After more than two weeks of tension and clashes between them, mediators from the subregion and from the Commonwealth have been trying to get the mutineers to hand over unauthorized weapons. Today, there was an exchange of weapons in Maseru. Journalist Mamelo Maurisini was there. On the line, Audrey Brown asked her how it went. [Begin recording] [Maurisini] At two o'clock our time, the traffic came to a standstill in Kings Way as armored vehicles traveled down Kings Way, with soldiers waving white flags, moving toward the headquarters barracks. [Brown] And what were these soldiers going to go and do there? [Maurisini] According to the information that the Commonwealth team had given us, the purpose of the soldiers going to the barracks was to go and hand in all heavy weaponry in order to get ready for talks with government, as soon as all heavy weaponry had been returned to the armories. [Brown] So these soldiers who were handing in the armory, were they the rebels? [Maurisini] There are no rebels, as far as the government and as far as Basotho are concerned. It was both sides of the army. The army at Makoanyane and the army at the headquarters. [Brown] So, they were giving in the weapons that they used to shoot each other with and to attack each other within the last couple of weeks? [Maurisini] Yes, that is what was happening. They were beginning their descent from the mountain at the same points where they had been keeping watch over the last two and half weeks. [Brown] So, these weapons that they were handing back, were they weapons that had been looted from the head office's arsenal? [Maurisini] The Commonwealth observer team assured us that all weapons had been signed out and that it would be easy for them to be returned, because they were going to be signed in, depending on the register of what had been taken out. [Brown] So, please, just clarify [words indistinct]. So, the army was actually giving weapons back to the army? [Maurisini] The army was returning the weapons to the armories, and we had been made to believe that two British captains attached to the Royal Lesotho Defense Force would monitor this handing in at the two barracks. [Brown] So, the weapons that they were giving back, these weapons, they say, were legitimately signed out and used to attack each other. Is that what had happened? And these weapons were now being given back? [Maurisini] The weapons had been legitimately taken out, the Commonwealth observer team says, but we have no proof that it was as they had said. But we have no reason to doubt that they had been legitimately signed out, as the two sides were getting ready for a final showdown. Now, it was all this extra armories that they were returning into the armories and they would be remaining with one firearm each, as is normal. [Brown] So, is everyone satisfied with the way the whole process went? [Maurisini] The people are satisfied because, as far as I could judge, there was ululation, there was cheering, and they were singing as the soldiers went down Kings Way in the company of members of the diplomatic corps and religious leaders. I would like to believe that everybody, including the Commonwealth team, are happy with the process this far. The major problem, of course, will be whether, after the army has been brought together by the Commonwealth team, the government will now be willing to talk. [end recording]
