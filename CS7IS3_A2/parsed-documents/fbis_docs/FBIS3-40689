There is a distinctly unreal air about it. It is more than the sight of the world's economic superpowers battling it out in Geneva, oblivious to the Luddite squeakings of Mr George Fernandes and his ilk. It is the manner in which domestic critics of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade seem blind to two glaring fallacies in their arguments. The first is the curious illusion India can afford to turn its nose up at GATT and thus world trade. The second is the insistent wail that the Dunkel draft is grossly slanted against India. Accepting GATT is to sell the country's soul, seeds and sovereignty for a few boatloads of fabric. This is a farcical misconception that looks only to India's concessions and none of its gains. GATT negotiations are about politics. As in all forms of international diplomacy there is a certain amount of give and take. If India is to judge whether GATT was a success it must ask how much it could have influenced events and then consider how much it accomplished. By this measure it can be said India, far from being sold a mickey, came out of it all reasonably well. The thing to understand is just how much India needs GATT. India needs to trade. The days of Nehruvian isolationism are over. It cannot withdraw into a protectionist shell, consoling itself with the thought Bangladesh is worse off. In very crude terms India needs to trade because it needs foreign exchange. It needs dollars and pounds to pay off its mammoth foreign debts and because it imports most of the petroleum that fuels its economy. Trade is also the best means to make an economy grow. As any number of boffins will tell you, nations like India that have been introverted about trade average three per cent growth. Economies that have looked outward double, sometimes triple, that rate. No better example exists than China. In its Maoist cocoon it seemed destined to be the biggest poorhouse in the world. As a Dengist butterfly it is slated to overtake the United States in 25 years. China is not a GATT member but that is not for want of trying. Beijing has incorporated most of Dunkel in its laws. Only a spat with the US keeps its membership pending. India has no alternative to trade. But trade can be like Darwinian evolution, red in tooth and claw. An export-import free for all is a boxing arena where bantamweights battle it out with heavyweights. Obviously the former--in global trade this means the third world--will be soundly bloodied. This is why GATT is important. For all its faults it is the closest thing to a set of Queensbury rules that world trade has. During the negotiations a developing nation that used wiliness to compensate for its lack of economic clout could save its skin and its markets. Outside GATT or in a world without Dunkel, India would have to fight multifront trade wars. Think of "Super 301," double its fangs and put it in the law book of every country in the world. Then talk of a neo-colonialist nightmare. The question is whether India was wily enough in GATT. Keep in mind India is a trade pygmy, smaller than Singapore. It has no weight to throw around. The only other way to win friends and influence people in Geneva is to be part of a like minded bloc of nations. Hence the plethora of GATT clubs from the upstart Cairns Group to the bewhiskered European Union. Try to think of an economic grouping that includes India on its roster. New Delhi boasts of two. One is the Group of Fifteen dinosaur. The other is the South Asia Preferential Trade Agreement where India's influence is augmented by Bhutan's. To put it in a cargohold, India went to Geneva in a wheelchair and dealt with titans. They should have walked all over India. But they did not. Consider how the country fared in some areas it had a special interest. The most controversial one, the source of many decibels from the Lok Sabha's leftist fringe, is patents. There is a completely specious claim GATT will mean every seen planted in India will mean paying the multinational. Only the selling of seeds on a commercial basis is restricted and even there India can fudge the laws. Incidentally the Indian Council of Agricultural Research expects to make a killing thanks to Dunkel by peddling its own hybrids around the world. India had virtually met Dunkel's requirements long before. Of GATT's seven intellectual property right areas, Indian law was in consonance with six. The one area of difference was patents--on seeds and drugs. In drugs India has secured the enormous loophole of being allowed to produce any medicine in the "public interest." And hang who holds the patent. India can say it was shortchanged over textiles. Textile exports are outside GATT, governed by a quota based Multifibre Agreement. Asian textile exporters have been clamouring for MFA to be scrapped and absorbed into GATT. The US and the EU [European Union], fearful their millions of textile workers will end up on the dole, have refused to accelerate MFA's 10 year phase out period. But again to renounce GATT is foolish. Under Dunkel the MFA's death is guaranteed. If India refuses to sign GATT its textiles will face pre-GATT tariffs of 50 per cent or more. Other textile exporters will bask in the three per cent tariff average GATT promises by AD 2000. India, and Asia in general, can also complain about the failure to tighten GATT's anti-dumping rules. The West has made an art of abusing such rules to tie up Asian exporters in lengthy litigation before GATT. Asia can gripe about the hefty two year safety margin the US and EU have awarded themselves against foreign financial institutions. Though given India's decrepit financial sector New Delhi is probably quite happy it can cite this precedent to give itself a buffer period. India has gained elsewhere. A gem of an opportunity lies in GATT's agricultural clauses. Much ado has been made of the requirement all nations must cut subsidies to farmers and how this will pauperise the Indian farmer. Here is the real story. One, India has to cut subsidies anyway if it hopes to reduce its deficit. Two, it is forgotten the most generous farm subsidies in the world are dished out by the West's governments. Partly because of these subsidies third world farmers have never been able to sell their produce to the West. Thanks to the Uruguay round the agricultural markets of Europe and North America have been pried open for Indian exports. Potentially this is a windfall of cyclonic proportions. It is why far seeing Indian farm leaders like Mr Sharad Joshi worship before the shrine of Dunkel. There is and will be much about India hoodwinked, mugged and left to multinational rape. The record says otherwise. It is definite GATT will knock some companies off their perches, put people out of their jobs. Every country will suffer. Japan and South Korea are glumly expecting millions of their farmers to be turfed out. But they look at the $250 billion it is conservatively estimated GATT will add to the world economy in its first year alone and figure it is worth it. Insulated India will suffer less social dislocation than them. Even the US and the EU did not have their way in everything. The mighty US, card carrying member of two trade blocs and world leader in all export sectors, bowed to demands for "compulsory licensing" of drugs in the public interest. India banded together with Brussels to pull this coup off. It is not necessarily true GATT was full of North browbeating South. When India asked for revisions in the clauses in September it was a group of 38 third world brethren who scuttled the effort. When Mr Pranab Mukherjee tells the Lok Sabha India has "no alternative" he is for once speaking like a boy scout. Without the Uruguay round the United Nations calculates the third world loses 20 per cent of its markets in seven years. Without Dunkel the rich nations would be unrestrainably greedy. They would simply kick the South into accepting the most disadvantageous terms possible. The GATT tribunals would not be able to serve as courts of appeal. This would be as nothing if the world signed GATT and India refused. This would be putting a noose around the neck of the nation. Indian tea and jewellery would face tariffs 10 times those of the Sri Lankan tea or Thai jewellery. After a few years the words "made in India" would fade from international memory. Do not denounce GATT. Instead be thankful the Uruguay round has at last been squared. Let Mr Manmohan Singh play the card of liberalisation well and in the next GATT round the world will await a trade agreement among China, Japan and India in the same manner it looked to Washington and Brussels this week.
