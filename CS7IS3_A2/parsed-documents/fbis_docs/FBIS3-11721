Because of this the adoption of new economic measures was put aside, except for those still pending from 1993, such as an increase in the price of gas for domestic use and in telephone rates. Nevertheless, other matters remain to be settled that involve the modernization of the state and privatization of its enterprises, the promulgation of new laws and regulations, and the announcement on the minimum salary of 66,000 sucres per month, that has not been changed since 1993. "If there is not another decrease in the price of petroleum, or a landslide, or washouts, or floods, if these things do not happen, I would guarantee Ecuadoran society, Ecuador in general, that we will have a very good year in 1994," said Galo Abril, planning secretary for the National council on Development (CONADE). Abril stated today in declarations to HOY that negotiations are under way with the IMF for "economic rehabilitation that will raise Ecuador's prestige in the eyes of international agencies, such as the commercial banks, among others." The Interview The following is the interview of the planning secretary by this newspaper: [Herrera] What are the prospects for this year? [Abril] The fall in the price of crude on the international market caused a budget deficit that was bridged by the latest increase in gasoline prices, so that the goal of inflation of about 20 percent calculated for this year is being attained; we believe that economic growth initially forecast at three percent will be about 2.5 percent due to a drop in public investment; and in the foreign sector we estimate that there will be good progress in the balance of payments and therefore maintenance, with a slight increase, of international monetary reserves. That is to say, the originally planned goals will be reached, economic growth will be less than 3 percent, but not dramatically so. [Herrera] Will the new prospects affect public investment? [Abril] In the process of compensating for the decline in the price of petroleum, the government has tried to preserve those investments in infrastructure that support production, such as highways, local roads, irrigation systems, drainage, and others, that are fundamental for farming in particular and for the agricultural sector to be able to bring their products to market. It will try to improve their production with the purpose of encouraging employment in two ways: directly, with employees engaged in infrastructural projects, and by greater production through support to private activity. These projects have great importance, in their turn, in all branches of the construction sector, in material supply activities as well as in lumber and metal manufacturing, among others. In housing, the 1994 program exceeds 20,000 units, which in itself means job creation. Therefore, if spending is used rationally to improve the infrastructure--although there may be a small reduction in growth--the original goals and social responsiveness through job creation, will be achieved in 1994. [Herrera] Why will the monetary reserves not grow? [Abril] Growth of the monetary reserves depends on economic growth, but we absolutely do not believe that reserves will be less than $1.2 billion at the end of 1994. [Herrera] Given these prospects, will Ecuador reinitiate payments to the creditor banks? [Abril] We do not know. It depends on the foreign debt negotiations. [Herrera] With the latest adjustments in gasoline prices, which seems to have been one of the IMF's demands, the way would be open. [Abril] I would like someone to certify for me what the IMF demands. I do not know why everyone has that on their mind: the IMF demands. We are negotiating economic rehabilitation that will raise the country's prestige in the eyes of international agencies, among others the banks, but these are things that we are planning. [Herrera] As a sovereign country? [Abril] Correct. I have not seen any IMF mission here that is demanding anything from the government's economic team. These are our proposals about the best way to reach economic stability in the country, including an agreement with private banks. It is a problem that should not puzzle anyone. The country must pay its debts, first, to all of the multilateral lending agencies, such as the World Bank, the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank], the Andean Development Corporation and European governments, which constitute the sources of support, in large part, for the nation's investment. In addition, we have a problem dating back years. It is one of not negotiating with private banks, and it is blocking an important flow of private investment capital and affecting the country's development, but nobody is imposing anything. [Herrera] If investment in the country has declined, is the British magazine THE ECONOMIST correct when it discusses this subject? [Abril] For investment to take place in a country, certain elements are required that are generally based on a stable economy, and from that point of view this government has managed to create a perception of stability that is attractive for foreign investment. Another factor is political stability, which means that the established rules of the game, whatever they may be, are maintained. But if what is happening in Ecuador is the case, that once a rule is established it is immediately changed by political or economic circumstances, then we lose credibility abroad, and this is very harmful to the country, but it is not necessarily the fault of the national government. A third element that attracts foreign investment is labor productivity, comparative advantage, and the country's resources, but if labor in Ecuador has low productivity because of poor education, poor training, and low adaptability, then it is not attractive for companies in which technology is intensive and changes rapidly. [Herrera] Is the lack of trained manpower the major problem? [Abril] It is not desirable to come to a country where manpower cannot be trained and retrained when required. It is the great national problem and we are working on it very hard: the general secretary for planning and the Ministry of Education are working constantly to deal with this problem, and there is already concrete progress: we have adapted to modern circumstances with a new program to train human resources. The situation will not change overnight. These are requirements that Ecuador fulfills in part, but sometimes it does not, and this is often due to political instability. [Herrera] Although there may be political factors, why is there no progress in the process of modernization of the state, and why has the new leadership for CONAM [National Modernization Council] not been named, following the resignations of its president and director? [Abril] The delay in passing the law obviously blocked progress in the process of state modernization, particularly the public sector and the turning over to the private sector of those areas it can manage efficiently. Once the law is passed--and it is not what was needed for a dynamic process of modernization because it still has important restrictions--we will go forward. Everything possible is being done, such as the sale of financial assets of the National Financial Corporation, the Ecuadoran Bank for Housing. Shares in the Selva Alegre cement company are about to be issued. The Ecuadoran Aviation case is almost completed. It is true that new leadership for CONAM has not been named to manage that institution, but there is a technical working group made up of officials from the Finance Ministry, CONADE and the Comptroller's Office that is moving ahead, preparing solid modernization programs. [Herrera] The sale of shares in the Financial Corporation and the Ecuadoran Aviation case occurred before passage of the modernization law. When will the government definitively start the process? [Abril] These matters are under constant study. While the law was under debate, all situations were studied in which privatization or conversion to a concession were feasible. Programs are already in progress in the hydrocarbons sector, such as pipeline construction; in the electric energy sector, turning over new generating capacity in small power plants to private enterprise, as well as aeolian power (electricity generated by the wind), among others. The state has not stood still. If one is unable to see a transfer to the private sector, it is because the definitive legal framework has not been created, but greater dynamism will be evident this year. [Herrera] Will the government propose new laws and reforms? [Abril] Certainly. We have several, such as the law on electric energy, the law on concessions, on telecommunications, on government contracts, reforms of the monetary system law, and agrarian reform. There are a great number of changes in the laws that are already prepared and they are being discussed with various social sectors to seek consensus. [Box, p 5A] On Investments and Salaries The central government's investments for 1994 declined to 110 billion sucres, following the dramatic fall in the price of petroleum on the world market to $10 per barrel. Nevertheless, Galo Abril, planning secretary for CONADE, said that many of the projects in the investment program would not necessarily be halted, because they will be carried out with other sources of financing, such as the State Bank. A reduction in investment will be in effect for some of the large companies, such as EMETEL [State-Owned Telecommunications Company], PETROECUADOR [Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise], INECEL [Ecuadoran Institute for Electrification], among other autonomous agencies. "The reductions are not such as to change the government's goals in the composition of current spending. Public investment remains in proportion to national income, about 8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); in 1993 it was 7 percent," said Abril, reiterating that this was no reason to expect an economic debacle. [Herrera] Will the price of gas increase? [Abril] This is a matter of restructuring budgetary income and spending, the general subsidies that benefit everyone, to focus subsidies directly on the poor, and with the money saved carry out social and public works. We are working on that. [Herrera] Is this the only measure still to be taken? [Abril] Yes, it is within the budget deficit under study. If the deficit cannot be covered with an increase in the value added tax, another source will have to be found. Therefore, with the adjustable duty on the price of gasoline, if the price of crude rises on the international market, tax revenues will improve and fuel prices will go down. [Herrera] And what do you have to say about salaries? [Abril] Salaries will be reviewed in July, as the law provides. [Herrera] Would these be salaries only, or the minimum wage? [Abril] We do not know. At the moment, there will be a review. It depends on how different cost components evolve and other factors, whether to choose one of the two, or to adjust both.
