The document, known as Sakhalin-2, was signed by Yuriy Shafrannik, the Russian minister of fuel and power engineering, (D. Daffind), president of the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, and representatives of the American and Japanese firms which formed a consortium to implement this major project which promises significant economic benefit to the Russian Far East. "The Sakhalin-2 project can truly be called crucial if one assesses it from the point of view of its underlying principles," Yu. Shafrannik said in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "For the first time, work on a Russian shelf will be carried out by a consortium of Western firms. The project is very advantageous for Russia. Almost 70 percent of subcontracting work will go to Russian firms and also 25 percent of profits. This is a very serious project. If, after such a first step we are able to take another -- and of this I am certain -- then there will be capital investment in this region in the course of the next year and one can expect serious changes in the region of the Far East within the next few years." In particular, the minister said, some of the gas extracted on the Sakhalin shelf could be sent to the mainland. "This project is really crucial," Ronald Brown, U.S. Secretary of State for Trade, said in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "I hope that its implementation will stimulate development of trade between our countries and open up opportunities for capital investment. This project is indeed important and, what is most important, it has gotten off to a good start."
