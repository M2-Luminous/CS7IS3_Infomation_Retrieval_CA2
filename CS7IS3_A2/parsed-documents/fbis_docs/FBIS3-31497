MPs supported the government and agreed that Hungary should not be affected in any military action, even indirectly. "The demonstrative absence mainly serves to reassure Belgrade, indicating that Hungary wants to avoid even the semblance of participating in military action," Kovacs said. He recalled that no parliamentary approval is necessary to let AWACS patrol in Hungarian airspace, or to ban them: The government decides on this alone. But parliamentary authorisation would be needed for NATO to ask that these aircraft take part in military actions. Kovacs said no such request has arrived from NATO. He admitted there was a dilemma in Hungary holding back from the conflict yet at the same time protecting relations with NATO.
