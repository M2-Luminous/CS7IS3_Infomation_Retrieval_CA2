Consequently, Korea will have a second meeting in Geneva today to get the schedule endorsed. To narrow differences in positions, Korea yesterday had a series of informal bilateral meetings with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the countries which vented particular displeasure with the schedule. A ministry official said Korea may have to revise its agricultural country schedule in such a direction as to expand the opening of its agricultural market if it fails to win concessions from the U.S. and other major farm exporting countries. In Thursday's meeting, the U.S. accused Korea of having presented a country schedule that doesn't correspond to the final draft presented on Dec. 15 last year when even-year Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks was concluded. The most thorny issue in Thursday's meeting was Seoul's plan to levy mark-ups, a term referring to levies which are equivalent to the difference between import and sales prices, on a number of imported agricultural products. Korea seeks to levy mark-ups on 118 agricultural products in the form of state-administered trade, saying the broadbased application of mark-ups is needed to protect its farm industry. On the contrary, the U.S. and other major farm exporting countries took issue with the mark-up scheme, noting that Korea listed only 10-odd items in its final draft presented last December. They also accused Korea of trying to levy what they claim are excessive amounts of mark-ups to have its farm industry nestled under the umbrella of government protection. Washington was also unhappy with Seoul's plan to keep tariff rates on agricultural imports at high levels, ministry officials said. In its country schedule, Korea offered to trim tariffs on agricultural imports by an average 24 percent over 10 years from 1995, insisting that it be regarded as a developing country. But the U.S. expressed dissatisfaction with Seoul's tariff reduction plan which it said was too conservative given its current economic status. Washington also clarified its objection to Seoul's plan to slap tariffs on 97 agricultural imports on the basis of amounts. Korea came under criticism for trying to curb farm imports by introducing a new tariff system, ministry officials said. In Thursday's meeting, however, the U.S. didn't raise an objection to how much rice Korea will have to import next year and what years it proposes to base market access quota and subsidy cuts on, the officials said. Complaining about Korea's plan to import 51,000 tons of rice next year, 1 percent of domestic consumption, the U.S. has been urging the quota be increased to 56,000 tons, saying the quota is limited to consumed volume and leaves out rice for seed and processing. On the contrary, Seoul argues that the quota be fixed at 51,000 tons, saying seed volume is just statistics and not part of the actual harvest and that the volume for processing is not categorized separately. As Korea failed to get its agricultural country schedule endorsed Thursday, farm economists say it may have no other alternative but to revise the schedule. An official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Korea is waging an uphill battle, hinting at a revision of its country schedule. So far, of 118 member countries, some 80 have their final farm schedules endorsed at the GATT. Korea is one of the few countries whose schedule failed to pass the screening process. According to GATT regulations, the screening process is due to be completed by March 21.
