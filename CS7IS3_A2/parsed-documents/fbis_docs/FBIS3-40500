A multi-block method was applied to the calculation grids. Complex configurations of bleed holes and throat slot were simulated in order to compare the solution with experimental (test) data. As a result, detailed information on the flow -- which is usually difficult to obtain experimentally -- was obtained. At this inlet under the supersonic flow-through conditions, the flow was found to be two-dimensional in 90% of the spanwise direction. In the vicinity of the side-walls, however, three-dimensional separation occurred along the cowl shock. The separation induced a vortex, and the vortex was stretched and swallowed into the throat slot. The ramp bleed ahead of the cowl-shock-impinge line was found to plan an important role in preventing the separation region from spreading. A static-wall-pressure comparison between the results and the experimental (test) data showed reasonable agreement. 1. Introduction In recent years, assiduous research efforts have been going on in Japan as elsewhere on supersonic air inlets for applications in such vehicles as the next generation of supersonic airliners and space planes.[.sup]1[/] Research to date has been focused on elucidating the operating characteristics, bleed characteristics, and bleeding role in supersonic mixed-compression air inlets using experimental techniques[.sup]2[/] and two-dimensional mathematical analysis.[.sup]3[/] The experimental techniques do provide much useful information, but there are limits as to model size, blower time, and blow frequency, making it very difficult at present to obtain detailed knowledge of complex internal flows. The purpose of our research is to elucidate flow sites inside supersonic air inlets -- which are difficult to gain accurate knowledge of experimentally -- by means of three-dimensional mathematical analysis, and then use this information in subsequent research. 2. Calculation Grids For the calculation grids we used multi-block mapping. With the multi-block method, grids can be generated relatively easily for even the most complex shapes, and the analysis codes which use this require no special handling for each object shape. In Figure 1 is shown the relationship between objects in the grid space defined regularly by I, J, and K, and objects in actual physical space (x, y, z). In Figure 2 are shown the calculation grids used. The number of grid points in the x, y, and z dimensions are 103 x 80 x 90 (but the y dimension is calculated with the half width of 40 points). For the bleed holes in the ramp, a square, porous wall was simulated, and the throat bleed holes are made slotted. The grid point coordinates are defined by all of the air flow paths (including the inside of each bleed hole). Inside the main duct, a fine grid is employed so that boundary layers along the wall can be ascertained precisely. This air inlet has a height:width proportion of 2:3, with the outlet shape not choked off in a circular shape but made a square shape (and the same flow path shape as was used in experiments described subsequently). Figure 2. Calculation grids 3. Analysis Code The basic equations used are the Reynolds mean Navier-Stokes integration equations. Coakly's q-_o_ model is used for the turbulence model.[.sup]4[/] Separation is determined by the limited volume method and cell boundary numerical flux by Roe's approximating Rieman analysis, to which TVD conditions are applied.[.sup]5[/] For this calculation, the ADI method is used for the y-z plane and the Gauss-Seidel method for the x dimension. The equations are spatially solved, with the first-order-precision negative solution method used for the time integration. 4. Analysis Conditions We made the Mach number 2.5, the Reynolds number 10[.sup]7[/] based on the standard of inlet height of the item being tested, with _a_ = _b_ = 0ï¿½. In this analysis, we made the area of the exhaust louver-type exhaust port constant without particularly regulating the bleed volume. In these tests, moreover, since the objective was to ascertain the interference in the supersonic section between the sidewall boundary layer(s) and the diagonal shock wave(s), we did not generate a terminal shock wave, but employed conditions such that outflow was still at supersonic speeds at the main duct outlet. 5. Analysis Results In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is represented an equal Mach contour diagram on the center surface. The two ramp shock waves and cowl shock waves, and the entropy compression continuing therefrom, were attained as designed, and the results obtained were almost the same as those from the two-dimensional analysis.[.sup]3[/] The throat shock wave is a diagonal shock wave that is generated when the bleed causes the flow to strike the back of the slot. Since we have set low back-pressure conditions, the flow is accelerated behind this and flows out at supersonic speed. In Figure 4 [not reproduced] is shown an equal Mach contour diagram at the 95% span position. In this way, in the vicinity of the sidewall, we find separation in the vicinity of cowl shock wave injection point. The third-column ramp bleed hole(s) prevent this separation region from spreading, indicating the importance of bleeding at this position. As a result of varying the cross-section delineated by the equal Mach contour diagram in the span direction, we found that two-dimensionality is maintained to approximately the 90% span position. In Figure 5 [not reproduced] we have an equal Mach contour diagram at the x = constant cross-section as seen from different perspectives, (a) and (b). (The wall surface on the near side is not represented.) The separation region in the vicinity of the cowl shock wave injection point is sucked into the aft throat bleed hole(s), and we can observe a thick boundary layer region in the sidewall cowl region(s) also. In Figure 6 [not reproduced] we see flow trails from particles emitted from three places very close to the sidewall as seen from (a) the side, (b) diagonally from the front, and (c) directly from the front. Looking downstream, the three-dimensional separation region at the left sidewall becomes a vortex which rotates clockwise along the cowl shock wave and is eventually sucked into the throat bleed place. The flow which passes through the cowl shock wave is subjected to a sudden reverse-pressure gradient. The inner layer region of the sidewall boundary layer has lower kinetic energy than the outer layer, so the flow turns toward the ramp side (up). That is why a clockwise vortex is generated. When we view the movement of this vortex in moving pictures, we find that the speed of rotation increases the closer the vortex approaches to the throat bleed hole(s), with the occurrence of vortex stretching. In Figure 7 we compare the wall static pressures.[.sup]2,6[/] At (a) is shown a static pressure distribution in the flow direction, with comparisons made between the values on the center surface in this analysis (solid curve), the two-dimensional NS analysis values (dotted curve), and the test values (symbols).[.sup]3,7[/] In the external compression region (x < 1.7), the two-dimensional and three-dimensional values agree perfectly, but a slight difference develops in the internal compression region (x > 1.7). We think this is due to the influence of the sidewall. Nevertheless, there is relatively good agreement between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional analysis and test values. At (b) in Figure 7 we have diagrammed the static pressure distributions in the span direction at the positions indicated in (a) (i.e. Sec. 1, Sec. 2). The agreement with the test values is good. Figure 7. Wall Static Pressure Distributions (Compared 6. Concluding Remarks The following facts were established as a result of conducting the three-dimensional analysis on the supersonic air inlet. (1) With this air inlet, under conditions of supersonic outflow, the two-dimensionality of the flow is maintained to approximately 90% in the span direction. (2) In the vicinity of the sidewalls, three-dimensional separation occurs along the cowl shock wave, and the third-column ramp bleed helps prevent this region from spreading. (3) With respect to the static pressure distribution at the wall in the center plane under conditions of supersonic outflow, there is almost no difference with the [results of] two-dimensional analysis, and there is good agreement with the test values. There is also good agreement between the spanwise static pressure distribution and the test values. With these findings in hand, we plan to conduct three-dimensional analyses in cases where the flow is decelerated to subsonic speeds by the terminal shock wave.
