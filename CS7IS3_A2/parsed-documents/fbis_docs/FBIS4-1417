The purpose of this press conference is to actually take you through a few additional updates that have come through to us, and also to give you a chance to answer any questions that you might have. One of the questions that we were asked earlier today was with regard to -- just an overview with regard to special voting. At the close of special voting yesterday, this is the overall situation as we recorded it. Only 16 percent of the 3,409 of the voting stations deployed during special voting day experienced difficulties, of which 10 percent were major difficulties, and 6 percent minor. In 77 percent of the voting stations of special voting day, the progress was good, and in fact there was a routine general performance. We have some updated figures with regard to the overseas voting which I will take you through briefly: Argentina, 93; Austria, 405; Brazil, 89; Bulgaria, 48; Chile, 86; China, 444; the Czech Republic, 147; Denmark, 126; Finland, 45; France, 803; Gabon, 12; Germany, 1,637; Greece, 50; India, 69; Italy, 774; Japan, 101; Jordan, 8; Korea, 28; Luxembourg, 60; Madagascar, 17; Malaysia, 108; Maldives, 149; Mozambique, 959; Namibia, 8,474; Pakistan, 110; Paraguay, 38; Russia, 75; Senegal, 8; Singapore, 365; Slovakia, 17; Swaziland, 3,446; Sweden, 115; Switzerland, 1,089; Thailand, 215; Turkey, 108; United Kingdom, 7,464; USA, 1,251; Uruguay, 11; and Zambia, 708. This morning and throughout the day we have been giving you updates with regards to reported problems. What we want to report now is that a substantial number of these problems have been addressed and are at hand, and we also want to report that in fact we have received 10,807 reports from voting stations around the country during the course of the day which indicate there were no hitches with the voting process. There's one specific issue that has come up which we should report to you. In the Western Cape, in response to allegations by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of partiality by IEC officials in the Western Cape, the provincial electoral officer of the Western Cape, Mary Burton, has written to the PAC's candidate for the provincial premiership, Mrs. Patricia de Lille, giving the following assurances: Firstly, presiding officers will be reminded of the need not to favor any one party over another. Secondly, the regulations dealing with the role and attendance of party agents will be strictly adhered to. Thirdly, the perimeters of polling stations will be clearly demarcated and the behavior of IEC officials strictly monitored, and finally, problems experienced with ballot boxes, rods and seals will be dealt with as a matter of greatest urgency. Additional monitors and observers will be dispatched on Thursday to voting stations identified by Mrs. de Lille as problematic. Two commissioners, Mrs. Don Mokhobo and Dr. (Teckley) will accompany Mrs. de Lille to a voting station of her choice to observe that the measures are being adhered to. We also have a minor statement that has come in with regard to the situation in Alberton. Some of you have been asking questions with regard to that. Ballot papers arrived there four hours ago and are being distributed to polling stations and polling was expected to have started at 4 o'clock There is further information regarding the supply of election materials to the East Rand stations. Delamika High School and Backen Park Community Center have now received adequate supplies of election equipment and are fully operative. Two other stations in Katlehong have also opened, we are awaiting names of the exact polling stations, and we will update you with these details later. The SADF are presently collecting supplies from Springs to take to Katlehong. I must point out that this report was -- that was the status at 6 o'clock. I think we just want to return to one issue before I open the floor for discussion, for questions, and that is the issue of the IFP stickers, and I think just for clarity, we have been requested to read out what directive exactly went out to the presiding officers with regard to this matter. And if I can just read it out to you, this is the directive that went out from the IEC headquarters to presiding officers in the field. It read as follows: Voters wishing to cast their votes for the IFP where no stickers were provided for the ballot papers have been marking their preference in writing on the ballots. The IEC will deal with such ballots in due course in terms of Section 47 of the Electoral Act dealing with voting irregularities. This section empowers the commission to make such determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting of irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the circumstances. The commission has decided that it will print additional ballot papers locally as they are required. This process has already begun. The two provinces already being addressed are the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Orange Free State. That's what went out to our presiding officers in the field. And the status report on this is that the printing is advanced and deployment about to begin with the SADF [South African Defense Force] providing assistance in this matter. Our assessment at this stage is that the difficulties that were encountered today are in hand and with our people on the ground working through the night, we would be able to have a smooth running operation first thing tomorrow morning, and just to note that, in many cases several voting stations will be opened beyond the 7 o'clock period. OK the floor is now open for questions. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Naidoo what is the IEC doing about the IFP's threat of withdrawing from the election, especially from Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi? How is this thing addressed, and what's your reaction to it? [Naidoo] The judge and -- Judge Kriegler and the other commissioners are presently in dialogue with the representatives of political parties. I think what is very important to place on record is that the concerns that have been raised by the IFP and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi are similar concerns that have been raised by the other political parties as well, and these are concerns that the IEC also shares in part, and we are hoping that in the discussions that will happen tonight we would be able to provide greater clarity on the situation, but that will have to be forthcoming from the commission itself, and we hope to be able to release that shortly. [Correspondent] [question indistinct] [Naidoo] OK. On the first question with regard to the number of problems or concerns that were raised during the course of the day, there have been close to 2,000. Most of these were regular concerns, like for example, if a monitor did not arrive on time that would have been recorded as a problem, as one incident. If there were communication problems between a monitor at a voting station and the sub-provincial operations center, that would also have been recorded as an incident, furthermore, if there were equipment problems. All these together with more substantive issues such as the problem of materials, which has been one of the major problems spoken about today. I think what is important to note is that of those 2,000 plus incident reports, most of them have actually been addressed at this stage. With regard to the Inkatha Freedom Party sticker at the bottom of the ballot, I think it is quite important that we do not read it the way you have read it, and that is that the scale of the problem is enormous. I think what -- the initiative taken by Judge Kriegler and the commission is to put in place an enabling way of dealing with this potential problem, and a way in which we can address the problem, particularly at the counting stage. It is quite important that we reiterate that this statement does not suggest that for example, the ballots that are now being presently printed do not have IFP on it. It does have IFP at the bottom being printed, and secondly it does not suggest that attempts to get the IFP stickers to voting stations that at this stage do not have them are not in process as well. [Correspondent] [question indistinct] [Naidoo] Yes. [Correspondent] My information is that originally there were 88 million ballot papers printed. Now, another 9.3 million have been printed. Does this -- Judge Kriegler explained that there were some extra ones at some stations that could not be moved to other stations -- but, does this mean that 66 million ballot papers are stacked up somewhere not being used, or have some of these new ballot papers been printed to avoid the problem of the Inkatha sticker, because Inkatha will be on the ballot papers? Is that perhaps the thinking behind it? [Naidoo] OK. I think you are right. That has been a factor that's taken into consideration, that obviously by printing the IFP sticker on the ballot it prevents us having to deal with trying to get the IFP stickers to the voting stations, but I think the other issue has been to ensure that at this time we rather have sufficient and excess ballots rather than less. [Correspondent Lulama] Two questions, Mr. Naidoo. The first one is, you just rattled through those numbers of the special votes. Can we just get a total figure? And then the second question is, you said yesterday in one of the briefings that the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region was not necessarily a priority area, and I mean, in Natal for instance couldn't it have been foreseen? I mean, couldn't Natal and the PWV region have been made priority areas, especially with regard to the dispatching of ballot papers that had stickers? [Naidoo] OK. I'll take your second question first, and I am very glad that you asked it, because I think that I was quoted out of context. Let me first reiterate what I said yesterday. What we said yesterday was that most of the problems with regard to deployment of materials were being experienced in the PWV. In the deployment plan of the IEC with regard to these material, we started deploying the materials from outside inwards, meaning that inward being the PWV because all the materials were in fact procured in the PWV region itself. So I think by no ways was anyone suggesting that the PWV wasn't given priority. I think just in terms of the deployment plan, it made sense to us to start with those outlying areas like the Northern Cape and move inwards, and unfortunately they weren't able to reach all the PWV locations and some of the other areas in time. With regard to the figures, we will make it available to the press at the media desk later this evening. [Lulama] OK, my other question, a part of it was, couldn't there have been -- couldn't Natal have been the one area in which all the ballot papers with stickers on -- couldn't that have been the first area in which ballot papers could have been dispatched? [Naidoo] OK. I think I need to clarify you on one area, and that is, you are suggesting that all the ballot papers with the IFP stickers should have been deployed in KwaZulu-Natal first. Is that what you are suggesting? OK, I think what needs to be clarified is that the way in which the IFP stickers were to be put on was as follows: Given the lateness of the entry of the Inkatha Freedom Party into the election, and the printing of the stickers itself, unfortunately we did not have the time to affix those stickers on the ballot papers prior to the ballot papers themselves leaving for the voting stations. So in the end we couldn't do it centrally, and what we needed to do was to appoint a voting officer in each voting station who was responsible for the specialised tasks of affixing this sticker on. So there were no ballot papers that left centrally with the IFP sticker on. All the affixng of the IFP stickers took place at voting station level. I am glad that you asked the question because I think that matter needed clarification. Sorry, there's the gentleman behind Lulama? [Correspondent] Thank you. I was wondering whether you can explain to us why it hadn't been possible to have a contingency plan for the kind of situation that you encountered on the East Rand today? I mean, it's not a long drive to IEC headquarters. Why was it not possible for people to get into cars and go over there and get the equipment and go back and have the polling stations open within an hour? [Naidoo] I think that the assessment of how the deployment is going -- the problems actually surfaced fairly late. We had anticipated that things would flow much more smoothly than they did, and that the supplies at the central deployment office, which is not in central Johannesburg, had been deployed out to the regions and to PWV sub-provincial regions, and we had anticipated that in fact there was sufficient supplies at PWV sub-provincial level, and hence the difficulty has been that the provision as -- particularly with the ballot papers -- just wasn't there and hence we have to produce more ballot papers. And I think in the main today the problem has been with ballot papers themselves in the PWV. [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] I think we can all say that we don't want the IEC to fail, but I sense that there is an enormous amount of frustration both as reflected in media reports and public calls to radio, that people don't understand what is happening and they feel they are not getting direct responses from the IEC. I think this latest thing on the IFP stickers, the quoting of Section 47, is enormously fuzzy for anyone out there to understand, plus, it doesn't address the very obvious issue of illiteracy and the inability of people to write the IFP as a party onto the ballot paper. And I think the overwhelming sense of people who have been frustrated today is that their frustrations are not being answered and have not been not addressed, and no one is saying yes, this is the scale of the problem. For example, what is the scale of the IFP sticker problem? How many stations were affected, how many ballots were affected? I do feel that we are not getting the answers and perhaps we want to know why? [Naidoo] I think it has been difficult to track the scale of the problem. It certaintly is not the intention of the IEC to deliberately withhold information from either the voters or the media. It has been a difficult situation in those areas that you've actually mentioned, and we have been attempting to assess the situation. In some cases I think its just been very difficult to get information on time and to process it sufficiently so that we can provide verified information to the press. I think the important point, generally, that we would like to make is that in fact yesterday, from the moment the special voting started, there were several rumors that almost became fact, in terms of the number of polling stations that had been occupied. Many of you would have heard of the Settlers Way example that was running for about two hours, so much so that we were confused as to whether it really was happening or not. This morning I can point to several members in the audience who came up to me and said: have you heard of this bomb blast in Rosebank and etc., etc. And I think generally our apparoach in terms of responding to the various problems has been one of caution, and one in which we are seeking to get absolute verification before we commit ourselves to a position. I think it wuld be undesirable for us to say that we are sure that there are X- number of IFP sticker problems when we are at this stage not able to verify it. So I think at the moment we do, we certainly would. I think it's also important that we make the point that we are certainly as concerned about the problems as the political parties and the community at large. Yes. We also want to place on record our appreciation for the fact that millions of voters actually conduct themselves with absolute patience, with understanding, and even though there have been frustrations, I think it's been remarkable, the level of patience and understanding that has been exhibited by the voters. [Naidoo] The other point that we also want to make is that -- I don't want to, maybe for those of you who weren't at the earlier press conference I should just give you a statistic on a provincial by provincial basis in terms of the extent of the success, in terms of the operation of the voting stations in the different provinces. I can take you through that very quickly, because I think some of you missed that at the last press conference. In the Western Cape we are recording a 94 percent fully normal operational voting station situation, in the Eastern Cape 80 percent, in the Northern Cape 100 percent, in KwaZulu-Natal 75 percent, in Orange Free State 87 percent, in Eastern Transvaal 80 percent, in Northern Transvaal 75 percent, in the North West 95 percent, and in the PWV 70 percent. These figures were calculated at 5.30 PM this afternoon. Some of them, most of them have actually increased. The one, the two areas where there has been a decrease has been in the OFS [Orange Free State] and the Eastern Transvaal. [program switches back to studio] [Announcer Penny Smythe] We have to leave the press conference at Gallagher Estate there. This concludes the English broadcast on Channel 1 for Election 94.
