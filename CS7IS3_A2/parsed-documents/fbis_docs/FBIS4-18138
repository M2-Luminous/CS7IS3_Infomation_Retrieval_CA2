One could doubt it in view of the latest government inconsistency. A minor inconsistency, but one which says much about the absence of a long-term vision. Lucette Michaux-Chevry, minister delegate responsible for humanitarian action and human rights, had decided to send a ship carrying 530 tonnes of food to Haiti to relieve the suffering of the population, in particular children. On Friday, 25 March, the military succeeded in preventing the ship from berthing, and threated to attack members of the local French community with the clear design of forcing Paris to retreat. It would be annoying and embarrassing if the handful of drug traffickers, military people, and corrupt policemen who exercise power in Haiti were to achieve such an easy success. Last October, a few vociferous neo-Duvalierian "demonstrators" were enough to dissuade Washington from disembarking 200 U.S. and Canadian blue helmets tasked with guaranteeing the return to democracy and that of the country's legal president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a coup two years earlier. The same scenario is being repeated. The "neo-Duvalierians" nonetheless have certain reasons to denounce the "cynicism" of France, which is trying to ease its conscience with humanitarian aid while demanding, ever since the American about-face, a total international embargo on Haiti -- right now only arms and oil are targeted. In the name of humanitarianism, Paris has demonstrated a democratic intransigence toward Haiti which it has scarcely exhibited toward General Gnassingbe Eyadema's Togo or Omar Bongo's Gabon. The first president in his country's history to have been elected by universal suffrage, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose life was saved during General Cedras' coup thanks mainly to the French ambassador's intervention, has received unfailing support from Paris, which has readily minimized the errors or mistakes of a personality who, while very popular in the shantytowns of Port-au-Prince, lacks the stature of a statesman. Paris has frequently found itself at odds with Washington over Haiti. France, whose strategic and economic interests in Haiti are not as great as those of the United States, is neither willing nor able to send a contingent of soldiers to the country to reestablish a semblance of democracy in Port-au-Prince.
