[Peres] We are dealing here with a number of doors which have to be opened. Some already have been opened, and Palestinians will enter through them. I believe the formal transfer will occur within two to three weeks. [Ya'ari] How do you assess the impact of this agreement on Israel's efforts to negotiate with Syria? Will it spur al-Asad on? Will it alienate him and convince him to wait? [Peres] I will tell you something far-reaching: Without an agreement with the Palestinians, we would be unable to reach an agreement with al-Asad, because without that agreement, al-Asad would view himself as the sponsor of the Palestinian issue. The fact that the Palestinians are engaged in a process separately from the Syrians permits us to negotiate and reach an accord with each of them. [Ya'ari] With your permission, I would like to address the most recent discussion you had last night with Yasir 'Arafat and the cosponsors. Can you tell us what happened with the remaining unresolved clauses of the agreement? [Peres] As always happens in negotiations, they were concluded with a compromise, which is made up of firm pledges on the one hand and promises and expectations for the future on the other. All in all, I think the compromise is adequate from Israel's viewpoint, and from the Palestinian viewpoint as well. We must not forget that this is a unique process: The negotiations are not over; a process has been launched, and it will continue. For instance, we never said the size of Jericho was final, as the negotiations on the size of Jericho will have to be resumed within a few months. Therefore, points on which agreement was achieved should be viewed in a time dimension, and not only a territorial dimension. I think this makes compromise easier for both sides. In any event, it was vital to conclude the agreement. [passage omitted]
