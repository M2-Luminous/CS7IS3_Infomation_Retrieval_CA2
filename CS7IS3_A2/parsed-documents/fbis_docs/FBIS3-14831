As is noted in the president's message, laws establishing clear rules pertaining to the functioning of state organs and, above all, the organs of executive power should be drafted and adopted in the very near future. They should provide effective mechanisms of control and accountability which make it possible to adopt legal acts which can actually be carried out, that is to say, do not allow arbitrary interpretation, and which are economically sound and include specific sanctions for their nonfulfillment. These include laws on the government, on the federal executive bodies, on normative legal acts, on the federal state service, on the bases of the organization of government and executive bodies in the components of the Russian Federation, and on the status of deputies of the State Duma and members of the Federation Council. The Russian Federation president's Message "On Strengthening the Russian State" raises the most topical problems. This was stated by Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy of the State Duma and minister of the economy. The president's message as applied to the economy "should be used to establish the normal mechanisms of market relations," he stressed. He emphasized that first and foremost "the state should learn how to collect all the taxes which now exist and establish strict currency, financial, and banking control." The Russian Federation president's message to parliament contains answers to the questions which are being thrown up today by the time and the actual situation, according to Vasiliy Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for the Affairs of the Federation and the Policy of the Regions. He suggested that "deputies and voters received in the Message what they expected to hear." The main point is that Boris Yeltsin's program "is based on the firm conviction that the democratic state's new Constitution should work." Each of his arguments is backed up by specific articles of the Constitution, Vasiliy Tarasenko explained.
