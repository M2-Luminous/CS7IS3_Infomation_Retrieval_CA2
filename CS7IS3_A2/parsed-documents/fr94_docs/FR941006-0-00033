Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1365, Public Law 103&hyph;317. §82.1 Purpose. The purpose of this part is to set out regulations and procedures governing the distribution of funds appropriated by Congress pursuant to the standards of Public Law 103&hyph;317 and to section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), (8 U.S.C. 1365), to provide assistance to the States for the cost of incarceration of illegal criminal aliens. §82.2 Reimbursement of States. Under section 501 of IRCA, the Attorney General shall reimburse any State which applies for a grant for the costs incurred by the State for the incarceration of any illegal criminal alien who is convicted of a felony by such State, to the extent an appropriation is made for such a purpose for any fiscal year. This program will be administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). §82.3 Definitions. (a) Illegal criminal alien means an alien who has been convicted of a felony and is in the custody of a State; and who: (1) Entered into the United States without inspection or at any time or any place other than as designated by the Attorney General; or (2) Was admitted as a nonimmigrant and before the date of the commission of the crime had failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 248 of Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1258), or to comply with the conditions of any such status; or (3) Is a Mariel Cuban as defined in Section 501 of IRCA. (b) State means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. (c) Compensation means the pro-rata average cost of incarcerating the alien in the relevant State as documented by the State. (d) Cost means routine operating expenses, as generally defined and used by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) for reporting purposes. See, e.g., ``Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 1990.'' Capital expenses, expenses reimbursed by other Federal funds, and other non-routine costs should be eliminated from the baseline for per bed estimates. (e) Custody means any State correctional facility for the confinement or rehabilitation of individuals convicted of criminal offenses within the State. (f) Reimbursement period means the federal fiscal year, October 1 through September 30, for which an appropriation is made. §82.4 Allocation and use of funds. (a) The program will reimburse the States for partial expenses incurred by them for criminal aliens incarcerated in facilities within the State during the reimbursement period. The State shall designate an administrative agency to administer the program. A budget or expenditure plan is not required, as the award will be used solely for reimbursement purposes. Matching funds are not required.
