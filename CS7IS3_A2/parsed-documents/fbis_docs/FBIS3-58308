This question is the only point on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels which was not thought up by the United States. The main feature of the allies' summit is a new U.S. plan for Europe: Partnership for Peace [last three words in English], together with the Combined Joint Task Forces [last four words in English]. In addition the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons will be discussed. At NATO people are not being hard with Europe. "Of course the European Union and its own security and defense policies will be applauded in the final communique. A small sentence or so," a NATO official says. European security remains primarily a NATO matter. In this field the European Union and its "military arm," the Western European Union (WEU), can do a bit of work on the side. The United States -- them again! -- have even thought up a term to express this: separable, but not separate [four last words in English]. Which means that of course Europe can undertake the odd peace operation without the Americans, but not without their permission. At present Manfred Woerner, NATO secretary-general, is maintaining excellent contacts with Wim van Eekelen, the secretary-general of the WEU. Woerner values the cooperation, but he never neglects any opportunity to emphasize that without NATO, Europe can kiss goodbye to its security. "NATO is irreplaceable," Woerner says. "It must be clear that the alliance is the central body where the decisions on the security of the NATO member states are taken." Van Eekelen is certainly not in a position to say something along the same lines. The WEU, the alliance's European pillar, is still in its infancy. Nothing has changed since the Cold War. Now, as in the past, the United States continues to set the tone in Europe when European security is involved -- in the past with glittering brochures about the dangers of Soviet Military Power [last three words in English], nowadays with ideas calling for not entering into conflict with the Russians, please. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as members of NATO? Rather not. The Russians are against that. As the West acknowledges in reality, they have a veto on this question, although some hesitations can be heard in NATO circles since the electoral triumph of the Russian right-wing radical Vladimir Zhirinovsky. At the NATO summit at the start of next week, to be chaired by President Clinton, Europe will not shine with ideas emphasizing the alliance's European pillar. "NATO is and remains the foundation of our security. It is the only alliance with functioning command and military structures. It is the guarantee of peace and stability in Europe," Volker Ruehe, the German defense minister, writes in the latest issue of NATO REVIEW. He says that the Americans have the key role in Europe's future. In the U.S. plan for Europe, the `European defense identity' is best expressed in the Combined Joint Task Forces. France is also showing a great interest in this plan. At stake is the new task which NATO set itself in Rome in 1991: a peace task, including activities outside the alliance's treaty area. On 14 December 1993 Manfred Woerner used it to tempt the French back into NATO's consultative structure, which is something very different from the integrated, U.S.-controlled command structure which France left in 1964. These joint military actions, Woerner explained, could best be carried out under the WEU's banner. "This concept," Woerner said, "greatly facilitates France's participation in military actions carried out by the alliance." And, according to Woerner, the `joint action' is the proof that the United States accepts a European defense identity. His words did not fall on deaf ears -- in Paris. The wishes of the WEU are not to be discussed at the NATO summit. Ideas on the WEU's role are developed in the European Union, rather than in NATO's Brussels headquarters. Internally the WEU is busy developing European security policies, but it is unclear how they will fit in with the policies of the top boss, NATO. WEU Secretary-General Van Eekelen says that three areas deserve attention. In the first place the WEU has formed a Forum for Consultation for political dialogue between the WEU states and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to develop mechanisms for consultations on crisis situations. Conflicts could be prevented this way. The WEU also wants joint exercises with the East Europeans. The French proposal to associate Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and perhaps Slovakia with the WEU is well received by Van Eekelen. Secondly, in reality the WEU is already involved in peace operations: The sea blockade of Serbia and Montenegro in the Adriatic Sea and monitoring the embargo against Serbia on the Danube. In these cases the WEU is helping NATO. The WEU still does not have the resources and structures necessary for an independent intervention. Finally the WEU wants to strengthen European defense cooperation. The French-German-Belgian Eurocorps is providing the first troops. But in military and technological respects, the WEU is far behind the United States. A European Armament Agency announced in the Maastricht Treaty is intended to be the start of a catching-up operation. But it is doubtful whether the firm political will necessary is present in Europe. It looks as if the WEU does not have the strength to play a real role in the new U.S. plan for Europe, which the Western allies will accept in the coming days under the leadership of Bill Clinton. For the time being, the European defense identity will remain a pious footnote.
