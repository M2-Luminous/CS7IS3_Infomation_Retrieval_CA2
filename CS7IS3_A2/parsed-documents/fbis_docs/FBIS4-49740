He was responding to a poll published by the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST yesterday which showed 36 percent of people felt less confident about Beijing's handling of the transition. But Mr Patten said he believed the more Mr Lu was able to visit Hong Kong, the more people would feel reassured. He hoped both sides would be able to demonstrate their commitment to cooperating with each other to encourage Hong Kong people to have more confidence. Mr Patten repeated his call for dialogue. "We want to have a dialogue with Director Lu. We want to see more work flowing up and down the channels of the Joint Liaison Group, the Airport Committee, the Land Commission and so on. "I think that the meeting of the Land Commission recently was a positive development and showed commitment on all sides to the well-being of Hong Kong. I think we'd like to see... the next Joint Liaison Group meeting as successful," he said. Mr Lu ended his nine-day visit at Kai Tak airport yesterday in the manner in which he had arrived -- bypassing the media. Mainland PWC [Preliminary Working Committee] members will return to Beijing today.
