He warned that the "Colorado Party will do anything necessary, during any emergency in which we are called, to defend the legitimate right of the Colorado Party to govern." The ceremony was held at the Colorado Party headquarters with the participation of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, ministers, and the party's top leadership. Sanabria Cantero said that the country is advancing "against what is written and proclaimed through incomplete information." He again warned those who speculate "that disorder, chaos, and a public lack of tranquility are instruments of destabilization, that they will never make the government slip nor will they confuse the republican masses who remain firm, as is their tradition, in the defense of order and lawfulness no matter what they are called to defend."
