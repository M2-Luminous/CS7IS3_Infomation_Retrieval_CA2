FBIS4-7338 "dreas083_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 North Korea Red Cross Urges Release of POW's Daughter Red Cross Urges Release of POW's Daughter SK2704051694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704051694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, in a telephone message today to Kang Yong-hun, president of South Korean Red Cross, urged the South side to take a humanitarian measure for Kim Chi-hyon and her brothers to receive medical treatment and have their livelihood protected in the North. Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, a soldier of the Korean People's Army who was arrested while active in the Jirisan guerrilla force during the Fatherland Liberation War and died after being released from prison where he had spent long years, refusing to be converted. She had her ribs cut off in an operation, attacked with costal tuberculosis, but the inflammation has spread to the region of the vertebra. So she is in a critical condition. The telephone message said Kim Chi-hyon has no family and relatives who can look after her at sickbed and no patrons who can take care of her younger brothers in the South. The only way of saving her is to bring her to the northern half of the country where free medical care is in force, the message noted, and continued: We notify your Red Cross that if there is a problem of hospital fees and money for medicine and medical treatment which she has not paid yet, we are willing to pay them in her place. The North and the South are in relations of confrontation which are abnormal politically and militarily. But humanitarianism of Red Cross is a most noble universal idea transcending the concept of confronting parties and of friend and foe. So we believe your side will accept our proposal with good will. We hope your Red Cross will take an appropriate measure so that our proposal based on human and compatriotic love may be realised at an early date.
