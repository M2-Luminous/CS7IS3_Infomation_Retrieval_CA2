The regional Governor Boris Nemtsov appointed his deputy Ivan Sklyarov to act as Nizhnyy Novgorod mayor. Officials in the regional administration explained to Interfax that the misconduct lay in Bednyakov's refusal to carry out Governor Nemtsov's order to cancel the referendum on the city charter draft. The refusal destabilized the city and the region, discredited the authorities and made their joint work impossible. Nemtsov said at a news conference Wednesday that "continuous rallies, picketing, ballot rigging and a large-scale anti-Semitic campaign could not be described as stability."
