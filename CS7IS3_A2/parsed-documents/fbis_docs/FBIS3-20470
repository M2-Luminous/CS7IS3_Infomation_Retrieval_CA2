He has gone from cooperation to a split with Acer. He is typical of the astute and tough partners and adversaries that Taiwan firms have encountered on the mainland. When thinking about the red guards who went through the severe test of 10 years of turmoil on the China mainland, one conjures up an image of burly men possessed of indomitable spirit and a booming voice. On first sight, Li Feng [7812 6912] turned out to be of slight build and extraordinarily quite, particularly so in the noisy lobby of a hotel in Shenzhen. It was impossible to know that as soon as he opened his mouth, this impression would be completely reversed. He was really a very incisive person! "If it hadn't been for my advertising, Acer would never have sold anything (in China)." He spoke like a machine gun, and not just rapidly but forcefully as well. "You must use strong words in advertising to Chinese. Acer's ads were not strong enough." He held back nothing when he talked. "Acer is too gentle. Stan Shih and the others are all too nice." "Computer ads in China are not for customers to read; they are written for the bosses who do not understand computers who may happen to read them." He began to give pointers. "There is no use talking all the time about Acer's history or concepts. No one wants to read that." Waving his hands, he said, "My ads said that Acer is best in six ways. What their own ads did not say, I said for them." Standing there, he was really complex. In the eyes of people in Shenzhen, Li Feng is a mystery. For Acer Computer, which longs to open up the China mainland market, Li Feng was a strong partner deserving of respect, but today he is a difficult to control local bully. To other Taiwan and overseas information entrepreneurs who want to open the mainland door, Li Feng provides a key on which they pin their hopes. Li Feng is a 39 year-old Hunanese. "No one knows where he sprang from." In talking about his background, one Shenzhen entrepreneur shook his head and said, "My friend who plays cards with him has never seen him lose." Another person who sells computers on the mainland seems to have heard a lot about Li Feng, but still really not enough. He said that Li Feng is the name on his name card, but his identity cards bears the name Zhai Lifeng [5049 7812 6912]. However, "this identity card was also bought, so just what his real name is, I have no way of knowing." In making the rounds of Shenzhen, Li Feng draws a lot of attention. His car is an imported Lincoln Continental. Sometimes he drives it himself rather than use a chauffeur. A year ago, Li Feng, who had been operating in Shenzhen for seven years, established the Liji Corporation, which specialized in the sale of Acer computers. Li Feng was very candid in saying why he had taken the name Liji for his corporation. "It was to cooperate with Acer." Within one year, he found 25 salesmen on the China mainland, and he claimed to have spent a total of $200,000 on advertising. In order to help Liji expand the mainland market rapidly, Acer provided all possible help. For this reason, all the computers in the Liji office were provided by Acer, and Acer helped set up all the office's E-mail networks. Liji's financial and management systems were all set up with the help of Acer. One person well versed on the inside story could not help saying that "Their (Liji's) whole enterprise is a duplicate of Acer." In 1992, Acer unexpectedly learned that Liji had privately sold copies of Acer computers. After contacting a Hong Kong lawyer unsuccessfully, Acer decided to sever relations with Liji. An Acer mainland market official said, "On anything having to do with the intangible asset of a trademark, Acer's principle is very clear: absolutely no compromise." In April 1993, Acer formally established a branch corporation on the mainland. Makes Own Way in the World Using Taiwan Connections While I was talking with Li Feng in the coffee shop of a Shenzhen hotel, his cellular telephone suddenly rang. After hanging up the telephone, Li Feng said that Acer had sent a fax demanding that Liji immediately settle outstanding debts. Hardening his voice, he responded, "Acer says it will not sell machines to me. Who cares? I can buy them from Hong Kong, Japan, or the United States." No matter how matters develop between Liji and Acer, Li Feng has decided to continue to use Taiwan computer contacts to make his own way in the world. "Now I am cooperating with Taiwan," Li Feng said. All the products that Liji needs in order to have a brand of its own -- mainframes, monitors, chassis, or script computers, etc -- will be provided by Taiwan concerns. In order to sell low cost computers for home use, he went to the Beijing branch of the American Yingdaier [phonetic] Company, which he told that he wanted 1 million 80386 computer chips each month. From his contacts with Taiwan entrepreneurs, Li Feng is quick to apply what he learns. After hearing of the Taiwan computer industry's business problems in recent years, he said with a laugh, "I only sell. I don't manufacture. Manufacturing is too tough." Because Li Ming's car had been sent to the airport to meet an official from the Ministry of Electronics in Beijing, he walked back to his office. Asked as he walked along the streets of Shenzhen whether Shenzhen was a so-called risk taker's paradise, he nodded agreement. To succeed in Shenzhen takes three things: "First is outside assistance. This is the facade. Second is contacts. This is the real strength. Third is assistants. Because of the many opportunities, it is impossible to get around to all of them." "How will your Taiwan overcome our mainland? Forty years ago, the Kuomintang lost out to the Communist Party," he said as he walked along. "Nowadays, there is no talk about politics; just about making money. The likes of Acer do not love money. I really have trouble understanding it." Except for the mainland, this is a world that operates using laws and concepts. In the mainland, by contrast, a fist is sometimes more useful than a lawyer. Li Feng is just the kind of astute and tough partner and adversary that a typical Taiwan trader meets on the mainland.
