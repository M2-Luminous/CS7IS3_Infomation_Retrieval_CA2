The minister stressed that he always opposed such tendencies, because especially in the period of the transformation of the Army "they cause harmful chaos in the Armed Forces." He added that if the political manipulations exceed a certain limit and if in the near future, there is a culmination of unfavorable phenomena, such as the budget debate which was unfavorable to the Army, he may come to the conclusion that there is no place for him in Warsaw. For the time being, however, "as long as his hands are not tied," the possibility of resignation is out of the question. Because he is not used to deserting because of difficulties, "the caravan will continue," said Kolodziejczyk; he carefully evaded answering the question of who exactly is trying to politically dominate the Army and what the manipulations are. He merely said that in recent days, he had met with Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz in order to discuss the issue of the final decisions concerning the model for steering the Ministry of National Defense [MON]. These problems will probably be resolved at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, the MON head expects; he hopes that it will be not a "contemporary model, but a model for years." MON roughly estimates that the costs of the "Partnership for Peace" program will amount to nearly 0.5 trillion zlotys [Z]. Approximately Z60 to Z80 billion are needed to establish our military mission with the NATO leadership in Brussels. We would have to spend Z420 billion for participating in this year's training. Kolodziejczyk is determined to maintain the civilian control over the Army; the control should be such as it is envisioned in the standards accepted by Western Europe and NATO. "It is with disgust that I read reports on the alleged conflict on the border of the civilian and military segments within MON," the minister was backed up by General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the general staff. He mentioned that there are sometimes differences of opinion; however, in a situation in which difficult problems must be resolved, this is entirely understandable. Jerzy Milewski, first deputy of the minister and head of the National Security Office, evaluates press enunciations bluntly as "false and outrageous." "Well, I have found myself in the ministry at the motion of Minister Kolodziejczyk," explained Milewski; in addition, his superior gave assurances that they had known each other for ages and the cooperation between them was developing very well. After one year's experiences in the area of steering the Armed Forces in line with new rules, General Wilecki announced on Wednesday [26 January] that there would be serious changes, not only in the central establishments of the Army. The General Staff, as the chief command body, will include newly established inspectorates (or centers of command) of the naval and air forces; the General Staff chief believes that this will place these forces higher to the strategic level, which will strengthen their position in the Army. Transforming the model of the functioning of the quite extensive Air Forces and Air Protection Forces will entail serious reductions of forces and equipment; at least 20 airfields will become redundant. "However, local communities increasingly often protest liquidating the garrisons that the strategists decided should be liquidated. Self-governmental authorities are willing to stop collecting fees -- only if the Army stayed in the town," says General Wilecki. The establishment of the experimental "ground-air" Krakow district will be continued; so far the process is half-way completed (it is scheduled for completion in 1997). Within its framework, the following formations will be established: 14th brigade in Przemysl, 21st brigade in Rzeszow, 23d brigade in Gliwice. In addition, the Krakow and Lublin garrisons will be extended. The experiences gained in the Krakow district will be useful in the future, in building a mobile brigade system, adjusted to the structures accepted in NATO. In the area of the Lodz Voivodship a division of armored cavalry will be established. Three regiments: in Leczyca, Tomaszow Mazowiecki, and Nowe Miasto will be equipped with Polish "Huzar" helicopters, light anti-infantry, and antitank weapons. This way some kind of fast reaction forces will be established; General Wilecki calls them formations of "winged infantry." A committee that is working on the new model of military education is completing its work. As early as this autumn, the first officers cadets will be trained in line with new rules. The number of schools will be decreased by half; some persons of the didactic cadres will be transferred to "future-oriented" schools. Minister Kolodziejczyk estimates the redundant military property that has been left over by the once-twice-as-big Polish Army at Z2 trillion. After a period of great interest at the beginning, no one wants to buy the empty barracks and store-rooms (the Army, in order to protect them from devastation, is spending its money). The minister hopes that this government will see to this problem. So far there has not been an appropriate agency that would free the Army of this burden.
