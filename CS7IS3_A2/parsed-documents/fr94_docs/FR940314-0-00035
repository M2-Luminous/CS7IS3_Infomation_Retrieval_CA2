The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which Santa Barbara County has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted SBCAPCD's regulations to EPA and requested that EPA delegate authority to SBCAPCD to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. SBCAPCD's regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable sections of 40 CFR part 55. The OCS air regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: (1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_SBCAPCD adopted Rule 903, Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on November 10, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR part 55 that EPA is delegating to the District. (2) The state has adequate authority under state law to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55_According to a letter dated January 25, 1993 and forwarded to EPA from the State Attorney General, SBCAPCD has the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of part 55.
