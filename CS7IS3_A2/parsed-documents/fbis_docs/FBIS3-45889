In releasing the monthly figures, the bureau said: "In December, China's industrial output increased significantly; retail sales were prosperous but price rises were serious and inflationary pressure expanded." "This (29.8 percent) is close to the peak level registered before (the Government) introduced its macro adjustment policies," it said.
