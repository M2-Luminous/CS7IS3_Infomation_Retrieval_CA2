FR941005-0-00009 FR941005-0-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 15 and 32 [FRL&hyph;5083&hyph;8] Ineligibility for Federal Contracts, Assistance, Loans and Benefits AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments. SUMMARY: This rule makes several changes to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules in 40 CFR part 15 governing the ineligibility of facilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) to receive Federal contracts, assistance and loans; and in 40 CFR part 32 governing nonprocurement suspension and debarment under EO 12549. This rulemaking conforms parts 15 and 32 to the changes EPA has made to the internal administrative responsibilities for the two debarment programs. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert F. Meunier, Director, Suspension and Debarment Division (3902F), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Telephone: (202) 260&hyph;8025. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background In 1993, EPA's Office of Administration and Resources Management (OARM) was reorganized to improve the administration contracts. That reorganization changed the titles of certain EPA officials having prescribed responsibilities under part 32 for the nonprocurement suspension and debarment program. Earlier this year, the EPA Administrator decided to reorganize the former Office of Enforcement (OE). As part of that reorganization, administrative responsibility for the part 15 CAA and CWA contractor listing program was transferred to OARM so that all EPA debarment functions would be conducted by a single office. These two reorganizations make it necessary to amend 40 CFR parts 15 and 32 to conform them to EPA's internal administrative changes. This rulemaking also modifies provisions of part 15 so that they describe the current practice of publishing all CAA and CWA ineligibility information in the List of Debarred, Suspended, Voluntarily Excluded, and Ineligible Persons maintained by the General Services Administration. In 1995, the Agency plans to propose substantive revisions to 40 CFR parts 15 and 32 which will consolidate these two sets of rules into a single part. Rulemaking Analysis B. Executive Order 12866 This is not a significant regulatory action under EO 12866; therefore, no review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs is required. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The EPA certifies that this rule does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule makes nomenclature changes only to existing rules. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not contain information collection requirements for the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. E. Public Comments The EPA has not solicited public comments on this final rule. List of Subjects 40 CFR Part 15 Administrative practice and procedure, Debarment and suspension. 40 CFR Part 32 Administrative practice and procedure, Debarment and suspension. Dated: September 27, 1994. Sallyanne Harper, Acting Assistant Administrator, Office of Administration and Resources Management.
