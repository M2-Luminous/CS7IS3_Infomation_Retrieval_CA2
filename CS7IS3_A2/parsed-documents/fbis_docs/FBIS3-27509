Several Hong Kong celebrities were invited and the atmosphere was warm. In his speech, Director Zhou Nan said: Over the past year, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress, China has made world-renowned achievements in its reform, opening up, and modernization. Its GNP has grown by 13 percent, ranking it first in the world. In the past year, China has witnessed sensible policies, harmonious human relations, political tranquility, and stability in popular sentiment; the country's comprehensive strength has increased, and its international position has improved. In the New Year, we will continue to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, widen opening up, promote development, maintain stability, make an important step forward in establishing the socialist market economic structure, implement a number of major reform measures, and bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy [as received] national economic development. We will usher in the 45th founding anniversary of the PRC with more brilliant achievements in our modernization drive. Over the past year, Hong Kong's economy has further merged with the motherland's economy. The mainland's vigorous development has enabled Hong Kong to overcome all kinds of negative factors and to maintain a comparatively high economic growth rate, which stands at appropriately 5.5 percent. This fully suggests that the motherland's stability and development serve as the most solid foundation for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. We are completely convinced that, in the New Year, exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, and other fields between Hong Kong and the mainland will further develop and move a step higher. Over the past year, we have sincerely hoped that China and Britain would reach agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-1995 electoral arrangements on the basis of "three conformities," and we have done our utmost toward this end. The British side, however, has obstinately persisted in the erroneous stance of the "three violations" and brazenly submitted parts of its constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council at a time when no agreement had been reached between the two sides. As a result, the Sino-British talks have ruptured, and the good wishes of the Chinese side and the Hong Kong compatriots have completely fallen through. Now people can understand more explicitly that the British side is completely responsible for the breakdown of the talks. However, Hong Kong's destiny is, after all, controlled by the great Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots. In no way can the British side's uncooperative attitude stop the wheel of history from moving forward. In the future, alongside the Hong Kong compatriots, we will actively make all kinds of preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region firmly in accordance with the "one country, two systems" policy and the provisions of the Basic Law. We enjoy the backing of the powerful motherland and the effective support of the Chinese people. We possess all the necessary conditions to overcome all sorts of obstacles to our progress, to bring about a steady transition in 1997, and to ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. There is only a little more than three years until the historic moment of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Let us unite as one, work with one heart and one mind, remove all obstacles, ensure China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and the comprehensive implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy, and work hard for the fulfillment of this great and glorious mission entrusted to us by history. The future of our great motherland and Hong Kong is infinitely bright.
