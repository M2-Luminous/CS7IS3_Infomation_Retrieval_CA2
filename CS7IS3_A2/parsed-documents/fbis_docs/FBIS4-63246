He emphasized that the RUKH definitely stood for restoration of lawfulness and preservation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. He suggested that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk must assume control over the Crimean power structures rather than be waiting. Ukrainian Peasant Party leader Sergey Dovgan announced to Interfax-Ukraine that a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation had left for Crimea. "We hope they will manage to persuade Crimean deputies to make more weighed decisions," he said. The Agrarian parliamentary faction speaks in favor of talks on Crimean issue, Dovgan stressed. However, he added that these issues must be resolved on the basis of the Ukrainian constitution. A leader of the UNA-UNSO (the Ukrainian National Assembly -- the Ukrainian National Self-Defense) ultra-nationalist organization Oleg Vitovich told Interfax he gave his complete backing to representatives of the Ukrainian organizations picketing the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and demanding to annul the autonomy of Crimea. Vitovich suggested that the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet must assess the activities of the president and the former composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet which had led to the present situation in the Ukrainian-Crimean relations. He believes that the Crimean problems should be solved in Crimea rather than in Kiev.
