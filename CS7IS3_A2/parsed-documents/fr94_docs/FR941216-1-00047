FR941216-1-00047 FR941216-1-00010 (iv) Amount realized on a scheduled retirement. For purposes of determining the amount realized by a holder and the repurchase price paid by the issuer on the scheduled retirement of a debt instrument, a holder is treated as receiving, and the issuer is treated as paying, the projected amount of any contingent payment due at maturity. The amount realized on a scheduled retirement of a debt instrument and the issuer's repurchase price on the retirement, however, may be reduced under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section (regarding the treatment of negative adjustment carryforwards determined in the taxable year of the retirement). (v) Unscheduled retirements. An unscheduled retirement of a debt instrument (or the receipt of a pro-rata prepayment that is treated as a retirement of a portion of a debt instrument under ยง1.1275&hyph;2(f)) is treated as a sale or exchange of the debt instrument (or a pro rata portion of the debt instrument) by the holder to the issuer for the amount paid by the issuer to the holder. (vi) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. In each example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and retirement _(i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. (ii) Adjustment to issue price and basis. Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest on the debt instrument would be $56 for 1996. Therefore, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are increased by this amount ($56), despite the fact that, under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, Z has a net negative adjustment for 1996 of $75 that reduces to zero the $56 total daily portions of interest otherwise accounted for by Z in that year. In addition, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are decreased on December 31, 1996, by the projected amount of the payment on that date ($100). Thus, on January 1, 1997, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument are $1,000. (iii) Retirement. Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately before the payment at maturity is $1,100. Even though Z receives $1,150 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt instrument, Z is treated as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 1997. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving $1,100 on December 31, 1997. Because Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately before its retirement is $1,100, Z recognizes no gain or loss on the retirement. Z, however, does include $131 as interest income on the debt instrument in 1997. See Example 1 of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. Example 2. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of sale_ (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that Z sells the debt instrument on January 1, 1997, for $1,075. (ii) Gain on sale. On the date the debt instrument is sold, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,000. Because Z has a negative adjustment on the debt instrument on January 1, 1997, of $19 under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)( 1 ) of this section, and has no positive adjustments on the debt instrument in 1997, Z has a net negative adjustment for 1997 of $19. Because Z has included no interest on the debt instrument in income in 1997 or previous years, the entire $19 net negative adjustment constitutes a negative adjustment carryforward for the taxable year of the sale. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)( 2 ) of this section, the $19 negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount realized by Z on the sale of the debt instrument from $1,075 to $1,056. Thus, Z has a gain on the sale of $56.
