As Grachev has reported in an interview with Interfax, the facilities are to be located at Vaziani (30 kilometers south of Tbilisi), at Akhalkalaki (southern Georgia), and at Batumi (the Ajar Autonomous Republic). As he explained, the bases will get under construction in 1995 after the term of Russian troops interim presence expires, and their status will differ much from that of the Russian forces in Georgia now. Russia will foot the entire troops maintenance bill and will partly compensate for its military presence in Georgia. Grachev emphasized that the primary goal of the bases would be to defend the CIS North Caucasian flank. According to experts, there are about 8000 Russian servicemen in Georgia. With the formation of three bases in Georgia plus two facilities in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Russian army in Transcaucasia will total 23,000 men.
