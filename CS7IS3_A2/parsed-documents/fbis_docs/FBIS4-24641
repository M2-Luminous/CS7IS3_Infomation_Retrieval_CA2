[sentence as received] Mr. Chen said that, through efforts in the past few months, authorities at various levels in China had increased their consciousness to control and administer prices under the condition of market-based economy, and both production and trade enterprises had now realized that they should accept price control conducted by the state and should not do whatever they wanted. The price situation had begun to change. Mr. Chen said that achievement made in the course of price inspection was great, however, it should not be overestimated. He analyzed that the reform and opening to the outside world had kept its momentum since this year. Various kinds of reform measures in fiscal and tax, financial, foreign trade and foreign currency as well as investment system had been functioning smoothly after they were put into practice, some functioned even better than expected. The national economy was gradually moving in the direction demanded by macro-control. However, there still existed some unfavorable factors in agricultural production at present, and inflation still maintained a high level. Therefore, to stabilize prices and to curb inflation remained a key task of macro-control. Mr. Chen called for strengthening control in price rise of daily necessities and basic services which would seriously affect people's life and had aroused strong reaction from the society. They included grain, cotton, chemical fertilizer, rural electric power supply, steel products and process oil.
