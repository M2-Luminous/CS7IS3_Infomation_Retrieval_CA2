On the surface, it appears that the price level in China will fall, but because of changes in the import-export mechanism and various other reasons, China's overall price level will not only not fall but possibly rise. Generally speaking, the following several factors will have an effect: 1. The effect of exchange rate changes. Several times since 1985, China has lowered the exchange rate between the renminbi and the United States dollar, but the official exchange rate today still overestimates the value of the renminbi. In addition, with the institution of strict foreign exchange control whereby the renminbi cannot be freely exchanged, the renminbi will be devalued. The reasons are as follows: First, as price reform intensifies and the pace quickens, domestic prices will enter a period of fairly high rise during which the national price index will increase several percentage points each year. Second, with the development of China's commodity economy, the determination of the prices of goods by the laws of value is bound to rupture the existing price system. Tremendous changes will occur that will cause a rise in prices resulting in an absolute decline in the existing monetary value of the renminbi. This will produce a devaluation of the renminbi relative to foreign currencies. Third, as trade protection weakens, imports will increase fairly rapidly in the short term causing an increase in domestic demand for foreign exchange, which will cause a rise in the exchange rate. Thus, the renminbi value of imports will rise. Clearly, a lowering of the renminbi exchange rate will cause a rise in the price index on the one hand, and a rise in the price index will spur a further lowering of the renminbi exchange rate on the other. Therefore, following China's re-entry into GATT, changes in the exchange rate will cause a rise in the domestic price level. 2. The effect of the transfer of international inflation. The meshing of China's economy with the international economy is an objective requirement for China's re-entry to GATT. As a result of foreign trade, foreign debt, and exchange rate devaluation, international inflation can be shifted to China. Conversely, because the renminbi cannot leave China, domestic inflation cannot be shifted to the international economy. Therefore, in the process of opening to the outside world, we will sustain pressure from both domestic inflation and the transfer of international inflation. Because of this double inflation, China's price level is bound to rise. 3. The effect of total supply and demand. Following re-entry into GATT, international factors will have to be added into China's total supply and demand balance. The former balance will be destroyed. On the supply side, numerous foreign products that enjoy marked superiority in quality and price will enter China directly. At the same time, large amounts of some Chinese resources and preliminarily processed raw materials will flow to foreign countries because of their cheap price. On the demand side, as Chinese incomes increase fairly rapidly and restrictions on income soften, the demand for high quality consumer goods (such as motor vehicles) will be virtually unlimited. Because imports of foreign goods are restricted in various ways at the present time, citizen consumption demand is held down by the structural dislocations between supply and demand; thus, supply and demand are in relative balance for the time being. But just as soon as the regulation of imports demolishes the structural restraints on the supply and demand structure, people's consumption will begin to be stimulated. As a result, current latent demand will become real demand. Moreover, since consumption accounts for two-thirds of total demand, the fairly rapid growth of consumption demand is bound to stimulate growth of total demand, thereby affecting the overall price level. 4. The effect of tariffs. In the course of multilateral negotiations with GATT signatory nations, China promised to reduce tariffs. China believes that a lowering of tariffs will lower prices of imports, thereby lowering the overall price level. A World Bank report believes that China's actual tariff rate is between 5 and 6 percent, which is close to the developed country level and lower than the developing country level. Therefore, following re-entry to GATT, China's actual overall tariff level will not change very much. Effect on Agricultural Product Prices 1) Advantages The GATT provides favorable conditions for accelerating the opening to the outside world of China's agriculture, and for linking China's agricultural production with the world agricultural products market. It helps introduce new varieties, and new techniques and management experiences to transform traditional agriculture, to promote advances in China's agricultural techniques, and to increase the modernization of China's agriculture. It enables China to enjoy fairly consistent most favored nation treatment, and it expands exports of China's agricultural products, particularly processed agricultural products. China can make full use of the GATT negotiating mechanism to link up with developing countries concerned in opposing the agricultural trade barriers and the export subsidy policies of developed countries in order to safeguard the interests of developing countries. China can make use of foreign experiences and GATT mechanisms to give impetus to thorough reform of agriculture that promotes the smooth transformation of China's agriculture from a planned economy to a socialist market economy. 2) Disadvantages The lowering of agricultural product tariffs and the reduction of non-tariff production measures means that China's principal agricultural products will face strong quality and price competition from foreign products. 1. Farming During the past decade, agricultural production costs in China have increased by an average 10 percent per year. Prices of some products are higher than the international market price. Many agricultural products have lost their competitive price advantage. Once China returns to GATT, its farm production --particularly grain production -- will face extremely daunting challenges. 2. Animal Husbandry It is well known that under today's import control system and at today's tariff rates, China's wool production frequently receives a pounding from the international market. In 1984 and in 1988, for example, China-produced wool accumulated in inventory for 2 to 3 years because too much wool was imported. This had an extremely adverse effect on the economic development of border areas and the normal life of peasants and herdsmen. Between 1989 and 1991, the annual per capita income of Inner Mongolian herdsmen was 201 yuan less than in normal years. Following China's re-entry to GATT, if tariff rates are further greatly lowered and license control is abolished, imports will further increase making maintenance of domestic wool production difficult. Milk and dairy products production also face challenges from foreign products. Today, prices of Chinese produced dairy products are higher than the international market price, largely because yields per milk cow are low and costs are high. In China today, 68 percent of all cows are low yield cows that product 5 tons or less per year. Second, processing scale returns are poor. Most of the country's dairy products processing plants have a fresh milk processing capacity of under 20 tons per day. No scale production capacity has been built, products are undiversified, and the labor productivity rate is low. Among imported dairy products, whole fat milk power poses a substantial threat. 3. Aquatic Products Following GATT re-entry, China's aquatic products industry will also face some problems and challenges. One relates to prawns. China is the largest producer and the foremost exporter of prawns. Because of the rise in production costs in recent years, costs now approximate, or are slightly higher than in the prawn producing countries of southeast Asia. If import tariffs are too low, southeast Asian prawns may take over China's markets because their quality is good and sale prices are flexible. Second, once tariffs are lowered, imports of marine fish will increase and prices will fall. This may damage freshwater fish production. Effect on Electronics Industry Products Positive Advantages 1. GATT re-entry will create a domestic and international climate helpful to the development of China's electronics industry and hasten its internationalization. a. It will help improve the domestic economic environment. In the operation of China's economy today, as formerly, the government controls the economy through the use of command plans and guidance plans. Government control of enterprises behavior is stifling. The role of the market mechanism in regulating enterprises behavior is insufficient. In addition, parochialism in industries and local protectionism split markets that were not intact to begin with the result that market behavior and the market mechanism in China today does not conform to GATT regulations. However, these regulations have been universally accepted by other countries. In order for China to revive its GATT signatory nation status, it must accept generally acknowledged international norms. This requires that China further intensify economic system reforms, demolish the old control system, and build a new administrative system and new market mechanism that meets the requirements of a socialist market economy. It requires elimination of excessive administrative meddling with enterprise behavior, elimination of local and industrial sector protectionism, full use of the market mechanism, establishment of the proper position of enterprises in the market, and accelerated formation of a nationwide unified market. Only in this way can our enterprises have a fair and competitive environment on which they can rely for their survival and development. b. China's environment for electronics exports will improve substantially. Following GATT restitution, we can enjoy steady, multilateral most favored nation treatment. We can further free ourselves from the economic control of developed nations. Applicable GATT tariff protection principles may be used to counter the non-tariff barriers that some countries have set up against China's export of electronics products. As the volume of China's electronics exports has increased in recent years, some rampantly protectionist developed countries have invoked anti-dumping controls against China's electronics product exports. Once China re-enters GATT, it will be able to rely on applicable GATT tariff protection principles to counter improper foreign anti-dumping, and anti-subsidy sanctions for a gradual elimination of such discriminatory trade behavior, and avoidance of the unfairness and arbitrariness of unilateral sanctions based on importing countries anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws. GATT principles of free trade provide that protection of the indigenous industry of all signatory nations is limited to tariffs. Signatory nations have an obligation to abolish import quantity restrictions, import subsidies, and such non-tariff barriers. Thus, the non-tariff barriers of certain countries against China's electronics products will decrease to a certain extent once China re-enters GATT. 2. Full enjoyment of the favored treatment that GATT accords developing countries. China is still a developing country; thus, it may make full use of GATT exception clauses that pertain to developing countries. It can enjoy the favored treatment that GATT accords developing countries such as greater elasticity in the tariff system of developing countries, permitting subsidies within certain limits, enjoyment of general preferential treatment, etc. These clauses are favorable for China's making the most of its own advantages, for turning its strengths to advantage and avoiding weaknesses, and for expanding exports once it has returned to GATT. Specifically, China's electronics industry can use the tariff system provisions (such as developing countries not making any countervailing tariff reduction or preferential provisions for developed countries) for fairly flexible handling of tariffs on the products of China's electronics industry, thereby gaining a certain degree of protection for China's fledgling and incompletely competitive industries. 3. Acceleration of the internationalization of China's electronics industry. GATT re-entry means a meshing of the domestic market with international markets, the domestic market becoming an integral part of the international market. China's electronics industry must orient toward both the domestic and the international market. Macroeconomically speaking, China must put in place an operating mechanism for the transformation of enterprises, effectively control the economy as a whole, improve analysis of the domestic and foreign economic situations, analyze market price prognostications, readjust tax policy, credit policy, income policy, and exchange rate policy in a timely fashion, and maintain general balance between total social supply and demand so that price formation and operation are consistent with economic development. China must use effectively and rationally domestic and foreign sources of materials, become a part of the modern economic development tide of an international division of labor, and join the ranks of international competition. Like it or not, our enterprises have no other choice. They can either seek survival and development through competition, or they can lose and collapse through competition. This international competition provides both motivation and pressure. This is the only way to spur enterprises to transform their operating mechanisms, to improve internal administration, to raise labor productivity rates, to strive to lower product costs, to engage in constant technological transformation, to update technology and develop new products, to actively adjust their product mix, to improve product quality steadily, and to realize the economies of scale. We must master the international market, and actively take part in international competition as the only way to develop our electronics industry. 4. GATT re-entry will permit China to take part in the drawing up of regulations pertaining to international trade; it will help China draw up economic regulations suited to its reform and opening to the outside world, new circumstances, and international practice. Since we are not yet a GATT member, our specific national circumstances cannot be reflected in GATT international trade regulations. We can only passively accept GATT regulations on international trade. Consequently, China's electronics exports are frequently treated unfairly. They are unfairly restricted, proscribed, and even excluded by numerous non-tariff barriers. Once China's GATT signatory nation status has been restored, we can participate directly in drafting and discussing the GATT regulations that play a major role in international trade. This will enable China to express its intentions and have them made a part of GATT regulations. This will mean that. like other members, China can enjoy and observe GATT regulations as an equal, avoiding the discrimination that comes with not being a member. China's participation in GATT will have a definite effect on the drafting and perfection of its laws and regulations pertaining to the economy, trade, and finance and banking. Some new laws and regulations that are in keeping with international practice and norms will have to be drawn up, and existing laws and regulations will have to be further improved to make Chinese economic life a part of the legal system while maintaining China's distinctive socialist market economy. 5. GATT entry will help resolve trade disputes. GATT is an international body having a mechanism for resolving multilateral trade disputes. It is an authoritative arena for the resolution of international trade arguments. Since China followed a policy of isolation and self-containment for so long, since economic reform and opening to the outside world has taken place only during the past 10-odd years, and since China is not a GATT member, it is still not thoroughly conversant with the trade regulations of some GATT signatory nations. The arguments and disputes of recent years over China's electronics product export trade have usually been attributable to this. This puts China in an unfavorable position for resolving and handling disputes, and thus it has paid an unnecessary price in some cases. However, each year GATT has to deal with many trade disputes. While upholding the just rights and interests of signatory nations, it effectively handles trade disputes verging on conflict from all quarters. Following GATT re-entry, China can place itself under the multilateral trade protection principles that all signatory nations acknowledge. It can avail itself of GATT's dispute resolution mechanism, thereby improving its bargaining position in the resolution of trade disputes among signatory nations. It will be able more effectively to discuss and negotiate solution to disputes with its trading partners using the maintenance of GATT principles as a basis. When necessary, it can fairly resolve issues through GATT's mediation, thereby improving treatment for China's electronics products export trade to safeguard the national interest. 6. GATT re-entry will mean fairly easy access to full information about the world economy and trade. GATT has information about the world economy and trade. As a signatory nation, China can use this GATT window to obtain documents from which it can gain an understanding of the trade regulations, trade policies, trade statistics, and trends of development in trade of other signatory nations. This will help China decide trade development strategies and draw up rational trade laws and regulations. It will also enhance information exchanges with other countries. For electronics products, in particular, which are updated extremely rapidly and in which competition is extremely intense, timely understanding of international market product trends and market movements holds extremely important significance for China's long-term trade strategy and the setting of near-term goals. 7. GATT participation will further help attract foreign capital, and bring in sophisticated technology and management experience. Following GATT re-entry, as China's markets mesh with international markets to become an integral part of the international market, our products will be able to leave and enter the international market, and we will be able to acquire some sophisticated technology and sales techniques from foreign countries. In addition, the more roomy domestic market climate will also further attract foreign trader investment and the operation of enterprises in China. Investment in the electronics industry, in particular, will increase, and with it will come fairly sophisticated technology and management experience. Negative Disadvantages Recovery of GATT signatory nation status will have a very severe near-term impact on China's electronics markets. Intense competition may put some enterprises in dire straits. Some enterprises that produce low quality, not readily saleable products will lose out in competition, will lose their markets entirely, and will face the prospect of halting production, going out of business, merging, or shifting to other lines of production. Following GATT re-entry, while enjoying rights as a member, China will also have to perform corresponding duties. As China's electronics products enter international markets, whether we greatly reduce tariffs or provide "market promises" as the "admittance fee" for GATT re-entry, the domestic electronics products market will become an integral part of the international market. Thus, China will lose its "protective umbrella" to stand completely naked in international markets. This will pose a grim test for China's electronics industry. 1. High and new technology industries that are just getting started will face grim challenges, and industries in their infancy will find their development threatened. High and new technology businesses in China's electronics industry are in a nascent stage. They do not have the ability to compete with similar foreign products in terms of product quality, technical performance, or price. We must clearly realize that in their overall level, China's electronics products cannot compete with sophisticated products from the United States, Japan, and Europe. They will even find sales competition with similar products from Asia's "four small dragons" difficult. Unless China's electronics industry is properly protected, foreign goods will overwhelm its electronics products markets facing China's industrial enterprises will a further predicament. 2. Many years of narrow sectarianism and local protectionism, failure to keep in mind the nation's overall interests, and much mindless redundant imports and construction have produced two consequences: One is the waste of a large amount of money, materials, and manpower; and the other is that excess production capacity for the same items resulted in none of the enterprises producing the same product being able to keep fully employed. Thus, they could not realize the economies of scale, found it difficult to hold down costs, and were unable to fashion a certain amount of international competitiveness. If premium quality, low priced foreign goods come flooding in on top of this, without government protection, some enterprises producing low quality products will face the danger of being eliminated when faced with the onslaught of foreign products because their technology is antiquated, the management is inept, their product quality is poor, and their economic returns are low. 3. Electronics products, which cannot compete on price and quality, will lose the protection they now enjoy when the domestic market is opened up. They face the danger of being wiped out. For a long time, China has accorded both tariff and non-tariff protection to electronics products. This kept out imports to protect markets. At the same time, however, it protected backward industries and obstructed competition. Ultimately this caused a loss of both money and human resources. Some low technology, poor quality enterprises had to rely on a distorted market price system. They depended on the government's protective umbrella for their survival. Even so, some enterprises still showed a loss. However, some technologically strong and well-run enterprises, and some enterprises whose product quality and prices were superior could not update their equipment because of unfair market competition, and government policies that penalized frontrunners. They lacked sufficient reserve strength, and thus could not become strongly competitive. The Effect on the Textile Industry GATT re-entry will open opportunities for the textile industry. 1. The international climate for textile product exports will improve. International competition in textiles is currently very intense. Trade protectionism by all countries is very severe. Currently, China's foreign trade is conducted through bilateral negotiations. Since textile exports are frequently limited by various tariff and non-tariff barriers in developed countries, China's exports are at a competitive disadvantage internationally. For example, the United States pressures China with most favored nation treatment, and it employs the "301" provisions to retaliate against China's textile exports. Following GATT restoration, in principle, China will unconditionally enjoy most favored nation treatment. All trade barriers will be greatly reduced; trade among signatory nations will become freer; and the international climate for China's textile exports will improve. 2. GATT re-entry will set the stage for textiles to open new markets. Most of China's textile exports today go to Hong Kong, Japan, the EC and the United States. Exports to these countries and territories account for the lion's share of all of China's textile exports. Relatively speaking, future potential is not very great for the expansion of textile product exports in these main sales markets. United States Department of Commerce Statistics show that China has become the largest supplier of textiles to the United States, accounting for 13.9 percent of the total. It ranks second in money terms at 12.6 percent. In 1990, China ranked third as a supplier of textiles to the EC. Therefore, expansion of China's textile exports will require great efforts to open markets in other countries and territories. GATT re-entry provides the possibility of opening a new, more diversified, multilateral trade pattern for China's textiles. 3. Portion of China's textile exports may increase. During the period of transition from the Multi-Fiber Arrangement [MFA] to GATT integration, the accompanying quotas on kinds and percentages will be gradually abolished, and surplus textile allocations will gradually increase. The year-by-year percentage increase in allocations according to provisions of the new agreement will be 16 percent between 1993 and 1995, 25 percent between 1996 and 1999, and 27 percent between 2000 and 2002. At this rate, the actual allocation will increase 1.3-fold within 10 years. Thus, following GATT re-entry, China should enjoy the benefit of a gradual increase in its textile and clothing quota. It must be noted that this is a theoretically calculated rate of increase. Numerous factors affect export growth, and they must be completely analyzed to make a scientific prediction. Actual quota increase can also only be obtained through intense market competition. In addition, the new agreement also provides for integration of 12 percent of textile imports between 1993 and 1995, integration of 17 percent between 1996 and 1999, and integration of 18 percent between 2000 and 2002. China may compete equally with other signatory nations in the integrated textiles and clothing trade. This will also provide China an opportunity to expand textile exports. 4. The 10-year MFA transition period provides conditions for readjustment of China's textile industry and wins time for technological transformation. During the textiles and clothing export trade integration process, fierce competition will occur in the world textile market. The key to successful competition lies in the technological transformation of the textile industry. Ability to apply high technology to the production of high quality, high grade, high added value products is decisive in competing successfully. At the present time, the technological level of China's textile industry lags far behind that of developed countries and territories. Top priority matters include transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, orienting toward domestic and international markets, readjusting the industrial structure and the product mix, spurring technical progress, and accelerating technological transformation. However, these things require a process of development. The MFA to GATT 10 year transition period provides conditions for China's textile industry to adjust and gain time for transformation. The above opportunities are premised on solution to GATT re-entry problems. Since the developed countries of Europe and America insist that the Uruguay round (including textiles and clothing) is a total agreement, only GATT signatory nations having the right to take part in textile and clothing transitional plans, this means that this plan applies only to signatory nations within GATT. Currently, 116 countries and territories are full participants in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. China is one of them. Once China rejoins GATT, it will automatically enjoy the rights stipulated in the Uruguay round of negotiations, and it will also be responsible for discharging attendant obligations. Unless China is able to achieve restoration of its signatory status before conclusion of the Uruguay round of negotiations, China's textile and clothing exports will continue to be limited to what can be accomplished through bilateral negotiations. They will be limited by quotas. China has already expressed willingness to sign the complete Uruguay round accord. It is hoped that the negotiations will conclude shortly in order to promote growth of the world economy and trade. This also explains the necessity and urgency for China's GATT re-entry. Of course, immediately following GATT re-entry, especially within a short period, China will have to gradually eliminate import licensing and substantially reduce tariffs; however, poorly competitive businesses and firms in the textile industry will face substantial pressures and threats. The main such trades are as follows: 1. China began to build its chemical fiber industries during the 1960s. Thanks to more than 30 years development, a complete range of such industries has been fashioned. Some fairly large size industries exist. In 1991, China ranked third in the world in chemical fiber production capacity. Conspicuous problems today are the small scale of China's chemical fiber industry, scattered plant sites, numerous production links, many tax rates, fairly antiquated equipment, low labor productivity rates, fairly high costs, not very high product grades, numerous ordinary products, few products meeting special specifications, prices that are higher than in international markets, and lack of competitiveness. Following China's GATT re-entry, the first textile industry to be hurt will be the chemical fiber industry. With the elimination of licenses and the lowering of tariffs, polyester producing enterprises will face losses, the returns of dacron short fiber enterprises will decline further, and new polyester and acrylic fiber plants will be hard hit. 2. Long chemical fiber textiles. During the past several years, China has developed the production of silk-like chemical fiber textiles on a large scale, but in 1991, large amounts of silk-like chemical fiber textiles were still being imported because China could not compete with foreign products on variety or quality, and particularly on price. Once China re-enters GATT, this kind of silk-like chemical fiber will be even harder hit. 3. China's dyeing industry today is not of a proper scale or composition, varieties are few, lots are large, quality and grade are not high, and returns are poor. It does not meet international needs for "small lots, many varieties, and quick delivery." Currently, China's self-sufficiency rate in export clothing lining is fairly low, and the quantity and quality of high grade sanforized products cannot meet domestic clothing industry demand. Much must still be imported. When tariffs are lowered and markets are opened following GATT re-entry, foreign textiles and clothing will enter the domestic consumer market at once. China's dyeing industry will face intense competition and a serious pounding. Effect on Iron and Steel Product Prices 1. The price formation mechanism. After 15 years of reform, China's iron and steel products price control system has changed. Enterprises rather than the state now set prices. This is basically consistent with the market pricing mechanism that GATT requires. However, China's iron and steel products price formation system differs in certain ways from the market system that western countries practice. 2. The iron and steel product price level. Overall, because they are currently pulled by demand, prices of iron and steel products in China are the same or greater than the international market price. For example, the domestic market price for popular goods such as wire rods and steel plate is greater than the international market FOB price. For a time, it was greater than the delivered cost of imported steel. Consequently, since 1993 large quantities of processed steel and scrap steel have been imported. The effect of GATT re-entry on China's steel products price levels will be as follows: 1. It will restrict domestic finished steel market price levels, thereby causing a slide in the price of finished steel products that exceed the delivered cost. Second, most Chinese-produced iron and steel products are less diversified and of poorer quality that the same kinds of products on the international market. This means that, generally speaking, prices of Chinese-produced iron and steel products will be lower than prices of imports. In addition, following GATT re-entry, prices of production elements such as railroad transportation, electric power and coal will rise substantially, thereby increasing iron and steel product production costs. This will affect the overall price level of iron and steel products, and the price structure between different products. Effect on Cement Prices Analysis of the effect of GATT re-entry on cement prices in China, and study of remedies that may be taken requires, first of all, a clarification of the advantages and shortcoming of China's cement industry in a free market. Advantages and disadvantages are comparative. Thus, one cannot generalize. One must make accurate comparisons. Many trades study the effect on domestic industry of GATT re-entry by comparing China's advantages and disadvantages in comparison with their main competitors, the developed nations of Europe and America. Such comparisons are correct, no doubt, but we feel that Chinese cement cannot be compared with cement in Europe and America. This is because many years practice show that we import very little cement from Europe and America, and we will not import much in the future. China exports very little cement to either Europe or the United States today, but the amount may increase in the future. However, a long development process will be required. The Chinese cement industry's main foreign trade competitors are Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. Our main comparative advantages over these countries and territories are as follows: 1) Manpower advantage. China's wage level is only one-tenth or less of theirs. The cement industry is a labor and capital intensive industry. To a very large extent, the cost of labor decides product competitiveness. Rise in the price of a nation's labor cannot arbitrarily exceed the overall level of its economic development. Therefore, the manpower advantage that China's cement industry enjoy is not just for the present, but will continue for a very long time. 2) Energy and raw materials advantage. The cement industry is a high energy consumption industry, and it requires large amounts of non-metallic raw materials such as limestone. By comparison with competitors, China has plentiful reserves of energy, particularly coal, and raw materials such as limestone, which are found over a wide area. China is richly endowed by nature, and prices are relatively cheap. 3) Environmental protection pressures are relatively slight. Since the cement industry is a traditional industry that pollutes the environment to a certain extent and whose technology content is fairly low, during the 1980s, some developed countries and territories began to limit its development or relocation. For example, Japan and Singapore adopted such measures. Relatively speaking, pressures in these regards are not great in China. 4) Transportation and sales advantage. The cement trade is strongly dependent on transportation. Cement must be marketed within a certain radius. Currently, some competitors are able to compete with us in sea transportation; thus, they have entered some coastal areas. However, they will find it difficult to compete with domestic firms in shipping cement long distances into vast inland markets. Relatively speaking, China's cement industry is at a disadvantage in the following respects: 1) The general level of production technology is not high. Most Chinese cement concerns are medium and small enterprises most of whose equipment is antiquated and whose technical strength is weak. Consequently, they lag behind foreign countries in product quality, variety, and resources utilization. In particular, the variety and character of the cement they produce lacks diversity. It does not meet the construction industry's development needs. 2) Plant size is relatively small. Only one in 100 plants are of large or medium size. This percentage is far lower than for Japan and South Korea, and even lower than for Indonesia and Thailand. Failure to increase the benefits of scale is bound to increase difficulties in lowering costs. 3) A not entirely rational dispersal of the industry, and poorly developed transportation means that cement is in short supply in some coastal areas where much cement is used, while supply is greater than demand in inland areas. This affords opportunities for imported cement. 4) Psychological effect. Chinese prefer foreign goods not just for technological or quality reasons, but for psychological reasons as well. In Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the demand of capital construction projects for cement has increased in recent years, but some projects would rather use high priced imported cement than low priced inland China cement. One important reason for this is greater confidence about the quality of imported cement and that contracts will be honored. Ultimately, all of the foregoing factors are reflected in price. In accordance with the principles of free trade that GATT follows, following GATT re-entry domestic and foreign firms will compete on equal conditions. Survival of the fittest will depend on quality, price, and sales service. China's advantage in future development lies in price, which it will continue to maintain. Its disadvantage lies in development problems, which efforts are being made to solve. Therefore, prospects are fairly optimistic. Effect on Export Prices Following GATT re-entry, China's commodity export trade climate will improve greatly. Applicable GATT provisions will provide forable conditions and effective protection for China's exports. They will provide China vast export opportunities manifested in the following specific ways: 1. Following GATT re-entry, in accordance with the most favored nation treatment provisions and the general preference system principles, China will enjoy tremendous tariff concessions from GATT member states. During the past more than 40 years, all member nations have conducted tariff concession discussions under GATT auspices, the tariff level of developed nations falling from 50 to 4.7 percent. The tariff level of developing countries has also fallen commensurately to 13.5 percent. Once China is a GATT member, more of its export commodities will enjoy preferential tariffs to a greater degree, and no longer will there be general tariffs. There is a wide gap between preferential tariff rates and general tariff rates; thus, this will greatly increase the price competitiveness of China's exports. This will mean that China's low cost and low price advantages can be more fully exploited. It will also lower export costs, improve export returns, and stimulate export growth, providing opportunities for exports that could not otherwise be exported because of overly high tariffs. This will enable more of China's goods to enter international markets. 2. Following GATT re-entry, China will receive most favored nation treatment from more countries and territories. Thus, its export channels will increase, and its export area will expand. At present, China's export area is relatively concentrated. Only 21 countries and territories provide general preference system treatment to China. Once China has re-entered GATT, we can use the GATT negotiating arena to conduct wideranging talks and negotiations with nearly 100 GATT member nations. We can use GATT's most favored nation treatment provisions and general preference system principles to obtain most favored nation treatment from more countries and territories. Thus, our goods can be exported to more countries and regions. Widening of the market will permit greater latitude in setting prices of China's exports. We will be able to chose markets over a wider area that will accept higher priced exports. 3. Consultation, mediation, and resolution of disputes are the basic tasks of GATT. After restitution of China's signatory nation status, with the help of GATT's mediation mechanism, China will be able to use international law as a basis for impartial resolution of trade disputes, the elimination of prejudice against China's exports, and improvement of China's position in trade negotiations. In recent years, some western nations have used the low prices of China's exports as a pretext for leveling dumping charges. They have instituted "anti-dumping investigations" and levied anti-dumping sales taxes that have caused great losses for China's export trade. Once China's GATT status has been restored, it will be able to refer such unreasonable charges to GATT for equitable resolution in accordance with prescribed procedures. This will ensure the development of China's foreign trade exports and safeguard China's economic trade interests. 4. Following GATT re-entry, China can use GATT's information system to obtain more international trade information and intelligence. In addition, it can engage in bilateral exchanges with other GATT signatories for an expansion of economic information sources and channels. Thus, China will be able to more frequently, more quickly, and more completely understand international market development trends, particularly international market price information. It will be able to scientifically determine kinds of exports and export price levels, and to rationally formulate export policy and make price competition decisions. Recovery of its GATT seat will provide China's foreign trade exports excellent opportunities, but it will also pose stricter requirements. We will have to abide strictly by international regulations in export practice, and strictly enforce the provisions of GATT articles. Of all the GATT provisions, the ones that have the greatest effect on exports are the "dumping and anti-dumping" and the "subsidy and anti-subsidy" provisions. Dumping is a form of unfair competition. GATT has provisions forbidding dumping, and it holds that an anti-dumping sales tax of a certain amount may be levied on dumped goods. Anti-dumping has a direct effect on the prices of China's exports. On the one hand, because of the strict provisions, once China has re-entered GATT, it will protest our legal rights and regular exports. It will prevent unreasonable accusations against China's dumping of goods. On the other hand, it will require that China's exports be handled strictly according to international standards. When setting export prices, we will have to be scientific and reasonable. When a low price is used to compete, a limit must be set. The price cannot be lower than normal value (i.e. a price comparable to the one for the same product consumed in the home country under normal circumstances, or the highest comparable price for the same product exported to a third country under normal trading circumstances, or the production cost plus a reasonable sales expense and profit in the home country). Since reform and opening to the outside world, China has frequently been accused of dumping by western countries. This has occasioned very great losses for China's export trade. This sounds a warning for China's exports following GATT re-entry. If an anti-dumping sales tax is levied, this will not be just a matter of loss or gain from buying and selling but may well result in the community being blocked from future exports of that product, which would seriously damage the development of China's exports.
