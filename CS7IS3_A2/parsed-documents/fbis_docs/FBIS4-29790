FBIS4-29790 "dreas119_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 South Korea `Cool Reaction' From Seoul `Cool Reaction' From Seoul SK2106140994 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network in Korean 1210 GMT 21 Jun 94 SK2106140994 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network Korean BFN [Text] The government, which is pushing for a North-South summit at an early date, had a cool reaction to the remarks of Mrs. Mutsuko Miki, wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki, on North Korean President Kim Il-song expressing the hope for a North-South summit on 15 August. This is because President Kim Il-song's remarks conveyed by Mrs. Miki are not an official response to our side's proposal made on 20 June, even if his remarks are true, and because 15 August is not an early date, as President Kim conveyed to Carter. This being the case, the government, paying no attention to this for the moment, has begun to work out concrete plans for realizing a North-South summit at an early date. Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of unification, met this morning with Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for security and diplomatic affairs, and shared the view that the government should strive to realize a North-South summit by mid-July. Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku then discussed measures for the convocation of the summit with Song Yong-tae, vice unification minister; and Chong Si-song, director of the secretariat for North-South talks. They came to a conclusion that the North Korean attitude of continuing to slander the South without responding to our side's proposal makes us doubt its true intention. However, our side should not necessarily regard this as a pessimistic signal. A relevant government official pointed out that considering past practice, it is very likely that North Korea will make a counterproposal and suggest a later date than the one we proposed. This notwithstanding, if North Korea does not attempt to drag on the issue of agenda items during a preliminary contact, the convocation of talks before mid-July would not be difficult. This official also noted that either Seoul or Pyongyang could possibly be the venue for the talks rather than Panmunjom or a third country. However, even if the North Korean side wants to designate a third place within the Korean peninsula, this will not work as a factor that would drag on time.
