[Tomovski] This summer, the second free multiparty elections are scheduled for Macedonia. A short but significant period of time has elapsed since the first elections in developing a democratic environment in our country. It has been assessed in various ways: According to some, we are living in a time of radical democratic developments; according to others, the old still prevails, and what we have now is nothing but simulated democracy. What is your reaction to the democratic processes? [Andov] The development of democratic processes in our country was determined by their nature. However, because of particular circumstances, they did not affect several areas. To begin with, the changes that occurred turned out to be so big and so significant that the political parties and their leaderships were unable to project any further programmatic development. Now, in a period of tremendous change in the history of the Macedonian people and of Macedonia as a state, there have been several minor programmatic changes made by the parties, although the foundations of society have radically changed. This is an indication that the new processes do not enjoy firm party and political support within the democratic infrastructure. Other problems may be found in the governmental institutions, the parliament, and so forth. Despite all the pressures and the great results it was able to achieve, considering the correlation of forces, obviously there was a certain area the parliament was unable to penetrate: Reform and reorganization of the administration of the state. The present administration meets the conditions that existed in a socialist society, at a time when Macedonia was, as a republic, a structural part of another state. There has been a substantial stagnation in the restructuring of the state. It should have been followed with its conversion to a developed market economy, privatization, reprivatization, denationalization, and so forth. [Tomovski] Can you indicate more specifically the areas in which state reform is difficult to accomplish? [Andov] To this day we do not have a Ministry of Foreign Affairs but a Ministry of Relations with Foreign Countries. Our classifications and legal resolutions still lack legal foundations for appointing ambassadors, replacing them, and so on. This is absurd, for the Constitution makes such decisions possible. We pointed out the reorganization of the Public Bookkeeping Service. However, the existing atmosphere surprised us: We did not see any understanding of the urgent need for the modern financial institutions. We raised this question with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is inconsistent with today's demands and needs of society. From time to time it works according to the old system and acts in a way consistent with the time and the society of the past. Ignoring the Law on Financial Inspections and others, on a parallel basis, financial inspections are conducted at the Ministry of Police, which is totally against the law. We need a reorganization of state reserves, in accordance with our stance as an independent country. In my view, there is insufficient dynamism in terms of introducing changes and promoting democratic processes. This includes the media, which are failing to promote the basic features of democratic changes as was done at the start of pluralism, at the time when we were separating ourselves from Yugoslavia. They and the journalists display little feeling for the new, for taking a risk, and for achieving a breakthrough. This, however, may be naturally the result of the problems I mentioned. That is why the forthcoming elections will be a challenge to the political forces, to the forces pledged to a further democratic breakthrough, and to a stable executive power with a clear program. [Tomovski] In a certain way the "103" elections became a test of what we may expect in the autumn. Or, at least, that is the way they are being interpreted. They are subject to the constant critical look of parties and candidates from the opposition, who participated in them. The criticism can be formulated as "the impossibility in Macedonia to win an election democratically." What are the democratic guarantees that will ensure fair play and a democratic struggle in the autumn? [Andov] I would rather not discuss the objections voiced by the opposition. I know, however, from worldwide practical experience, that those who do not succeed keep interfering and criticizing, which is natural. Last summer there were disagreements about the electoral laws. There was even hostility toward those who did not think that the laws must be passed immediately and such individuals were even accused of not considering the good of the state and being opposed to the elections. That is why the government was right to revoke the draft laws and ensure the application of regular procedures. This offers us greater opportunities in terms of the Council of Europe, from which we asked for experts to assess our laws. The same request was made to several U.S. institutions. This is a guarantee that we shall pass laws providing for fair and free elections. On the basis of these laws we shall ask international observers to monitor the full elections. Otherwise, what happened in relation to the "103" was an attack on democracy, for methods alien to the democratic struggle were used. The representative of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] openly threatened violence. Representatives of the Democratic Party used the method of unsubstantiated and one-sided statements concerning the various parties and attacked the integrity of individuals with a view to compromise them. A democratic electoral atmosphere must be one of struggle but a struggle for party programs, a struggle among the capabilities of the candidates and their intellectual and political power. [Tomovski] However it is being pointed out to you that once again there are manipulations in the passing of laws, and the parliamentary session has been extended. All of this is in order to help the governmental coalition acquire better electoral conditions for itself. [Andov] It was the parties that requested the extension. We have never had any greater cooperation and understanding among the parties about the laws as we do now. There have been many proposals and many suggestions. The new laws are now, virtually for the first time, being formulated in a real pluralistic atmosphere. I believe that we shall be able to pass real laws for free elections and a fair electoral struggle. [Tomovski] Now that we are on the verge of elections it has been remarked, concerning the suggested model of proportional majority, that it will not provide a true political picture of Macedonia in the next parliament. [Andov] In all countries the political picture remains within the framework of its basic purposes and needs at that specific period. If in the forthcoming period we need a stable authority in Macedonia, clearly we have no interest in letting a number of small parties enter parliament, with two or three representatives, and so on. For in that case it would be impossible to secure the existence of a legislative body with the required political weight needed to create a stable and responsible executive authority. We have about 60 political parties. Does anyone truly think that there are 60 real options for Macedonia? Therefore, this is a rustic, folkloric, carnival, country fair atmosphere rather than a true reflection of the need for political development of the state. [Tomovski] The parliament is one of the key factors of parliamentary democracy. It is a member of the Interparliamentary Union. At the same time, however, the parliament is being constantly criticized by the public and by the political parties. What is its real position in terms of the two extremes in such assessments? [Andov] I think that our parliament functions in accordance with European standards. The problems appeared wherever a two-thirds majority was required. I believe that the Assembly established itself as the central legislative and political institution in the period between the two elections. At the same time, it took all the steps required for the functioning of an independent state. The criticism on the part of the public is undifferentiated: It is more a criticism on the part of circles that would like the work to be done more rapidly and efficiently. However, they forget that the dynamics and efficiency of the work depend above all on the correlation of political forces. Another criticism comes from the nonparliamentary parties. They are displeased for being outside the parliament. In all countries such parties play no role in society. The fact that in Macedonia the opposite is taking place is probably the result of our inexperience and the fact that, according to some, they could not become members of parliament within the first electoral period was a mistake. [Tomovski] What are the chances that the new basic laws that so far have not been passed by the parliament may be passed before the start of the new elections? [Andov] I mentioned the administration of the state. This includes justice. I believe that despite all efforts it would be impossible in this parliament to rally 80 votes for any given project. It is impossible to have 80 votes, given the breakdown of political forces. [Tomovski] Almost half of the townships in the Republic of Macedonia are not functioning for a variety of reasons. However, it is a fact that the people are having problems in their daily life. Yet the most important law on local self-government was not passed. [Andov] Obviously, there are difficulties concerning the functioning of the townships given the absence of regulations in that area. The old regulations and statutory laws remain along with some government resolutions. However, there has been no definitive solution based on the Constitution. The law on local self-government was not passed. However, there are townships without a township assembly. Otherwise, all townships function one way or another. It would be better to pass a law on local self-government. It is obvious, however, that we have included in this law an excessive number of problems to be resolved. This includes interethnic relations. However, disputes concerning the law do not pertain to local self-government but to other issues which this law must resolve. Its passing was delayed by the government for a variety of disagreements, which point at the nature of the demands raised with the amendments. The government determined that the nature of the amendments makes an 80-vote majority impossible. [Tomovski] Macedonia is developing its own original model of interethnic democracy. However, the political parties of the various nationalities are dissatisfied and are also the result of their internationalization. What is your view of Macedonian interethnic conditions? [Andov] The main directions in resolving problems of interethnic relations are formulated in the Constitution and we do not have to exceed such frameworks or such methods in resolving them. There is no need for redefining interethnic relations. Those who think that by making statements abroad a somewhat different picture of the actual situation may be created are playing the wrong card. I believe that such problems are of no threat to Macedonia. [Tomovski] According to the Constitution, the classical division of powers exists in Macedonia. How do you assess relations among the parliament, the head of state, and the government? [Andov] I believe that a major step was taken with the constitutional resolutions according to which the executive power was granted to the government and the president. A more secure future and a more stable democratic development demand that some basic state interests be closely tied to the president's power. That is why we need a stronger presidential authority. This can be seen in other democratic countries as well. In my view, the present division of powers between the president and the government is not the best possible. Some changes must be made in the exercise of presidential power in order to achieve a better stability in the executive branch. This also means reciprocal responsibility. The parliament can and does have the right to replace the president. However, the possibility must be contemplated also of disbanding the parliament by the president. This would strengthen responsibility and the balance of power. Presently, the power is not balanced. At one point, the parliament made the president of the Republic equal to the parliamentarians. In my view there is no country in which one drags the name and the functions of the president in current party quarrels, involving ordinary demands. Respect must be shown for the institutions. The government is something different. Within this period of time the situation in Macedonia has somewhat changed, and we believe that this must be taken into consideration. [Tomovski] Is this not in line with the criticism precisely of the fact that Macedonia is slowly abandoning the basic definition of parliamentary democracy and switching to a presidential system? [Andov] A parliamentary democracy exists also wherever there is a presidential system. We cannot say that there is no parliamentary democracy in France today. A parliamentary democracy should not have any features of self-government and views about some kind of plebeian democracy, a democracy of the streets. Such a democracy cannot be considered a government. It cannot govern and administer the state. It may be of some importance but only in the course of establishment of the state. Otherwise, once it is established, there must be a variety of institutions with a variety of duties. [Tomovski] The involvement of history in European political life is being condemned. However, of late efforts are being to patch former Yugoslavia together; an orthodox association is being created. This includes the intention of involving Macedonia. [Andov] Europe and the rest of the world have tried everything possible in this area. They tried to have different states and in Croatia and Bosnia people started fighting and do not know how to stop it. The appearance of a variety of ideas cannot be blocked. It is quite important for the world to have a clear view of our position concerning each one of these ideas. We have proved, among others, that our withdrawal from former Yugoslavia indicates that this is a way of preventing the war. This proved that this was a right step to take. Of the current options available in Europe this proved to be the right one. That is why we should not be afraid of ideas expressing the despair of some circles. What matters is that we have a clear line well-known to the world. For the time being we are succeeding and I believe that we shall succeed in the future in making it known to all.
