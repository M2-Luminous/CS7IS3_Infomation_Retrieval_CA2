Hosokawa said Sunday he will deliver a policy speech to the Diet probably on March 7 instead of Friday as earlier planned. The remark appeared to mean that the prime minister will continue talks on a cabinet shake-up with leaders of seven coalition parties by the end of this week. The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake, however, remain opposed to an early cabinet reshuffle. Takemura, appearing Sunday on NHK-TV's "Political Debate" talk show, said he thinks a reshuffle is desirable around two months later from now after seeing the fiscal 1994 budget pass the Diet around early May. But Takemura said it is finally up to the prime minister to decide whether to shake up the cabinet and that he will not oppose Hosokawa's decision. Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a core party in the ruling coalition, which has pushed for an early cabinet reshuffle, indicated having second thoughts on the reshuffle, political sources said. On the same NHK-TV program, senior Shinseito official Kozo Watanabe said, "it's one idea that the present cabinet should be in office until the passage of fiscal 1994 budget through the Diet," expected in May. Watanabe, however, reiterated Shinseito's position to support Hosokawa if he decides to reorganize the nearly seven-month-old cabinet. Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaking at a news conference in the central Japan city of Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, said Hosokawa should swiftly reshuffle the cabinet if he really thinks it necessary. "It is a problem for us to continue lengthy discussions like this," Hata said. Hata, also deputy prime minister, said, "it should be done as early as possible if Prime Minister Hosokawa judges it necessary at any cost." Meanwhile, a top official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDP) said Sunday "a cabinet shake-up may be physically difficult" because of tight political schedules ahead. The SDPJ official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said "a reshuffle cannot be done in one day even if the prime minister wants to do so." Hosokawa has said that he may reshuffle the cabinet after the passage of a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the enactment of amendments to political reform legislation. The 2.19 trillion yen extra budget became law on Wednesday, while the amended package for political reform laws is expected to pass the Diet as early as Thursday. On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers will give policy speeches to both houses of the legislature on March 7. Many sources in the coalition have said the planned cabinet shake-up is aimed at removing Takemura from the post of chief cabinet secretary which serves as the top government spokesman and chief of staff for the prime minister. Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have differed over several important political themes, first on the partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent "national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption tax, political sources said. SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking on "Political Debate" and on TV Asahi's "Sunday Project" talk show, called for a summit among leaders of the seven ruling parties before Hosokawa reshuffles the cabinet. "It is natural to seek consensus through talks among the parties to strengthen the foundation of the coalition government," Murayama said. The head of the largest party of the coalition reiterated that a reshuffle targeted at a specific minister "smells something like a power struggle" and that "this is not the time to carry out a cabinet reshuffle."
