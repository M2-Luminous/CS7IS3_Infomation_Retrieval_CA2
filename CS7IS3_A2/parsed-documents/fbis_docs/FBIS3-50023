Both parties accepted the idea that an optimum solution had to suit people on both sides of the border, they said. The fourth and last disputed area -- the Kasarna recreation grounds -- is yet to be discussed by the two countries' premiers. In keeping with petitions by the people who live there, the ministers recommend that the Slovak village Sidonia be joined with the Czech Republic and, conversely, the U Sabotu neighborhood be joined with Slovakia. The 123 hectares acquired by the Czech Republic as a result of the straightening of the course of the river Morava will be compensated for by an extra area of U Sabotu and a railway station near Vrbovce. On the basis of the two ministers' recommendations, a national frontier bill is to be drawn up for consideration in the parliaments of their respective countries.
