FR941031-0-00007 FR941031-0-00002 The recommended salable quantity of 811,516 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil (an increase of 88,190 pounds), combined with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 145,809 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 957,325 pounds. Similarly, the recommended salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of 195,103 pounds), combined with the revised June 1, 1994, carry-in of 19,139 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 1,306,819 pounds. The revised available supplies of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil, respectively, are approximately 67,000 pounds and 227,000 pounds higher than the respective annual average of sales for the past five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand for both classes of oil will be adequately met with the recommended increase. The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that allotment percentages of 46 percent and 66 percent, respectively, should be established for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. These percentages will provide an increased salable quantity of 811,516 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil and an increased salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed, final, and interim final rules in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is found that to revise ยง985.213 to change the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) This interim final rule increases the quantities of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately; (2) the committee recommended this rule a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportuntnity to provide input; and (3) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
