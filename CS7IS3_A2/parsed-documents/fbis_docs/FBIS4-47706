W. de Klerk, on Sunday [1 May] evening said he was optimistic the NP would do better than had been indicated by the polls so far. At an impromptu press conference outside the NP federal offices in Pretoria, President de Klerk told reporters it was clear at this stage there would be two parties to qualify for deputy presidencies -- the NP and the African National Congress. But, said Mr de Klerk, there had been many complaints about irregularities and according to the NP these had been widespread. This was a matter of great concern and would be taken up with the Independent Electoral Commission and the various political parties, Mr de Klerk said. "I'm as anxious and frustrated as the public to see things come to a conclusion," he added.
