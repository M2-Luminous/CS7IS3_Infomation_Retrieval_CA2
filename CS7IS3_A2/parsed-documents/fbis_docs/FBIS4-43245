On a visit to Lille, the prime minister announced that, within two weeks, he would be presenting a "plan of action for the next six months" with a view to "stepping up the effort to boost economic recovery in the country." Unlike the January plan aimed at boosting consumption, which was preceded by several interministerial meetings, it would appear that the prime minister's office has not prepared a new catalog of measures in consultation with the various ministers. This time, the message is essentially a political one. Edouard Balladur will set a date "on the major topics to be decided on this autumn," explained someone from his entourage. For him there can be no question of allowing the result of the European elections to disrupt his own political agenda and lead anyone to think that his government is rejecting any reforms. These major topics, he said, concern "youth, health insurance, the fight against the budget deficit, the choice to be made between lowering taxes and social security charges," just to cite economic and social issues. Better Targeting Will the government adopt new measures aimed at recovery? Nothing could be less certain given the strong budgetary constraints in force. Furthermore, people at the Economics Ministry say that recent surveys on the state of the economy conducted among company bosses and households demonstrate a very clear-cut boost in confidence. Moreover, it was emphasized that the result of the last study, carried out last week by the INSEE [National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies] and focusing on households, was "excellent." The fact remains that the success of the "scrap premium" adopted in January in an attempt to relaunch the automotive industry is leaving some people rather envious. There are many sectors serving a large consumer market, such as clothing, toys, or furniture, that would like to benefit in turn from a nudge in the right direction. Consequently, the CLIMO (Liaison Committee for Manpower Industries), which represents more than 1 million jobs, is asking for "better targeting of back-to-school grants" for September. Moreover, it wants employee ownership of companies to be encouraged in order to stimulate consumer spending, as was done in the automobile and housing sectors last January. Yesterday, Edouard Balladur contented himself with making a gesture in the direction of the textile and clothing industries. He confirmed a program aimed at helping companies in this sector to develop foreign markets and promote their products. However, the textile and clothing sector is seeing two further demands remain unfulfilled, namely the demand that work hours be calculated on an annual basis and, more importantly, that social security taxes be reduced. While hailing France's foreign trade performance last year, which "enabled us to preserve 100,000 jobs," Edouard Balladur has found a new "carrot" aimed at encouraging companies to hire more workers. Accordingly, he announced a new measure according to which small- and medium-sized companies which recruit an employee in an "export" department will receive a cash advance from the COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade]. This advance will amount to 260,000 French francs [Fr] for companies with a turnover under Fr300 million, and Fr300,000 for those with sales totaling between Fr300 million and Fr3 billion.
