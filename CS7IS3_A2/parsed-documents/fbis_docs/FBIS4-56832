Of course, they are our neighbors, and we want to have very close, cordial, and helpful relations with them. [Duran] What will be your position vis-a-vis the United States? [Perez Balladares] One of respect. I believe the Torrijos-Carter Treaties are our best references. We, as well as the United States, know that respect is the best way to ensure good relations and that the implementation of and compliance with those treaties are fundamental to positive relations between our countries. [Duran] Is it true that Panama is a U.S. puppet? [Perez Balladares] No, God forbid. We, however, do have many joint interests in the Panama Canal enterprise. Those interests will continue, but with the difference that the Canal will now be managed entirely by Panamanians. No, Panama is not a U.S. puppet. [Duran] Does the United States influence the government in any way? [Perez Balladares] The current government? [Duran] Yes. [Perez Balladares] Well, you will have to ask the president that question. In my administration, there will be a great deal of respect and consideration, but no influence. [Duran] Do you see any political future for [presidential candidate Ruben] Blades? [Perez Balladares] I believe that, in addition to youth, some political experience is required, and Ruben, who is my friend and whose music I enjoy, does not have it. I, of course, offer him the opportunity to acquire this experience during my government.
