Minister/State Secretary Murdiono briefed newsmen on the outcome of the talks between the two leaders. [Begin Murdiono recording] As scheduled, President Suharto held talks with his guest Ruud Lubbers this morning. President Suharto was accompanied by the minister/state secretary and the foreign minister, while Prime Minister Lubbers was accompanied by the Netherlands foreign minister. The talks, which covered a wide range of topics, lasted for quite some time. Here is a summary of what they discussed: The talks concentrated on bilateral, regional, and international issues. President Suharto gave a general explanation of Indonesia's development proposals, strategy, and target under the first 25-year long-term development master plan which has been completed, and the development target under the second long-term development master plan. President Suharto explained to Lubbers in detail about our national development achievements so far which provided a basis to enter the next development phase, which is known locally as the take-off period. This period is known as the second era of national awakening. The president also explained in detail our achievements in creating and maintaining national stability to support economic growth and to provide an equal distribution of wealth to the people. Prime Minister Lubbers expressed high appreciation for Indonesia's development achievements during the talks with President Suharto. He was amazed by President Suharto's ability to provide accurate figures on all topics. The head of state also briefed Lubbers on Indonesia's ideas on the role of the Nonaligned Movement, NAM, and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. Meanwhile, Lubbers also told President Suharto about developments taking place in Europe. After explaining in detail Indonesia's development achievements so far and the government's plans for the future, President Suharto then invited Netherlands businessmen to participate in infrastructure development such as the construction of an electric generating station, and telecommunications and port facilities here on a build, operate, transfer basis because Indonesia has a limited capability to develop such areas of infrastructure independently. President Suharto also asked Netherlands investors to set up joint ventures with Indonesian businessmen by utilizing resources available in the country. He said the products can be marketed in Europe as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. [passage omitted] Also today, President Suharto offered the Netherlands, a developed country, to contribute efforts to solve the foreign debt problem faced by Third World nations. [passage omitted] President Suharto also extended an invitation to the Netherlands to join South-South cooperation, which according to his own concept is within the framework of tripartite cooperation. Briefly, it is difficult to promote cooperation among countries in the South due to limited funds available in some countries. Indonesia has vast experience in achieving self-sufficiency in rice production and it has accordingly offered to share its experience with several African countries. This is intended to enable African farmers to know clearly about what we do here, and it will be possible if they come to Indonesia and live with our farmers. However, Africa does not have enough funds to send its farmers here and at the same time we cannot afford to bring them here. Under such a situation, we hope that a third party -- a developed country -- will sponsor the program. This is what President Suharto meant by tripartite cooperation. In his response, Prime Minister Lubbers said that the Netherlands is willing to promote bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy and investment because his country has the capability to do so. At the same time, Lubbers also said that there should be cooperation between the Navies of the two countries, both in shipbuilding technology as well as in training personnel. President Suharto welcomed this idea and reiterated that Indonesia is determined to give high priority to economic development besides paying attention to developing security and defense. At the start of their talks, Prime Minister Lubbers conveyed greetings from Queen Beatrix to President Suharto. [end recording] [passage omitted]
