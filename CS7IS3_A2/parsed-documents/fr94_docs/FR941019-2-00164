FR941019-2-00164 FR941019-2-00088 The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is to establish an oil collection system such that lube oil leakage from potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the RCP lube oil systems will not lead to fire during normal or design basis accident conditions and that there is reasonable assurance that the system will withstand the Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). The licensee's proposed RCP motor lube oil system could not accommodate an oil collection system for collecting potential oil leakage from four specific sites. The staff evaluation of these sites is as follows. The RCP motor lube oil system, with its pumps and associated piping, supply oil to several parts of the RCP. The existing RCP lube oil system includes a high pressure and an induced flow system. The high pressure system consists of two independent pumps, and associated piping, and supplies oil, among other components, to the ARD. The induced flow system is driven by the rotation of the RCP motor and provides lube oil to the thrust bearings, guide bearings, and to the ARD. In the new design, the ARD vents located at the top of each RCP motor would be equipped with demisters. According to the equipment vendor, the ARD vent lines only contain oil mist or foam during startup, shutdown, and normal operation. The demisters are equipped with a filter to prevent lube oil mist from escaping to the atmosphere. Two upper lube oil supply lines provide oil to the ARD from the low pressure lube oil system lift pump during startup and shutdown of the RCP motor. During normal operation, oil is provided to the ARD by the induced flow system. The ARD vents are not part of a pressurized system. Therefore, spray shield protection for mechanical connections is not provided. If leakage were to occur during normal plant operations from the ARD demisters or from the mechanical connections, the oil would run down the side of the torque drum and bearing housing, be collected by a one-inch lip on the bottom of the upper RCP motor bearing housing, and then be channeled to the oil collection drain pan for the upper lube oil cooler. The two upper lube oil supply lines are part of a pressurized system and, therefore, lube oil spray from a leak at a mechanical connection may not be fully captured by this lip and could potentially run down the RCP motor onto hot Reactor Coolant System (RCS) surfaces. The lower RCP motor leak detection system provides detection of water leakage from the RCP motor heat exchanger. Consequently, this system normally contains cooling water. However, oil may enter into the cooling water either from overfilling the lube oil reservoir or from leakage at the lower RCP motor bearing. The mixture of water/oil could potentially leak at the threaded connections of the leak detection system piping and run off onto hot RCS surfaces. It is not expected that this oil/water mixture would represent a fire hazard under these conditions. These lines are not part of a pressurized system and are not provided spray protection for this potential leakage site. The lower guide bearing and oil temperature thermocouples are located near the lower RCP motor bearing housing. Each of these instruments has two threaded connections. One of these connections is at the RCP motor lower bearing oil reservoir and the other is at the outer end of the thermocouple pipe where the thermocouple is inserted into the pipe. These thermocouple connections are located in a non-pressurized portion of the lube oil system and are not provided with spray shields. The innermost connections are located directly over the RCP motor lower oil drain pan and it is expected that leakage from these connections would be captured by the lower drain pan.
