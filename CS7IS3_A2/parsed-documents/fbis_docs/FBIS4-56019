At the beginning of today's session Filip Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], made a statement on behalf of his faction in which he asked Prime Minister Berov to resign. An attempt to repeat the no-confidence vote will be viewed by the SDS deputies as a violation of the Constitution. If this is allowed it will represent a danger for Bulgaria's democracy, Dimitrov said. Replying to the statement, Velko Vulkanov of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] demanded that the 19 May vote on structural and personnel changes in the government be annulled, and asked National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to resign for what Vulkanov described as a violation of parliamentary practice. BSL leader Zhan Videnov assured the hall -- the SDS deputies and Aleksandur Yordanov had already walked out -- that there will be a debate on the draft resolution proposed by the government on a framework agreement with parliament. The political forces that support the cabinet are now holding consultations at the invitation of Prime Minister Berov, who still has not come to the National Assembly. It appears that the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] will participate in the consultations. The deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] are divided. Part of them will probably participate in the consultations, while others demand separate talks with the prime minister.
