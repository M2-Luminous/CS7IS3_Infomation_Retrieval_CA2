The state has just approved construction of the Hongjiadu Hydro-Power Station with a generating capacity of 540,000 kw. Experts calculate that the Wujiang River's abundant hydro-power resources have a total potential capacity of 8.56 million kw for development. At present a 630,000-kw hydro-power station is in operation, another 510,000-kw plant will be completed within the year, and in the long run, a Wujiang hydropower energy base with a total generating capacity of 6.39 million kw will be built up in the coming 25 years. The Wujiang River Valley is rich also in natural resources of coal, aluminium, sulphur, manganese and mercury. The bauxite reserve amounts to 270 million tons, ranking third in China; and its phosphate ore reserve comes to 2.58 billion tons, ranking second in the country. In order to accelerate development of hydro-power resources, the central government and Guizhou Province have also incorporated the Wujiang Hydropower Development Corporation of Guizhou, which will be in charge of construction and operation of nine power stations along the Wujiang River.
