FR940817-2-00027 FR940817-2-00023 Assumptions: The assumptions used in the Assumptions and Methodology Document cover three tiers: Tier 1: Programmatic assumptions reflecting current Department policies and directives. Tier 2: Implementation of site-specific assumptions reflecting a site-specific planning basis. Tier 3: Technical assumptions based on expert knowledge and local conditions. Assumptions will be based on: •When, where, and how spent nuclear fuel will be managed and dispositioned •Technologies and requirements for stabilization (including processing), storage, transport, and licensing •The time frame required for various factors in managing spent nuclear fuel. •Facility lifespan, upgrades, new building, decontamination and decommissioning. Methodology: The Assumptions and Methodology Document is intended to provide a methodology for a relative comparison of costs that could be involved in Department of Energy spent nuclear fuel management. The DOE sites already engaged in spent nuclear fuel management activities will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of utilizing existing facilities and the costs of operating and maintaining those facilities. Certain functions or facilities are not available at all sites under all management strategies and alternatives. Generic facility descriptions and associated costs will be developed to fill the gap between existing and needed facilities. To define the possible spread of costs for each alternative. To the extent practicable, estimates will be based upon historic data; analyses of similar activities and projecting cost to provide estimates for new actions; use of estimates developed in other programs that address some aspect of spent nuclear fuel management; and expert opinion.
