Korean missile. KYODO on Sunday quoted a U.S. weekly, "U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT," that Japan was urging Iran to stop the missile test. In a letter to managing director of the International Department of KYODO news service, the ambassador said the United States has launched a campaign to pressure Japan and other industrial countries to limit their commercial activities with Iran by raising such allegations. "Regarding our nuclear program, as part of its post-war reconstruction, Iran has sought to repair its damaged industrial infrastructure. Major damage was inflicted on Iran's power generation facilities. To deal with this urgent problem and to meet the growing demand of the population, Iran has looked to other sources. Major investments have been made in the past 20 years in nuclear power generation and it is natural to continue and build on these investments for the immediate and prospective power needs of the nation," the ambassador said. "Our nuclear facilities have been visited and inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and their peaceful applications have been verified," said the ambassador.
