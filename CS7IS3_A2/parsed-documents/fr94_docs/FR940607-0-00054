The test pressure for each pressure test conducted under this subpart must be maintained throughout the part of the system being tested for at least 4 continuous hours at a pressure equal to 125 percent, or more, of the maximum operating pressure and, in the case of a pipeline that is not visually inspected for leakage during the test, for at least an additional 4 continuous hours at a pressure equal to 110 percent, or more, of the maximum operating pressure. §195.304 [Amended] 6. In §195.304, in paragraph (a), the word ``hydrostatic'' is removed and the word ``pressure'' is added in its place; and in the introductory text of paragraph (b), the word ``hydrostatically'' is removed and the word ``pressure'' is added in its place. 7. The introductory text of §195.306(b) is revised to read as follows: §195.306 Test medium. * * * * * (b) Except for offshore pipelines and pipelines to be tested under §195.302(c), liquid petroleum that does not vaporize rapidly may be used as the test medium if_ * * * * * §195.308 [Amended] 8. In §195.308, the word ``hydrostatically'' is removed and the word ``pressure'' is added in its place. §195.310 [Amended] 9. In §195.310(a), the word ``hydrostatic'' is removed and the word ``pressure'' is added in its place. 10. In §195.406, in paragraph (a)(3), the word ``hydrostatically'' is removed and the word ``pressure'' is added in its place; and paragraph (a)(5) is revised to read as follows: §195.406 Maximum operating pressure. (a) *␣*␣* (5) For pipelines under §§195.302(b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) that have not been pressure tested under subpart E of this part, 80 percent of the test pressure or highest operating pressure to which the pipeline was subjected for 4 or more continuous hours that can be demonstrated by recording charts or logs made at the time the test or operations were conducted. * * * * * Issued in Washington, DC, on May 27, 1994.
