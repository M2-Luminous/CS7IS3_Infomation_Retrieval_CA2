The ambassador said later that on the instructions of the Russian leadership he had requested a meeting with the League's secretary general to exchange views on the latest developments in Yemen. He pointed out that Russia and the League are cooperating and coordinating their stance on resolving the Yemeni crisis, noting that this cooperation takes a diplomatic and political form. The Russian ambassador explained that when the war broke out, his country appealed to the warring parties in Yemen to stop fighting and initiate a dialogue to solve their problems. Polyakov pointed out that Russia's recognition of south Yemen will depend on the findings included in UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the crisis. He denied reports claiming that Russia is supplying south Yemen with weapons and assistance in view of the close ties linking Moscow with south Yemen in the past. He said Russia halted all weapons supplies to the Yemeni parties when the Yemeni crisis began and before fighting broke out.
