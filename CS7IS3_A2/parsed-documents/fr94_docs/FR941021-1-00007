FR941021-1-00007 FR941021-1-00002 Specifically, Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;890.400 by cross-referencing a Utah self-insurance statutory provision at Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.) 63&hyph;30&hyph;28. This provision authorizes governmental entities to purchase liability or liability self-insurance, and to establish trust accounts for self-insurance. Utah's proposed revision at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;890.400 reads as follows, with the italicized language representing wording that is being added to the existing rule, and the capitalized language in brackets representing wording that is being deleted. 890.400‚ê£The Division [of Oil, Gas and Mining] may accept from the applicant, in lieu of a certificate for a public liability insurance policy, satisfactory evidence from the applicant that it satisfies applicable state self-insurance requirements Section 63&hyph;30&hyph;28, U.C.A. [Approved as part of the state program] and the requirements of R645&hyph;301&hyph;890.100 through R645&hyph;301&hyph;890.300. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program. 1. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. 2. Public Hearing Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT by 4:00 p.m., m.d.t., November 7, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions. The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish to testify have been heard. 3. Public Meeting If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting by contacting the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT . All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed under ADDRESSES .
