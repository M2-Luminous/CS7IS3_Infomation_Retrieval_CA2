According to Serebrennikov, Zhirinovskiy intends radically to limit his trips abroad in the future. The LDP leader decided not to travel to Slovakia under the impression of his visit to Saratov on Wednesday [18 May] where, according to Serebrennikov, he saw with his own eyes the dramatic situation the country finds itself in. "Factories are standing still, people have not received any wages since January, a social explosion is looming. Vladimir Volfovich reached the conclusion that his task is now to tour Russian cities and to talk to the people there so that, when the situation comes to a head tomorrow, they are able to orient themselves and seek a solution in support of the LDP," Serebrennikov said. According to the LDP press secretary, the trip to Slovakia has not been postponed but canceled. In the foreseeable future, there will not be a single opening in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's busy schedule. [passage omitted] [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 May on pages 1 and 2 carries a 500-word Vladimir Jancura, Boris Latta report, entitled "Visit Postponed Again," which provides a different explanation for the cancellation of Zhirinovskiy's visit to Slovakia. According to the report, Bratislava lawyer Jozef Lauko, who describes himself as "Zhirinovskiy's friend of long standing," told the PRAVDA reporters that three members of Zhirinovskiy's entourage "had problems with their travel documents. It seems that the 'AB-Sluzhebnaya' stamp, identifying holders of official passports, was missing in them." Lauko voices the assumption that the three men in question were Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards and that "for understandable reasons, the party leadership did not permit Mr. Zhirinovskiy to travel without bodyguards."]
