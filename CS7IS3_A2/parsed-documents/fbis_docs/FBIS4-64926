The two government partners of many years, the Liberals and the Conservatives, are deeply divided over allowing wage-earner and pension funds to invest billions of kroner in Danish trade and industry. Conservative leader Hans Engell surprisingly signaled in yesterday's paper that the party is now ready to allow ATP and LD to have more influence: "The wage earners' money is just as good as the firms' own money," Engels said. [passage omitted] Kirsten Jacobsen, the Progress Party's spokesperson on business finances, was "totally unable to comprehend" Engell's turnaround. "He has launched an idea that former Industrial Affairs Minister Anne Birgitte Lundholt, also a Conservative, fought against tooth and nail," she said. Sten Gade, Socialist People's Party (SF) group chairman, cannot understand the Progress Party's opposition because he recalls that the party supported such proposals in Glistrup's day. [passage omitted] Labor Minister Jytte Andersen (Social Democrat) is pleased with the Conservative move because it ensures a broad majority when the ATP and LD law is amended. [passage omitted] The four parties in the government are about to fall into step after some internal discussion. Yesterday BERLINGSKE TIDENDE tried in vain to get a comment from Industrial Affairs Minister Mimi Jakobsen, the leader of the Center Democrats (CD). The party previously opposed raising the investment limit.
