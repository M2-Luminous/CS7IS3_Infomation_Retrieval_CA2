NODONG SINMUN today says this reveals again their treacherous nature in seeking only confrontation and war. The analyst says: A grave situation has been created on the Korean peninsula by the war moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets. While visiting South Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry was closeted with the puppets to examine war preparations and declared that the "Team Spirit" nuclear manoeucres would be resumed in November. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique frequently stage provocative war games of the puppet army including operations for breaking through the Military Demarcation Line. Recently, they checked the reserve ammunition. It is obvious that the "Hwarang" is motivated by a sinister intention to drive not only the puppet army but also para-military forces and inhabitants into war manoeuvres against the North. Through the military exercise, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are seeking to divert the attention of the people elsewhere, save the crisis and justify their policy of confrontation and war. But the days of traitorous regime, estranged by the nation, are numbered.
