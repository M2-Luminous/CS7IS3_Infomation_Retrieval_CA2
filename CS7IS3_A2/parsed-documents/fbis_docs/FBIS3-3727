According to local economic officials, last year the per capita net income of farmers from the province's 70 poverty-hit areas reached 448.9 yuan. Farmers from the province's 37 other major poor areas achieved a per capita net income of over 350 yuan, basically solving the difficulty of having enough to eat and wear. Poverty-stricken areas, which make up two-thirds of Shaanxi's total area and served as revolutionary bases in the past, are mainly located in the province's northern and southern parts, featuring poor natural conditions, inconvenient transportation and slow economic development. Since the early 1980s, the central government, together with the provincial government, has decided to list the province's northern and southern areas as the main targets of the help-the-poor program, and given them great financial support and large quantities of manpower. With the focus on economic development, the program has helped poverty-hit farmers to overcome difficulties and solve the problem of making a living. In carrying out economic development, local farmers pin their hopes on capital construction of agriculture to help them to prosper and have made painstaking efforts towards such development. For instance, by the end of last year, farmers in the province's poverty-hit areas had cultivated about 1.1 million hectares of farmland and had been blessed with grain harvests for many years running. Consequently, northern Shaanxi, which used to suffer serious soil erosion, has brought 30,000 sq [square] km of erosion-prone land and 90 percent of the shifting sands zones (566,667 hectares) under tight control after having adopted a series of measures to carry out comprehensive harnessing work. Moreover, forest and grass cover in the province has been raised from the former 11 percent to the present 36 percent, greatly improving the ecological environment for farming. Local officials from poverty-stricken areas have also made active efforts and have built bases for carrying out diversified economic development in accordance with characteristics of mountainous areas and plateaus, in a bid to form highly efficient pillar industries for various poor localities. In line with market demands, northern Shaanxi has stressed the development of businesses concerning cigarette-making, growing and processing of fruit and potatoes, and breeding of sheep, while southern Shaanxi has laid its focus on the development of products such as tea, fruit, medicine and edible fungus. The efforts have begun to pay off. Statistics show that earnings from diversified economy of northern and southern Shaanxi now makes up 70 percent of their local total output value of agriculture. In the meantime, local officials have made a success of technical popularization and training, greatly improving the general competence of farmers from poverty-hit areas, as well as the level of productive forces in those areas. Over the past few years, governments at provincial, prefectural and county levels have worked closely and have sponsored more than 100,000 training courses of various kinds for poverty-stricken areas, and have established 4,900 exemplary scientific and technological households (centers). At present, the main laborers in 56.7 percent of the rural households from the province's poverty-hit areas have mastered one or two special skills to become prosperous. Poverty-hit areas of the province have also made active efforts to build more rural and township enterprises. The endeavor has generated positive results. Meanwhile, governments at various levels have actively strengthened exchanges of cadres with economically developed provinces and municipalities, injecting great vitality into the economic development and social progress in poverty-hit areas of the province. In addition, 60 departments at provincial level have sent 260 cadres to 53 poor areas of the province to help carry out help-the-poor work. These cadres have helped poor areas launch 197 projects and introduce more than 200 million yuan of outside investment into poor areas.
