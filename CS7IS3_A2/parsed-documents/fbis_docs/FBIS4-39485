A limited partnership, "National Credit" is an authorized bank of the Moscow government. Its founders are the "Olbi" concern, the "Interkoys" joint venture, the "Mezhdunarodnyye Otnosheniya" publishing house, the Savings Bank of Russia, and the "Industriya Service" bank. Its start-up capital is 37 billion rubles. The decision to open a "National Credit" branch in Sevastopol was made under the Russian-Ukrainian agreements on financing for the Black Sea Fleet. Mr. Baranov stated that the bank intends to introduce new types of services on the territory of Ukraine in line with the laws of Ukraine or Crimea depending on which will register it. "National Credit" is to function in Ukraine as a foreign bank whose chartered fund at the time of registration stands at 10 million European Currency Units. If the Russian authorities set the promised 52 billion rubles aside for Sevastopol, the start-up capital of "National Credit" would grow to match this figure. "National Credit" is expected to take the niche of the Dnepropetrovsk "Privat Bank," which up to recently acted as an intermediary in the transfer of Russian money to the Black Sea Fleet. According to bank representatives, the opening of the branch does not signify turning Sevastopol into a ruble zone oasis. It is still not clear in which currency Black Sea Fleet sailors will be paid. The same day a cable came to Sevastopol from Ukraine's Finance Ministry saying that Kiev has set aside for the city a preferential credit to the tune of 50 billion karbovanets.
