Briefing the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee today, Rabin at the same time warned that if there is no peace agreement between Israel and Syria in the next two or three years, he will recommend injecting large sums of money into the Army to prepare for the possibility of war. From the Knesset, David Ze'ev reports: [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] On his way out of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin downplayed the Syrian arms buildup. [passage omitted] But, according to a Knesset official inside the closed-door meeting, the premier sounded a totally different note there. Said Rabin: Since the end of last year, I cannot remember such a large quantity of arms reaching Syria, and of the most advanced type: hundreds of T-72 tanks; not an insignificant number of mobile artillery; and Rabin referred to Russian President Boris Yeltsin saying that Moscow will continue to supply spare military parts to Damascus -- due to the Russian commitment -- and that if the Syrians kept up to their payment schedule of paying off an $11 billion debt, the Russians would supply surface-to-surface SA-10 missiles as well. Rabin also sounded a more ominous note than in last week's statement on a possible war with Syria in the coming years, if there is no peace agreement. Rabin told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee -- following criticism from the opposition on the committee -- that if there is no agreement in two to three years, I would recommend injecting huge amounts of money into the Israel Defense Forces to allow the IDF to prepare for the possibility of war. The prime minister also justified the delay of the donor countries in sending money to the PLO to fund self-rule operations until they know how the moneies will be supervised and to where they will be going. But he hoped for progress when he meets PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Paris next week. [passage omitted] Rabin said he had not invited 'Arafat to visit the Jerusalem holy shrines in his newspaper interviews last weekend, only that he was repeating the policy of previous Israeli Governments of freedom of access to all Muslims and Christians.

The government, he said, is willing to confiscate land to this end, but it is awaiting a ruling by the High Court of Justice on several petitions regarding matters of land in Jerusalem. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister was speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee."]
