He said that President Zeroual gained the support of those attending the dialogue and of various political forces in the country, including those who did not participate in the dialogue. In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Algeria, Khatib said: The political parties that withdrew from the dialogue were seeking to frustrate it. We know what their objectives were. He noted that a draft document on organizing the transitional period was presented for discussion during the dialogue and that all the participating parties and organizations approved it. On the reason for amending the draft document's article on appointing the president, Khatib said: The draft stipulated that the president be chosen by the dialogue and the dialogue committee. In view of the withdrawal of the main parties from the dialogue, it was decided to go back to the Constitution, which gives the Higher Security Council the right to appoint the president. This article was amended in accordance with the Constitution. Commenting on Bouteflika's nomination for the presidency and then his withdrawal, Khatib said: Bouteflika agreed at first to become president and was given all the authority he asked for. But some parties and political forces objected to him, following the leak of his nomination to the press, because he does not stand for breaking with the past, which everyone was looking for. He stressed that the parties and the people expressed full satisfaction with President Zeroual when it was publicly announced that he would be president because of his qualifications to lead the state. On the contacts with the "banned" Islamic Salvation Front, Khatib said that these contacts are continuing and have achieved encouraging and fruitful results. He expressed his hope that during the next stage there will be positive steps to stop the wave of violence in the country.
