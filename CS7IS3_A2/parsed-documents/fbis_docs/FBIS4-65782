Tilt to U.S. Viewed K.I. Angelopoulos comments in the 30 April-1 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI on Prime Minister Papandreou's perceived foreign policy tilt toward the United States to the detriment of the European Union (EU). While Papandreou's entourage was aware he believed that developments in the Balkans brought Athens closer to Washington than to Brussels, the prime minister's recent visit to the United States confirmed his "spectacular" switch, Angelopoulos writes. Papandreou did not hide his satisfaction over the White House "understanding" of the Greek problems. He did not hesitate to express to Greek-American audiences his "bitterness and disappointment" at the lack of "solidarity" on the part of the EU. Following his meeting with President Clinton, Papandreou "exempted" the United States from any responsibility for the Yugoslav tragedy, blaming the EU instead. Angelopoulos comments that these developments are occurring during Greece's term as EU president and wonders whether the Skopje issue will prove "fateful" for Greek-EU relations. It is well-known that the views of a majority of EU partners on Balkan issues do not coincide with those of Athens, Angelopoulos continues. The country's EU partners showed from the start that they did not wish Greece to be the EU "representative" in the Balkans, with Germany, France, Great Britain, "and even Italy" signaling that a "new Balkan order would be their own preserve." Angelopoulos observes that there are risks involved in Papandreou's tilt toward the United States, given that the Greek economy depends to a great extent on EU funds. Trip Results "Positive" According to an editorial in the 25 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Papandreou's meeting with President Clinton produced "rather positive" results, tempered by problems related to the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations. Among the positive developments, the editorial continues, are President Clinton's acknowledgment that Greece is "rightfully" concerned about the Skopje issue; his statement that "we are concerned about the Greek minority in Albania" and his acknowledgment that "Greece is facing the problem with wisdom and discernment"; his expression of interest in the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the Turkish prime minister; and his acknowledgment of Greece's important role in the Balkans. However, the Cyprus issue remains unresolved, with President Clinton assigning responsibility for a solution to his negotiator, and Athens-Ankara relations are still a "puzzle" for the President, with him only wishing for cooperation between the two countries while making no mention of what Turkey should do to achieve it. The visit, the editorial concludes, showed that while further understanding and development of Greek-American relations are possible, reservations should be maintained. Cartoons Lampoon Papandreou Policy Change A cartoon in the 24 April Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA shows a disgruntled Papandreou listening to a beaming President Clinton stating that "Greece can play a leadership role in the Balkans...behind Turkey, Albania, and Skopje." Another cartoon in the 23 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA depicts Papandreou, accompanied by his wife Dhimitra, insistently and plaintively knocking on the White House door, calling "Biiill," after climbing a number of steps, each labeled with slogans progressively more friendly to the United States. The lowest is labeled "Americans, murderers of people," the next "out forever from NATO," then "out with the [U.S.] bases of death," followed by "the struggle is coming into its own," "forward for better days," and "Greek-American business." <graphic> </graphic>
