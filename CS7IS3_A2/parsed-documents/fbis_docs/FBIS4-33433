The Colombians will be in charge of preparing this outstanding event. Before being selected, however, they had to sidestep several obstacles preventing Latin America from obtaining the Presidency of that organization. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak wanted the position after ending his term as the head of the OAU, said accredited diplomatic sources in Cairo. After the sixth NAM summit held in Havana, Cuba, in 1979, Latin America had to wait 15 years to be able to preside over this movement again, which was founded in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1956 and which currently comprises more than 100 states. Latin America declined to assume the NAM directorship in 1991, when Nicaragua was selected and its government explained that it was going through a very serious internal crisis that did not allow it to organize the event. The principle of rotating the Presidency of NAM, will, on this occasion, allow the governments in this part of the world to give special attention to the economic and social inequalities in the region, among other points, diplomatic sources have commented. During the first summit (Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961), Cuba was the only full Latin American member in the movement. Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador participated as observers, and the continent was only mentioned once during the meeting to condemn the U.S. occupation of the Guantanamo Naval Base in the eastern part of Cuba. At the second NAM summit held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1964 nine observers from this part of the world attended the event, in addition to Havana, and topics related to Latin America were given greater attention. However, it was not until the 1973 conference in Algiers that the Latin Americans had significant representation. At that meeting, Argentina, Guyana, Peru, Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, and Chile entered NAM. Six years later, Havana brought in 11 effective members and 10 observers from Latin America, and in New Delhi, India, in 1983 the region's representation increased to at least 25 countries, of which 13 were full members. The NAM summit held in Cuba not only marked Latin America's complete identification with the fundamental principles of nonalignment but also the failure of 20 years of U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba from the rest of the continent. Latin America's growing participation in the movement increased its geographic and ideological dimension. Its contribution was essential for NAM to take a stand on the sovereign rights of states, drug trafficking, and terrorism, among other issues. Asked about Colombia's appointment to chair the heads of state and government meeting in 1995, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said to PRENSA LATINA that "it is a tough commitment for Latin America at a difficult moment in the movement."
