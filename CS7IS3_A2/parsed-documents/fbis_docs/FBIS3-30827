This statement was made by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus yesterday at a seminar for senior enterprise managers. According to him, there will be economic growth this year of some 2-3 percent. This should be confirmed by the results for the first quarter, which, of course, will be compared with the low figures for the first quarter of last year, a period immediately marked by the collapse of the federation. The government's aim is to establish the Czech Republic "for all time" in the world of single-figure inflation. At the seminar, which was also attended by Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and a number of other government economists and enterprise representatives, Klaus expressed his concern about too-rapid wage increases, but he also assured businessmen that the wage regulation applied by the government this year will be moderate and mild. The issue involves, he explained later, ensuring that the current level and structure of wages and other costs are maintained. Given the current productivity of labor, infringing them could force Czech enterprises out of their markets, which is the experience of some West European countries. In the opinion of the prime minister, an absolutely fundamental battle over the future nature of our economic system and societal arrangement is currently under way. The question is, he emphasized, whether there will really be a free society in our country, with a free market or a neosocialist system that would lead us into the same traps as the former communist regime. When someone regulates something, someone else is regulated, and we have had very bad experiences with this, he said. Immediately afterwards, he asked all those present to put pressure on the tendencies to excessively regulate the economic processes. Klaus devoted a great deal of attention to the koruna's exchange rate. As he said, the koruna's long-term stable exchange rate is a key element of the entire transformation process and is a firm mooring for all of the other economic quantities. The transition to full convertibility, which, incidentally, has its own specific features in each country, is not, according to him, a short-term aim but, rather, a long- or medium-term one. There is no reason for us to get rid of the fixed point in the form of the koruna's stable exchange rate now, emphasized the prime minister. He cited the need to maintain monetary and fiscal autonomy as another argument against the rapid implementation of full convertibility because the Western countries with whom we would be competing do not have to deal with the transformation tasks we are dealing with. The koruna's entry onto world markets could also lead to undesirable speculation in the Czech currency. In another part of his speech, often punctured with English or German expressions, Klaus said that the era of rescuing enterprises via the state budget or the National Property Fund is coming to an end. As far as social policy is concerned, the government's aim, in particular, is to improve the specific targeting of all benefits. When he was speaking about the government's endeavor to restrict the bureaucratic moloch, an individual burst of applause was heard in the almost full congress hall of the Palace of Culture, where the seminar was held. "I am glad that someone is happy," responded Vaclav Klaus.
