FR940727-2-00019 FR940727-2-00016 [OPP&hyph;300347; FRL&hyph;4807&hyph;2] Statement of Policy for Termiticide Labeling Revision; Availability for Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for revising soil applied and most other termiticide labeling, except fumigant type termiticides such as sulfuryl fluoride and nitrogen. That policy has been developed in a draft pesticide regulation (PR) notice, ``Termiticide Labeling,'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the address section of this notice. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP&hyph;300347], must be received on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The PR Notice is available from Harvey L. Warnick. By mail: Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person: Rm. 208, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA. By telephone: (703)&hyph;305&hyph;5200. Submit written comments to: By mail, Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person: Bring comments to Rm. 1128, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA. Information submitted and any comment(s) concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Harvey L. Warnick, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 208, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA, (703)&hyph;305&hyph;5200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Because of the highly specialized nature of termiticides, a number of issues evolved over the years with regard to products' labeling: (1) limitations on distribution, sale, or use; (2) precautionary statements; (3) environmental hazards statements; (4) storage and disposal statements; (5) use directions; (6) the longevity of termiticide treatments; and (7) application at less-than-labeled rates. In 1988, representatives from the termiticide manufacturing and user industry, State pesticide regulatory officials, and EPA representatives met voluntarily under the auspices of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG) to identify specific issues to be addressed. The identified issues were set forth in AAPCO/SFIREG's 1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and were endorsed by the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials (ASPCRO). EPA has reviewed the AAPCO/SFIREG 1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and has developed a draft PR Notice setting forth proposed policy regarding termiticide lableing and longevity of termiticide treatments. This Federal Register notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing any comments, EPA determines that changes to the Policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the Draft PR Notice prior to release.
