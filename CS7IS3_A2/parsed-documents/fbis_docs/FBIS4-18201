The group also reviewed the situation with respect to G-24 macro-financial assistance in favour of Albania. In view of the results of this meeting, Vice-president Christophersen indicated that the Commission will now submit to the Council of the European Union a proposal increasing the Union's balance of payments assistance to Bulgaria to up to ECU150 million. The vice-president also indicated that the Commission is ready to consider proposing further assistance for Romania and he urged the Romanian authorities to immediately complete the agreed prior actions. Mr. Christophersen finally confirmed that the Commission has now adopted a proposal for a new balance of payments grant of up to ECU35 million in favour of Albania. In the case of Bulgaria the G-24 noted with satisfaction that all the policy measures considered as prior actions by the IMF were now in place and that subject to adequate financing assurances from the EC/G-24, the stand-by arrangement will be considered by the IMF board on 11 April 1994. The G-24 noted that some USD157 million committed by Japan and several EFTA countries under the previous G-24 assistance package will be disbursed in the coming weeks on the basis of the approval of the stand-by arrangement and the new Paris club rescheduling agreement that would follow. Furthermore, subject to final approval by the governments of the donor countries, the European Commission on behalf of the European Union and representatives from Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands indicated their intention to provide additional macro-financial assistance of up to approximately USD260 million in support of Bulgaria's 1994-95 macro-economic programme. These financing assurances were necessary for the executive board of the IMF to consider the new stand-by arrangement and a second drawing under the systemic transformation facility (overall some USD420 million during the programme period). Along with assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, the EC/G-24 complementary financing will facilitate Bulgaria's adjustment and reform efforts, will allow for the successful implementation of the debt and debt service reduction arrangement recently agreed between Bulgaria and its commercial creditors, and will alleviate part of the cost of the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, from which Bulgaria has considerably suffered. In the case of Romania, the G-24 took note of the information provided by the IMF representative on the progress with respect to the implementation by the national authorities of the policy measures considered as prior actions for the new stand-by arrangement. The European Commission and several G-24 representatives indicated their positive stance and their readiness to consider new macro-financial assistance in favour of Romania on the proviso that all the agreed prior actions required for the IMF programmes are promptly and fully implemented. The group agreed to hold a pledging session on Romania as soon as these actions are in place. Concerning complementary balance of payments assistance to Albania, of which the principle was agreed at the G-24 high level meeting held in November 1993, the group noted with satisfaction that the performance under the enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) arrangement agreed with the IMF on July 1993, was satisfactory and that the authorities were pursuing the agreed macro-economic policies with determination. The group examined the implementation, in terms of effective disbursements, of the 1992-93 G-24 assistance package and noted that some US28 million committed by Japan and several EFTA countries were expected to be disbursed shortly. Furthermore, the European Commission indicated its intention to propose further balance of payments assistance to Albania in the context of the 1993-94 assistance package and a number of representatives from EFTA countries also pledged to participate with additional financing. It was recognized that further commitments were necessary and that the group should meet again in the coming months for this purpose.
