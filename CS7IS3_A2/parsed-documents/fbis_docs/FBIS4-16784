The Investment Bank of Reconstruction and Development of Small Russian Cities will be instituted for this purpose, Yevgeniy Malkov, the president of Russian Small Towns Union, told journalists on Tuesday at the presentation of the EBRD investment programmes in Russia. The bulk of the investment projects are to be realized in St. Petersburg, Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, but a considerable part of the Russian industries is situated in small towns. This is why Russia will come to a market economy only if it modernizes industry and transport in its small towns. One of these programmes deals with reconstructing small ports on the Baltic, Black and Azov seas. Another one envisages reconstructing local airports and industrial facilities. According to Uralvneshtorgbank official Sergey Obraz, "the Urals is a territory safe for investments because, no ethnic conflicts take place here, and local industry managed to preserve its high standards of research and development. Scientists and engineers working on defence enterprises (the Sverdlovsk region alone has five top-secret nuclear-technology towns) can produce new technologies, but cannot make money. This is why investment projects here should be launched before they give up their production capacities completely."
