FR940727-1-00043 FR940727-1-00014 Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, this section of the preamble summarizes the costs (savings) and the economic impact analysis of (option 1) the proposed mercury-containing lamp exclusion and of (option 2) the proposed special collection of mercury-containing lamps. Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's rule, the Agency's best estimate is that the exclusion of mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C hazardous waste regulatory requirements (option 1) may result in nationwide annualized savings of approximately $93 million, and the special collection of mercury containing lamps (option 2) may result in a nationwide annualized savings of approximately $17 million. A complete discussion of the economic impact analysis is available in the regulatory docket for today's proposed rule (EPA, 1994). The Agency requests information to better evaluate the human health and environmental effects of the two options described in this notice and current disposal practices. Human and environmental exposure to mercury could occur during the collection, transportation, processing, recycling, treatment, and disposal of spent lamps. EPA estimated the potential mercury air emissions resulting from some of these activities, but is uncertain about the extent and likelihood of human and environmental exposure. The Agency is also aware that the two regulatory options may pose different worker and transportation injury risks as well as different environmental risks. The Agency requests information on the overall risks to human health and the environment associated with current practices and the two proposed options. A. Compliance Costs (Savings) for Regulatory Options Considered This section briefly describes (1) the universe of spent mercury-containing lamps and lamp generators, (2) the current regulatory baseline and (3) the major options for the regulation of spent mercury-containing lamps included in today's proposal for consideration. Descriptions of the baseline and the major options also include a summary of the methodology used in estimating compliance costs (savings). Results of the analysis are summarized in section 5. 1. Universe of Spent Lamps and Spent Lamp Generators The Agency estimates that approximately 310 to 380 million mercury-containing lamps, and 47,000 to 64,000 facilities could be affected annually by today's proposal. The spent lamp generation number is based on sales data, 1 adjusted to account for (1) Lamps generated by Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG), which would not be affected by either one of the proposed options, and (2) lamps generated in States where spent bulb management regulations exist (California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). (It was assumed that these State controls would be more stringent than the options considered in today's proposal and would therefore supersede any Federal exemption of spent mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C requirements). 1 Source: National Electrical Manufacturing Association. 2. Baseline Costs EPA assumed that baseline requirements are the continuation of current Subtitle C regulatory standards for the treatment and disposal of mercury-containing lamps which currently fail the TC. Under this scenario, generators of spent mercury containing lamps which fail the TC continue to be subject to the full spectrum of hazardous waste management standards including record keeping and manifesting of all mercury-containing lamp shipments, Agency notification and Subtitle C transport, treatment, storage and disposal standards. In the cost analysis, all spent mercury-containing lamps were assumed to be TC (Toxicity Characteristic) hazardous wastes. All spent lamps were also assumed to be in the low risk category for mercury, requiring stabilization as treatment under the Land Disposal Restrictions. Cost drivers for the baseline management of spent lamps include hazardous waste transportation, and Subtitle C disposal. The bulk of mercury-containing lamps currently disposed (97%) are assumed to be stabilized and disposed of in hazardous waste landfills. The remainder, based upon volume data from the spent mercury-containing lamp recovery industry, are recycled. Based upon conversations with the recycling industry, which indicate planned increases in recycling capacity, the analysis assumed a small annual increase in the baseline recycling rate of mercury-containing lamps over the first three years of the analysis. Unit costs for stabilization, landfilling, recycling and hazardous waste transport were applied on a per ton basis. Generator specific requirements which applied to all large quantity generators of spent mercury-containing lamps included record-keeping, manifesting, exception reporting, and BRS (Biennial Reporting System) reporting. Other generator requirements, including rule familiarization, notification, personnel safety training and emergency 2 planning were only assessed for new facilities which spot relamp and store (up to 90 days for large quantity generators; up to 180 days for small quantity generators) spent lamps on site. It is assumed that costs resulting from generator requirements which are incurred on a per shipment basis (i.e. manifesting, exception reporting) will be incurred by group relampers once every three years (once per relamp). Spot relampers will incur these costs twice a year (for small quantity generators) or four times per year (for large quantity generators). 2 According to 40 CFR part 265 Subpart D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, all large quantity generators of hazardous waste must draft a contingency plan describing the actions facility personnel will take should a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden releases of hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water occur. Local emergency response teams use the information required in the contingency plan to minimize unanticipated damage from the storage of hazardous waste.
