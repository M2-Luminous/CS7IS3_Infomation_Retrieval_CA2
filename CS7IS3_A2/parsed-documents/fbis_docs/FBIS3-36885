[passage omitted] Have the Kazakhstani leaders adjusted their stance on the eve of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty? "No, they have not," said state counselor Tulegen Zhukeyev, who in fact shapes Kazakhstan's foreign policy. "Our policy remains unchanged. If the Russian side wants to discuss the subject, we will continue the dialogue. But I do not think it will reveal anything completely new." As for "minor" details concerning the issue, Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko unexpectedly spoke up on the matter during his trip around the republic's eastern oblasts. In his words, a treaty with Moscow is being drawn up whereby every Kazakhstani citizen, if he or she so wishes, will have the possibility of obtaining Russian citizenship in Moscow under a special procedure that will be simplified as much as possible. This information was confirmed for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent at the information-analytical center of the Kazakhstani president's staff. "I do not think that the question of citizenship is a cornerstone in Russian-Kazakhstani relations," Marat Tazhin, the center chief, believes. "To all appearances, a solution will be found in the form of a `postponed' or `dozing' [`dremlyushchiy'] citizenship; at least our president has repeatedly said that he wants the problem resolved in this particular fashion." According to Marat Tazhin, the procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship may boil down to a simple registration for ethnic Russians, and for other persons wishing to move to Russia the acquisition of citizenship would last no longer than three months. "But all this, of course, will be settled at the upcoming talks and in the course of concluding treaties," the chief of the presidential staff's information-analytical center said. [passage omitted] "References to Turkmenistan or Kyrgyzstan in this case are inappropriate," thinks Sabit Zhusupov, a sociologist and the center's leading analyst. "We have an entirely different situation in Kazakhstan. If we agree that dual citizenship is really needed, around 60 percent of the state's population will turn out to be foreign citizens." Sabit Zhusupov also believes that the problem can be resolved completely by concluding bilateral agreements that would specify the rights of the two countries' citizens and simplify a procedure for changing citizenship. "But for the most part these matters are of interest for politicians," Sabit Zhusupov claims, "and also the intelligentsia. But not for other categories of citizens." An entirely clear view has taken shape in Kazakhstan's high echelons of power: It is Russian politicians who are trying to add a political tinge to the citizenship question with an evident purpose of expanding Russia's sphere of influence into Central Asia and making Russophones a sort of "force field" to influence local governments.
