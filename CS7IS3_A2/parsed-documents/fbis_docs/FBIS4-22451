When studying the question of the composition of intelligence information it is of fundamental importance to evaluate the correlation of such information procured from agent sources and information obtained with the use of legal possibilities, including notification, official contacts with informed persons, open-source analysis, and the gathering of information by way of personal observation during visits to accessible facilities, exhibitions, parades, exercises, and festivals, thanks to personal participation in conferences and symposia, and with the aid of various technical means of reconnaissance. According to R. Hillenkoetter, director of U.S. central intelligence in 1948, "80 percent of intelligence information is obtained from such conventional sources as foreign books, journals, and S&T reviews, photographs, the data of commercial analysis, newspapers, and radio broadcasts and also from general information obtained from persons who have an idea of affairs overseas." Another American specialist in the field of intelligence, W. McGovern, observed: "It is very hard to compute mathematically, but I am inclined to believe that in the process of the preparation of strategic decisions approximately 20 percent of the basic information comes from clandestine sources, approximately 80 percent, from open, legal sources." This viewpoint accords entirely with the opinion of a number of foreign specialists in the field of intelligence expressed at the end of the 1970's to the effect that 20-25 percent of the information procured by the intelligence community of the United States comes from open foreign sources (newspapers, journals, radio broadcasts, and so forth), 20-25 percent from the reports of employees of official missions of the United States in other states, and approximately 5 percent from unofficial sources, and technical types of reconnaissance account for the rest. All these estimates are quite a plausible reflection of the possibilities afforded in the processing of open sources. An undoubted authority in the field of the organization of illegal intelligence-information activity, V.I. Ulyanov (Lenin), wrote in this connection: "Legal material is particularly important.... It would be no exaggeration to say that it is still possible on the basis of legal material alone to somehow write a professional brochure, on illegal material alone, it is impossible. Gathering illegal material... it is impossible also acquiring knowledge... which is scattered in a mass in brief newspaper reports and in special industrial, medical, land association, and other publications." Let us, however, turn to modern examples from the experience of the American special services. Despite the fact that we have always been considered overseas a closed society, in which the free exchange of information is limited, many American specialists in the field of intelligence believed that even under these conditions "there is a considerable amount of information that may be collected from accessible materials." Thus in the Soviet period of our history 11 of our most important military journals and newspapers, including KOMMUNIST VOORUZHENNYKH SIL, VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL, and VOYENNYY VESTNIK, were of the greatest interest to the American military. In addition, specialists of American intelligence would make a close study of a considerable number of less well-known and more specialized periodical publications. American experts always carefully studied the texts of official speeches of our country's top officials. An analysis of the formal and structural features of these texts made it possible to uncover contradictions in the Soviet leadership. The polemic that developed in the CPSU Central Committee Politburo in 1969-1974 around the question of the essence of the Soviet military doctrine, in which Politburo members Andropov, Brezhnev, Grechko, Gromyko, and Kulikov found themselves involved, is given as an example. The parties' positions were reconstructed by American researchers by way of a content analysis of the Soviet leaders' public speeches based on material of the newspapers PRAVDA and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Similarly, an analysis of the political information published in the open press of the USSR enabled specialists of the U.S. intelligence community to formulate valid forecasts as to who would fill the position of general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee in the period 1982-1985. As the well-known American Sovietologist P. Steven (University of Virginia) observed, the policy of perestroyka largely contributed to an improvement in the work of specialists on the Soviet Union. "The resolve of the media in the USSR to illustrate problems of interest to us, the broadening of contacts between scientists of our two countries, and the growing readiness of Soviet politicians and officials and also representatives of science to freely and candidly discuss many questions with colleagues from the United States--all this increased considerably the extent and the quality of the information available to us. Specifically, we were able, thanks to the increased quality of information about Soviet society, to evaluate anew the work of former citizens of the USSR and the East European countries, on whom we had depended earlier in obtaining information at first hand, but whose personal partiality was sometimes reflected in the reliability of their information." The source base of the report CIA SOV S87-10043 "Enterprise-Level Computing in the Soviet Economy," which was published in 1987, was studied for an analysis of the composition and structure of intelligence information pertaining to our country. Some 347 open sources, including 295 Soviet (85 percent), were used in the course of work on the report. The statistics of quotation by newspaper are given below (see chart 1). FIGURE On problems of military policy at the end of the 1980's the most important sources of information were the newspapers KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which accounts for 75 percent of all references, and PRAVDA (16 percent) (see chart 2). The situation changed noticeably at the start of the 1990's. Interest in our open sources (newspapers, particularly) became more diversified. Thus in the works of American analysts on military-policy topics in 1993 the most quoted Russian newspapers were the publications indicated in chart 3. The information on the budget of the U.S. intelligence community is sufficiently eloquent also. Spending on intelligence has always been classified, but, employing special research procedures, an approximate level of this spending of $30-32 billion (some American experts put this amount at $34 billion) may be established. A relatively modest amount of these funds is spent on personnel. The funding of procurement activity (mainly with the aid of technical means of reconnaissance) accounts for the main expenditure (approximately 80 percent). It is significant that no more than 3 percent of the intelligence community's budget is spent on agent methods of operation. The remaining resources (approximately 17 percent) are spent on information and analysis, and also on administration, international cooperation, personnel training, and other purposes. Determining, as a whole, the dependence of intelligence information on the sources of this type or the other (agents, technical means of reconnaissance--TSR--or open information material) would not seem possible. But the greatest volume of intelligence information is compiled, in the opinion of various specialists, from open sources and with the aid of TSR, which is not mutually contradictory, being an intersecting estimate made with approaches differing in terms of their criterion.
