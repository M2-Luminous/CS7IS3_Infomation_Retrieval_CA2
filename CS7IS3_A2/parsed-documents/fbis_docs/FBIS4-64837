However, Japan wishes that "the door be left open for negotiations." The risks created by North Korea's nuclear policy were among the main topics addressed on Wednesday, 4 May by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in his successive meetings with Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and Edouard Balladur. Mr. Hata reiterated that his country agrees with the statement issued last month by the Security Council, which threatened with economic sanctions against North Korea should it persist in refusing international inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. According to Mr. Hata, Japan has asked China to use its influence to get North Korea to come to terms. Mr. Hata raised the issue of Japan becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. He reminded his hosts that France has been in favor of this notion and, more generally, would like Japan to play a more prominent role in world affairs. The Japanese prime minister also agreed that "it is not a healthy state of affairs when a single country" (like Japan) "has a trade surplus," adding that Tokyo "is attempting to open its market to the world." In office since 25 April, Mr. Hata is currently completing a European tour that already took him to Rome and will take him next to Germany and Belgium, where he will meet with Jacques Delors on Friday.
