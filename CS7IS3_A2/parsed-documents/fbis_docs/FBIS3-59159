We doubt whether the U.S. President has found time to deal with Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building measures. Some employees at the White House or State Department have again written the President's report, which appears to be three months late. Consequently, Clinton's report is outdated and out of touch with reality. Cypriot Hellenism demands that the U.S. President view the Cyprus issue seriously and honestly and stop acting as others have. He promised in Brussels that when he returned to Washington he would personally deal with the Cyprus issue. Instead of dealing with the substance and trying to promote an honest solution, he is signing documents presented to him by officials and submitting worthless reports written by bureaucrats. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will come to Cyprus at the weekend but it appears that he will come to resuscitate the confidence-building measures. Unfortunately, the Americans do not appear willing to get seriously and effectively involved in the Cyprus issue and this disappoints Cypriot Hellenism.
