FR940705-2-00085 FR940705-2-00063 Federal Subsistence Sheep Season; Baird Mountains, Alaska; Public Hearing AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Public hearing regarding the federal subsistence sheep season in a portion of Unit 23 in the Baird Mountains, Alaska. SUMMARY: A public hearing is scheduled regarding the federal subsistence sheep season in the Baird Mountain portion of Unit 23. Dependent upon the status of the sheep population, the Federal Subsistence Board may have to exercise its closure authority to conserve healthy and natural populations of sheep in the area. If such a closure becomes necessary, this public meeting will have fulfilled the requirements of 50 CFR 100.19. The purpose of the meeting will be to inform the public of the status of the sheep population and of potential proposals to the Federal Subsistence Board for action. Public comment will be accepted. BACKGROUND: Aerial surveys conducted in the Baird Mountains (that area of Unit 23 south and east of the Noatak River) show a dramatic decline in the sheep population since 1989. In an effort to protect this population and facilitate its recovery, this area has been closed to all hunting of sheep since 1991, through closure actions of the Federal Subsistence Board. Survey results from July 1992 indicate the sharp decline has at least temporarily stopped; however, the population has not significantly grown. A sheep survey by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the National Park Service is scheduled for mid-July 1994. These survey results are expected to be available for discussion at the July 21 meeting. Should the survey and past biological data indicate a continuing threat to the conservation of a health population of sheep in the Baird Mountains of Unit 23, a proposal will be advanced to the Federal Subsistence Board to once again close federal public lands to sport hunting, under Alaska regulations, and, perhaps, to the subsistence seasons currently scheduled for August 10&hyph;September 20, 1994, and October 1&hyph;April 30, 1995. The Federal Subsistence Board will make a final determination on any such proposed closure, if advanced. The National Park Service is hosting this meeting as the principal federal land manager in the Baird Mountains area. The federal lands in the Baird Mountain area are within the Noatak National Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, and Kobuk District, Bureau of Land Management. DATE/LOCATION: The meeting will be held July 21, 1994, at 7:00 p.m. in the Public Lands Information Center, Kotzebue, Alaska. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bob Gerhard, Superintendent, Northwest Alaska Areas, P.O. Box 1029 Kotzebue, Alaska 99752, telephone: (907) 442&hyph;3890. David B. Ames, Acting Regional Director.
