Since the Party Congress held in the fall of 1992, reshuffling has been conducted off and on. However, nearly 100 general-class senior officers were reshuffled at a time at the end of last year, and the majority of top leaders at both the military headquarters and seven military regions have been relieved over the past year. Compared with past years, the age-limit system is now being implemented in a more strict way. At the same time, efforts are now being made to avoid abrupt promotions in leadership rejuvenation so that personnel affairs can be dealt with in a normal way. In view of the post-Deng Xiaoping age, efforts have been made to make a shift from the "rule of man" to the "rule of law" so as to strengthen the civilian leadership of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary who is concurrently chairman of the Central Military Commission. In the reshuffling in late 1993, three leaders of the major military regions retired. They are: Wang Chengbin, commander of the Beijing Military Region; Song Keda, political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, and Liu Anyuan, political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. As a result, commanders and political commissars born before 1928 were all eliminated. The People's Liberation Army [PLA] enacted a regulation setting the retirement age of cadres of the major military regions at 65 in principle. The recent personnel actions applied this principle strictly. On the other hand, 58-year-old Li Xinliang, political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, is the youngest among those recently promoted. Compared with General Liu Jingsong's promotion to commander of the Shenyang Military Region in 1985, when he was 52 years old, efforts at rejuvenation seem to have slowed down. The recent moves seem aimed at shortening the period cadres stay at one post, and "preventing specific cadres from gaining strong power in a specific locality or organization." (according to a military source) However, there has been active promotion of younger men to the no. 2 positions, and below. According to the military source, a typical example is the case of He Pengfei, son of the late Marshal He Long, who assumed the post of deputy commander of the Navy in late 1992, when he was still 48 years old. PLA observers regard the transfer of Major General Zhang Gong, who served as the spokesman of the martial law forces during the Tiananmen indicent in 1989, from the position of political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region to that of political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences as most noteworthy. Zhang had just moved from the Beijing Military Region in late 1992. He has been "demoted" (according to the military source) twice during a period of more than one year. Zhang has been known to be close to Yang Baibing, member of the CPC Political Bureau (formerly secretary general of the CPC Central Military Commission). Yang became very powerful after the Tiananmen incident, but fell from grace in the PLA in late 1992. Zhang's transfer is regarded as a symbolic personnel action to do away with memories of the Tiananmen incident and Yang's influence. However, the prevailing view is: the fact that Zhang is still nominally kept in a senior position shows that overtly factional appointments are still being avoided. Many also see these recent personnel changes as a major attempt to strengthen discipline in the military. A concerned source cites the following as the basis for this view: 1) Lieutenant General Wang Ruilin, a close confidant of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and incumbent secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection, also took up the position of deputy director of the General Political Department in early 1993; 2) the chief procurator of the Military Procuratorate was changed in late 1992; and 3) JIEFANGJUN BAO carries many articles warning against commercial activities of military personnel. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Recent Personnel | | | | |Changes in Major | | | | |PRC Military Regi-| | | | |ons | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Jan 1992 |Jan 1993 |Jan 1994 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Beijing Military | | |> | |Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Wang Chengbin (28)| |Li Laizhu (32) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Zhang Gong (35) |Gu Shanqing (31) | | |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Shenyang Military | | | | |Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Liu Jingsong (33) |Wang Ke (31) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Song Keda (28) | |Li Xinliang (36) | |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nanjing Military | | | | |Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Gu Hui (30) | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Shi Yuxiao (33) |Liu Anyuan (27) |Fang Zhuqi (35) | |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jinan Military Re-| | | | |gion | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Zhang Wannian (28)|Zhang Taiheng (31)| | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Song Qingwei (29) | | | |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Guangzhou Militar-| | | | |y Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Zhu Dunfa (27) |Li Xilin (30) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Zhang Zhongxian (2|Shi Yuxiao (33) | | |ar |6) | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chengdu Military | | | | |Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Li Jiulong (29) | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Gu Shanqing (31) |Zhang Gong (35) |Zhang Zhijian (34)| |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lanzhou Military | | | | |Region | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |commander |Fu Quanyou (30) |Liu Jingsong (33) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |political commiss-|Cao Pengsheng (30)| | | |ar | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Figures in | | | | |parentheses repre-| | | | |sent year born.
