'Abd-al-Harith Madani died the day after being arrested on April 26 on charges that he had acted as a go-between for imprisoned members of the Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and those abroad. The Egyptian lawyers, who normally work on Sundays, also plan a protest march on a palace of President Husni Mubarak on Tuesday. They have demanded the release of 34 lawyers held without charge and to take part in an inquiry into Madani's death. The prosecutor's office said Thursday that an initial autopsy showed the lawyer had died after being tortured. But the Interior Ministry said two days later that Madani had died from an asthma attack before even being questioned. It said his asthma attack had started at his home where he had been taken by security services and that Madani was immediately brought to hospital where he later died. But his family was only told of his death on May 6. The ministry said Madani had been a "terrorist leader" of al-Jama'ah, which has waged a two-year-long campaign of violence against the government, and that it had documents to prove the allegation. Mukhtar Nuh, a member of the bar association, rejected the explanation that Madani had died of natural causes, saying if that were true "the security services would not have waited nine days to inform his family." "Even if he was accused of belonging to an armed group, that doesn't give the state the right to kill him," added Nuh, whose association is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.
