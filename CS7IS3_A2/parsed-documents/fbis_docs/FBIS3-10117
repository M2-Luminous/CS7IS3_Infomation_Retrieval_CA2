On its part, the government has charged that the former soldiers are being "manipulated" by those who want to create problems for the election process. Pedro Martinez, of the Association of Demobilized Armed Forces Members [Asociacion de Desmovilizados de la Fuerza Armada -- Adefaes], said "we could obstruct the elections. We have demobilized personnel in all the departments and we could easily block streets and prevent access to polling stations." The demobilized soldiers yesterday gathered in front of the offices of the Armed Forces Social Welfare Institute (IPSFA), located at No. 6a-10a, Poniente Street, near the National Gymnasium. "We are told to present ourselves, but when we do so, they write in our documents that we were discharged because we are guilty of some irregularity in our service or we went AWOL and they refuse to grant us our rights," the former soldiers said. "We have warned the government and the Armed Forces that we will not permit being denied compensation." "We will go to Guazapa Hill [site of fighting during the armed conflict]." "We are going to take reprisals against all those who oppose our compensation process. We are going to take reprisals against the colonels and the officers who are declaring themselves our enemies," the former soldiers warned. Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria yesterday warned that if the former soldiers carry out their threats, the law will be enforced against them.
