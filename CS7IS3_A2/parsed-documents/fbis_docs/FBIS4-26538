[Begin recording] [Correspondent] What are the plans of the regional party committee and the regional government to accomplish the tasks of deepening the reform, accelerating development, and maintaining stability this year? [Chen Kuiyuan] This year is a crucial year for reform throughout the country. In Tibet, the level of economic development is comparatively low. It is a region with a comparatively backward economy. This being so, it is all the more necessary that we seize the opportunity and push forward Tibet's economic development by deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world. We are unable to compete with the rest of the country in our level and speed of economic development. However, reform is not only a motive force for further development in developed areas, but is also a strong motive force for economically backward areas to catch up and accelerate development. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity for reform. Through deepening reform, we should strive to further invigorate Tibet's economy and improve the people's living standards. This year, what we should do first is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Like the rest of the country, we should transform the economic structure, especially the financial structure, the pricing structure, and the planning structure. The state is aiming at building a unified and orderly market economy. If there is a lack of uniformity in economic structure and operating mechanisms, we will face many obstacles in our economic exchanges and economic cooperation with the rest of the country, as well as in the normal operation of the economy in the autonomous region. Therefore, we must first catch up with the rest of the country in reform so that we can join other fraternal provinces and autonomous regions in marching toward the development goals of the end of this century and even of the next century under similar economic conditions. [passage omitted] To develop the economy and improve the people's living, we need a stable social and economic environment. Judging from the current environment of Tibet, the general situation is stable. With the efforts of party committees, governments, and security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels and with the support of the people, Tibet's entire social environment is stable. Of course, internationally, a handful of people desire to stir up trouble in Tibet. Moreover, they have spread lies about turbulence and disturbances occurring in Tibet. In fact, the situation which they have been expecting has never emerged in Tibet. On the contrary, people here are arduously participating in socialist economic construction in a relatively peaceful environment. Of course, we are maintaining high vigilance against both the internal and external factors of instability. Internationally, there is truly a small number of people who are unwilling to see Tibet pursue economic construction in a stable and peaceful environment. Meanwhile, the splittist clique outside Tibet has been trying to win the support of international hostile forces in a bid to create chaos in Tibet in order to achieve their despicable political objective. In Tibet, with the vigorous support and cooperation of the cadres and people, we are going all out to participate in economic construction. Because of this, a relatively peaceful and stable environment has been maintained in the autonomous region. In the future, we will continue to adhere to the principle of "grasping two links" at the same time and of "attaching importance to both" and be ready at all times to eliminate the interference of hostile forces so as to ensure the smooth progress of Tibet's economic construction and gradual improvement of the people's living standards.
