[passage omitted] Sulayman Majid al-Shahin, the under secretary at the Foreign Ministry, who had welcomed Ekeus on his arrival, said that the prominent UN official's visit to Kuwait was important because it exemplified the UN Security Council's surveillance over the Baghdad regime's mass destruction weapons. He added that Ekeus will brief Kuwaiti officials on the achievements of the UN commission with regard to destroying Iraqi mass destruction weapons and the long-term monitoring of the Iraqi regime's armament program. For his part, Rolf Ekeus said that the commission did not feel satisfied up till now with the results of its work in Iraq, which meant that the UN economic sanctions imposed on the Baghdad regime, because of its aggression against the State of Kuwait, will remain in force. Ekeus added that with regard to chemical weapons, the commission did not feel reassured because of the lack of complete information from Iraqi regime officials that would enable the commission to confirm that all these weapons had been destroyed or removed. Ekeus stressed that there were still serious problems to be solved with the Iraqi regime officials at a meeting to be held in March. He said he believed that as long as the UN commission was able to work in Iraq, the Baghdad regime would not be able to implement any comprehensive armaments program. He emphasized that UN control was effective in this field and that the UN Security Council will rely on the reports of the commission when it came to make any decision related to considering the lifting or reduction of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi regime.
