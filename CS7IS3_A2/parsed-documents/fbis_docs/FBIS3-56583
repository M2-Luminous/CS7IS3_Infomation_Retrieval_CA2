In his interview with Interfax the premier voiced a supposition that certain moods to turn away from shock therapy and increase state expenditures for social needs spreading in Russia have played a certain role here. "It's a pity that shortage of funds for these purposes could result in the refusal of reform policy and very hard consequences for all Russia's neighbors, as their successes in economic development depend upon their eastern neighbor," underlined Laar. "It's strange to hear optimistic statements against such a background stating that nothing has changed in Russia and after the elections everything is continuing as before," he said.
