Ioffe; place and date not given; from the "Vesti" newscast -- recorded] [Text] [Ioffe] Sergey Filatov is far from being a noisy sort of politician, he is very proper and even affable, and then all of a sudden there is a huge fuss in the newspapers about his resignation. [Filatov] It was news to me just as to everyone else, all the more so in that there is nothing behind it all. That is the most interesting bit. Two months ago there were attempts to bring the president's first aide Viktor Vasilyevich Ilyushin and myself into conflict... [Ioffe] On what grounds, if I may ask?
