Last year, the growing of economic crops, vegetables and fruit, and animal husbandry helped local farmers increase per capita income by 347 yuan, a 53 percent rise. The provincial government has announced preferential policies and provided funds for farmers to develop a diversified economy. More than 40 diversified economy projects in rural areas have been designated as key ones to receive favorable policies in funds and materials. The planting area of apple trees was increased from 193,000 ha in 1990 to 339,000 ha. Last year, with an annual output of 300,000 tons to 1.31 million tons. Vegetable areas were increased by 66,600 ha. In 1993 some 15 of the key projects produced a total income of nearly six billion yuan (about 700 million U.S. dollars) for the local peasants. Commodity production bases of chicken, pork, vegetables, pears, edible oil, apples, tobacco, mushrooms and dates have emerged in various localities. At the same time, the province attaches importance to developing cold-storage, processing, packaging and transportation facilities.
