The appeal was signed by a number of people known for the fact that, until recently, they held an irreconcilable stance vis-a-vis the president and his policies. The president's administration expects the new association to make a specific contribution to the preparation of an agreement on civil peace in Russia, and afterward, to its practical implementation. It is on the basis of these deeds that society will judge whether the intentions of the appeal's authors are sincere, the press service report says.
