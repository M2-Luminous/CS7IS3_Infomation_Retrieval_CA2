The "Doing Radio" newscast sends all its self-sacrificing fighters its most fraternal greetings. The revolution has waged a constant struggle against those who have tried to crush the achievements of this process throughout three decades; and, within that struggle, the Minint fighters have played a role that deserves full recognition. Tasks which deal with the prevention of crime and repression of activities which conspire against the security, integrity, and assets of the people and the citizens represent difficult, self-sacrificing work that entails sacrifices, total dedication, and -- many times -- serious risks because many Minint fighters have lost their lives in the line of duty. These tasks require honest men because nothing is more damaging than the abuse of power or the use of that authority with intentions other than those granted by the revolution and the law to the organizations and the men who serve it. Minint fighters have achieved success in their tasks because they have had the people's full support. In a revolution like ours, the repression of criminal activities, whatever their nature, always has the people's support. This is one of the keys of the Minint fighters' success in their various activities. Today, when we mark the foundation of the Minint, which was formed with a nucleus of men from the rebel army and clandestine groups, "Doing Radio" joins the people in greeting those fighters with strong principles, convictions, and determination to serve the people, which is the source of their authority.
