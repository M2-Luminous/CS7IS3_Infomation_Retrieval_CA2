FR940516-0-00074 FR940516-0-00021 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG51 Returned and Canceled Checks AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning returned and canceled checks. The amendment will assure that the regulations clearly reflect the requirements of the governing statutes as interpreted in a precedent opinion of VA's General Counsel. The intended effect of the amendment is to ensure that the amount represented by a benefit check received but unnegotiated prior to a beneficiary's death is properly distributed. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective June 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Thornberry, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, telephone (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.1003 in the Federal Register of September 3, 1993 (58 FR 46920&hyph;21). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before October 4, 1993. No comments were received, and the amendments are adopted as proposed with the exception of the following technical amendment. Section 3.1003(a), as here amended, will provide that the amount represented by a returned and canceled check will be payable to the living person or persons in the order of precedence listed in ยง3.1000(a)(1)&hyph;(4), which deals with accrued benefits. Section 3.1000(a)(4) provides, in effect, that, where there is no living person in the classes identified in ยง3.1000(a)(1)&hyph;(3), the amount of accrued benefits payable is limited to the amount necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. We are adding to ยง3.1003(a), as originally proposed, a similar statement to ensure that there is no confusion on the amount of a returned and canceled check that may be paid in such a situation. The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.
