A statement from the Alex Boncayao Brigade sent to the INQUIRER office yesterday, meanwhile, pointed to the military as the "direct perpetrator" of the killing, but also held the Sison led faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) responsible for "opening the door for (the military's) bloody intrigue." Ricardo Reyes, former secretary general of the CPP, added that Sison and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lisandro Abadia are using the victim for "self serving purposes." Sison's group was earlier implicated by Martinez's comrades in the underground movement in Visayas in the killing, but Sison reversed the accusations, saying that Martinez must have been killed by the communist opposition in connivance with the military and the police. "Martinez was known to have distanced himself from the (opposition group)," Sison said, adding that "he (Martinez) was subsequently suspected by the (opposition) of turning against it." But Reyes, who has now joined the open legal struggle refuted Sison's statements. "Vic Martinez has unequivocally and steadfastly stood for the opposition," he said. "I know it because we are co-workers in the (Philippine Ecumenical Action for Community Empowerment Foundation)," he added. "Sobrang kawalanghiyaan na ito [This is notoriously shameless]," Reyes said, describing alleged "twisting of facts." In criticizing the military, Reyes said that Abadia has exonerated the military "with indecent haste... relying on something as dubious as intelligence reports." Because of this, he said the military's impartiality has therefore been compromised in the investigation. Sergio Romero, ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] commanding officer, said that the "bloody intrigues" were sparked by Sison's group when it issued last month "charge sheets" against four ranking leaders in the CPP opposition who are to be tried in "people's courts." These are Reyes, former NPA [New People's Army] chief Romulo Kintanar, Metro Manila CPP head Felimon Lagman and CPP Visayas chair Arturo Tabara. The ABB called on Sison's group to "repair the damage they have done." Likewise, he demanded the withdrawal of the charges against the opposition leaders and to stop Sison's personal attacks against these people. Meanwhile, Luis Jalandoni, vice chairman of the National Democratic Front (NDF), yesterday condemned the killing of Martinez and warned that such "bloody intrigues" would frustrate the peace talks. "Any attempt of the Ramos regime to carry out bloody intrigue against the revolutionary movement will render impossible further talks between the NDF and the (government)," Jalandoni, who represents the NDF in the peace talks, said in a statement from Utrecht, The Netherlands.
