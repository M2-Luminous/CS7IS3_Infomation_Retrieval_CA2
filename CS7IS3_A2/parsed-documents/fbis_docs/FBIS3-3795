He told a press conference here that the "American side should not forget the historical experience of the 1950s Korean war." He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was sending Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military exercises with South Korea. Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but war," said Chu. He also said that if international sanctions were imposed on North Korea by the United Nations Pyongyang would "make the necessary response." The International Atomic Energy Agency has accused North Korea of not fully cooperating with inspections of its nuclear programme and has referred the issue to the United Nations for possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance.
