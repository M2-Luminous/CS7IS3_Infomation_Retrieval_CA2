FR940407-0-00088 FR940407-0-00014 Some industry commenters disagreed with the use of two discount factors, on the basis that such an approach would double count uncertainty. These commenters also expressed the view that a presumptive norm of 80 percent for a rule compliance factor is too low. On the other hand, an environmental group commented that a presumptive norm of 80 percent was too high. This commenter also urged that credit not be given for prior reductions or for plant shutdowns and slowdowns which would have occurred in the absence of a control program. The final rules generally retain the proposed approach of requiring the State to develop and apply discount factors to account for compliance-related and programmatic design uncertainties. In addition, however, the final rules also include further guidance and criteria for developing and justifying such factors. In particular, various aspects of program design should be considered in developing such factors, including but not limited to the type of incentive mechanism upon which the program is based; the variability in emissions from affected sources and the nature and extent of uncertainty in the emissions quantification procedures required by the program; the type and frequency of MRR required by the program; sanctions for noncompliance; the frequency, scope, and committed responses to program audits; and the nature of administrative procedures to be used by the State in implementing and enforcing the program. G. Audit/Reconciliation Procedures The proposed rules specify that program audits be made at least every 3 years, consistent with intervals associated with RFP milestones and emission inventory requirements. Alternatively, the State could specify a shorter period, so as to allow time to make programmatic corrections or adjustments (in either direction) to SIP credited emissions reductions, before an RFP milestone is reached. The proposal solicited comments on the appropriate audit frequency. Several comments were received on the general issue of programs audits. Most such comments were generally supportive of a requirement for ongoing program tracking and feedback, although the commenters differed on the role that the audit should have relative to other EIP requirements. Some State commenters felt that ongoing audits should serve as an alternative to many of the proposed regulatory requirements for up-front technical analyses. Another State supported the use of audits to assess EIP adequacy and the need to take corrective actions. An environmental group recommended that the EPA require for all EIP's contingency measures to compensate for shortfalls revealed through the audits. Other State, environmental, and industry commenters felt that requiring audits was reasonable, but expressed varying degrees of concern that audits not become so burdensome as to serve as a disincentive for developing an EIP. On the other hand, one industry commenter felt that EIP's ought not be subject to any special audit requirements different from those applicable to traditional programs. On the issue of audit frequency, most commenters generally agreed with the proposed 3-year interval. One State commenter felt that annual audits should be conducted to assess progress, with a summary of such audits to be incorporated in triennial SIP RFP reports. The final rules and guidance retain the proposed requirements for program audit and reconciliation procedures, and establish 3 years as the maximum time interval for conducting such audits. The final rules recognize that the State has flexibility in establishing the frequency (within the 3-year constraint) and scope of audit provisions. Further, the final rules recognize that there is an interplay between the frequency, scope, and other design features of the audit provisions and the nature and scope of other program design elements (such as the justification for uncertainty factors). In addition, to better define the benefits from EIP's, the final rules include analysis of control cost savings, to the extent practicable, as a part of the required program audit. H. Penalties for Noncompliance The proposed rules recognize that determination of statutory maximum penalties for noncompliance is significantly complicated in the case of EIP's that incorporate multisource emissions caps and/or long-term averaging times, since Federal statutory maximum penalty authority is specified on a per-day, per-source basis. While establishing the principle that such penalty provisions must create a deterrent effect comparable to that of traditional programs, the proposal solicited comment on criteria for the development of such penalty provisions. Commenters generally agreed with the principle of equivalent deterrence. Several industry commenters opposed any criteria that would suggest that any multisource emissions cap violation should be considered to have occurred at each source. Some commenters recommended that penalty provisions be based on the amount of the exceedence of a cap, and one commenter suggested that the final rules should recommend predetermined minimum penalties. Another commenter recommended that penalty provisions differentiate between violations that are willful or negligent and those that are determined not to be willful or negligent.
