In a speech delivered at the congress, comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said: It pleases me to relay the greetings of leader President Saddam Husayn, as well as those of the steadfast Iraqi people, and the cadres of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party cadres to the leaders and cadres of your party and the friendly Russian people. The Ba'th Party wishes every success for the congress in its efforts to achieve the LDP's objectives in the interest of Russia and its future. 'Abd-al-Ghafur added: The LDP congress is being held under complicated international circumstances, in which world peoples are resisting all that has been brought by the so-called new world order; namely, the U.S. attempts to dominate the world, and the double standards employed in handling the issues of international legitimacy, democracy, and human rights, and abusing these values to interfere in the domestic affairs of world peoples and deny them the right to lead the free and decent life they deserve, not to mention the use of the United Nations to oppress world peoples in violation of the UN Charter and international conventions through the enforcement of embargoes against world peoples to achieve selfish and rancorous political objectives. 'Abd-al-Ghafur noted that the Iraqi people have been suffering from an unfair and tyrannical embargo for the past four years because they are determined to walk the path they have chosen, and also because they are opposed to U.S. bids to control their resources and undermine their national sovereignty. He noted that the enforcement of the embargo against Iraq is a form of international dictatorship practiced by the United States against the world community and the United Nations in order to achieve its objective of domination. 'Abd-al-Ghafur called for the lifting of the economic embargo clamped on the Iraqi people, saying: Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments per the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, even though they are unfair resolutions, at a time when the Council has failed to honor its commitments toward Iraq due to U.S. interference. This has been clearly manifest during the recent UN Security Council deliberations. For the first time, there has been a rift among the UN Security Council members, particularly the permanent members. The positions of Russia, the PRC, and France were marked by a measure of objectivity. These positions marked a departure from the U.S. position, and insisted that Iraq be granted some of its rights by way of implementing Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687, which allows Iraq to export its oil. The Iraqi official hoped that Russia's recent position at the UN Security Council will be promoted and become more effective to help lift the embargo and end the sufferings of the Iraqi people. He asked the congress to attach special attention to the issue of enforcing embargoes on peoples as a means to achieve political objectives to the detriment of these peoples' interests. He also urged the conferees to come up with decisions and recommendations demanding an end to the embargo clamped on the Iraqi people, particularly since Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments. The Ba'th official commended the struggle being waged by the Russian people to uphold their dignity, sovereignty, and independent decisionmaking, as well as their rejection of attempts to impose custodianship and domination on them and the attempts being made by some international forces that profess false concern for them and their future at a time when they seek to weaken Russia, because it is not in their interest to see Russia reemerge as a powerful country occupying its deserved position and standing in today's world. 'Abd-al-Ghafur stressed that the Iraqi people will never abandon their freedom, dignity, independence, and their right to walk the path they have chosen to ensure their livelihood, because they are well aware that people who are stripped of their dignity, freedom, and independent decisionmaking are rendered lifeless. He reaffirmed that the Iraqi people will continue their struggle and maintain their support for the leadership of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn, given that he is the symbol of the struggles waged by the Iraqi people, the Arab nation, and humanity against global injustice and oppression. This speech by the member of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th Party was welcomed by thunderous applause to show solidarity with the just struggle waged by the Iraqi people, and with their heroic confrontation of the forces of evil and aggression. In an opening speech, LDP Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had earlier asserted his party's total solidarity with the Iraqi leadership and people, and its support for the just struggle being waged by the Iraqi people to promote their freedom, dignity, and independence. He urged the Russian leadership, on behalf of the party and its fifth congress, to do whatever is necessary to lift all aspects of the embargo clamped on Iraq. He reiterated his party's firm position on the issue, and its persistent efforts in internal and external forums to achieve this objective, and end the Iraqi people's sufferings. Zhirinovskiy urged his party members to close ranks and make persistent efforts to promote the great accomplishments the party has recently made, the accomplishments that have allowed it to enter the Parliament, and that will allow it to win the Russian presidency during the next elections. The LDP leader criticized the deteriorating situation in Russia, and held the current Russian leadership fully responsible for the current situation in the country. He also denounced the plots being concocted against his party by certain government structures in Russia. He called for enhancing the powers of the party leaders. Some 343 delegates and 865 guests, including 14 foreign delegations, attended the congress meetings. Among the most important developments seen during the fifth congress was a decision to hold the party congress every three years, and a decision authorizing the congress to elect the party leader, whereas the party leader shall appoint the party command members and his close aides.
