The 15 December clash took place during an attack by members of a monafeqin splinter group, who call themselves the Execution Squad, at the monafeqin's central garrison in Dayr in southeast Iraq. A group of Kurds also assisted in the attack against the three-story command post. A former member of the monafeqin group who fled to Jordan said on Saturday: The attack took place at 0530 [0100 GMT] on 15 December. The target was the operations control center of the monafeqin in Basra and the headquarters of Mehdi Abrishamchi, former husband of Maryan 'Azodanlu, third wife of monafeqin leader Mas'ud Rajavi. During the attack, seven missiles were fired at the building and five leaders of the terrorist group were killed on the spot. A former member of the monafeqin group, who says he deserted because of the group's spying and terrorist activities, listed the dead as follows: Mas'ud Mazlumi from Tehran, vice chairman of the monafeqin's executive committee and one of the commanders of the group's terrorist squad; Sadiqeh Ebrahimi from Tehran, member of the so-called executive committee and one of the leaders of the group's terrorist squad; Ahmad Afshar from Mashhad, member of the so-called executive committee and one of the main elements of the group's terrorist squad; Adham Tayyebi from Tehran, the head of the organization's institutions and commander of the terrorist group; and Zahra Hosnipur "Hoseynpur" from Tehran, member of the executive committee and a head of the terrorist squad. The former member said: After the victory of the Islamic revolution, these five people were directly involved in terrorist attacks on farmers living in border regions. According to Kurdish sources in northern Iraq, the attackers were members of a splinter group that had deserted the main group long ago in a bid to flee Iraq and was in hiding. They gained the support of Kurds who oppose the presence of the monafeqin in Iraq for the attack on the monafeqin headquarters. The Kurds regard the monafeqin as Ba'thist agents and overtly threaten to take revenge.
