Here special demands are made not only on the training of pilots but also on the design of aircraft and combat aircraft-carrying ships. The Americans, who know carrier aviation, did not anticipate that Russian aircraft builders would be able to develop a fighter aircraft with high tactical-technical specifications, the take-off of which is carried out using a ski jump. In their country, all carrier-based aircraft take-off using steam catapults. But they clearly underestimated our capabilities. That fighter aircraft has already been developed. What is more, it is being series-produced and is being successfully mastered not only by test pilots but also by line pilots. As you have figured out, this discussion is about the Su-27K carrier-based fighter aircraft. (It received the designation Su-33 at the Sukhoy Design Bureau). Work on the Su-33 program began in 1984. It was conducted under the leadership of "Sukhoy OKB" [Experimental Design Bureau] ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Industrial Complex] General Designer Mikhail Simonov. A team of developers headed by Aircraft Chief Designer Konstantin Marbashev was directly involved with the carrier-based fighter aircraft's design. The Su-33 completed its first flight in August 1987. Two years later, for the first time in our country, Honored Test Pilot Viktor Pugachev carried out a successful landing on a heavy aircraft-carrying ship and a take-off from the ship's deck using a ski jump on 1 November 1989.

However, if you compare them from the point of view of combat capabilities and design peculiarities, they are essentially different aircraft. The Su-33 has an integral aerodynamic layout and has been manufactured according to the triplane design. Movable foreplanes, which substantially improve the aircraft's maneuvering capabilities, especially controllability and stability during separation from the ski jump, have been employed on it for the first time. This is the first fighter aircraft of the Su-27 family that is equipped with an aerial refueling system. The wing, tail plane panels, and tail and nose fairings are folded upward to decrease the aircraft's dimensions in the parking area. The fighter aircraft has a very high thrust-to-weight ratio -- greater than one. Two AL-31F bypass turbojet engines that were developed under the leadership of A.M. Lyulka have been installed on it. Aircraft take-off from the ship's deck is carried out using a ski jump from one of three positions equipped with gas-deflecting shields and special restraining devices which are retracted after the engine reaches the ChR mode (emergency power mode). Even from the shortest distance, a length of 105 meters, the fighter aircraft easily takes-off with a full fuel load and a full weapons load. There are glidepath beacons, a radar landing system, and also an optical landing system installed on the ship to support landing on a ship which can be accomplished both in the automatic, directed, or manual modes. The fighter aircraft descends along a very steep glidepath and carries out a landing without the traditional leveling off. After touching the ship's deck, the arresting hook engages one of the arresting gears, which ensures rapid braking and stops the aircraft. A special emergency barrier can be utilized in non-standard situations. The aircraft's landing gear has been reinforced as a result of the fact that take-off and landing are carried out at adequately high G-loads. In the event the arresting hook does not engage the arresting gear, the aircraft has the capability to safely circle around a second time. The Su-33 is designed to defend Naval ships from air attack weapons --aircraft and helicopters, cruise missiles, remotely piloted vehicles, and also to destroy ground-based and surface targets and to support amphibious assault landings. The weapons control system consists of a powerful pulse-Doppler radar that is capable of carrying out search while tracking targets in the background of the earth and water surface and an optical-electronic radar with a helmet-mounted target designation system. At the present time, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA recently reported, the mastery of the Su-33 is being conducted at an accelerated rate by Northern Fleet Aviation personnel. Not only test pilots but also line pilots are already successfully carrying out landings on the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser. Soon, long ocean cruises await the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser and, therefore, the Su-33 carrier-based fighter aircraft.
