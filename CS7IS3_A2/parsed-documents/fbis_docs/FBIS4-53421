FBIS4-53421 "dreas097_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Thailand U.S. Evidence Ruled Insufficient To Try Thanong U.S. Evidence Ruled Insufficient To Try Thanong BK1905051694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 19 May 94 p A4 BK1905051694 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled out the possibility of embattled Member of Parliament [MP] Thanong Siriprichaphong being prosecuted in Thailand unless Washington provides more evidence to substantiate drug trafficking accusations against him. Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said. At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai Montriwat. "The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The police cannot do anything at present," Chawalit said. The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges. Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17 other Thai MPs stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in drug trafficking. Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board to gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry. Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved. Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his stature or influence. Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. Ophat will testify today before the House committee on parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He would infomm the committee of all information he received from U.S. officials.
