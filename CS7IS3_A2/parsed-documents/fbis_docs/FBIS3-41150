As a result of this, some changes were introduced. Vice Admiral Ricardo Villaran Tapia, the chief of staff, was transferred to a "meaningless" post in the National Defense Secretariat. In 1992, Villaran was in charge of the General Command of Naval Zones (Congezonas), a key post with command of troops. Villaran is the second most senior on-duty vice admiral. Another Vice Admiral who protested, Luis Giampetri Rojas, was also punished. He was designated chief of staff, a bureaucratic post with little power. Giampietri headed Congezonas in 1993.
