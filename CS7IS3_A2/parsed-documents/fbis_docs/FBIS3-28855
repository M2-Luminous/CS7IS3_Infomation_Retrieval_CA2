In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said the stakes in Bosnia are high for the international community and failure to effectively implement the latest ultimatum would lead not only to more innocent lives lost in Bosnia, it could also send a wrong signal that the international community is now prepared to tolerate and accept aggression. The Foreign Ministry notes that the immediate response of the Bosnian Serbs has been to call for a cease-fire around Sarajevo. However, the ministry adds that the Bosnian Serbs have established a cynical pattern of bending to international pressures but immediately reverting to their indiscriminate attacks when the threat of military action is lifted.
