In an interview published in the first edition of the independent SAVANA newspaper, the Renamo leader did, however, say that Renamo does not intend a return to war. Leonel Matias, our correspondent in Maputo, reports: In an interview he granted to the BBC, Jose de Castro, Renamo's number-one man for electoral matters, noted that his movement had received promises of financing for its transformation into a political party, as long as it signed the General Peace Accord. Jose de Castro says that the accord was signed, but those countries have not complied with their undertakings yet. [Begin Castro recording] We find ourselves in a precarious situation that does not allow us to be at peace to face up to the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo. In view of that, we believe such support would be necessary, seeing that it has been promised. If you promise, you owe. [end recording] I also asked Jose de Castro how much money Renamo thinks the international community should make available. He did not provide figures, but said that Renamo needs a great deal of money. [Begin Castro recording] At this stage, we have delegates working from their own homes. They do not have [words indistinct] residences. It is important to note that those are key provinces, notably those where we believe some conditions should have been in place but are not. [end recording] It should be noted that the United Nations has already created a special fund for Renamo. That fund is worth $6 million. I asked Jose de Castro whether that amount would not be enough: [Begin Castro recording] We need transportation. We need homes. We need fax machines. We need machines. In other words, we need so many things that we see $6 million as less than a drop in the ocean. [end recording] Reports doing the rounds in the Mozambican capital today say that EC countries have decided to support the special fund that has been created for Renamo. However, no details are available at this stage. Reacting this afternoon to the statement made by the Renamo leader, Transport and Communications Minister Armando Guebuza, government representative in the Supervision and Control Commission, described Afonso Dhlakama's threats as blackmail. [Begin recording] [Guebuza] I hope that the Renamo leader will reconsider that demand, because it cannot be used to blackmail our people. [Matias] Do you see it as blackmail? [Guebuza] I cannot see any better explanation for it. Our people want money but they know they will only have it once there is stability in the country. [end recording]
