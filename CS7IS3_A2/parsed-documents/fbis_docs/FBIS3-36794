During the meeting, the premier expressed concern over recent events in Abkhazia. The Abkhaz side has for a fourth time violated the Geneva agreement. On 6 February groups of armed militants attacked the Georgian population, killing 60 people and taking many people prisoner. Villlages were burned down. Militants also attacked a village in Tsalenjikha Rayon, killing five people. About 3,000 people, including children and women, are sheltering in a gorge. It is difficult to evacuate them from there due to thick snow. The premier said that everything is being done to evacuate the population. Heavy equipment, including 15 tanks, has been used to eliminate the Georgian population. Militants of Chechen, Cossack, and other nationalities had been brought to the area on Ikarus buses. The premier stressed that the authorities of the Republic of Georgia have been doing everything to achieve a political settlement of the conflict. Not a single armed Georgian fighter is in the area. The premier asked Mr. Starcevic to convey to the United Nations full information on the current situation in Abkhazia and force the separatists to observe the Geneva agreement.
