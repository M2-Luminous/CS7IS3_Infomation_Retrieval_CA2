In many respects, the topics discussed were more of interest to the United States than to Central America, an area that is still suffering from the effects of 10 years of civil war and extreme poverty. For the six heads of state who attended the event last Tuesday, the dialogue with Gore was primarily aimed at determining the White House's position on the possibility of Central America gaining access to the NAFTA signed by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, which has been in effect since 1 January. The economic bloc with the most potential in the world emerged from this agreement, and access to it has become a sort of obsession for most governments in Latin America. According to Gore, however, the Tegucigalpa mini-summit was intended to prepare for the hemispheric summit to be convened by President Bill Clinton in Miami in December. Revived by Clinton, these types of meetings were suspended by Washington in the 1960's and are reemerging today, when defensive and vindictive strategies for the Ibero-American summit are being consolidated. Predictions became realities in Tegucigalpa. Gore downplayed any possibilities for short- or medium-term links between Central American countries and NAFTA. U.S. analysts commented a few weeks ago that countries with key raw materials or with strategic geographical positions, like Chile and Venezuela, would now be among the few nations with which Washington would be willing to negotiate a link to the agreement. Obviously, Central America does not fall into that category. Instead of access to NAFTA, the U.S. vice president offered the Central American presidents "a program that would provide similar NAFTA treatment for textile products coming from the Caribbean basin that could comply with NAFTA regulations. Such a prerogative would eliminate tariffs for some $3 billion in Central American exports to the U.S. market per year. Gore said, however, that for the countries to benefit from this program, to be discussed in the U.S. Congress in the next few days, the Central American nations would be forced to expand their domestic markets for the entrance of U.S. textile products. According to Gore, this plan is Clinton's reply to the existing concerns in Central America regarding the economic effects that could be brought about by NAFTA, and it definitely dashes Central America's hopes of having closer ties to the trade bloc. The serious foreign debt problem, however, which has absorbed so many resources from Central America and prevented it from undertaking sustainable development, was not analyzed in the summit. By the end of 1993, Central America and the Caribbean accumulated a foreign debt totalling $36.56 billion. The Central American region alone owes a total of $25.6 billion, 40 percent of which is Nicaragua's, one of the countries most seriously affected by civil war. As for this delicate matter, Vice President Gore only said the United States would encourage international financial institutions to cooperate with the region to overcome the problem. What absorbed Gore's attention the most was not the debt problem but his interest in dictating the conduct of the presidents of the region in matters of human rights, public sector corruption, honest elections, and drug trafficking. With a population of 30 million, the Central American region, so overwhelmed by social injustice and the impunity with which the military continues to intrude on the civilian sector, urgently needs specific projects that can lead to accelerated development rather than political promises. Economic expansion will be the key to consolidating peace and democracy in the region, but unfortunately, according to some observers here, the meeting with Gore did not open wide any opportunities for dealing with such urgencies.
