Gu Yongjiang, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC), will attend the Marrakech Trade Summit scheduled to run from next Tuesday to Friday, when 118 ministers of countries participating in the Uruguay Round will sign the final act embodying the results of the multilateral trade negotiations and the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. Long Yongtu, assistant MOFTEC minister and secretary-general of the Chinese delegation to Marrakech, said before his departure that the coming summit is a major event in the current international trade community. He said that China, although not yet having GATT membership restored, participated in the Uruguay Round of negotiations since September 1986 and is qualified to sign the package of documents concluded by the Uruguay Round of talks. Long said that after the Uruguay Round documents go into effect, a new World Trade Organization (WTO) will be established, replacing the existing GATT as the leading world trade body. Therefore, he said, China insists that its eight-year negotiations with GATT members for re-entry into the international trade body be concluded before the wto comes into being so that the country can be one of its original members. "China's signing of the documents means it has met fundamental requirements to become a founding member of the new world trade organization," the assistant minister said. He added that China, as a big country and a major world trade partner, deserves WTO membership. Long said that the Chinese Government will continue to make joint efforts with other GATT members for an early restoration of China's GATT membership on the principle of balance between rights and obligations.
