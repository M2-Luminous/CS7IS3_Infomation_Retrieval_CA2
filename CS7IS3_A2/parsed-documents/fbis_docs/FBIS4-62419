Eduard Shevardnadze is not attending the session despite the deputies' call on him to do so. His absence was supposedly justified by the fact that he was meeting a U.S. delegation, but this turned out to be untrue. The draft envisages separation of the sides, a cease-fire, and the introduction of peacekeeping forces along the confrontation line. The draft caused a protest from not only the opposition but the governing majority as well, for the following reasons: A. The draft envisages introduction of peacekeeping forces not throughout the whole Abkhaz territory but solely along the Enguri River; B. The draft envisages withdrawal of the Georgian Army formations from the Kodori gorge, which is the only base for the Georgian armed forces in Abkhazia; C. Peacekeeping forces will not be responsible for the defense of the refugees, which means that the refugees will not be able to return to Abkhazia. The leader of Abkhazia's Liberation Organization, Boris Kakubava, demanded Shevardnadze's immediate resignation and called his supporters traitors to the country. Opposition members put to a vote the draft resolution, which forbids the Georgian delegation to sign any document in Moscow before the Georgian Parliament makes a decision. A parliamentary majority then left the hall, resulting in there being no quorum, but the issue was still put to vote. The decision was adopted not in the form of a resolution, but a recommendation, which enables the Georgian delegation to sign the agreement as a recommendation, which has no legal force. The situation remains tense.
