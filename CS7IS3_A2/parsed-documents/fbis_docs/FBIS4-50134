FBIS4-50134 "drchi094_q_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Southwest Region Tibetan Monastery Issues Statement on `Puppet' Buddha Tibetan Monastery Issues Statement on `Puppet' Buddha OW1405151294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0943 GMT 14 May 94 OW1405151294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Lhasa, May 14 (XINHUA) -- The Curbo Monastery near Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, issued a statement today, denouncing the activities of making abroad a puppet reincarnated child of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba by two fugitive Tibetans. The statement said that the puppet reincarnated child granted by fugitive living Buddha Shamarba and manager Doga against the will of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba will never be recognized by the Curbo Monastery and religious people in Tibet. It noted that Okying Chilai, the reincarnate soul of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba or the leader of Kagyudpa which is also called the White Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, ascended the holy throne in the Curbo Monastery at a solemn ceremony on September 27, 1992 with the approval of the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. He has then become the lawful and universally acknowledged 17th living Buddha Garmaba. The making of a puppet reincarnated child was a farce in violation of the Buddhist dharma and canon of Kagyudpa, the statement said, noting that the farce was directed by living Buddha Shamarba, disciple and relative of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba, and his follower Doga. According to historical records, the statement said, 164 years ago, Diarqen Ogyainxoi Jiudeqinlinba, the personification of great master Padma Sambhava, left prophecy saying clearly that the respected name of the 17th Garmaba should be "Okying Chilai" who would be confirmed and supported by the 12th living Buddha Situ. The 16th garmaba also left a stamped posthumous paper, indicating that his reincarnated personification would be born in an area north of Sikkim called Qamdo. The paper also indicated the names of the reincarnated child's parents and the year of his birth. On March 10, 1992, four leading disciples of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba, namely Situ, Jiecao, Shamarba and Gongzhu, opened the sealed will of their teacher together in the Rongding Monastery, where they decided that living Buddha Gongzhu would take up the search of the reincarnated child, the statement said. The mission was continued by living Buddhas Situ and Jiecao, upon the unfortunate death of the living Buddha Gongzhu in a traffic accident. With their assistance, the Curbo Monastery set up a team for the mission. Strictly following the instruction of the will in their secret searching work, the team came to the Paggor tribe near Qamdo, as they were told by the will, and found the reincarnated child, it said. On April 15, 1992 of the Tibetan calendar, the living Buddhas Situ and Jiecao held a tonsure ceremony for the reincarnated child before the image of Sakyamouni, the Buddha, at the Johkang Temple in Lhasa. On Tibetan calendar August 1 of the same year, the reincarnated child ascended the holy throne to become the 17th living Buddha Garmaba, in the Curbo Monastery at a ceremony attended by noted religious figures in Tibet and nearly 50,000 Buddhists from home and abroad. However, Shamarba on September 5, 1990 claimed that the reincarnated child would be born "in a village by the Baimaco Lake, at the northwest of the Curbo Monastery. [no closing quotation mark as received] His saying proved to be sheer fiction by two searches by the Curbo Monastery, the statement said. Later, Shamarba fabricated documents and privately designated a Tibetan child to be the reincarnated boy, and smuggled him abroad. The statement of the Curbo Monastery said the living Buddha Shamarba and manager Doga have committed a tragic mistake in their deep trap of sin. It also urged them to stop timely before the abyss of their sin.
