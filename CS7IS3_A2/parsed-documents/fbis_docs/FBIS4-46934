It will broadcast daily for 14 hours at 1413 kHz frequency in the medium-wave range (between Youth Channel and VBC) from 0700 to 2100. We will publish the precise date of the Radio VVS first broadcast as soon as the Vladivostok city telephone company completes the work for which it already has been paid, the technical substantiation for which has been in the works at the telephone company since April. Radio VVS is another information channel owned by AO [joint-stock society] Vladivostok-Novosti, which currently publishes VLADIVOSTOK, TIKHIY OKEAN, VLADIVOSTOK-REKLAMA, and VLADIVOSTOK NEWS newspapers. The need to set up a new radio station was dictated first and foremost by the information needs of Vladivostok residents. It was also these needs that defined the structural basis of Radio VVS programs: 20 minutes of each of 14 hours (from 0700 to 2100) will be devoted to news--the most current, just-received news. Imagine: On a weekend you are at a dacha or on the sea shore... Moscow radio programs are too far removed from the life of the Far East and Maritime Kray; besides, when something happens here, it is usually the middle of the night in Moscow. A portable radio tuned to Radio VVS will bring you all the information about events happening in the city and kray. How much did AO Vladivostok-Novosti journalists regret that they did not have access to air waves on 14 May! This day is remembered for its bad news: the explosion in Novonezhino arsenal, evacuation of residents of Romanovka and other villages, and, of course, rumors and anxiety. I am convinced that there would be fewer rumors had Radio VVS already been in operation. Our correspondents knew about the incident one hour after it happened, and an AO VLADIVOSTOK-NOVOSTI journalist even managed to squeeze into the car that took members of the commission for emergency situations to Novonezhino. Maritime Kray residents could have listened to reports from the incident site as shells were still exploding, and then read the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper with all the details and particulars two days later. But, of course, this is about more than just emergency situations. Numerous events take place in our city and kray that any person who feels himself an active member of society would find useful to know--be it economic and sociopolitical items or the news from everyday life of the city. Some may say: Why set up another radio station in the city that already has Radio Vladivostok and VBC? And we will reply: The more stations, the better. Each of them has its own audience of listeners, and those who do not have a strong preference for one particular station simply will have a choice. Besides, let us admit it--each radio station has its own specialty: Radio Vladivostok has great shows and expensive prizes; VBC has innovative advertisement, round-the-clock music. Radio VVS dares to make the emphasis in its programming on the latest news about the events and life in Vladivostok. Of course, it will be supplemented by musical programs. Radio VVS information programs will be anchored by journalists whose names are very familiar to VLADIVOSTOK readers: Andrey Ostrovskiy, Marina Lobova, Aleksandr Kartashov, Sergey Filonenko, Aleksandr Maltsev, Dmitriy Khabalov. The programs will be produced by Tatyana Batova, Oleg Erastov, Igor Chetverikov, Stanislav Golovach, and Irina Roshchina. Thanks to AO Vladivostok-Novosti's stable economic situation, Radio VVS is completely independent of political parties, state bodies, and commercial and financial structures. This to a large extent guarantees objectivity and unprejudiced coverage at our radio station. We do not intend to go after superprofits: Advertising will occupy no more than one-fifth of broadcast time in Radio VVS programs. The transmitter from which Radio VVS programs will be broadcast is powerful enough to ensure stable reception on the territory of the entire southern part of Maritime Kray--50 kW. We are grateful to the staff of Vladivostok Radio Center who were able to lease us these broadcast capacities and air time. And we do hope that Vladivostok Today radio will become truly a necessity for the city and its residents.
