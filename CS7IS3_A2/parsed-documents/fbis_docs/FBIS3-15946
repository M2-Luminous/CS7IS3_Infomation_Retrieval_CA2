In 1993, Tallinn's income was almost one billion kroons, but this year only some 525 million kroons are expected to be collected from taxes. "The state tied Tallinn's hands behind the back and took away its wallet," Vhi said while adding that 81 percent of taxes go to the state while only 19 percent is left at the disposal of local self-government. Tallinn produces 76 percent of the country's sales tax and entrepreneur's tax and half of private persons' income tax while only one third of the country's population lives in Estonia, Jaak Tamm, the Mayor of Tallinn, told ETA. Tallinn is more or less Estonia's tax base, Tamm said while accusing the government in attempts to revitalise centralization. "The importance of the state is continually growing along with the centralization of resources and their state-controlled distribution -- planned economy in its essence," Tamm said.
