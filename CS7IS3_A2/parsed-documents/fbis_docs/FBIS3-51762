He heads the so-called Change 94 Alliance. Good morning professor, thanks for being here. Political analysts who were here earlier today called the Change 94 Alliance a Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] alliance because you are a member of the Molirena party, so is Guillermo Quijano, and Tomas Herrera deep down is also one because he works with Mario Galindo, a Molirena member, in the same law offices. [Carles] To describe Tomas Herrera that way shows a complete lack of respect. Tomas Herrera is the president of a political party [Agrarian Labor Movement -- MOLA] and is a distinguished professional with his own merits. He is a man who has fought all his life for liberty and democracy and began his struggle against the dictatorship back in 1969. My fellow citizens who made those assertions made a very poor political analysis. [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, another very important aspect is the fact that you, according to studies made, represent the official sector -- you belonged to the official sector and so did Molirena. Many people believe that your links to Molirena do you harm. What do you think? [Carles] Good gracious! Molirena is a party; in addition I have been nominated by Morena [National Renewal Movement], a party with much vitality, much organization, and which will be successful. I was also nominated by the Civic Renewal Party. These were the bases of my political actions; there are persons, however, who saw what happened yesterday and who do not appreciate what has been happening for several months. My base is the 60 percent of Panamanians who are not members of any political party. [Alvarado] How do you describe yourself at this moment? Are you in opposition to the government? [Carles] I am a citizen who takes action according to my own point of view. I proved this during the four years I was comptroller general. [Alvarado] There are those who argue that your candidacy represents the country's business or oligarchic class -- the interests of the rich and not the interests of the poor. [Carles] Look at who is making this statement! This holds true for those who said this.... [Alvarado, interrupting] The Arnulfists, mainly. [Carles] Good gracious! The Arnulfists also have very rich people, a big oligarchy, and some who are very rabiblanco [derogatory term for upper-class Panamanians]. This holds true for all parties so this is just an indiscreet remark by people. People should show more respect. Regardless of their social, economic, or racial condition, I have, and it gives me great satisfaction, friends everywhere -- in the interior, in the city, in farming, industry, business, and among workers. This is really something silly by people who should know better and who want to use this as a populist and senseless maneuver. I believe those who are carrying out that sort of campaign must by now be regretting this. Wait until they come and ask for help and I reply by asking: What is wrong with you? Are you against anyone who has something? That is not the way. Panamanians who have not stolen any money have a right to do what they please with it and take part in the political party of their choice -- businessmen, industrialists, cattle ranchers, workers, professional people. It seems to me a disservice to the country to make these insinuations. Let us measure the campaign by the candidate's merits and capacity and not any other way. Let us see what can they do and what can I do with my capacity, experience, and knowledge. [Alvarado] Are you coming close to possible talks with Mireya Moscoso, Arnulfista Party president and presidential candidate? This is rumored in political circles. [Carles] Look here, I think we have reached a certain point. We have the nomination and have broadened somewhat the base that allows electoral and political actions. But remember my dear Alvaro: I am the candidate, I am the one who is going to rule, I am going to be the boss, the person who has the program in his head and in writing is me, and that I am the person whom the country identifies as the person who has a possibility of fulfilling a program. What lies ahead are formulas that need to be resolved such as questions to do with candidacies and nominations. Regarding the presidency, I am the candidate and I have absolutely no attachments or commitments for political opportunities with anyone. I am going to choose my assistants among capable Panamanians, so I do not believe we should waste any time on this. [Alvarado] Professor, something that has become very relevant is the president's statements on Saturday. What is your opinion on Endara saying that he openly supports Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber describing as traitors all those in his government, principally from Molirena, who did not support him [the Arnulfist ticket]? [Carles] This is a free country and each person should politically opt for what he believes in. The president should by now be worried after using such strong words. Perhaps in the heat of the moment he said things that I, who know him well, know he does not feel. [Alvarado] Can there be any impartiality in his words after he swore to respect the electoral process and not meddle in political affairs? [Carles] People's oaths are each person's promise. I am sure that he went slightly overboard when he took such a direct participative stance. This is a problem he should admit to. He is going to resolve it because Guillermo Endara deep down is someone who is very willing to obey the law. If he scoffed at it at the National Theater [as heard] and has repeatedly said that he will preside over open elections, which I believe is the case, then he will have to straighten his course. Otherwise, he is going to have -- I know how these things are -- a disastrous last few months in office. Guillermo Endara has a vision of the future because he is aware that he cannot allow his work to become complicated in his last months in office. [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, today an EL SIGLO newspaper headline says that the Legislative Assembly now is in the hands of Molirena, which in certain ways is an opposition party. National Assembly President Arturo Vallarino has said the president could be put on trial for his statements on Saturday. What do you think? [Carles] First of all I must correct you because no single party controls the Legislative Assembly and the actions they can initiate are something they should.... [pauses] They can only ensure compliance of the legal aspects. This is a very delicate topic that needs proper consideration. I am sure that President Endara's attitude in the future will be to keep his promise to hold free and open elections, without becoming politically involved. It does not matter what happened recently; I hope that he keeps to his promise because this is one of his basic goals and I believe he is going to keep to it. [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what other parties are seeking to support your candidacy or join the alliance? [Carles] I believe what we need now are agreements of support for the future. I hope that a process of adjustment will begin among the various groups that have formed and that these groups will join us or that some may transfer their attention to us. You will doubtless have noticed that when these youths speak they have great mobility, while others are not yet defined. I believe that between now and 8 February some will join. I will continue, of course, with the candidacy I have initially accepted by the Morena Party and the Civic Renewal Party. Others, I hope, will join as we go along. This will avoid having so many party groups, and most especially, the great majority of independent Panamanians will start defining themselves in our favor. The candidates are what is important in these elections and not the ticket of the political mechanisms that of course served to comply with the electoral laws. [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what will win these elections, the person or the party? What do people support right now? [Carles] What I can see is that voters want a good president who makes decisions and resolves problems. This is not something that the parties guarantee, it is the candidates who guarantee this. [Alvarado] You visited Chiriqui Province this weekend, what is the situation there? Chiriqui producers constantly complain about the situation. [Carles] Lately I have had the opportunity to visit several places in the country. This weekend I promised, as a matter of economic policy, to fight so that the Republic of Panama can resolve its food problem. If a government does not contribute to solving the problem of food produced in the country, it is not doing well. I told them what has been my norm for many years: to reasonably protect the production of cattle and dairy products, rice, corn, sorghum, tomatoes, and some vegetables. This is an unalterable policy, but I warned that this would be done within reason so producers can increase their efficiency and ensure that prices to consumers are reasonable as well.
