FBIS4-44135 "drweu123_q_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-123 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 TURKEY Ankara, Tehran To Discuss Turkmenistan Pipeline Ankara, Tehran To Discuss Turkmenistan Pipeline NC2406170694 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS in English 21 Jun 94 pp 1, A8 NC2406170694 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS English BFN [Text] Ankara--Acutely aware of Turkey's growing need for natural gas, President Suleyman Demirel declared on Monday [20 June] that he would personally hold talks with his Iranian counterpart regarding building of a pipeline that would transport Turkmen gas to Europe via Turkey and Iran. Demirel's announcement of Turco-Iranian talks on the pipeline followed his request to Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov to "start the natural gas pipeline project as soon as possible." Receiving Turkmenistan's Saparmurat Niyazov, who changed his name to Turkmenbasi--meaning the Head of the Turkmens--Demirel said that Ankara and Ashgabat had reiterated the mutual will to build this natural gas pipeline via Turkey. The bilateral talks mainly concentrated on economic cooperation in general and possible joint projects to develop and operate Turkmen natural gas reserves and construction of the pipeline in particular. Turkmenistan recently agreed to the transfer of its natural gas to Italy and France through Iran and Turkey with a 5,000 kilometer (3,000-mile) pipeline. The 9 billion dollar project also calls for another, 1,800-kilometer (1,125-mile) pipeline to provide Turkey's and Iran's natural gas needs. "We will be the transit point and the buyer at the same time," Hayrettin Uzun, the chief of Turkish state pipeline company Botas, said before the official talks. But he complained about the slow progress on the multi-billion dollar project. A final decision on the pipeline is expected at a meeting between Turkey, Russia, Turkmenistan and Iran, chaired by Niyazov himself, which will take place on August 15 in Tehran. But Demirel said he would take up the issue with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati [as published] when he paid a visit to Iran on July 25. "We want the project to be realized as soon as possible," Demirel told Niyazov, after signing a memorandum of understanding. "It should be completed within two years... Turkey needs natural gas and so does Europe. What must be done is to find financing for it." Botas' chief Uzun said last week that Turkey's economic difficulties, coupled by the strict austerity measures imposed on Botas by the government jeopardized all megaprojects on the agenda. In the economic section of the talks, the two presidents have discussed a number of projects from a Turkish carpet factory in Turkmenistan to a "Turkmenbasi port" on the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan has the third largest number of Turkish contractors and the volume of trade in 1993 was 160 million dollars. Other projects include selling Turkish electricity to Turkmenistan and construction of roads and railways for this Central Asian republic. "The two countries have given each other most favored nation status," President Demirel said. On the political platform, the two presidents have discussed the venues of two upcoming international conferences. Niyazov said his country would be happy to host the next summit of Economic Cooperation Organization--a group founded by Turkey, Iran and Pakistan and later joined by Afghanistan, Turkic republics and Tajikistan. "The summit was originally scheduled to take place in Pakistan but, if Pakistan agrees, the next venue can be Ashgabat," Demirel said. He also said that they have decided to have Istanbul, instead of Baku, as the next venue of a Turkic Summit. This was interpreted as a way to overcome the reluctance of Turkic leaders to hold the summit in the capital of Azerbaijan which is involved in fighting with another CIS member, Armenia. The Baku meeting, which was scheduled for last December, was not realized partly due to tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, which had provided natural gas to Armenia. Both countries have taken pains to stress that their cooperation was "not against any third party." "We have a firm relationship based on mutual interest," Demirel said. 'No country should feel threatened by this."
