The commission proposed that the Supreme Soviet should dismiss a number of government officials on various charges, among them -- Vice Premiers Stanislav Bril and Nikolay Kostikov and National Bank President Stanislav Bogdankevich. Head of the commission Aleksandr Lukashenko in an interview with Interfax pledged his commitment to further investigations with "the help and understanding of ordinary people and decent members of the Interior Ministry, KGB and prosecutor general's office who may want to cooperate with the commission." Nor does he rule out the possibility of cooperating with the media because it has a wide spectrum of information. Lukashenko raised fears the next session to be held in mid-May could wind up his commission.
