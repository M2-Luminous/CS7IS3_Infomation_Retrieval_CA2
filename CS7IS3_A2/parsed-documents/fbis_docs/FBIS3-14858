That, incidentally, is what the administration is being strongly advised to do -- and by those who themselves headed the special services in the past. But Washington decided that it was far more important to "punish" Moscow as quickly as possible (Moscow, mind you, and not Ames or those in the CIA who allowed this failure to occur). They announced the expulsion of the Russian diplomat, Aleksandr Lysenko. Lysenko was asked to leave purely because of the position he held at the Russian embassy (he was accredited to Washington as an intelligence officer and dealt with cooperation between the two countries' special services), and not because he was in any way implicated in the "Ames affair". No accusations have been levelled against him. Is it any wonder, after this, that James Morris, an American diplomat who worked as a counsellor at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, now has to leave the Russian capital far earlier than he intended to? He has been given seven days to leave. However, to be more precise, Morris was not a diplomat, but a CIA officer holding a diplomatic passport. One would rather not use expressions like "an eye for an eye" or "a tooth for a tooth," but it would have been incomprehensible for the American demarche to go unanswered, to go without "reciprocation". Washington is implying that it is now time to put this entire incident behind us. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, expressing regret about the expulsion of Morris, said: "We do not expect any further diplomatic moves." Vice President Albert Gore stressed that relations between the United States and Russia "ought not to be determined by such incidents." This is both heartening and encouraging. It is, indeed, time to close the curtain on this affair, but once the fly-wheel has been started, it is not always easy to stop it. Certain people in the United States, including a number of congressmen, are exploiting the "Ames affair" to say that Russia should not be assisted and that a closer look should be taken at its "behavior." Certain people are already portraying Russia's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which helped to stop the bloodshed, as an "imperialist scheme." One is reminded of the euphoria that there was in Washington over the fact that neither ideological rivalry nor confrontation would any longer determine relations between the two greatest powers on earth. Moscow was just as happy about this, but different judgements are now appearing more and more frequently here. Here's a quote from the journal `Nation': "The rivalry is continuing. Now and in the future Moscow will play the role of geopolitical superpower, whose interests, history and character run counter to the interests of the United States." Naturally, the interests of the United States and Russia, as two sovereign states, can and will diverge, but there is obviously no point in seeking out and then enlarging the cracks. Instead one should seek and build on points of contact. The hullabaloo which has been raised over the "Ames affair" is hardly likely to facilitate this.
