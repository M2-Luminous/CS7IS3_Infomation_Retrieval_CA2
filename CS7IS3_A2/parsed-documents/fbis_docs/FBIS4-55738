NATO stepped up air cover of the airport, with an AC-130 Spectre hovering above the airport in the morning and several fighter planes flying over at low altitude, particularly during unloading of the white Ilyushin 76 transport plane. It landed two days after Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the airport when another UN plane landed there, UN spokesmen said. [passage omitted] The first plane Thursday brought in material and equipment -- including radar -- for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in Tuzla, a UN-declared safe area. On its second trip out of Tuzla the plane evacuated five people needing medical treatment, accompanied by nine members of their families, on behalf of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was the first time since the solemn reopening of the airport by special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi that a UN humanitarian mission has taken place at the airport. UNHCR spokeswoman Radna Vikoren said the agency hoped "security conditions will allow the airport to be used again." A third flight was expected to take place later in the day. [passage omitted] The United Nations said there were no problems Thursday and no Serb artillery fire when the Ilyushin 76 made two successful trips in and out of the airport, on a circuit from Split to Tuzla to the Croatian capital Zagreb then again through Tuzla before heading back to Split. The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the UNPROFOR on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14, but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.
