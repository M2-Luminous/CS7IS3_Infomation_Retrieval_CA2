Malval added that in the event international sanctions against Haiti fail, "the armed option is being considered more all the time." Speaking over the local private Radio Metropole, Malval referred to a foreign military invasion, mainly a U.S. invasion, and said that "if an army cannot count on the support of the people, it will not be able to resist, regardless of how powerful it may be." Malval added that Army Chief General Raoul Cedras "is reaching the end of his forces." Malval also predicted "very difficult days" for Haitians, and he wished the Army would prevent this for the country. Meanwhile on Monday, the Haitian Interior Ministry and National Defense (not recognized by the international community) issued a communique announcing that "any attack (from abroad) will provoke a reply, even a suicidal reply." "The army has received instructions "to defend Haitian territory," the communique pointed out while protesting over "the violation of Haitian waters by foreign warships." The communique concludes by asking the people to remain "calm and alert in the face of provocations." Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination announced it had "taken note" of statements made on Friday by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, president in exile, to THE NEW YORK TIMES in favor of a foreign military intervention after he spoke out in favor of total embargo. The government communique requests there be a legal proceedings case against "all citizens who try, through their actions or words, to promote the invasion of our country." President Aristide clarified his statements, denying he had asked for a military intervention in Haiti, which is prohibited by the constitution. Finally, a presidential communique signed by Emile Jonassaint (not recognized by the international community) announced the establishment of a national crisis commission led by the economy and finance minister "to administer the embargo and to guarantee the rights of the people to food and work."
