According to Chi Fulin with the Provincial Office for Economic Restructuring, since 1988 when Hainan was designated a special economic zone, a market economy has taken shape in line with a new social security system. However, the official said, the reform of property rights has become a pressing need nowadays, and a lot of state enterprises are far from efficient. By the end of last year, 30 percent of the province's state-run industrial enterprises were operating at a loss, while 70 percent of its commercial and trading firms did not make profits. The province will place more emphasis on transforming its state enterprises into share-holding companies. So far Hainan has approved the setting up of 126 share-holding companies with total assets of more than 20 billion yuan. The province will also foster the transaction of various property rights concerning stocks, patents and fixed assets, the officials said.
