No damage was caused in that incident, but the plane took off abruptly as the eight shells thudded in. Captain Kirk, of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said another plane would land at the airport Thursday afternoon if no shelling took place. The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the UNPROFOR on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14, but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.
