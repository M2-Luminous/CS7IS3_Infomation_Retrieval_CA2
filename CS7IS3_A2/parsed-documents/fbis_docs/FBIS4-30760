The International Relations Institute experts, who prepared the documentation for the government concept of security policy, believe that even the present conflict in former Yugoslavia is less dangerous for the Czech Republic than the ethnic, political, and economic conflicts in the post-Soviet countries. According to the document, which the government experts used when drafting the security concept, the most perilous disputes in Europe are the Polish-Russian, possibly Polish-Ukrainian, Polish- Lithuanian, and Russian-Baltic conflicts. In the context of the war in former Yugoslavia, the Czech experts point out particularly the possibility of the penetration of militant Islamic fundamentalism into Europe. Another security hazard in Central Europe could be the nationalist attempts at revision of the borders and the so-called disputable territory -- Greater Germany, Greater Hungary.
