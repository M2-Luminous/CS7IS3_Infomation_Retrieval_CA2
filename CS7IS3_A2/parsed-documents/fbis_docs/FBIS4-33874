A communique issued by the Presidency of the republic stated that Salinas ordered the Mexican Army to maintain the cease-fire and continue to patrol the country's southern border to prevent any gunrunning. On 11 June, the EZLN, which staged an armed rebellion in January, rejected the government's offers and virtually broke off the negotiations by summoning a National Democratic Congress, whose goal, among others, is reportedly to establish a provisional government. "Attentive to the indeclinable determination of the government of the republic to preserve peace and guarantee the economic and political development of the region, which is immersed in a conflict, the president ordered various institution to continue implementing programs and executing actions that were previously agreed upon," the document added. Salinas also ordered Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis to continue efforts to find a political and negotiated solution to the conflict in Chiapas. The EZLN rejected government proposals but also decided to maintain a unilateral cease-fire and to continue seeking a solution to the "war" in Chiapas.
