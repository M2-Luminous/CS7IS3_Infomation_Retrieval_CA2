"Pailin has not yet fallen into our hands, but it has received heavy shelling from [words indistinct] artillery," the Khmer Rouge spokesman, who requested anonymity, told AFP. "Our troops are continuously moving towards Pailin," the spokesman said from the radical faction's compound adjacent to the capital's royal palace. A police general in Battambang told AFP by telephone Wednesday that the guerrillas were shelling Pailin, but added that they were only firing two or three rounds a day to try and "disturb our helicopters from landing." The Khmer Rouge spokesman said the guerrillas rejected an appeal from co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen for a cease-fire so that both sides could enjoy the current Khmer New Year festivities. "How can we accept a cease-fire when they [words indistinct] our necks and force our tongues out of our mouths and destroy all our belongings in Pailin?" he said. "This is not the time for celebrations." Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh denied Khmer Rouge claims that guerrillas destroyed two government tanks in fighting around Pailin. "The Khmer Rouge did not destroy two government tanks," the prince told reporters at a reception to welcome the new year late Wednesday. "We destroyed two Khmer Rouge tanks that they received from China a long time ago." The tanks were destroyed near O'Lak, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Pailin. The prince questioned the motivation of those who claimed Pailin had fallen from the government's hands. THE BANGKOK POST had quoted Thai army sources as saying that the Khmer Rouge recaptured their former "capital" late Tuesday. A Western diplomat, pointing to the recent heated exchanges between Phnom Penh and Bangkok over Cambodia's allegations of Thai military support for the Khmer Rouge, speculated that Thai officers may have deliberately leaked the news to the press to try to embarrass the government here. General Nhoek Bun Chhai, deputy chief of the general staff, said the Khmer Rouge, backed by four tanks attacked government border police at O'Lak on Monday. "They came from Thailand and they pushed our forces back one kilometer," he said. [Words indistinct] were not yet known as the police retreated into the jungle with a group of 17 fleeing into Thailand to seek refuge, he said. The prince said the guerrillas attacked because they thought O'Lak was an easy target. "They knew that we thought that place was stable and they knew there was just police based there. So they fought us," he said. Although the prince did not mention Thailand by name, he backed the general's accusation when he said Wednesday that the tanks attacked from somewhere "not inside Cambodian territory." The prince acknowledged that the repeated accusations of Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge were causing aggravation in Bangkok. "Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said his patience was limited" the prince said, adding: "But [words indistinct] is also limited." The prince, however, said he wanted to have good relations with Thailand and that fellow co-premier Hun Sen would soon visit Bangkok to resolve "border problems." "His Excellency Hun Sen, on behalf of the Royal Government will try again to let our Thai friends know their duty according to the peace agreement," the prince said, referring to the 1991 Paris peace agreement which brought a formal end to the Cambodian conflict and paved the way for UN-organised elections in May last year. "The agreement mentioned [words indistinct] that Cambodia's three neighbouring countries must protect the sovereignty, integrity and security of the country," he said.
