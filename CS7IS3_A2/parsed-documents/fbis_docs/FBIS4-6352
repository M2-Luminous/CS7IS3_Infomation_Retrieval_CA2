The rebel army however was silent on the gunslaying Sunday of one of its former commander, Leopoldo Mabilangan alias Comrade Hector, formerly head of the Mt. Banahaw Command in Quezon-Batangas area, and a government surrenderer. In a fax statement sent to the MANILA BULLETIN, Labrador Luminoso, spokesman of the NPA command in Northern Quezon province, said that the NPA gains started in the early 1980's and engaged the military in several confrontations. They claimed that the NPA North Quezon were supported by 5,000 organized masses in the armed struggle. Last year, he said that the NPA North Quezon was able to "punish enemy agents, bandits, and military operatives engaged in espionage and counter-insurgency operations." Luminoso also said that people who are using the NPA's name to promote their criminal activities were likewise arrested and told to reform under pain of severe punishment. The NPA leader attributed the people's army gains after it launched a rectification campaign to strengthen its ties with the masses and organize them for revolutionary work in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines. The NPA Quezon, he said, also launched campaigns to treat thousands of people on Pollilo island and the coastal town of General Nakar and firmed up its relations with thousands more scattered in remote barangays [villages] of the island town and the nearby municipalities. Today, Luminoso said, the group is vigorously campaigning to stop illegal logging in its jurisdiction. Pollilo, he said, is noted to be a shipment point for illegally cut logs bound for Japan and Taiwan.
