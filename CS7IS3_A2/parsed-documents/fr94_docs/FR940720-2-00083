Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;317 and 50&hyph;318, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Calvert County, Maryland Date of amendments request: June 8, 1994. Description of amendments request: The proposed amendments would revise the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications 4.8.1.1.1.b to extend the alternate 69 kV offsite power circuit surveillance frequency from 18 to 24 months. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of the 69 kV Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) power source is to act as an independent energy source for achieving and maintaining safe shutdown of the plant if the 500 kV system is not available. Failure of the 69 kV SMECO system is not an initiator for any existing accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident. The 69 kV SMECO system could be used to mitigate the consequences of accidents involving a loss of primary offsite power. However, the accident analyses assume that if the 500 kV circuits were not available, the Emergency Diesel Generators would be used to provide power to maintain the plant in a safe shutdown condition. A historical review of surveillance test results indicates the system has experienced only one significant failure in the last ten years. In addition, the system is routinely used. However, the SMECO system is not assumed to function in our accident analysis, so this change will result in no significant increase in the consequences of accidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated? This requested increase in the interval for a 69 kV SMECO surveillance from 18 to 24 months does not involve a significant change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant of the proposed change. The proposed change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, the proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The 69 kV SMECO system provides a margin of safety by providing an alternate offsite electrical power source. The proposed change does not affect the operation or design of the 69 kV SMECO system. Historical surveillance data and routine use indicates that the reduction in surveillance frequency will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation in the system. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Silbert, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: Michael L. Boyle Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket No. 50&hyph;318, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2, Calvert County, Maryland Date of amendment request: May 27, 1994. Description of amendment request: This amendment would revise the existing heatup and cooldown curves and rates to increase their applicability to 30 Effective Full-Power Years (EFPY). The fluence value that was used to determine the heatup and cooldown curves was based on the peak fluence and EFPY at the end of Cycle 9 and the peak predicted fluence for Cycles 10 and beyond. In addition, a variable-setpoint low-temperature overpressure protection (VLTOP) system is being installed to increase the allowable operating pressure band in the Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) region. The VLTOP system uses a variable power-operated relief valve setpoint to take advantage of increased Appendix G pressure limits at increased reactor coolant system (RCS) temperatures. This system will increase the operating window in which the plant may operate during heatup and cooldown. Specifically, this amendment would revise the Unit No. 2 heatup and cooldown curves and rates for the following Technical Specification (TS) sections. TS Section 3.4.9.1.a would be revised to decrease the maximum heatup rate from a fixed value of 75 ○F/hr to a more conservative variable heatup rate of 30 ○F to 60 ○F/hr which varies with RCS temperature range from 70 ○F to greater than 246 ○F. TS Section 3.4.9.1.b would be revised to increase the RCS temperatures for the maximum allowable cooldown rates. TS Figures 3.4.9&hyph;1 and 3.4.9&hyph;2 would be replaced by new RCS pressure Temperature Limits. The revised curves and rates are based on the predicted fluence value for Cycle 10 and beyond. The following TS sections would be revised to support modifications to the LTOP system. TS sections 3.4.9.3.a.1 and 3.4.9.3.a.2 would be changed to ``trip setpoint below the curve in Figure 3.4.9&hyph;3*'' to account for the VLTOP system. The footnote, ``When on shutdown cooling, the PORV trip setpoint shall be less than or equal to 443 psia,'' has been added for Shutdown Cooling Operation to maintain an extra setpoint that is independent of RCS temperature and is equal to the lowest variable setpoint. The Minimum Pressure and Temperature (MPT) Enable would be changed from 305 ○F to 301 ○F. This change would effect TS sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, Table 3.3&hyph;3, 3.4.1.2, 3.4.1.3, 3.4.3, 3.4.9.3, 4.5.2, and 3.5.3. Due to the lower MPT Enable temperature, the transition region at which the high pressure safety injection pumps are placed under manual control on cooldown and restored to automatic status on heatup would be changed from a temperatue range of 305 ○F&hyph;350 ○F, to 301 ○F&hyph;325 ○F. This affects TS 3.5.3 and Table 3.3&hyph;3. TS Bases Sections B3/4.4.1, B3/4.4.9, and 3/4.5.2 would change to be consistent with the proposed change and to provide additional clarification of some of the existing bases. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) system, including the administrative controls, ensures that the 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, Pressure-Temperature (P&hyph;T) limits for the reactor pressure vessel will not be violated while operating at low temperatures. The heatup and cooldown curves are conservatively developed in accordance with the fracture toughness requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, as supplemented by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III, Appendix G. The reactor vessel material Adjusted RT NDT values are based on the conservative methodology provided in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. Analyses show that the proposed use of a variable LTOP system will not result in a significant increase in the probability of an inadvertent opening of a Power-Operated Relief Valve (PORV) causing a small break Loss-of-Coolant-Accident. The proposed heatup and cooldown curves and associated limits continue to provide conservative restrictions on Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure to minimize material stresses in the RCS due to normal operating transients, thus minimizing the likelihood of a rapidly propagating fracture due to pressure transients at low temperatures. Because the proposed heatup and cooldown curves and rates are based on conservative Appendix G methods, and because the LTOP controls protect the Appendix G P&hyph;T limits, the proposed curves and limits do not involve an increase in the probability of accidents previously evaluated. The proposed use of a variable PORV trip setpoint and the increase in the allowable fluence at the reactor vessel wall results in the changes to the heatup and cooldown curves and rates, the Minimum Pressure and Temperature (MPT) Enable temperature, and high pressure safety injection pump manual control transition temperature. These proposed changes continue to provide sufficient margin to accommodate postulated pressurization from mass and energy addition transients. Calculations have been performed that predict the response to such transients. Because the results of the analyses remain well within the conservative acceptance limits of Appendix G, these changes do not increase the consequences of accidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The new variable LTOP control system along with the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will ensure that the Appendix G P&hyph;T limits will not be violated during low temperature operations. While setpoints and curves have changed, this proposed change does not introduce any operator actions that are significantly different from current operator actions used at the plant. The variable LTOP system will continue to have redundant channels to ensure that no single equipment failure or operator error will result in violation of the P&hyph;T limits. The use of a variable LTOP system does not create a new failure mechanism for the PORV. The failure mechanism for the PORV continues to be an inadvertent opening or the failure to open during a pressure transient which has been previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change will ensure that the margin of safety is maintained with respect to energy or mass addition events in that none of the events postulated could challenge the Appendix G limits. The proposed use of a variable PORV trip setpoint and the increase in the allowable fluence at the reactor vessel wall necessitate the changes to the heatup and cooldown curves and rates, the MPT Enable temperature, and high pressure safety injection pump manual control transition temperature. These changes ensure that the margin of safety is maintained by protecting the Appendix G limits for all postulated transients. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
