FR940728-0-00055 FR940728-0-00019 EPA is not excluding recovered oil from operations downstream of refining, such as marketing or retail sales, because such oil is already excluded from regulation (so long as it is not disposed of). Under existing section 261.33, unused commercial chemical products that are recycled in most manners are not solid wastes when they are recycled. This principle applies to unused fuels that are recycled by being returned to fuel-production processes. (See also RCRA section 3004 (q)(l), establishing a similar principle.) Thus, for example, if a bulk oil storage terminal has a spill of product and is able to capture the spill and return it to a refinery or other legitimate fuel production operation, the spilled product is not a solid waste. (As noted at 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990) however, mere assertion of an intent to recycle a commercial product spill does not convert the spill into a non-waste. There must be objective indicia that recycling is reasonable, and that it will occur in a timely manner.) For different reasons, EPA is not extending the exclusion to recovered oil from non-petroleum industries. First, such an exclusion is beyond the scope of the proposed rule. It is also beyond the scope of the judicial decisions construing the definition of solid waste. These decisions indicate that when one industry sends its residual materials to another industry for recycling, the initial industry can be considered to have discarded them. API v. EPA, 906 F. 2d at 741&hyph;42; Ilco v. EPA, 996 F. 2d 1126 (11th Cir. 1993). EPA is also concerned that when recovered oil originates with non-petroleum industries, the likelihood increases that the oil can be contaminated with toxic constituents that would not normally be found in petroleum industry recovered oil. See generally, 56 FR at 48009 (Sept. 23, 1991); and see, e.g., EPA's Development Document for effluent guidelines for the iron and steel industry (skimmed oil from iron and steel industry contains contaminants not found in petroleum recovered oil). 6 Such oily material consequently is more likely to differ from the feedstocks customarily processed by refineries and thus need not be viewed as part of that process, and may also pose risks that can be viewed as part of the waste disposal problem. Finally, the Agency is studying this issue under the aegis of the Solid Waste Definition Task Force and is not at a point where it is in a position to make a final determination. 7 6 Volumes I&hyph;V of Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category, U.S. EPA, May 1982, National Technical Information Service # PB82&hyph;240&hyph;425, &hyph;433, &hyph;458, &hyph;466, and &hyph;474. See specifically Volume III, pp. 395&hyph;398; Volume IV, pp. 107&hyph;129; Volume V, p. 227. 7 EPA also notes that when Congress created certain exemptions (not exclusions) from hazardous waste fuel labelling requirements to accommodate certain petroleum industry practices involving recovered oil, it limited the scope of those exemptions to fuels produced from oily materials ``resulting from normal petroleum refining, production and transportation practices'', RCRA section 3004 (r)(3). This is similar to the scope of today's rule. B. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil and Not Wastewater from Being a Solid Waste EPA is also determining today that the oil that is skimmed from plant wastewaters during wastewater treatment (normally during the initial oil/water/solids separation step occurring during primary wastewater treatment), as well as oil recovered from other sources, is not a solid waste if it is going to be inserted into the refining process prior to the point in the process where crude distillation or catalytic cracking occurs. Thus, the recovered oil systems themselves would not be waste management units. (These units may, however, contain hazardous wastes, such as K049, which become subject to regulation when removed from such units. See 40 CFR 261.4 (c), which says that hazardous waste regulation does not begin for (among other things) hazardous waste which is generated in an associated non-waste-treatment-manufacturing unit until the waste is removed from the unit.) The petroleum industry argued in its public comments to the January 8, 1988 proposal that plant wastewaters containing oil are not solid wastes either. Rather, they characterize the primary wastewater treatment operations in which oil is skimmed from plant waters as still being part of the refining process. Thus, the argument goes, any step at a refinery that involves some recovery of oil for further use is still part of the ongoing refining process and cannot involve solid waste under the holding of AMC I . EPA disagrees with respect to primary wastewater treatment operations. These operations do not involve secondary materials that are ``recycled and reused in an ongoing manufacturing or industrial process'', AMC I , 824 F. 2d at 1186 (emphasis original); see also AMC II , 907 F. 2d at 1186 ( AMC I concerns only ``materials that are `destined for immediate reuse in another phase of the industry's ongoing production process''') (emphasis original). Primary wastewater treatment operations exist to treat plant wastewater. The percentage of oil in plant wastewaters that form the influent to primary wastewater treatment is minuscule, on the order of .0001 % to .000001 % ( i.e. from 1 to 100 parts per million oil). See Tables in Section V, Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category. While some oil may be recovered from this wastewater (an activity the Agency certainly encourages, and indeed requires to prevent the oil's discharge to surface waters and POTWs), the amounts are not significant in the context of a refinery's overall production activities. Clearly, wastewater treatment is the main purpose of the systems in question, and any oil recovery is of secondary import. Refinery wastewater is not a ``secondary material immediately reused within an industrial process''. Chemical Waste Management v. EPA , 976 F. 2d at 14. Primary wastewater treatment is the first step in the wastewater treatment process that purifies the discarded wastewaters from the refining process so that those discarded waters can ultimately be discharged to navigable waters pursuant to Clean Water Act requirements. That a small amount of oil is removed from these wastewaters in the course of treatment does not make wastewater treatment a petroleum refining operation. Put another way, the fact that a small amount of oil may be recovered from large volumes of the discarded plant wastewaters does not require EPA to consider those operations to involve non-discarded materials, and hence to exclude all of the materials going to primary wastewater treatment operations from the definition of solid waste. AMC II , 907 F.2d at 1186&hyph;7 (``discarded'' is an ambiguous term that EPA may interpret in a reasonable manner, and EPA's interpretation that recoverable materials managed in wastewater treatment operations containing surface impoundments were discarded solid wastes was reasonable).
