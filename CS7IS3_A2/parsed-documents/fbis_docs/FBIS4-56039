In his address he stressed that Croatia had good relations with almost all neighboring and European countries. Official Italy has contributed to this, he said, by denying worrying statements made by Italian neofascists regarding Croatia's territorial integrity. For Croatian diplomacy, the most important task at the moment is to achieve the simultaneous resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of UN Protected Areas into the legal system of Croatia, while the sanctions against Serbia ought to be linked with the progress reached in negotiations on UN Protected Areas. He warned that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] mandate will not be extended if its troops are not deployed along Croatia's borders with Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and unless it prevents ethnic cleansing. Minister Granic assessed the Vienna agreement on the implementation of the Washington Agreement as being extremely important for Croatia and stressed: [Begin Granic recording] The Zagreb cease-fire agreement is supported by all countries and by international financial institutions. We must carry out our diplomatic activities carefully, and gain support from international factors for all activities that we will be undertaking in connection with UNPROFOR. But the key issue is how the Washington Agreement is going to be implemented. [end recording] [Correspondent] In continuation, the Chamber of Counties rejected a demand by the opposition parties for a no-confidence motion in the culture and education and defense ministers to be put on the vote, but demanded a report on the set-up of the Croatian Army and results of an investigation into the explosion at the Duboki Jarak munitions dump.
