Kopylov, Moscow] [Abstract] The search for new sources of electric power prompted an attempt to consider the power of the ocean--the principal store of energy on the planet--from the viewpoint of general electromechanics. The approach to developing commercial power plants for generating large quantities of electric power necessitated an examination (qualitative, at first) of the ocean power from the viewpoint of electromechanical energy conversion. To this end, the planet Earth is considered as an electrical machine whose magnetic field is created by a longitudinal current on the boundary of the solid core and liquid magma as well as radiation belts in space. The design of a unipolar electric motor is cited, and the planet Earth-electric machine is simulated by a machine which combines a magnetohydrodynamic (MGD) generator with an MHD motor in a single electromechanical system. It is assumed that the Earth rests on space just like electric machines working in parallel with a network of infinite power in engineering electromechanics. The sine-shaped curve of transverse current on the planar Earth projection is plotted, and it is noted that the sinusoidal curve coincides with the great oceanic currents, i.e., the Gulfstream and the Great Pacific Current. The effect of retardation of the Earth's spinning speed is taken into account. The high probability of a global change in the geomagnetic field and its consequences call for setting up state programs aimed at addressing the resulting global issues. The conclusion is drawn that electromechanical energy conversion has a certain role to play in our planet's evolution and that electromechanical energy's fraction of the total energy balance of the planet is on the same order of magnitude as thermal energy.
