Construction on most of the projects is in full swing, while some have been completed and put into operation ahead of schedule, according to officials with the Hebei provincial leading group for major construction projects. Since last July when China began to adopt macroeconomic control measures, the province has adjusted the orientation of its basic construction investments at the right time and made an overall plan for key construction projects in the province to guarantee adequate financing. Meanwhile, Hebei has observed the guiding principle of optimizing industrial structure and product mix in making investment in fixed assets, speeding up development of basic industries and the service trade, and opening wider to the outside world and promoting technical progress in the province's major enterprises. In the past year, the province completed 54 billion yuan in investment toward fixed assets, up 68 percent compared with the previous year, according to the officials. Construction of basic facilities and completion of technical upgrading projects in state-owned enterprises of the province have greatly boosted the province's production of oil, iron ores, coal, electricity, iron and steel, chemical fertilizers, cement and textiles.
