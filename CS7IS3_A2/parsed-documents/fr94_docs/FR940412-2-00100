ACTION: Call for information. SUMMARY: The Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office of Health and Environmental Assessment, of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is undertaking to update and revise, where appropriate, EPA's air quality criteria for particulate matter (PM) under sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act. Since completion of the 1982 criteria document for particulate matter and sulfur oxides (and its 1986 addendum), EPA has continued to follow the scientific literature and compile information that may be relevant to a review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM. Interested parties are invited to assist EPA in developing and refining its scientific information base to help ensure that all relevant information is considered in updating the air quality criteria for PM. Identification of new information in the following areas will be particularly useful: Effects of exposure on laboratory animals and humans; effects on vegetation, agroecosystems (crops), and natural ecosystems; effects on nonbiological materials; effects on global climate; chemistry and physics; sources and emissions; analytical methodology; transformation and transport in the environment; and ambient concentrations. To be considered for inclusion in the criteria document, submitted information should have been published, accepted for publication, or presented at a public scientific meeting. DATES: All communications and information should be submitted by June 30, 1994, and addressed to the Project Manager for PM, Environmental Criteria and Assessment office (MD&hyph;52), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Dated: April 5, 1994. Gary J. Foley, Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8736 Filed 4&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
