Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, who twice represented the U.S. side in the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks last year, declared: "There are no longer any grounds on which to hold the third round of high-level talks." Kang Sok-chu, DPRK first vice minister of foreign affairs, who represented the DPRK in the high-level talks, earlier said: "If the United States declares the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we have temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will collapse." In this way, Kang hinted at formal DPRK withdrawal from the NPT. However, Gallucci said: "The United States and the international community will not stand for any threats from North Korea." He thus indicated the United States does not intend to back off at all. We have insisted that to completely settle the North Korean nuclear issue, the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks should be held without any preconditions attached. According to bilateral accords reached last summer, the United States and North Korea are supposed to hold the third round of talks to discuss such issues as North Korea's official return to the NPT, special inspection of the DPRK's two undeclared nuclear facilities, and the replacement of North Korea's graphite moderated reactor to the light water reactor, which has a low plutonium conversion ratio. These issues are to be broadly discussed along with other problems such as the improvement of political and economic relations between the two nations. Originally, the United States had planned to hold the third round of talks with North Korea in early June, after holding discussions with Japan and the ROK. In the end, this plan failed to materialize, as the DPRK refused to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) request to follow its regulations regarding separating and storing spent nuclear fuel rods in the process of refueling North Korea's 5,000-kilowatt experimental nuclear reactor. It is a mystery as to why North Korea refused to cooperate with the IAEA. The nuclear watchdog organization had in fact given consideration to North Korea for its "unique status" and made concessions, agreeing to analyze the fuel rods "in the future" rather than "at the present." A senior U.S. Government official has said that the issues of DPRK missiles exports and human rights are to be taken up at the third round of talks with North Korea. Perhaps North Korea felt that it needed a new negotiating card in response to U.S. plans to take up the human rights issue in the third round of bilateral talks. In the United States, however, more and more Government officials and Congressmen became irritated with Gallucci's policy of trying to settle the DPRK nuclear issue through dialogue. Finally, the United States has become enraged with the fuel rods issue. Regardless of the DPRK's intention, high-level talks between the United States and North Korea remains the most realistic way to settle the nuclear issue. However, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, who ardently insisted on settling the issue through dialogue, has been forced to declare "suspension of the third round of talks." Considering such a political situation in the United States, the only way to break the currently deadlocked situation is for North Korea to take a sincere attitude regarding the issue of the removal of its spent nuclear fuel rods. Although North Korea has asserted that "fuel rod samples can be analyzed in the future according to the way we proposed," the IAEA is not convinced. The IAEA has made concessions regarding when fuel rod samples would be analyzed. Now, it is North Korea's turn to make concessions to open the third round of talks. Not only will imposing economic sanctions against North Korea fail to solve the nuclear issue, but it could also deal a serious blow to the NPT framework. Considering that North Korea is being pushed into a corner, there is even a possibility that military tension might develop as a result of economic sanctions. It will require a lot of time for the UN Security Council to discuss economic sanctions. Moreover, its is expected that in the end, the PRC will exercise its veto power. For this reason, the Japanese Government is considering joining the U.S. and ROK Governments toward imposing multilateral sanctions against North Korea, outside of the UN framework. However, we urge that the government exercise caution. It is necessary to continue striving to settle the issue through dialogue, at all costs, with both the PRC and Russia, which border the Korean peninsula, participating in the discussions.
