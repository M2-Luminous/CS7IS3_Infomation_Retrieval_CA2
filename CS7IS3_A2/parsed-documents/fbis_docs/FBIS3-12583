Chavan, today denounced attempts to raise human rights issue in Kashmir by Pakistan and the United States. He declared in the Lok Sabha today that no country in the world has a better record in this regard than India. He said Pakistan teaching us about human rights is ridiculous. Mr. Chavan was replying to the day-long discussion on a statutory resolution seeking to extend president's rule in Jammu and Kahsmir for a further period of six months from tomorrow, which the House adopted by a voice vote later. The Rajya Sabha has already approved it. In his 40-minute speech, Mr. Chavan questioned the intention of the U.S. Administration in raising the issue and asked what locus standi Washington has in recognizing or not recognizing the instrument of Kashmir's accession to India. He said neither they appear to help Pakistan, nor India, but themselves. [sentence as heard] Referring to his meetings with British leaders, Mr. Chavan said he was sure that Britain, too, is not happy with the U.S. stand on Kashmir. Appealing to all parties to consider the issue above party considerations, Mr. Chavan said any internal bickering will only weaken India in the international forums. He also strongly defended the role of the armed forces in the state and said all have to understand the difficult conditions in which they are functioning there. He said there is a qualitative change in the whole scenario, as the terrorists do not have the support of the local population anymore. Earlier, initiating the discussion, Major B.C. Khanduri, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], urged the government to have a clear-cut policy on Jammu and Kashmir. Participating in the discussion, members from all sides of the house supported the resolution, but stressed the need for taking political initiatives to win the confidence of the Kashmiri people.
