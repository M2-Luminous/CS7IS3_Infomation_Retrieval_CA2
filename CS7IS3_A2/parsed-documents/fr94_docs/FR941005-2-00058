FR941005-2-00058 FR941005-2-00039 I. Jurisdiction and Authority The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981) and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). II. Background The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Each Remedial Order firm was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR Part 210 and 10 CFR Part 212, Subpart F. The Order states that during the relevant audit period, they each charged prices higher than those permitted by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make their records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b). The firms were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of gasoline had been sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations. 1 After decontrol, DOE moved to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 20 FERC ¶§62,319 at 63,537 (1982). Under the terms of DOE's motion, the firms were required to disgorge and remit to the Treasury any violation amounts and the profits they had acquired as a result of their violations of the aforementioned provisions of the pricing regulations. The firms objected to DOE's motion which has since been affirmed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Decision issued on August 13, 1982. Id . 1 The Order imposed no sanctions upon the firms for failing to provide records pursuant to 10 CFR 210.92(b). See Remedial Order at 1 and 7. On February 3, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the funds that each firm remitted to DOE pursuant to the modified Order. We proposed implementing a two stage refund proceeding and we stated that applicants who purchased gasoline from any one of the retailers identified in the Appendix to the PDO would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event funds remained after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the remaining funds would be disbursed in the second stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. §4501) (PODRA). We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received no comments since the PDO was published in the Federal Register more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally outlined. Immediately set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications during the first stage. III. The First Stage Refund Procedures Refund applications submitted in the Alameda special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we have frequently chosen to adopt a number of rebuttable presumptions relating to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our belief that adoption of certain presumptions (i) permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger numbers by avoiding the need to incur inordinate expense; and (ii) facilitates our consideration of first stage refund applications. 10 C.F.R. §205.282(e). For those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding. (1) Calculating the Refund We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout each firm's gasoline sales during the relevant audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on a volumetric basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined product each applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric). Applicants believing they were disproportionately overcharged by the pricing violations may present documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in showing they were disproportionately overcharged will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric. We have established a separate volumetric for each of the firms whose name appears in the Appendix accompanying this Decision. The precise volumetric for each firm can be found in the Appendix. Each volumetric was obtained by dividing the remedial order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline each firm is believed to have sold during the audit period. 2 2 In the absence of precise figures indicating the amount of motor gasoline sold by each firm during the audit period, we have estimated their sales using the best available data. Our estimate is that each gasoline retailer sold 50,000 gallons of motor gasoline per month for each month of the audit period. This figure will be used to calculate each retailer's volumetric unless the refund applications submitted pursuant to this Decision and Order indicate that our estimate is inaccurate. In the event the estimate proves to be inaccurate, it may be necessary to reestimate the volumetric. (2) Eligibility for a Refund In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) Document the volume of motor gasoline it purchased during the consent order period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by the overcharges. The threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement is typically satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund is sought and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application. The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb the overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit them to pass through those increased costs.
