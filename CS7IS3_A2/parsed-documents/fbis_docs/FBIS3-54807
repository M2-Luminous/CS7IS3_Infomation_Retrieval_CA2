The aggressive logic adopted by the authorities as they consistently antagonize, humiliate, and snipe at their political adversaries old and new has made the political elite totally isolated. Under the spell of their own omnipotence and thrilled by the passivity of the people and the demoralization of power structures, the liberals easily alienated both democrats, patriots, and communists. And now, faced with the whole spectrum of hostile "Red," "Brown," "Red-Brown," "Black," "White," "international," "nationalist," people's," elitist," "youth," and "nonyouth" forces, they have finally become aware of the seriousness of the situation. But, instead of reconsidering their course, we are once again seeing the liberals' typical, extremist move: If everyone is against us, it is necessary to split the opposition and generate a new civil conflict, and that is also the purpose of proclaiming an "antifascist" front. Incidentally, we would point out that the actual creation of this front is in direct contravention of the law -- even the Constitution that has just been adopted. The creation of "antifascist front" branches in the prefectures (that is, attached to organs of executive power) contravenes the fundamental provision of the new Constitution regarding the absence of any ruling ideology in the state (which means the absence, among other things, of antifascist ideology, which can only exist as a sociopolitical, but not a state phenomenon on any account). But the fact that the Constitution was violated as soon as it was adopted should not surprise those long accustomed to the dictatorial methods used by the authorities. On the other hand the idea of an "antifascist front" is clearly aimed against the election triumph won by Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and thus against the voters' free will, which is the basis of democracy. In other words, in the wake of the "highly democratic elections" their defeated organizers are cynically flouting their own constitution and their own "democracy." The total absurdity of this postelection behavior by the liberals is obvious not only to Russians, but also to foreign political observers. Thus, France's LE MONDE wrote in an article 21 December 1993 with the following highly significant question as its headline "Is Western Support for Yeltsin Justified?": "The main danger to Russia today is not fascism but the policy pursued by the incumbent authorities." In a situation where the "overwhelming majority of voters unequivocally stated that they either do not support Yeltsin's course or categorically reject it" it is quite unjust to say that Yeltsin has supposedly won a "third vote of confidence." Nor did the latest piece of deception as regards early presidential elections increase the president's influence or popularity, LE MONDE wrote. Bearing in mind that France, the democratic LE MONDE in particular, is an outpost of antifascism and democracy in Europe it is quite obvious how other, less antifascist countries should regard the defeated liberals' clownish idea of "antifascism." Confidence in the current authorities in Russia is on the wane even among their foreign supporters. Each new step taken to escalate the political situation meets with increasingly obvious antipathy. So it is obvious that provocation is behind the "antifascist front," but what is its ideological thrust? One Radio Liberty commentator commenting on the postelection situation recently made the following unequivocal statement: "The nationalists' victory jeopardizes reforms in Russia." Let us ponder this statement, which in effect explains a great deal about the reforms. If a socialist or communist victory, for instance, could indeed be logically interpreted as a threat to liberal (that is, radical capitalist) reforms, on what grounds are the "interests of reformers" being compared to "national interests"? Thus, the purpose of the reforms being implemented by the current authorities, as they themselves see it, is identified with antinational activity. Otherwise there would simply have been no panic over Zhirinovskiy's victory, since on an economic level he supports liberal capitalist transformations, which should, in his view, however consider national interests. Thus, the liberals' undisguised fury toward Zhirinovskiy represents an expressive feature of the ideological portrait of the incumbent authorities, revealing that reforms are aimed not only against a socially oriented economy (socialism), but also against nationally oriented capitalism. On a social level the liberals support radical capitalism, the concepts of Hayek, Friedman, etc., and from the outset this made them enemies of the Communists. In the sphere of the economy and the state the Communists were and still are the radical antipodes of the ruling liberals. This was manifested particularly clearly at the time of the August putsch and the subsequent banning of the Communist Party, but at that time other forces joined the liberals in opposing the Communists -- the social democrats, the democrats, and certain national anticommunist movements. The liberal elite began to be "cleansed" of "fellow travelers" at the next stage. The main target being the soviets, the social democrats, and other democratic or socially oriented institutions and political forces. The bombardment of the parliament put an end to the alliance between the democrats and the liberals. Even those democrats who did not join the social democrats, the christian democrats, and the constitutional democrats in directly defending the White House were nonetheless in various forms opposed to terror and dictatorship, opposed to tyranny and authoritarianism. It was from this moment that a progressive split in public opinion began, a split reflected in the democratic choice made by such newspapers as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in part, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (we would remind you of the very honest reporting of the events of October) and the opposite liberal choice made by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, IZVESTIYA, etc. In principle the division of Yeltsin's former confederates and supporters into several blocs during the election campaign also reflected the objective ideological dissociation between the liberals and democrats in the ruling strata itself. Travkin represented the most radical democratic and antiliberal flank, Yavlinskiy was somewhat closer to the liberals, and Shakhray and the Movement for Democratic Reforms went further. It was only "Russia's Choice" that acted as a purely liberal ideological bloc. Thus, the division of the liberals and democrats lent an ideological tinge to the entire election campaign. Zhirinovskiy's victory presented the liberals with a dilemma: Either to enter into an alliance with him on the grounds of their single liberal orientation or to remain true to their textbooks and spurn national interests as somehow impeding a "free market." The liberals' total lack of political flexibility also took its toll this time. Instead of seeking out allies they set about making themselves new enemies with threats of executions, guns, and "antifascist committees." "Fascists" now undoubtedly include not only all "Red-Browns" but also all democrats, who have been rudely repudiated by the extremist liberals. The ideology which, contrary to the statement of the Constitution, has become the prevailing, dominant one in our society is the classic Anglo-Saxon liberal ideology, which denies in a totalitarian manner all other political concepts' right to exist. This ideology is antisocial and antinational. We have gotten a one-party state, which is now actively setting up punitive institutions to preserve the power of the ruling elite. The European newspapers joked that "the Russians will now take Lenin out of the Mausoleum and put an embalmed statue of Adam Smith in his place." The provocative call for the creation of an "antifascist front" is politically important for the liberals. The cynicism and brutality of the "reformists'" liberal measures have alienated all other political forces that are in any way different from liberal orthodoxy. An antiliberal alliance of Communists, nationalists, and democrats is clearly brewing in the new Duma. Under these conditions, sensing danger, the liberals decided to urgently provoked a conflict between their adversaries. If indeed the "antifascist front" even becomes a temporary, transitory reality the antiliberal opposition's strategic game will be totally ruined. Instead of uniting all forces whose ideology focuses on collective interests (be it the socialists' "socium," the nationalists' "nation," the democrats' "demos") against the liberals, who, in accordance with their classic position, insist on the supremacy of the individual, the "antifascist front" would like to set the Communists and the democrats against the nationalists or at least split all opposition movements and parties, particularly those represented in the Duma, into supporters and opponents of "fascism." Naturally by "fascism" the liberals mean any nonliberal ideology, any ideology that differs from theirs, so the time is nigh when they will use the term "democratic fascism," devised by extreme Communists, to abuse their democratic opponents. Similar charges have already been heard from liberals regarding those who disagree with the line pursued by "Russia's Choice." The defeated liberals' "antifascist" adventure would be ridiculous where it not for the political naivete of our people, who have difficulty in distinguishing between a vile, meaningless slogan and a genuine program. Representatives of the older generation of Communists, certain provincial democrats, and even some archaic patriots and conservatives may regrettably succumb to "antifascist" rhetoric. Having become aware of the perfidious scheme being hatched by the liberal "executioners of Russia," all political antiliberal forces have to find a common platform. The creation of an "antiliberal front" is on the agenda -- a front which could include "Reds," "Whites," and "democrats." The existence of such an "antiliberal front" in the Duma could be the last opportunity to peacefully remove the uncontrolled "reformers" from power.
