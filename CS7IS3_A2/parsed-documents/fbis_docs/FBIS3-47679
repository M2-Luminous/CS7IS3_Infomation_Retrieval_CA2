"I do not expect the legislation to be voted down," Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], said at a news conference, referring to the voting on the reform bills at a House of Councillors plenary session expected later this week. Ozawa said most people must long for the enactment of political reforms in the current extraordinary Diet session, which ends January 29. On possible talks between the ruling coalition and the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to seek a compromise on the final shape of the reform legislation, he said the LDP should prepare its own compromise plan before seeking negotiations with the coalition. "Discussion for modifications should be premised on the LDP's pledge to achieve reform during the current Diet sitting and its presentation of specific areas for possible fine-tuning," he said. The government package, featuring a rearrangement of the electoral system for the House of Representatives and stricter curbs on campaign funding, cleared the lower house in mid-November. Hosokawa has vowed to achieve political reform by the close of the current Diet session. Obstacles to passage of the bills remain, however, with some upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] the largest force in the ruling coalition, opposed to certain aspects of the package. Ozawa, a former LDP secretary general, is said to have masterminded the formation of the seven-party coalition last August after he and his followers quit the LDP and inaugurated Shinseito in June. He said he believes additional pump-priming measures and administrative reform will be two major tasks for the Hosokawa government in the event of passage of the political reform package. Monday's news conference was Ozawa's first in about two months. He had refused to speak to the media on the grounds that two national dailies carried inaccurate reports of his press conferences.
