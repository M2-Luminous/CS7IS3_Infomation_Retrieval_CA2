In a communique, the FOGADE president said she does not want to become a negative factor within the Venezuelan financial and political systems. She adds she has a clear conscience because she fulfilled her duties. [Begin Martino recording] Quite frankly, I feel very disappointed that having succeeded in obtaining financial aid that had practically reached 1 billion bolivares, last night it topped 8 billion bolivares. [sentence as heard] Does this help at all? This proves that this week's events have been a determining factor in once again creating a climate of upheaval among depositors. I am not blaming the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV]. During my interpellation yesterday, at no time did I say the BCV was responsible. In this case, all of the authorities are responsible, and I assume full responsibility in my capacity as FOGADE president and as president of the FOGADE Board of Directors. All of this financial assistance was granted with the approval of both boards. Were we wrong? No! At this stage I cannot say that I was wrong; on the contrary, I believe it has been done very well and I believe a financial crash has been prevented, and this is important for the country.
