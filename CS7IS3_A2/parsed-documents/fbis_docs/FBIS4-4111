Wu Yi, minister of the Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, made these remarks at a news conference held here this evening. She said the question of the most favored nation (MFN) trading status was a core item in the trade agreement signed between the governments of China and the United States when the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, adding it is also the fundamental basis for the trade development between the two sides. Wu said MFN is purely a question of trading, saying that China will absolutely not accept any attempt to connect MFN with matters which have nothing to do with trade, especially the human rights. She said that at present, China has set up trade relations with 228 countries and regions worldwide and is not afraid of confrontations that would take place over MFN. She expressed the hope that the United States would properly deal with the MFN issue, saying confrontation will be harmful to both China and the U.S.
