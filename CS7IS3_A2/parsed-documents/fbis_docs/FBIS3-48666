The press statement reads: The twenty-fifth of January marks the 3d anniversary of the formation of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon. We who are involved in the work of Pomminnyon are filled anew with deep emotion and great resolve as we greet this day at this magnificent juncture when all the fellow countrymen at home and abroad have designated this year a year of great national unity for the country's reunification and undertaken the first step for pannational reunification. Three years have passed since the North side headquarters were designated as a regional organization of Pomminnyon during the formation of the Pomminnyon at the three-way working talks held in Berlin in November 1990 following the resolution of the first round of pannational rally on 15 August that year. Since its formation, the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon has waged a vigorous struggle to realize the country's reunification to fulfill its lofty mission and responsibility to history and the nation, strengthening its relations with the other Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad. All the struggles the Pomminnyon has waged for these three years--such as the struggle to promote the implementation of the historic North-South Agreement and the joint declaration on denuclearization, the many rounds of pannational rallies which were grandly held to crush the splittist forces' persistent suppressive and obstructive maneuvers, the meetings of the Pomminnyon chairmen's groups, and the struggle for the abolition of the evil anti- reunification laws, for the release of patriotic figures devoted to reunification, and for the repatriation of old man Yi In-mo--have been just and patriotic struggles which reflect the aspiration of all the fellow countrymen who ardently desire national unity and the country's reunification. Through the numerous joint struggles since their formation, our Pomminnyon organizations have been able to contribute to strengthening the independent might of the country's reunification and further heightening the fellow countrymen's reunification desire at home and abroad. Through the three years of the Pomminnyon movement, we have demonstrated at home and abroad that our Pomminnyon's advance for the realization of the three principles-- independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity, which are the common national ideals--is unstoppable, no matter what desperate efforts the splittist forces may take from their aversion to national unity and the country's independent and peaceful reunification, and that the victory of the cause of our reunification is inevitable. The great advance of our nation for the country's reunification is now entering a new stage, and the fellow countrymen's desire for this has become more ardent with the new year. The great leader President Kim Il-song--who provided a sagacious analysis of the new situational demands in developing the reunification movement and the fellow countrymen's aspiration for reunification--elucidated a programmatic task in his New Year's address this year for all the compatriots at home and abroad to wage a pannational struggle in firm unity under the banner of great national unity in order to bring forth a new phase for the country's reunification this year. Prior to this, last year, he brought forth a 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification, which is a great political charter for national unity. A weighty but honorable task has now been set for the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon to wage a more vigorous movement for great unity of the whole nation by giving impetus to the ardent aspiration and will of all fellow countrymen for national unity and reunification, upholding the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification. Some time ago we designated this year a year of great national unity based on the proposal made by the overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon, and announced at home and abroad that all the activities of Pomminnyon will be concentrated on the realization of the great unity of the whole nation. I declare once again the resolve of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon to brilliantly realize, in cooperation with all the other Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad, the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification and make this year a year of great national unity and a year of opening a new phase for the country's reunification so that we may realize the country's reunification in the 1990's without fail. In the future, we will explain, publicize, and implement the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation taking advantage of all of Pomminnyon's activities so as to actively inspire all fellow countrymen to defy all differences of political opinion, religion, party faction, and position to rise nationwide and unite as one in the movement for the country's reunification. Many obstacles and difficulties remain on the road of our struggle against national oppression and for reunification. Trying to maintain colonial division system infinitely by relying on outside forces, the present South Korean rulers began aggravating tensions between the North and the South from the beginning of the new year by scheming large-scale war exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise aiming at the North, and by wielding the national security law which defines fellow countrymen as the enemy, to intensify suppression of South Korean pro-reunification patriotic forces, including Pomminnyon-related figures. Furthermore, the South Korean authorities did not hesitate to commit criminal acts against human ethics a few days ago. Citing absurd reasons and pretexts, they blocked the Seoul visit of the group of mourners from the North side who had wanted to pay their respects to the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, whose whole life was spent devoted to reunification and patriotism and who fought at the fore for the formation of the South side headquarters of Pomminnyon. The maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group, which schemes confrontation and division and goes against the fellow countrymen's desire for reunification, are by far more crafty and atrocious than those of previous military dictators. Fellow countrymen in South Korea and abroad from all walks of life are raising their voice of rage and denunciation against the South Korean Kim Yong-sam group which wears a so-called civilian mask. In the future, we will not tolerate any legal and institutional devices as well as antireunification force's maneuvers that put a brake on the great national unity. We will especially designate forces that attempt to designate Pomminnyon, the mother body of great national unity, as being heretical, and that attempt to destroy or disintegrate it by outlawing its activities, as the enemy of the nation obstructing the country's reunification and national unity, and will wage a staunch struggle to remove it. We strongly demand that the present South Korean authorities who have persistently blocked the formation of the South side headquarters of Pomminnyon, to promptly stop their traitorous acts and positively ensure Pomminnyon's pro-reunification and patriotic activities. As in the past, our North side headquarters will continue in the future to actively support and root for the just struggle of the South side Pomminnyon-related figures to carry out legitimate Pomminnyon activities in South Korea and will vigorously and continuously carry out pro-reunification and patriotic activities by strengthening solidarity with all Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad. No one can block the Pomminnyon's grand march toward reunification which bears the whole nation's aspiration for reunification. Marking the fifth year of the nineties, we can no longer abide by the tragedy of national division brought about by outside forces. I ardently call on the 70 million fellow countrymen in the North, South, and overseas, to join Pomminnyon in stepping up the grand march toward reunification under the banner of great national unity.
