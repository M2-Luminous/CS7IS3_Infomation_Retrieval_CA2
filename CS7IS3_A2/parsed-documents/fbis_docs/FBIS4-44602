This QWIP is composed of 50 GaAs quantum wells and Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As barriers. The device was made on a 320-�m-diameter mesa. Its primary characteristics, i.e., responsivity and detectivity, are highly dependent upon bias current and operating temperature. The performance of the device was further upgraded through delicate design and improved fabrication technique. The peak detection wavelength is 9.2 �m. At an operating temperature of 77 K, the peak current responsivity is 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] V/W, the peak detectivity exceeds 1 x 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the dark current is less than 0.1 �A. 1. Introduction An IR photodetector that relies on the transition of bound electrons in a quantum well to continuous states near the top of a potential barrier is developed on the basis of research on superlattice semiconductors. The QWIP has advantages such as fast response, high quantum efficiency, variable wavelength, good thermal stability and uniformity. Furthermore, it can be made into a large-area IR focal plane array (FPA), which plays an important role in IR imaging technology, novel IR spectrophotometers and space precision guidance systems. This new QWIP is a direction of further development in IR sensing technology and has become a leading-edge research topic worldwide. In 1985, West and Eglash first observed the light transition effect inside a GaAs quantum well.[.sup]1[/] Later, Levine and coworkers accomplished a great deal in the development and improvement of a practical device.[.sup]2-10[/] A GaAs/AlGaAs MQW IR photodetector (MQWIP) was developed in 1987.[.sup]3[/] Initially, the device was designed to have two bound-state quantum wells. To improve its performance characteristics, they designed a novel superlattice structure,[.sup]4[/] which involved the transition between bound states in the wells to extended states in the conduction band to prevent light excited electrons from tunneling the barriers. Consequently, the barrier thickness can be increased to suppress dark current and thus raise detectivity. The best MQWIP was also developed by Levine et al; its primary specifications are as follows: operating temperature 77 K, peak wavelength 8 �m, and peak detectivity D* = 4.0 x 10[.sup]10[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W.[.sup]7[/] Currently, besides trying to improve performance further, the device has entered an application stage, i.e., fabricating it into a GaAs/AlGaAs FPA QWIP array.[.sup]11[/] It has already been successfully used in IR photography.[.sup]12[/] Based on research done on the physics associated with the growth of GaAs/AlGaAs MQW materials, we began to develop QWIP. The emphasis is placed on structural design and fabrication technique improvement to further enhance performance. A high-sensitivity, low-dark-current, long-wavelength MQWIP has been successfully developed. Its performance characteristics have reached optimal levels known to date. 2. Device Preparation We went through the entire process of quantum-well design, material growth, device development and electrical and optical measurements. A 50-rectangular-MQW (75 Angstroms) GaAs/(300 Angstroms) Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As structure was prepared using a VGV80H MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) system manufactured in the UK. The growth and study of this high-quality QWIP material will be described in a separate paper. Figure 1 [photograph not reproduced] shows the structure of the device. The device is a 320-�m-diameter mesa made with conventional lithographic and chemical etching techniques. Thin AuGe/Ni layers are evaporated on the N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layers on the top and bottom of the mesa. Excellent ohmic contacts are made after alloying. A thin Au layer covers this ohmic layer before a metal lead is ultrasonically welded to it. In order to increase the area of the ohmic contact layer and avoid shorting between electrodes to improve yield, it is required to have a good design for the lithographic pattern, to simplify the technique and to locate the optimal alloying conditions to make the best ohmic contact. The etching depth must be accurately controlled so that it penetrates the quantum well. The N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layer at the top of the mesa must be exposed to make a good ohmic contact. In order to determine the etching depth, a new microscopy technique was developed: REM (Reflective Electron Microscopy) is used to observe the cross section of the etched mesa to directly and accurately determine the etching condition of the MQW mesa. Figure 2 [photograph not reproduced] shows a REM cross-sectional view of an etched mesa. It clearly shows the 50-period GaAs/AlGaAs MQW structure. The bright narrow lines and wide dark lines in the photograph are GaAs quantum wells and AlGaAs barriers, respectively. N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layers are located on top and beneath the quantum-well region. The dark area on the right is an etched pit (the inclination of the pit is due to a slanted incident beam). From this picture, we can see that the etching depth is being controlled just right at the quantum-well region. On the basis of the selectivity principle, the optical coupling of a MQWIP that relies on transitions between sub-bands within the conduction band is different from that depending on transitions between bands. The former requires that the polarization of light hitting the MQWIP must have an electrical vector perpendicular to the mesa. Hence, it usually enters at 45 degrees from the back or uses a diffraction grating. We used a 45-degree incline coupling method, as shown in Figure 1. This incline is mechanically ground and polished on the epitaxial substrate. 3. Device Characteristics and Results 3.1 Voltage Versus Current Characteristics To test the quantum-well structure, dark current and leakage current due to electrode quality, the voltage/current curve was measured at 77 K with no light and the result is shown in Figure 3. The curve clearly shows negative impedance damping. This illustrates the destruction and establishment of resonance between two neighboring wells as the electric field varies. In addition, it shows that dark current primarily comes from resonant tunneling current and it is below 0.2 �A. If the barrier is made thicker, such as 300 Angstroms in specimen G122, then dark current could be reduced by two orders of magnitude to 0.002 �A. This will drastically increase detectivity. The apparent negative impedance damping and low dark current clearly prove that the MQW epitaxial material is of high quality and that the device has no leakage and has excellent ohmic contacts. We also calculated differential resistance as a function of bias from the 77 K current/voltage curve. Over the range of bias, the differential resistance is 1-10 M_O_. The low-temperature resistance of this QWIP is much larger than those of other types of photodetectors (such as a HgCdTe waveguide IR photodetector). Special care should be given to avoid loss of signal due to distributive capacitance of the leads. Figure 3. Voltage vs. Current Curve at 77 K Without Light 3.2 Measurement of Voltage Responsivity and Detectivity The photodetector was placed in a low-temperature E-1332 freezer and the temperature was varied from 10-300 K. A 500 K blackbody source was modulated at 800 Hz and then entered the photodetector at an angle through the freezer window. The viewing angle of the photodetector is 136�. A Keithley 220 current supply is used to provide the constant bias current. An EG&G 5210 lock-in amplifier is used to measure the rms signal voltage V[.sub]s[/] and rms noise voltage V[.sub]n[/]. ``Introduction to Optoelectronic Devices,''[.sup]13[/] edited by Tang Dingyuan [3282 1353 0337] et al., describes a way to calculate blackbody voltage responsivity R[.sub]b[/] and blackbody detectivity D*[.sub]bb[/], i.e., R[.sub]b[/] = V[.sub]s[/]/_Ph_[.sub]s[/](V/W) (1) where _Ph_[.sub]s[/] is the rms fundamental frequency power of incident radiation which can be determined from some parameters related to the measurement system and test conditions (such as blackbody temperature, modulating disk temperature, blackbody emission aperture and photodetector illumination area). The blackbody detectivity is Equation when A[.sub]d[/] is the photodetector area and _D_f is the bandwidth of the measurement circuit. The GaAs/AlGaAs MQWIP is a narrow-band photodetector. Therefore, its performance is usually expressed in terms of its peak detectivity D*[.sub]_l_p[/].[.sup]10[/] Its equation is as follows: Equation The correction factor &Ggr; can be expressed as follows: Equation where _n_ is the wave number. M[.sub]b[/](500K, _n_) is the blackbody radiation power distribution function which can be expressed by Planck's equation that describes blackbody radiation. R(_n_), wave-number responsivity, is expressed by a peak normalized Gaussian distribution. Its peak position and half-height width can be determined from the IR spectrum of sub-band transition. Reference 3 confirms that the frequency-response spectrum is similar in shape to the sub-band transition IR spectrum. Therefore, the above analysis is reasonable. 3.3 Dependence of Peak Detectivity D*[.sub]_l_p[/] Upon Bias Current and Temperature Optoelectronic performance characteristics such as peak detectivity D*[.sub]_l_p[/] of a sub-band transition QWIP are closely related to its operating conditions. We found that detectivity varies significantly with the bias current, as shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, a different curve exists for each temperature. Obviously, each photodetector has an optimal operating point at a specific temperature. At that point, it has the maximum detectivity. The corresponding current is the optimal bias current (which varies as a function of operating temperature). Hence, it is very important to ensure that a QWIP operates at this optimal point. Figure 5 shows detectivity as a function of operating temperature. Especially after the operating temperature exceeds liquid-N[.sub]2[/] temperature (77 K), detectivity drops even faster. The MQWIP developed should also have blackbody response when the operating temperature exceeds 100 K. Figure 4. Detectivity vs. Bias Current at Different Temperatures Figure 5. Peak Detectivity vs. Operating Temperature 3.4 Measured Results Five different sets of QWIPs of different dimensions have been prepared. Table 1 shows their primary performance characteristics at 77 K. The measurement of responsivity and detectivity was discussed earlier. Specimen parameters and test conditions are as follows (for specimen G236): photodetector area 8.04 x 10[.sup]-4[/] cm[.sup]2[/], blackbody emission aperture 0.4 cm, distance between emission aperture and photodetector 20 cm, modulation frequency 799 Hz, measurement circuit bandwidth 24.08 Hz, and window transmissivity 63 percent. Table 1 only gives the voltage responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/]. The current responsivity R[.sub]i[/] can be calculated from R[.sub]_n_[/] and the calculated differential resistance r, i.e., R[.sub]i[/] = R[.sub]_n_[/]/r. For instance, the optimal bias current for specimen G236 at 77 K is 9 x 10[.sup]-7[/] A (from Figure 4). The corresponding differential resistance r = 2.4 x 10[.sup]6[/] _O_ (which is looked up from the differential resistance vs. bias-current curve). Corresponding to voltage responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/] = 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] (V/W), the current responsivity R[.sub]i[/] = 0.4 A/W. This is comparable to the highest value ever reported worldwide. In addition, from Table 1, the most important indicator of the GaAs/AlGaAs long-wavelength MQWIP developed, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], i.e., peak detectivity at 77 K, has exceeded 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W. This is higher than the best level ever reported worldwide.[.sup]7[/] Table 1.

Conclusion The MQWIP, a recently developed IR photodetector, is an important direction of development in IR sensing technology. It has advantages such as fast response, high quantum efficiency, good thermal stability and excellent uniformity, and has become a leading-edge subject worldwide. This paper reports the preparation and characterization of a high-sensitivity, low-dark-current GaAs long-wavelength MQWIP. By way of careful design and process improvement, the performance of this device is further enhanced. At 77 K, the peak detectivity, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], has exceeded 1 x 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the dark current is below 0.1 �A. These are better than anything else reported worldwide.
