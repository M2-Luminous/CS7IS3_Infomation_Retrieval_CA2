Getting overseas Chinese involved in mainland projects will be encouraged, Yang Taifang, the newly-elected chairman, said at the final session of the federation's fifth national conference in Beijing on Saturday. Co-operation with the overseas Chinese will be expanded to trade, science and technology, culture and education as well as hygiene and sports. Yang encouraged returned overseas Chinese to join the country's policy-making process. In January, 1991, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory body, for the ruling party and government, accepted the federation as a group participant. Yang vowed at the meeting to develop the federation into a "home to returned Chinese and their relatives." Yang, 67, is the former minister of Posts and Telecommunications and has wide connections with overseas Chinese. To draft the laws pertaining to overseas Chinese, legislators must solicit opinions and suggestions from them. The federation, in turn, will support the government's efforts to protect the interests and rights of overseas Chinese and their relatives, he said. If necessary, the legislature will set up new projects, Yang added. He also said the NPC [National People's Congress] has sent several teams to investigate and prepare to draft laws that will protect overseas Chinese investors.
