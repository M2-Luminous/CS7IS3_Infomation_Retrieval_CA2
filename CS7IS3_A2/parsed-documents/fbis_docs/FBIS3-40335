They will be employing the unique SIMS (Structures Integrales Monolithiques a pointe singliers) [Integral Monolithic Single-point Structures] and RAC (Revetements contre Agressions des Composites) [Coating against Agression by Composites] process. ALKAN has developed much knowhow as well as specific processes for the conception of primary non-bonded structures. Applications now in development include the oil tank of the GE90 built in partnership with SNECMA, a pod pylon for the Rafale, flanges for aircraft wheels, tank rollers, etc. For many years LATECOERE has been investing in equipment and activities aimed at composites and has now attained a high competitive level for plan layout and production. LATECOERE is a partner in making important structural composites for the CFM56, thrust reversers for the V2500 and parts for the MD11, Falcon 2000 and Airbus. The Boards of Administration of the respective firms have given agreements of principle to cooperation being organized in the form of an Economic Interest Group, or risk-sharing partnership, now being fine-tuned. It will open the way to a pooling of work and facilities for improved market position. ALKAN/LATECOERE -- Contact: Mr. B. Javary - Phone 33-1-43-89-39-90, Contact: Mr. H.
