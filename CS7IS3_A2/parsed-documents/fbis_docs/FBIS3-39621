It was uttered by Davide Visani -- the Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] bigwig who had been sitting at a negotiating table which occasionally resembled a boxing ring -- thus announcing the end of the long negotiations between the eight souls of the progressive camp. An agreement has been reached -- a "positive" understanding which includes a number of "qualified and important" choices. As from today, then, the left can actually launch its electoral campaign against what Visani calls "the old and new right." The last round ended at about 1800, thus bringing also another match to a close, namely, the Sicilian match that resulted in the only serious wound inflicted on the allies by Rete, which was unshakable in its determination to exclude the Socialists from single-member constituencies. [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Del Turco made a forceful protest, denouncing the fact that not even the outcome of the elections in Catania "could convince those who started out with strongly held positions." Competing with the progressives, the PSI candidates will in Sicily also run single-member constituencies, but in a responsible fashion, the PSI secretary said. "We will not dramatize this disagreement beyond the confines of the island." The Sicilian case, they say at the Bottegone [PDS headquarters], was the last hurdle to be confronted. Basically, it confirms the fact that [Rete leader] Orlando's troops will have the lion's share with 26 out of 41 candidates for single-member districts. In Palermo, Luciano Violante will serve as a rival attraction, heading the list against [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, and -- among others -- Antonino Caponnetto, Pietro Folena, Alfredo Galasso, and Gaspare Nuccio will be running in single-member constituencies. In eastern Sicily, the best known names are those of Anna Finocchiaro, Giuseppe Ayala, Claudio Fava, Tano Grasso, and Franco Corleone. The greatest uncertainties have also been dispelled in the Lazio region, even though there is still some doubt concerning the identity of the progressive candidate in the toughest contest of all -- that against Silvio Berlusconi in the Rome 1 constituency, in the elections for the lower house. This constituency is a prestigious showcase including the historical sites -- and some are not hiding the possibility of a "sensational surprise," consisting of an "unimpeachable and outstanding" personality entering the field to take advantage of the 3 percent lead won by the progressives in the area following last December's contest between [Rome mayor] Rutelli and [National Alliance leader] Fini. At the regional coalition headquarters, however, they were saying that it was almost certain that the candidate would be Loredana De Petris, from Rome, aged 36, who was a member of DP [Proletarian Democracy] before joining the Greens, whose parliamentary floor leader she now is. "It came as a surprise, and also a bit of a shock," she acknowledged in her role as the "philosopher" against the Knight [Berlusconi's nickname], "but all in all it will probably be an amusing challenge. Anyway, we will not be fighting only over such issues as sidewalks which need mending...." In Rome, following the established tradition, the list will be headed by the PDS secretary in constituencies with proportional voting; Giovanna Melandri will be leading AD [Democratic Alliance], whereas Ottaviano Del Turco will be the PSI's number one. Catholic Edoardo Missoni, the nephew of the well-known designer, will meet the impossible challenge posed by Gianfranco Fini in the Prati constituency. Much safer constituencies will be fought for by "lightning" minister Vincenzo Visco, in eastern Rome, and Communist Renewal member Famiano Crucianelli, who will be contending with Lucio Manisco for North Viterbo. A good constituency -- Civitavecchia -- also goes to Carlo Alfredo Moro, the statesman's brother, who has accepted Carniti's Social Christians' invitation. Basically, the pattern of the candidacies in the left's strongholds has been confirmed: Turin acknowledges Communist Renewal's strength (with Fausto Bertinotti as candidate), whereas Genoa is garrisoned, among others, by Gino Giugni and Ferdinando Adornato, heading AD's list. Umbria -- reflecting the fact that of 12 single-member district candidates, five will be journalists (Walter Veltroni, Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe Giulietti, Paolo Raffelli, and Leonardo Caponi) -- has definitively given the progressive team the nickname of "the editorial team." In Tuscany, the following candidates will be standing: Armando Cossutta (in Scandicci), Sergio Garavini (Arezzo), Mauro Paisan (Pisa), Enrico Boselli (Valdichiana), Valdo Spini (Florence 3), and Sandra Bonsanti (Florence 1), with Luigi Berlinguer, Carlo Ripa di Meana, Antonino Caponnetto, and Willer Bordon heading the lists in the proportional elections. In Emilia -- traditionally a communist and republican stronghold -- the safe-constituency strategy prevented the rescue of Augusto Barbera, who had previously announced that he was willing to withdraw his candidacy. Among the best known "parachuted" candidates are Giuseppe Ayala in Ravenna, Claudio Petruccioli in Bologna-Modena, and Willer Bordon in Rimini -- all of whom are standing as candidates for the Senate. As regards the lower house, the candidates are -- together with Occhetto in West Bologna -- Gianni Mattioli in Rimini-Riccione, Fausto Vigevani in Cesena, Gianfranco Pasquino in one of the Reggio constituencies, and singer Pierangelo Bertoli in Piacenza. Giorgio Benvenuto will head AD's list in the proportional elections. Among other candidacies which have been confirmed -- in addition to Franco Bassanini playing the anti-Bossi part in Milan 1 -- there are Giovanni Raboni and Giandomenico Pisapia, who will be standing for the Senate in Milan. Giorgio Ruffolo will head AD's list in Calabria, and Miriam Mafai will be the lower house candidate for Pescara city -- a comeback, almost 40 years later, following her long experience as a local councillor.
