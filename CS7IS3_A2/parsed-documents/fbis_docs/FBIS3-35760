After a private meeting, the two leaders will join their delegations for further talks. Yeltsin will also meet local intellectuals and get involved in a signing ceremony for a package of bilateral agreements with the outline friendship and cooperation treaty being the main one. The source said work was in progress to put final touches to some 20 draft papers but the two heads of state would sign only those which were ready by February 3. In the meantime, spokesman for the Transcaucasian Group of Russian Troops Gennadiy Dolgachev told Interfax that the President would probably be accompanied by Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.

Up to 5000 policemen will be mobilized to tighten security during Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, an Georgian interior ministry spokesman told Interfax. Security forces will also be deployed.
