According to several merchants and civilians in Ocosingo, several Army members have told them not to leave the municipality because there might be new confrontations. Ocosingo was the scene of the bloodiest fighting during the first 10 days of the conflict. The reports, which the National Defense Secretariat (SDN) could not confirm to EFE today, maintain that there is tense calm in the town and that many residents have traveled to other towns so they will not be trapped in new fighting. "So far there are no official communiques, but if there are, we will release them as soon as possible," a SDN spokesman said. The SDN has neither confirmed nor denied that soldiers are on alert in that town in Chiapas. For some days Ocosingo residents have lacked potable water and telephone services for unexplained reasons. The residents have asked the insurgents and the government to begin peace talks as soon as possible so they can resume their normal activities. [passage omitted]
