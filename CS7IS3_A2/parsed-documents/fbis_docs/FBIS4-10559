The task force was appointed by the Ministry of Health in February for the purpose of ending the controversy surrounding the quality of the vaccine. "The scientists have carte blanche to conduct all possible investigations and determine the product's real rate of coverage," says Gerson Penna, president of the National Epidemiology Center. The committee, which the ministry calls a task force, consists of representatives of Unicamp [Campinas State University], Rio de Janeiro State University, the Federal Universities of Bahia and Minas Gerais, and the Evandro Chagas Institute. Institutions involved in the controversy over the vaccine, among them the National School of Public Health of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), which advocates its use, were excluded from the group. "In this work, there is no room for anyone defending an impassioned position," Gerson Penna explained. The Brazilian ban on imports of the Cuban vaccine was the subject of a debate held at Fiocruz yesterday with Brazilian and Cuban health authorities in attendance. Epidemiologist Eduardo Costa accused the Ministry of Health of deliberately delaying purchase of the vaccine until Brazilian researchers could discover a similar one.
