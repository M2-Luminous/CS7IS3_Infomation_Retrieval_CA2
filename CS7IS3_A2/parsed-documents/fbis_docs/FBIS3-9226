He claims many projects were incomplete and their approval therefore was against the law. Commenting on the suspicion that Meciar destroyed certain documents before vacating his chair as acting head of the Privatization Ministry, Janicina says that neither Meciar nor his state secretary Ivan Lexa gave him an agenda, and he even had to borrow a secretary so someone could make him coffee. Janicina intends to propose that the new government rescind the former government's resolution on the approval of privatization projects. He said there were no plans as yet to replace ministry staff. What was important was the staff "are able and have clean hands," he said.
