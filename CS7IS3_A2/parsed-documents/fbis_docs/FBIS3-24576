Shelkovnikov; UDC 535.417:773.93] [Abstract] Results are described in this article of studies dealing with the optical amplification in amorphous photopolymer materials GFPM-633 which exhibit a high sensitivity in the red spectral region. The material is designed for recording phase holograms by the He-Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8 nm). The experiments on optical amplification were made with a holographic apparatus using a series produced LG-52-1 laser. The dynamics of diffraction efficiency at _l_=760 nm for recording with optical amplification on photopolymer material GFPM-633-2 is shown in a graph. For this type of material, the gain was in the 2-60 range. Holographic characteristics were also obtained for this material. The relationships of the initial, final and corrected diffraction efficiency as a function of the initial time of exposure for the 632.8 nm wavelength are also provided. The gain corresponding to the diffraction efficiency curves is also shown in the graphs. The mechanism of optical amplification in the photopolymer material is discussed.
