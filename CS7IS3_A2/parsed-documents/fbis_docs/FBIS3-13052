He urged them to stop making mistakes in order to save Yemen from the bad consequences of letting things continue as they are. In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR, Abu-Shawarib said that after all the efforts that have been made, he believes there are people working for separation. Based on this belief, he said that he had resigned from the dialogue committee because he does not want to suffer the condemnation of history, because all those who contribute to the foiling of unity will be condemned by history. He said Yemen will endure, and the faith of Yemenis in their unity will continue, and individuals will be gone, sooner or later. Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expressed pessimism about Yemen's foreseeable future, because the president and his deputy, and the People's Congress Party and the Yemeni Socialist party, continue making mistakes visible to local, regional, and international public opinion. Each party is trying to show it is eager to maintain unity, but this is not the real situation, he and his colleagues in the dialogue committee have concluded. Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expected something to happen in the near future unless reason prevails. He said it is a matter of time. If recriminations continue, they will lead to a military confrontation, and Yemeni unity will be the scapegoat. He prayed to God to save Yemen from the plots of its enemies inside and outside, especially since the situation has reached the point in which reform is useless unless things are returned to normalcy, and living consciences give priority to Yemen and the Yemeni interest. Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib highly valued the role played by His Majesty King Husayn toward the signing of the document of pledge and accord, and his eagerness to maintain the Yemeni's unity and fraternal spirit, and his desire to do all he can to preserve Yemeni unity. At the same time, he expressed appreciation of the Omani role in this field, and hoped that other Arab parties will play good roles that serve the interests of Yemen and the Yemenis. Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib hoped that the Yemeni president and his deputy will return to the right path and do what is for the good of Yemen in order to save their country from dangers known only to God.
