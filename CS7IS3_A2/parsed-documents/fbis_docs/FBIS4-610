Rees] [Text] Bloemfontein April 12 SAPA -- Farmers using their land productively should not feel threatened by a future African National Congress government in the Orange Free State [OFS], a senior ANC official said on Tuesday [12 April]. ANC southern OFS chairman Solomon Nthatisi said farmers operating productively had a right to continue to do so and anyone wanting to buy land would have to show they could put it to good use. However, a future regional government would abide by the rulings of a constitutional land claims court and all land matters would be dealt with within a strict legal framework. Land not currently being utilised, like the vast tracts of rich property owned by the state and military, would be provided to those who could put it to good use. Mr Nthatisi, who is third on the ANC's regional electoral list, said he was currently visiting farmers to reassure them their land would not be appropriated by a future government.
