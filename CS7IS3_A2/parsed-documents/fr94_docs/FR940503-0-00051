FR940503-0-00051 FR940503-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Parts 880, 881, and 883 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1714; FR&hyph;3683&hyph;F&hyph;01] Special Rent Adjustments AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule is a technical amendment to HUD's regulations for certain Section 8 programs governed by 24 CFR parts 880 (New Construction), 881 (Substantial Rehabilitation), and 883 (State Housing Agencies) to conform the language to that used in section 8(c)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The amendment will authorize rent adjustments for privately owned Section 8 projects to cover expenses that are not presently compensated for by annual rental adjustments. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Tahash, Director, Planning and Procedures Division, room 6280, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20410&hyph;0500; telephone: (voice) (202) 708&hyph;3944 and (TDD) (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is a technical amendment to the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs governed by 24 CFR parts 880 (New Construction), 881 (Substantial Rehabilitation), and 883 (State Housing Agencies). The amendment will conform the special rent adjustment regulations for those programs (§§880.609(b), 881.609(b) and 883.710(b)) to the language used in section 8(c)(2)(B), by adding the phrase ``or similar costs'' to the list of substantial increases in expenses, such as real property taxes and utility rates, that may result in the need for special rent adjustments. The ``similar costs'' language appears in other section 8 program regulations (parts 882, 884 and 886), but was never included in the regulations for those programs covered by parts 880, 881, and 883. This final rule will treat all section 8 programs comparably. In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. This rule is being published as a final rule for effect because the Department believes that public comment is unnecessary. The amendments made by this rule are technical in nature, and conform the regulations to the statutory language. Other Matters An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since fair market rent schedules is categorically excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20( l ), and rent adjustments are directly related to such rent schedules.
