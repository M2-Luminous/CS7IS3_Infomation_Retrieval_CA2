Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said he was hopeful that the G-15 and South countries could meet prior to the 15 April GATT meeting to establish a common stand against the proposal by the U.S. and France. The Uruguay round trade accord is to be signed by 120 countries at the meeting next week. The U.S. and France were proposing that a wage-trade link be discussed at the meeting, setting in motion a debate on the proposed minimum global wage standards. Datuk Abdullah was speaking to reporters after meeting China's vice minister for foreign affairs, Tang Jianxuan, at Wisma Putera [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] in Kuala Lumpur. The four-man delegation arrived on Tuesday for a three-day visit to Kuala Lumpur and Melaka. Reiterating that linking workers' rights with trade was unjustified, he hoped the G-15 along with other South countries would be united in opposing the link. The G-15 needed to discuss and coordinate support from all countries of the South, adding that the proposal would have a serious impact on the economies of the developing countries.
