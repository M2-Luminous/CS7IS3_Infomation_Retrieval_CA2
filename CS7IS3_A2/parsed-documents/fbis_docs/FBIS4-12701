It discussed various media issues and approved the amendments to Legislative Decree 104 dated 30 June 1977. I will read the basic amendments to this decree: 1. Concerning publications, the amendments cancel the administrative suspension of a publication on a basis of a decision by the information minister. They cancel the suspension of a publication by the attorney general or by a court decision before a final verdict is issued. They cancel the penalty of withdrawing the license or terminating the franchise regardless of the repetition of the crime and regardless of its nature. 2. Concerning the press, the amendments cancel the precautionary detention of journalists in all press crimes. They cancel the penalty of imprisonment for crimes not specified in the penal code. Concerning the procedures of trials, the amendments cancel the judiciary's power to order precautionary detention regardless of the kind of crime. No measures will be taken to suspend a publication or a newspaper before a final court verdict is issued. The trial period will be shortened. The publication court must start a trial within three days and issue a judgment within a week from the date a case is referred to it. The appeals court must begin a trial within five days and issue a judgment within 10 days from the date an appeal is submitted to it. Concerning penalties, the amendments adopt the same fines adopted by operating laws. They reduce those fines which exceed these limits. The amendments cancel the penalty of imprisonment for crimes unspecified in the penal code. This concerns Legislative Decree 104. The National News Agency will release the verbatim text of the amended decree this evening. The cabinet then discussed the news transmitted to Lebanon by satellite and picked up by satellite dishes. On the proposal of the information minister, the cabinet decided to make an exception: Until the issuance and application of the clauses of the law organizing radio and television media, it will allow local radio and television media services to re-transmit the newscasts and political programs of the following world media services: CNN, Super Channel, BBC, NBC, Sky News, Antenne 2, ITN, MBC, TFR, Euro News, Telefunken, and Dubai Television picked up by satellite dishes after the approval of the information minister within the framework of safeguarding the copyrights of the material transmitted. The cabinet then discussed in depth the subject of radio and television media in accordance with all the proposals submitted to the ministerial committee and the cabinet. It gave the main directions for the options in this subject so that the committee can discuss all the options and possibilities within the framework of diversification and within the framework of constitutional principles, operating laws, and the nature of the Lebanese people. The cabinet took into consideration that the television and radio media law resembles in no way the publication law, either from a technical point of view, or in its options, or in its penalties. Consequently, the committee that will meet tomorrow will start on a new draft inspired by the diversification options that the cabinet instructed it to use this evening.
