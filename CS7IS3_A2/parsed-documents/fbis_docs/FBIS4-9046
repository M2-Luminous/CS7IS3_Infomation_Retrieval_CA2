He said that the government had only restricted space for the realization of its programme. HZDS leaders are concerned over the government concessions to the Hungarian minority parties which expressed great satisfaction with an ethnic minority programme which concerns them, Kozlik said. Former Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the 167 days would not be sufficient for the government to prepare early parliamentary elections and that the behavior of the coalition parties did not testify that the elections are being prepared. The HZDS intends to come back with the idea of a referendum to decide on early elections as "laws had been violated," Kozlik said, adding that the petition lists had not yet been returned to the HZDS from the Presidential Office. Kozlik was referring to the petition campaign to support calling a referendum on early election which was organized by the HZDS shortly before its fall in early March. President Michal Kovac rejected calling a referendum as the organizers failed to collect 350,000 signatures needed.
