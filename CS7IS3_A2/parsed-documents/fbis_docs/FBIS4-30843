Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "the Serbian aggressor's provocations that characterized the day [31 May] on the Brcko front intensified during the night. In the evening hours, the chetniks used 62 and 80-mm mortars, Tromblon grenades, and infantry weapons to pound the Brcko defense positions. On several occasions, the chetniks from (?Lipe) opened fierce fire at the central part of the defense. At 2115, the enemy used a hill gun to shell the wider area of Bajici but to no avail. The first morning hours on the Brcko front are marked by the Serbian aggressor's small arms' provocations, which are particularly pronounced in the region of Djukici. The defenders are not responding." Izudin Durakovic, the correspondent from Gracanica, recapitulates the situation on the front in the past 24 hours and adds that "the shelling from howitzers, tanks, and Bofors from [name indistinct] and Besanj continued in the evening hours. Enemy vehicles were on the move throughout the day, bringing in fresh forces and hardware. In the 117th Lukavac Brigade theater of operations, the chetniks used a Broving and anti-aircraft guns to shell Malinjak. The night was more quiet than usual for this part of the front."
