Toyoda, who was appointed chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations on May 27, said it is the "mandate of our day" to pursue dramatic reforms of the political, bureaucratic and economic systems of the country. Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in his first public address as the head of Keidanren, Toyoda said deregulation is essential for Japan to create a more vigorous economy and gain international credibility. He promised that Keidanren under his reign will "think boldly and act steadily" to harmonize Japan's much-criticized social system into one that resembles those of other major countries. Asked how Keidanren will have its schemes for social revolution realized, Toyoda, who is also chairman of Toyota Motor Corp., said the organization will do so through constant consultation with the government. He said clearly Keidanren will not wield its influence on policy-makers by funneling corporate donations to politicians as before. Responding to a question about concerns that deregulation would lead to a higher jobless rate, he said he hopes the possibility can be avoided by creating jobs through the innovation of new technologies and industries. He was cautious on the state of the economy, which some observers claim has turned a corner. "There are some quarters in the economy which are showing bright signs, but such unstable factors as the political fragility and the high yen have kept me from saying for sure that the economy has been improving," he said. Calling for tax cuts and increased investments -- 100 trillion yen more than the planned 430 trillion yen for the current decade -- in public works projects, Toyoda said a hike in indirect taxes such as the consumption tax is inevitable in order for the plans to take shape. He failed, however, to specify how far the now 3 percent consumption tax rate should be hiked.
