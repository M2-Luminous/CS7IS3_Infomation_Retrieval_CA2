The report defines the basic principle for the country's work in 1994 as: taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance; comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; precipitating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; maintaining political stability; and promoting comprehensive social progress. The current 16,000-character government work report to be presented to the NPC for examination and deliberation is divided into seven parts. As disclosed by a member of the NPC Standing Committee, the seven parts comprise: 1) a review of domestic work in 1993 and basic principles for work in 1994; 2) maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; 3) accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; 4) developing scientific, technological, educational, and cultural undertakings; 5) intensifying building of socialist democracy and legal system; 6) positively pushing forward the peaceful reunification of the motherland; and 7) work with regard to foreign affairs. According to the committee member cited above who was interviewed by this news team, in the first part of the report, assessment is made on work in 1993, primarily from the following four aspects: the national economy maintained sustained, rapid, and healthy development; new headway was made in reform and opening up; further development was attained in various social undertakings; and urban and rural people's living standards continued to improve. In the meantime, the report particularly points out: It is necessary to take positive measures to seriously resolve the following problems: excessive investment in fixed assets; the relatively big margin of price increases; the irrationality of the economic structure; the relatively difficult situation in the production and operations of some large and medium state enterprises; the poor condition of social security in some localities; the ineffective crack down on ugly social tendencies; the corruption of a small number of government officials bending the law to commit graft, embezzlement, and irregularities; and formalism and bureaucratism existing in government organs, and so on. The Distribution Relationships Between Central and Local Authorities and Between State and Enterprises Have Yet To Be Straightened Out The report maintains that GDP growth of 9 percent in 1994 is a positive and sound growth rate. It is necessary to intensify the position of agriculture as a foundation, comprehensively develop the rural economy, improve operation and management, do a good job of production in industry and communications, maintain a rational investment scope, optimize the investment structure, open wider to the outside world, boost foreign cooperation and exchange, and continue to enhance the people's living standards. The report emphatically points out that family planning and environmental protection are China's national policies. Meanwhile, it is necessary to conscientiously put into practice the financial taxation reform plan, straighten out the distribution relationship between central and local authorities and between state and enterprises, steadily carry out monetary structural reform, transform operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises, explore an effective way of establishing a modern enterprise system, further rationalize price relations, develop and cultivate a market system, continue carrying out organizational reform in a proper way, conscientiously transform government functions, reinforce the building of a clean and honest government, and so on. These are the major contents of the third part. With regard to the development of scientific, technological, educational, and cultural undertakings, the report highlights the following issues: bringing about the close integration of the economy and science and technology, taking firm control of educational reform and development, making socialist culture prosperous, and developing public health undertakings. In the section on intensifying the building of socialist democracy and legal system, the report stresses the necessity of continuing to strengthen the building of socialist democracy, taking the building of the legal system seriously, and conscientiously doing a good job in the overall control of social security.
