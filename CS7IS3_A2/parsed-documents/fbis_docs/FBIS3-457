At a special congress in Giyani on Saturday [5 March] the party gave the thumbs up to Chief Samuel Nxumalo as its president and resolved to have the party's registration for the elections canceled in court. Secretary-General Ed Ngobeni and Treasurer A D Mahatlani, who are part of the group which registered the party, were replaced with Chris Fankomo and L M Nkuna respectively. The position of vice-president, held by Edward Mhinga, who is also with the rival group, was done way with by the conference which was attended by about 200 people. The conference decided the opposition group, which voted at a conference in Phalaborwa last week to remove Chief Nxumalo as president, be stopped from using the Ximoko Progressive Party name. At a joint rally held at Giyani Stadium with the ANC, Chief Nxumalo told a crowd of more than 10,000 to vote for the ANC.
