[Former Senate speaker] Spadolini really asked for it. He was pathetic when he said that he lost because the others, and not he, presented his candidacy. He was a joke." [passage omitted] Fini is certainly happy about the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of Forza Italia and Irene Pivetti of the Northern League as Senate and lower house speakers. "We will continue in this way, we have buried the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]." [Ventura] The adversaries are accusing you of being arrogant and of wanting to take everything. [Fini] Please, this is ridiculous. These statements are being made by those who have nothing to say. A great many people in Italy disliked clubby politics: Now that this terrible custom of the First Republic has finally ended, here they are shouting out. [Ventura] Why do you say that Spadolini was asking for it? [Fini] His position was a very respectable one as long as he said that he was only available as an institutional candidate. I said that we did not have the majority in the Senate. However, when I had evidence that Spadolini was the candidate supported by [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto and [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino, and that the institutional cover was only an alibi to cover those who had been defeated at the elections, I no longer had any doubts. [Ventura] Spadolini said on the spur of the moment: "The new government reminds me of `Giovinezza, Giovinezza'" [fascist song]. [Fini] This is an hysterical reaction; he lost his temper. [Ventura] Yet things will not be easy for this government in the Senate. [Fini] We know this. At the beginning many foresaw that there would be irreconcilable differences among us, Forza Italia, Northern League, and the CCD [Christian Democratic Center]. Instead we demonstrated our power of cohesion: Scognamiglio got all the majority votes, all "my" parliamentarians voted for a Northern League candidate in the lower house and for a Forza Italia candidate in the Senate. And since eight out of nine life members of the Senate voted for Spadolini, at the Senate we got eight votes that were not from our people. [Ventura] What about the future? [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi has "opened" to the center. [Fini] This was agreed upon with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi and myself. There is a problem of numbers in the Senate, there is no use denying this. However, this opening will take place on the basis of our program and certainly not immediately with the vote of confidence. The government will have to promote a possible widening of the majority with policies that are judged positively in certain circles of the center, especially on the topic of solidarity. [Ventura] Will the center go along? [Fini] The center is weak. Its opposition will inevitably be sucked up by the progressives. There are already two lines of thought inside the meager Italian Popular Party [PPI]-Pact for Italy unit: Not all of them are willing to follow [PPI Veneto regional secretary] Bindi and [PPI Sicily regional secretary] Mattarella. I am very optimistic, as long as the center does not fool itself by thinking that it can stop the renewal and clean-up process. [Ventura] Even the Left demonstrated itself to be compact. [Fini] A possible arithmetical majority against the government in the Senate will never be a "political" majority: Left and Center would have to join forces but they would never make it in the lower house. There is no alternative. The opposition will have to take on the responsibility of making Italy ungovernable, while the Italians want a government. [Ventura] Scognamiglio in the Senate, Pivetti in the lower house. When will it be the turn of National Alliance? [Fini] One minute after the closure of the voting booths, I had already said that we would not make the issue of candidates a problem: We wanted to facilitate matters for the alliance, not hamper them. When the government is formed we will be there, actively. [Ventura] It seems that the deputy speakers will also be from the Northern League. [Fini] In meetings with Bossi and Berlusconi, we never said: You take the lower house, I will take the Senate, then at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] For the first time the two speakers have been elected without considering parliamentary seats as pawns to be moved on a larger chessboard that also includes the ministries. [Ventura] You have been accused of trading votes, of having divided the seats among yourselves. [Fini] Trading, nothing of the kind! These people do not understand that things have really changed. Moreover, I am convinced that, while we all will obviously have to work on the program, the choice of the prime minister instead will fall on the president and therefore we will put an end to the old power sharing system. [Ventura] Will the opposition also remain out of the rest? How will it be guaranteed? [Fini] The lower house regulations apportion two deputy speakers to the opposition. There are mechanisms of this kind in other sectors. The men that we will choose for the institutional tasks will be experts. As for the "rest" we will see. [Ventura] What about the president of the Republic? Some from the Northern League are pushing for [President] Scalfaro's resignation. [Fini] At the moment, the current head of state is a guarantee and not an element of confusion: It is neither opportune nor necessary to question this. [Ventura] A controversial 25 April [Liberation Day] is drawing near. Scalfaro is calling for national reconciliation. [Fini] I hope that he keeps the well-balanced positions that he held some days ago; I viewed this very positively, just as I considered the behavior of Interior Minister Mancino to be very serious: Mancino did not give a damn about the country when he resigned in an emergency situation that can be difficult. There are those who see 25 April as a revenge for what happened on 27 March [election day] not for what happened on 25 April 50 years ago. [Ventura] Are you afraid of the people even after 25 April? [Fini] A part of the Left -- I am referring to the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and the COBAS [rank-and-file committees], will again try to be the protagonists by publicly protesting. This risk must be defused with a good government. If 500,000 citizens start protesting this is one matter, 5,000 party members is something else. The instigators? It is a matter of public safety: The police know where Leoncavallo [former Milan squat] is and also where the Nazi skinheads are.
