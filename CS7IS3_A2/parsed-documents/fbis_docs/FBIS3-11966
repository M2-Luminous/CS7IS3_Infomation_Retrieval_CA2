Luis Becker, a member of the URGN's Political-Diplomatic Commission, said the document's signing will mark a new phase in the country's social and political life, where daily practice will determine whether it is possible to reduce the gap between the proposals on human rights and the devastating reality the country has faced. Becker did not give any details of the agreement, but he described it as a positive step and a victory for the Guatemalan people, as well as a victory for all sectors that have struggled to maintain the values and principles of real democracy.
