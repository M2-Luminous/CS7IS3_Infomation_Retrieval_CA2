Both presidents felt that Hungarian-Polish friendship could stabilise the Visegrad pact (Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia), and European integration efforts. On Monday at his residence, President Goncz received the representatives of Podkowa Lesna town, near Warsaw, which was one of the main centres of Polish opposition in the 1980s. Parish priest Leon Kantorski figured prominently in this, and the Hungarian president presented him with the Imre Nagy Memorial Plaque. President Goncz presented the Pro Cultura Hungaria Memorial Medal to the Chairman of the Federation of Polish-Hungarian Friendship Societies. In the afternoon, the Hungarian president received Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. President Goncz also paid a visit to the Polish Parliament. He met leaders of the parliamentary clubs, the chairman of the foreign affairs and economic committees of both Houses, and members of the Polish-Hungarian group of the Interparliamentary Union. He said Hungary sees closer cooperation with countries in the region as vital, with Poland as its closest partner in the region. The president also valued the Visegrad group, and thought that the earliest possible introduction of the Central European free trade bloc is a basic condition of a trade boom. The Hungarian president then met Jozef Oleksy, marshall of the Sejm, and with Zofia Kuratowska, deputy marshall of the Senate.
