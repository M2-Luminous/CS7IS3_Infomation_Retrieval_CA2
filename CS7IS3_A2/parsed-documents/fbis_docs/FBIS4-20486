The bioactivities of the synthetic peptides were examined in terms of indirect ELISA. The peptide 3 (30 amino acid) ELISA assay has sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent with 55 anti-HIV-1 antibody-positive sera and sera samples from 150 healthy blood donors. Either peptide 3 or HIV antigen inhibition assay also demonstrated that the peptide ELISA was specific. The results showed that the peptide 3 could be used as a highly sensitive and specific reagent for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection.
