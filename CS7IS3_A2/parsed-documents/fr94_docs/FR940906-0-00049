FR940906-0-00049 FR940906-0-00018 ADDRESSES: Submit comments to William Stelle, Jr., Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN&hyph;C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Rodney McInnis, Acting Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140, or Rodney McInnis at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FMP and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 663) provide for rapid changes to specific management measures that have been designated ``routine.'' Trip landing limits (including cumulative trip limits) and frequency limits for the Sebastes complex are among those management measures that have been designated as routine at 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1)(i)(B). Implementation and further adjustment of those measures may occur after consideration at a single Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting. Sebastes complex means all rockfish managed by the FMP except Pacific ocean perch, widow rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, and thornyheads. A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without a limit on the individual number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply to calendar months. The coastwide cumulative trip limit in the limited entry fishery for the Sebastes complex was set at 80,000 lb (36,287 kg) per month, including no more than 14,000 lb (6,350 kg) of yellowtail rockfish caught north of Cape Lookout (45 ○20 ’15 ’ ’ N. lat.), or no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of yellowtail rockfish caught south of Cape Lookout, and no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of bocaccio caught south of Cape Mendocino (40 ○30 ’00 ’ ’ N. lat.) effective January 1, 1994 (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994). The 1994 Sebastes complex harvest guideline is divided into northern and southern management areas along the Washington, Oregon, and California coast. The northern harvest guideline applies to the Vancouver and Columbia subareas, and the southern harvest guideline applies to the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas. In the southern area, the total harvest guideline for the Sebastes complex is 13,440 metric tons (mt), which is further allocated between the limited entry (8,920 mt) and the open-access fisheries (4,520 mt). At the Council's August 1994 meeting in Portland, OR, a review of the Sebastes complex landings in the southern area (Eureka-Monterey-Conception) indicated that, through June 1994, approximately 3,805 mt had been landed in both limited entry and open access fisheries. This catch is 7 percent higher than during the same period in 1993. Even at this higher rate, only 8,371 mt (62 percent) of the 1994 Sebastes complex southern area harvest guideline and 4,856 mt (54 percent) of the limited entry allocation would be taken during the year, whereas 3,515 mt (80 percent) of the open access allocation is expected to be taken. The Council also noted that the catch of yellowtail rockfish in the Eureka-Columbia-Vancouver area through June 1994 was 4 percent above the 1993 catch, and that the combined harvest guidelines for that area could be reached by late November 1994. The catch for bocaccio in the Conception-Monterey-Eureka areas through June 1994 was about 33 percent below that in 1992&hyph;1993, and it is possible that the overall harvest guideline for bocaccio may not be attained in 1994. However, changes to bocaccio trip limits are not warranted, due to uncertainties in species composition and distribution of the catch between open access and limited entry fisheries. In order to encourage limited entry vessels to shift their fishing effort south, where the Sebastes harvest guideline is not otherwise likely to be achieved, and to reduce the harvest of yellowtail rockfish in the Eureka through Vancouver areas, the Council recommended that the limited entry cumulative trip limit for the Sebastes complex caught south of Cape Mendocino be increased from 80,000 lb (36,287 kg) to 100,000 lb (45,359 kg) monthly, with no changes to the existing limited entry cumulative trip limits for yellowtail rockfish caught either north or south of Cape Lookout, bocaccio caught south of Cape Mendocino, or for the open access fisheries. The limited entry cumulative trip limit for the Sebastes complex caught north of Cape Mendocino remains at 80,000 lb (36,287 kg) per month. This action may provide incentive for the limited entry fleet to move south of Cape Mendocino, increasing their focus on other rockfish species while reducing the pressure on yellowtail rockfish in the Vancouver-Columbia-Eureka areas. Secretarial Action NMFS announces the following changes to the management measures for the Sebastes complex taken by the limited entry fishery, contained in the 1994 fishery specifications and management measures as published at 59 FR 685, January 6, 1994, and modified at 59 FR 23638, May 6, 1994. All other provisions remain in effect. Paragraph IV C(2)(a) is revised to read as follows: (2)(a) No more than 80,000 lb (36,287 kg) cumulative of the Sebastes complex north of Cape Mendocino, or 100,000 lb (45,359 kg) cumulative of the Sebastes complex south of Cape Mendocino may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per month. Within the cumulative trip limit for the Sebastes complex, no more than 14,000 lb (6,350 kg) cumulative may be yellowtail rockfish taken and retained north of Cape Lookout; no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative may be yellowtail rockfish taken and retained south of Cape Lookout; and no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative may be bocaccio taken and retained south of Cape Mendocino. Paragraph IV C(2)(e) is added to read as follows: (2)(e) If a vessel is used to fish north of Cape Mendocino during the month, then that vessel is subject to the trip limit for the Sebastes complex taken and retained north of Cape Mendocino, no matter where the fish are possessed or landed. Similarly, if a vessel is used to take and retain the Sebastes complex south of Cape Mendocino and possesses or lands the Sebastes complex north of Cape Mendocino, that vessel is subject to the northern trip limit for the Sebastes complex. Classification This action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is based are available for public inspection at the office of the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (see ADDRESSES ) during business hours. This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(c), section III.C.1. of the Appendix to 50 CFR part 663, and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Dated: August 30, 1994. David S.
