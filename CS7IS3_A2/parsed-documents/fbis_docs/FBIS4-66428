Receives Approval from CARB for Direct-Injection Diesel Engine 94FE0402E Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jan 94 p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0402E Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Yanmar Diesel Engine Co.'s direct-injection diesel engine passed the emissions criterion of the California Atmospheric Resources Bureau (CARB) and was approved by CARB. The engine keeps emissions down below the CARB standard because it has a smaller-diameter injection nozzle and improves the manner in which air is mixed with fuel. It is the first time in the world that a direct-injection diesel engine, in which fuel is directly injected into the cylinder, received approval. The engine that passed the CARB criterion was the company's six-horsepower L70A engine, which is an improved version of the small, air-cooled L-A series diesel engines (3.5 - 10 horsepower) that first appeared on the market in 1990. Starting with the L-A series engines, by June, Yanmar plans to get approval for its upright water-cooled diesel engines and mass-produce those that meet the emissions standards. Small, general-purpose engines with less than 25 horsepower and engines for landscaping work will be subject to CARB's first set of regulations, which will go into effect in January 1995. After two years Yanmar aims to change all of its diesel engines that are subject to the regulations. The company will also tackle more development to deal with the even stricter second set of regulations CARB plans to put into effect in 1999.
