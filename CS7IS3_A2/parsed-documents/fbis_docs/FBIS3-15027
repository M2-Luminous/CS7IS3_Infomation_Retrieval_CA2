Udaltsov's announcement that Russia has backed away from the mutually agreed upon date for final withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia, the Estonian Foreign Ministry expressed the hope that this was just one official's attempt to influence the 17th round of talks beginning today outside Tallinn. However, if Russia officially no longer accepts August 31, 1994 as the final date, Estonia may seriously have to consider breaking off the talks. In interviews with Interfax and BNS February 28, Mr. Udaltsov also tied final withdrawal to "social guarantees" for military retirees and their families, directly contradicting previous Russian promises as well as CSCE and United Nations documents which specify and require unconditional withdrawal. The Udaltsov statements potentially negate the substantial progress made in the 16th round of talks held February 1-2 in Moscow. Despite repeated promises, Russia still has not presented a withdrawal timetable as required by international practice. Nevertheless, Estonia made a concession in Moscow and accepted the August 31, 1994 date as proposed by the Russian side in the 15th round of talks. The Estonian delegation will do everything possible to ensure that the withdrawal agreement is initialed in the current round of talks. The Estonian side is also willing to discuss the question of social welfare for Russian military pensioners, but this does not mean that Estonia is prepared to tie that issue in any way to the withdrawal of troops.
