The reports quoting a U.S. Pentagon statement said the incident occurred approximately 60 kilometers north of Irbil, and the U.S. helicopters had been mistakenly identified as Iraqi aircraft operating in the "no-fly zone" in Northern Iraq. An official of the U.S. State Department was quoted as saying "high level" U.N. officials were on board and between 12 and 24 were dead. Earlier Western reports said the helicopters were shot down by Iraqi warplanes in the allied-imposed zone. The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.
