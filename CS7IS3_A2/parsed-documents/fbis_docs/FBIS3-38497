The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] informed Turkish journalists who traveled to northern Iraq to visit the Zhalah camp after it was bombed in a cross-border air operation on Friday [28 January] that the "embargo on the press is being maintained" and that they will not be allowed into the camp. Several Kurdish sources in the region have claimed that the PKK militants left the Zhalah camp at 0500 and returned at 1900 on 26 January. Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Rasul Kusret, prime minister of the federal Kurdish state in northern Iraq, said that his government was not informed about Turkey's air operation. He asserted: "Consequently, we were not able to take precautionary measures in our villages. We lost 18 people in Sheni, Goreser, and Sune, which are close to the border. Many of our people were wounded. Nine people were killed and 19 others were wounded in Iran. The PKK lost only seven men." Stressing that they have informed Ankara on their reaction to the air operation, Kosret said: "The Zhalah camp is 120 km from Turkey's border. PKK maintained its activities in areas close to Turkey. We signed a protocol with that organization and allowed its members to settle in the Zhalah camp. Our objective was to keep the PKK away from the border. Turkey is aware of that. The protocol we have signed is still valid. The PKK members are in the Zhalah camp. That is where they maintain their activities." Local sources have said that 1,200 militants were based in that camp until recently. However, they also said that considering the possibility of an air attack, the PKK recently reduced the number of its militants in that camp to 500 and began to use it as a facility for support services instead of a base for military and political training.
