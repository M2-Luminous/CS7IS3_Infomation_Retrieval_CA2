FBIS4-51953 "dreas087_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-087 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Philippines Communist Chief Vows To Kill Sison if Arrested Communist Chief Vows To Kill Sison if Arrested BK0405131394 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER in English 2 May 94 pp 1, 7 BK0405131394 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER English BFN [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has put out an arrest order for breakaway leader Felimon Lagman and has fielded an armed unit of the New People's Army [NPA] to take him into custody. But Lagman, in a telephone interview with the INQUIRER, said his men are ready to kill believed CPP head Jose Ma. Sison in Utrecht, The Netherlands, if the party pushes through with its arrest order against him. "Come and get me," Lagman said. "Our answer to that is tit for tat. Once they formalize the decision to arrest or execute me, automatically we will hit Sison in Utrecht. "We will not retaliate against any of Sison's men in the Philippines. We will hit the head itself in The Netherlands." In a press statement, the provisional executive committee of the Manila-Rizal branch of the CPP said the party has decided to place Lagman on trial for various crimes against "the working class, the people, and the revolution." The statement described Lagman as a "traitor to the revolution." A source in the committee said a team of armed partisans is now hunting Lagman, who broke off from Sison's leadership last year. Lagman has blamed Sison's leadership for the setbacks suffered by the communist movement, including its failure to seize the chance to grab power during the EDSA [Epifanio of the Saints Avenue] uprising of 1986. "The revolutionary proletariat rejoices at the decision of the party to put to trial the traitors to the revolution, particularly Felimon Lagman who was responsible for the near-fatal annihilation of the labor movement in Metro Manila," said the statement. It was signed by one Nova Salvacion, presumably a pseudonym. Salvacion said once arrested, Lagman will be immediately tried by a people's court where evidence of his alleged crimes will be presented. "Metro Manila-Rizal proletarian revolutionaries shall furnish the people's court the litany of crimes committed by Lagman and his clique, and the evidence on hand proving the guilt of those heinous offenses," the statement said. "(These) revolutionaries shall be eagerly waiting for the outcome of their trial," it added. The CPP's arrest order for Lagman came weeks after the killing of Leopoldo "Ka [Comrade] Hector" Mabilangan, one of the former leaders of the NPA's Banahaw Command operating in Southern Tagalog. Mabilangan had earlier surrendered to the government and received a P5 [Philippine pesos] million loan for a cooperative he was starting in Sto. [Santo -- Holy] Tomas, Batangas, his hometown. The command, through its spokesperson Rogelio "Ka Roger" Rosal, has claimed responsibility for the killing of Mabilangan in a churchyard in Sto. Tomas. In a statement read over radio station DZRH, Rosal said Mabilangan had been executed for various crimes against the party and the revolutionary underground, including the abduction and killing of fellow rebels. The killing of Mabilangan deepened the rift between opposing factions in the CPP. During Labor Day rallies yesterday, the rift was highlighted by the holding of separate rallies by groups loyal to Sison and those who have broken off from his leadership. The pro-Sison group held its rally at the Liwasang Bonifacio while members of the breakaway group, which had allied with the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, converged at the Luneta Grandstand. Sison, in an earlier telephone interview with station DZMM from his base in Utrecht, said Lagman, former NPA leader Romulo Kintanar, former CPP-Visayas leader Arturo Tabara, and several other breakaway rebel leaders had been plotting to assassinate him in collaboration with the military. Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] chief, as well as Lagman and Tabara, has denied Sison's charge. Sison's allies in The Netherlands have asked their local comrades to investigate the alleged assassination plot against him.
