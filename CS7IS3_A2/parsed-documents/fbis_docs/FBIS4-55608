Exports have dropped by 85 percent, and orders from the Polish Army have plummeted catastrophically. Over the past four years, the arms industry has lost its "traditional" markets in the Middle East and East Asia, as well as in the former Soviet Union. One year ago, the indebtedness of the special enterprises came to 12 trillion zlotys [Z]; today it already exceeds Z15 trillion. It is difficult to see any chance to change this situation. Exports are still effectively blocked by the so-called negative list of countries to which arms cannot be sold, as well as by the atmosphere of scandal related to the Polish arms trade. The Ministry of National Defense will spend only about Z4 trillion for the purchase of new equipment. Experts from the Central Planning Administration say that, to improve the condition of the arms-industry sector, the Army should buy Z7 to 8 trillion worth of equipment in 1994. Exports Without Significance The arms industry is not getting any money for restructuring. The production potential, the maintenance of which requires billions of zlotys a year, would be sufficient to meet the needs of a 500,000-member army. Only 20 percent of this potential is now being used. It is not known what should be done with the rest, as well as with the people employed at defense industry enterprises. Before 1990, as many as 80 companies worked to meet the needs of the defense industry. The main recipients of armaments were the almost 500,000-member Polish Army, the armies of the Warsaw Pact, and the countries of the Middle East and East Asia. From 1965 to 1990, the Polish arms industry supplied 11,000 tanks, 5,800 self-acting howitzers, 1,600 artillery tractors, 8,600 armored transports, 6,000 helicopters, 1.5 million guns and machine guns, as well as vast quantities of ammunition. Between 1984 and 1991, Poland exported armaments worth $1.8 billion and 7 billion transferable rubles. In the years 1979-89, tank exports alone yielded $2.5 billion. Over 80 percent of the arms were sent to the former Soviet Union. The disintegration of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact spelled the end of the "golden times" for our arms industry. As a consequence of the imposition of a UN embargo on Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, the arms-producing factories have lost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. Sejm deputies have recently been trying to force the idea of suspending the negative list, which, according to the arms-industry enterprises, is too long. It includes countries not found on the UN embargo list, such as Burma, Somalia, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Mozambique, Sudan, and Taiwan. Polish arms are no longer playing a major role on world markets. According to the Stockholm-based Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Poland's share in the world arms trade does not exceed 1 percent. Former "fraternal armies," which once received a large portion of our products, now have arms surpluses of their own. Arms Industry to Civilian Life Arms-producing enterprises could not endure such a sudden and drastic limitation of their markets. Currently working for the Army are 31 companies that have acquired special status. They are burdened with the task of maintaining the defense reserve (RO) in the event of a war, as well as the production of equipment to meet current needs and--most willingly--for export. The other factories must switch over to production for the civilian market. This task is also imposed on the enterprises of the "thirty." Easier said than done, the directors of the companies say. The factories do not have enough money for investment in the civilian sector of production; however, some of them get on somehow. The Mesko factory in Skarzysko-Kamienna manufactures, aside from ammunition and rocket missiles, light agricultural machines and electric-light fixtures, among other products. The Machine Enterprises in Tarnow, aside from small guns and heavy machine guns, produces machine tools and cooling aggregates, also for the civilian market. The Kasprzak Radio Company, in addition to military electronics, also manufactures cassette recorders and radios. To maintain a given company's positive earning capacity, production for the civilian market in arms-producing factories should constitute approximately 60 percent, whereas military production, along with RO, no more than 40 percent. The snag is that most of the arms industry companies do not have appropriate technologies that would allow them to manufacture "civilian" commodities competitive as far as their quality is concerned. In most of the companies, adjustment of the production volume to the volume of orders and limitation of manufacturing capacities resulting from the lack of demand for the "civilian" products, often entail considerable limitations in employment. For example, in the Machine Enterprises in Tarnow, only some 900 workers will remain, out of the 2,400 working there now. This is at least what is suggested in the program of restructurization and conversion prepared at a cost of 690,000 German marks by the German company Cognos AG and the Institute of Organization and Management in Industry (ORGMASZ). The arms industry is not guaranteed any social protection for the laid-off employees; therefore, it is hard to predict the course of practical implementation of the program of conversion to civilian production. The Department of Defense Affairs in the Ministry of Industry and Trade has not revealed the expected costs of conversion of the defense industry as calculated for the entire industry branch. The scale of the financial needs is shown in the estimated data concerning the costs of the implementation of the program of restructurization and conversion in Tarnow. ORGMASZ estimates that this company will require approximately Z2 trillion. Similar sums are also needed by other plants. However, it is no secret that there is no money in the budget. Poor Ministry of National Defense] Over the past four years, the volume of Polish Army orders for the industry's products has decreased four times. Even though, during that time, the manpower of the Polish Army has decreased from 500,000 to fewer than 300,000, some experts say that the decrease in expenditures was relatively much larger than the reduction in manpower. In 1990, MON [Minstry of National Defense] spent Z13.8 trillion (in comparable prices) for new equipment and technical outfit. In 1993, the ministry could allocate for this purchase only Z3.4 trillion--that is, approximately 74 percent less. This year's budget envisions Z47.1 trillion for MON. It was assumed that no more than Z4 trillion can be spent for purchases. In practice, this means several Orliks and approximately 10 Hard tanks. The purchae of two modern MiG-29 fighter planes, of which we have too few to be able to defend ourselves effectively, would cost us approximately Z1.5 trillion. To a Superior Instance MON, whose budget is less than modest, has not yet put in its full orders for 1994. The lack of orders from the Army, which made it impossible to begin the production process, was the indirect reason for the protest of union activists of the arms industry (staged on 6 May--the demonstration on the streets of Warsaw). Military officials who were present at the meeting with unionists at Skarzysko-Kamienna in early May of this year promised that 100 percent of the orders would have come to the factories by the end of this May. The unionists also demand that the costs of maintaining RO from 1990 to 1991 (several billion zlotys) be returned to them; more specifically, they want the government to compensate the mutual debts of the arms industry, the budget, and the Social Security Agency. In 1992, the government earmarked approximately Z1 billions for RO; in 1993, a little more. The arms-producing factories claim that they must pay for the state's security with the money from their own, empty pockets. The arms industry merely managed to obtain compensation for the losses incurred as a consequence of the imposition of an embargo by the United Nations on Iraq and to retrieve some of the money for the equipment sold to the former Soviet Union. Some more desperate factories, with a view to retrieving the money they lost through exports to the former Soviet Union, decided to sue the Government of Poland. In early March of this year, the Warsaw Rawar company won a trial case against the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM]. The company demands that the government give it back Z125 trillion, which Rawar lost after the Bielecki government broke the contracts with the Russians. URM has appealed the ruling.
