FR940920-1-00095 FR940920-1-00008 If the final guidelines establish different control requirements for low capacity MWC units than high capacity MWC units, the guidelines would include operational restrictions for low capacity units. That is, each low capacity MWC unit located at a small MWC plant would be required to have a federally enforceable operating permit that limits the annual capacity factor of the unit to a specified capacity level, and records would have to be maintained to document the amount of waste fired in the unit on an annual basis. The annual capacity factor would be calculated on a unit basis and not on a plant basis. This would assure that obsolete and inoperable MWC units at an MWC site (i.e., with a 0-percent annual capacity factor) are not averaged together with replacement high capacity units to calculate the annual capacity factor, with the possible effect of circumvention of emission control requirements for high capacity factor units. Additionally, if a decision was made to switch a unit from a low capacity operational designation to a high capacity designation, the unit would have to be retrofitted with emission control equipment to comply with the emission guideline requirements for high capacity MWC's. d. MACT for Hydrogen Chloride for Small MWC Plants. The MACT floor for HCl for small MWC plants is 660 ppmv, which is above the typical uncontrolled level of about 500 ppmv. The MACT floor for HCl would not require acid gas control, but MACT for SO 2 would already require acid gas control based on DSI/ESP systems. Dry sorbent injection/ESP systems used for SO 2 control can achieve greater than 50-percent reductions in HCl emissions. As discussed above, the cost to retrofit an SD/ESP or SD/FF system on a small MWC plant would be unreasonably expensive. Because a DSI/ESP system operating in a manner that achieves the MACT for SO 2 would also achieve a 50-percent reduction in HCl, the proposed MACT guideline for HCl at small MWC plants is either 250 ppmv or 50-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. The EPA recognizes that costs associated with the proposed acid gas control retrofit requirements for small MWC plants are not insignificant. The same acid gas control system used to control SO 2 emissions controls HCl emissions, and similar issues exist. As discussed under the MACT SO 2 section, small MWC plants represent about 10 percent of the national MWC capacity to be retrofitted with acid gas control systems, and the associated cost burden for this acid gas retrofit would be about 15 percent of the national cost of the proposal. On a national basis, the retrofit of SO 2 /HCl acid gas control systems to small MWC plants would cost about $60 million/yr and the retrofit of acid gas controls to large MWC plants would be about $340 million/yr. As discussed above, the HCl MACT floor for small MWC plants is 660 ppmv and would not require any HCl control. The proposal, however, goes beyond the MACT floor requirement and would establish MACT at 250 ppmv or 50-percent HCl reduction based on the DSI/ESP acid gas control system installed for SO 2 control. The EPA is soliciting comments on the alternative of establishing HCl control requirements for small MWC plants at the level required by the MACT floor (i.e., 660 ppmv, which requires no control). The EPA requests comment and data supporting the achievability of a 660 ppmv MACT floor level (24-hour geometric average, corrected to 7 percent O 2 ) without the use of a scrubbing system. e. MACT for Particulate Matter for Small MWC Plants. Average uncontrolled PM emissions from MWC's are about 1,500 mg/dscm. The MACT floor for PM is 85 mg/dscm, which would require about a 95-percent reduction in PM over uncontrolled levels. The MACT floor for PM can be achieved with the same DSI/ESP system needed to meet MACT for the other pollutants. A DSI/ESP system can achieve PM emissions of less than 69 mg/dscm. The cost to operate a DSI/ESP system to achieve 69 mg/dscm versus the MACT floor level of 85 mg/dscm is negligible. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for PM for small MWC plants is below the MACT floor at a level of 69 mg/dscm. f. MACT for Cadmium for Small MWC Plants. Typical uncontrolled levels of Cd from MWC's are about 1.2 mg/dscm. The MACT floor is also 1.1 mg/dscm, thus the MACT floor requires less than 10-percent Cd control. However, the DSI/ESP systems that would already be needed to achieve the MACT floor for SO 2 can achieve Cd levels of 0.10 mg/dscm. The proposed Cd MACT guideline, therefore, is 0.10 mg/dscm based on DSI/ESP control. g. MACT for Lead for Small MWC Plants. The average uncontrolled emission level of Pb from MWC's is about 25 mg/dscm, and the MACT floor for Pb for small plants is 15 mg/dscm. The MACT floor requires a 40-percent reduction in Pb. The DSI/ESP systems needed to meet MACT for acid gases can achieve Pb levels of 1.6 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT for Pb is based on DSI/ESP control, and the proposed MACT guideline Pb level is 1.6 mg/dscm.
