It Is Necessary To Take Some Measures Urgently"] [Text] Causes and Specifics of Forced Migration Migration geared toward the interests of the economy and production and predicated on regional imbalances in labor resources, territorial differences in the standard of living, and uneven distribution of jobs and places of study prevailed in Russia and other republics of the former USSR until the mid-1980's. Forced migration of the population picked up in the Russian Federation beginning in the mid-1980's. The problem of interethnic relations, which generates the terrifying phenomenon of refugees, is becoming the foremost problem among the factors inducing forced migration. Unemployment caused by economic crisis became a second factor inducing migration of the population. The growth of unemployment everywhere in combination with interethnic conflicts aggravated two interconnected problems--refugees and mass emigration. The third cause of forced migration, ecological catastrophes and natural disasters, is also important. Chernobyl, the Aral Sea basin, the Semipalatinsk region, and Novaya Zemlya are the best-known foci of such catastrophes. At present, as in the 1980's, the demographic potential of the Russian Federation increases by virtue of interrepublic migration processes. However, for a long time now the migratory flow has consistently trended down. Between 1981 and 1985 Russia received an average of 185,300 people a year as a result of the interrepublic redistribution of the population, and in 1986-1990--156,600 people, whereas in 1991 the inflow of labor resources to the republic came to just 51,600 people. Qualitative changes have also occurred in the nature of migration processes in Russia. Firstly, the attraction of northern and eastern regions, which have a labor shortage, diminished; in the late 1980's these regions began to experience population loss. For example, population loss due to migration in Western Siberia and the Far East increased by factors of 15 and seven, respectively, in 1991 as compared to 1990. Second, the migratory outflow of the population (as a result of diminishing needs for out-of-town labor and a sharp increase in the cost of living) caused a reduction in population in the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg by 0.5 and 0.6 percent, respectively, in 1991, which had not been registered previously. Third, population inflow to southern regions of the republic has picked up. Compared to 1990, the number of migrants to the North Caucasus increased by a factor of almost two in 1991. The main role in this was played by streams of refugees and displaced persons resettling in North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray, Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast. Hidden Discrimination and the Russian Issue As has already been said, since the late 1980's forced migration has become a new feature and the most acute problem in migration-related exchange of population between Russia and neighboring foreign countries. Aggravation of interethnic relations and discrimination along ethnic lines and language and political convictions were the reasons for the forced migration of the population. The above negative trends of national isolationism emerged in many republics as early as the 1960's and 1970's. Individuals of the indigenous nationality were recruited into leadership positions in all areas of public life, and by the beginning of the 1980's they were absolutely prevalent in numerical terms. Principles of ethnic background, clannishness, and territorial affiliation got the upper hand in cadre policy. Colleges of the republic ended up in a sphere of particularly strong influence of unfavorable manifestations. The policy of preferential admission to colleges of individuals of the indigenous nationality was deliberately promoted in the republics. Disproportions developed between the ethnic structure of the student body and the ethnic structure of the population of many republics. At present almost 28 million Russians (according to the 1989 census of the population), as well as citizens of other nationalities which have national-state entities in the territory of Russia, reside in the territory of the former Union, beyond the boundaries of Russia. The latter nationalities are the Tatars, Jews, Ossetians, Bashkir, Mordvinians, Chuvash, Chechens, Udmurt, and Mari. Russians account for 25.3 million, or almost 91 percent of citizens of the above nationalities. Among the largest other nationalities let us note the Tatars--1,127,000 people (4 percent) and Jews--841,000 (3 percent). Apparently, the Russian issue will remain dominant in the tangle of migration-related problems in the years to come. In 1991, 42 percent of non-Russian students and 29 percent of professors of colleges of the former USSR believed that the Russian people have always aspired to dominate and suppress other peoples and nations. In the consciousness of these people the policy of the Soviet party and political leadership and the role and lot of the Russian people are identical notions. The situation of Russians in interethnic relations with the indigenous nationalities of the former Union is complicated by the fact that, despite the rejection of nationalism, their position is not supported culturally. Thus, the proportion of those who have command of a second language among Russians ranges from 1 percent in Kazakhstan to 37 percent in Lithuania. In all republics, the proportion of Russians who are fluent in the language of the indigenous nationality falls far short of one-half. The statistics are highest in Ukraine, Armenia, Lithuania, Georgia, and Latvia (one-fifth). The numbers are extremely small in the former republics of Central Asia--from 0.9 percent to 4.5 percent. Migration Projections Outside of Russia, Russians are mainly concentrated in four former Union republics. The former republics should be divided into several zones from the standpoint of the possible scale of the movement of Russians to Russia. The first embraces those who reside in Ukraine and Belarus--12.7 million people, or just over one-half of all Russians beyond the borders of Russia. These are republics with long-standing, traditionally strong bonds with the Slavic peoples. Apparently they cannot be considered a source of forced migration of any consequence. The second zone, represented by Kazakhstan, with 6.2 million Russians, approximates the first. Until recently the historical conditions for the formation of the population there provided a relatively favorable background for the residence of Russians. Uzbekistan, with 1.7 million Russians, belongs to the third zone. In the consciousness of the Uzbeks, the quite high industrial potential (compared to other Asian republics of the former Union) is associated with the inflow of a considerable amount of skilled Russian cadres during the Great Patriotic War. The postwar boost to the industrial potential of the republic was associated with the replenishment of Russian cadres to a considerable degree. Apparently, Uzbekistan should not be viewed as a zone for a mass resettlement of Russians. A relatively large proportion of Russians (about 5 million) is concentrated in the fourth zone, to which the rest of the republics of the former Union belong. The Baltic states, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova are among these republics. The mere enumeration of these territories with the most unfavorable social situation testifies to the fact that these are zones from which the most intensive forced migration of Russians should be expected. However, the main characteristics of interethnic relations in the Baltic area indicate a high degree of cultural compatibility between Russians and the majority of the population of these states. In Georgia and Armenia, half of the resident Russians were born in these parts, and about a quarter come from resident families. Until recently mutual relations among Russians, Armenians, and Georgians gave no rise to concern. However, flareups of interethnic conflicts indirectly worsen the situation of the Russians. In the European regions, the standing of Russians is comparatively the worst in Moldova. The situation in the Dniester area has promoted tension in relations between Moldovans and Russians. The most unfavorable conditions for the residence of Russian minorities have developed in the region that includes Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Chechnya, and the republics of Central Asia. This region accounts for up to 80 percent of the entire last Russian emigration. Between one-third and one-half of the almost 1.1 million former Russian local residents have already left the most unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan and Azerbaijan. Many Russians have left even more stable republics, such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russian populations accounted for between 8 and 13 percent in these four republics. In Kyrgyzstan this statistic came to 26 percent, and in Kazakhstan--41 percent. Now that the Muslims are coming to power and becoming a majority, Russians feel less secure. The flight of Russians from the Muslim republics began in earnest four years ago. In Dushanbe fewer than one-half of the 300,000 original Russian residents remain. Nonetheless, fewer than 20 percent of all Russians residing beyond the borders of Russia may be considered potential refugees. Some projected estimates considerably exaggerate the refugee problem. Prospects for forced migration are most likely associated with the Russian populations of the Baltic area, Azerbaijan, Transcaucasia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, and Georgia. Uzbekistan may provide "sustenance" to some extent, and probably Kazakhstan (to a much smaller degree). The Russian Federation may consider 6 million Russians residing in neighboring foreign countries, out of 25.3 million, potential refugees. The figure of 2 million refugees coming to Russia in the immediate future is viewed as quite realistic. Reception and Resettlement Problems Russians are mainly clustered in urban areas. The proportion of urban population among Russians is much higher than among the indigenous population. This is particularly characteristic of Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and Transcaucasia. There are many more Russians among the urban population than there are among rural residents. The greatest numbers of Russians reside in large cities. This picture is due to the professional structure of the Russian population. Russians aspired primarily to work in industrial sectors, in the areas of science and education. This is particularly noticeable in the Asian states of the CIS. Therefore, the problems of Russians beyond the borders of Russia are mostly problems of the urban population, to the greatest degree--of those in large cities. This suggests that the probable refugees will have to be accommodated and placed in jobs mainly in the cities. The existing view about the extensive potential of the rural areas of Russia in this instance is illusory. Forced migration of the population cause problems both for the resettlers themselves and the residents of regions they enter. The settlement of migrants is one such problem. The indicator of refugees holding residence permits as a proportion of the total number of registered refugees reflects, to a certain degree, adjustment at new locations and resettlement. By the end of 1991 less than 40 percent of refugees had obtained residence permits (and, therefore, had been dropped from the rolls) in Russia as a whole. This situation was largely due to difficulties in the permanent resettlement of migrants. The greatest numbers of forced migrants settled in Vladimir, Kursk, Orenburg, Orel, Ulyanovsk, Samara, and Astrakhan Oblasts, and in Tatarstan--since 1991, more than 90 percent of the refugees arriving there have obtained residence permits. At the same time, no more than one-third of the arriving refugees had obtained residence permits in Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar Kray, Ivanovo, Penza, and Tambov Oblasts, and only 2 percent--in North Ossetia. On the whole a trend may be noted toward an outflow of refugees from the central and northern territories of Russia to the southern regions. At present, 70 percent of all refugees are concentrated in the southern regions of the Russian Federation: North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray, Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast. Immense difficulties develop in the job placement of refugees. Specialists estimate that just over two-thirds of the total number of migrants who wish to work will be able to find work. According to conservative estimates, more than 2 million jobs will be needed if events take an unfavorable turn. This may substantially worsen the situation on the labor market in Russia, especially in some of its regions. It is possible to predict that in the environment of overall socioeconomic and political instability, the streams of refugees will remain extensive into the mid-1990's because new hotbeds of tension continue to emerge at present, as well. At the beginning of 1990 there were 25 of them in the territory of the former Union, whereas by March 1991 there were three times as many--76. Emigration We should note one more alarming phenomenon: some refugees, disappointed in the ability of the state to protect their interests, have lost faith in the opportunity to normalize their lives within the country and are becoming emigrants. Looking for salvation from economic difficulties, citizens of the former USSR are resorting to various tricks, circumventing laws, quotas, and so on. Thus, many Russians and representatives of other nationalities are leaving the country, together with Germans, Jews, and Greeks, using ethnic emigration. For example, of the 186,000 Soviet emigrants who arrived in Israel in 1990 alone, Russians and representatives of other non-Jewish nationalities accounted for 35 percent. The refugee problem has thus grown from a domestic into an international one. In the late 1980's, emigration from the former Union had already become precipitous, as statistics testify: in the 45 years since the war about 2.5 million people left the country, whereas in four years (1987-1990), about 1 million people left, or 38 percent of the entire outflow. Since 1986 the outflow has increased sharply every year. According to data from the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 1986 only 4,000 people emigrated abroad from the USSR, in 1987--as many as 29,000, in 1988--75,000, in 1989--235,000, and in 1990, 600,000 citizens left the country. In 1991 the outflow doubled, and this number will keep growing. According to some projections, up to 7 million people may emigrate from CIS countries for permanent residence abroad within 10 years, of whom no fewer than 1.5 million will be specialists and 1.5 million will be skilled workers. According to other estimates, about 2 million people awaited the Law on Exit in order to embark on work abroad, and another 5-6 million are morally prepared to take this step. There are many refugees in the stream of emigrants because the most skilled segment of refugees (18 percent of those polled in various regions of the country) are oriented toward migrating abroad. Most emigrants (about 40 percent) are residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts; 8 percent are residents of Omsk Oblast, 6 percent--residents of Altay Kray, and 5 percent--of Orenburg Oblast. However, the severalfold growth of emigration is hardly possible in the immediate future because the actual scale of departures will depend not only on the number of people in Russia who strive to go abroad but also on the immigration capacity of receiving countries whose potential is limited. During the period of a mounting third wave of emigration from the republics of the former Union, a number of states changed the tactics of immigrant reception, making their qualitative selection stricter. Thus the leading universities of Europe and America and the research departments of multinational corporations will be able to place in jobs up to 200,000 leading scientists and specialists in the next few years to come. This is why, to Russia, emigration of the population means primarily loss of highly skilled specialists and intellectual, creative potential. Necessary Measures Therefore, two of the most acute migration-related problems of the present day, those of refugees and emigrants, are closely intertwined because a considerable proportion of refugees are potential emigrants. It is necessary to take this circumstance into account in developing a modern migration policy. It is necessary to urgently do the following in order to avert a catastrophe associated with swelling streams of refugees and forced migrants: to put representatives of the migration service on the staff of embassies and consulates of all states of the former USSR; to establish, on a parity basis with other CIS states, an organization similar to the International Migration Organization; to set forth the status of dual citizenship and bilingualism with the preservation of Russian as the second state language; to admit CIS countries to the International Migration Organization and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees; to provide moral, financial, and organizational assistance to Russian and Russian-language communities in establishing cultural and educational centers and similar centers of other nations in Russia; to take political, legal, and financial measures aimed at overcoming the forced migration of representatives of national minorities, the Russian-speaking population.
