Denmark is among Poland's largest foreign investors. Since the collapse of the communist system, the largest Danish firms have invested over $60 million--about 400 million kroner--in Poland, meaning that Denmark is in 11th place in the ranking list of investing countries in that country, according to the newsletter POLAND. Denmark now accounts for 1.7 percent of total foreign investments in Poland, and, at the same time, moved up five places on the list since last August, when Danish investments were registered at only just over 50 million kroner. The actual amount is presumably much greater because many small and medium-size business investments are not included in the calculation. The survey covers only those foreign firms that have invested at least $1 million in the country. Ranked according to the number of firms with investments amounting to over $1 million, Denmark is in seventh place. The United States, Italy, and Germany top the list, while Sweden, with $71 million, and Norway, with $44 million, occupy the 10th and 13th places, respectively. Over 130 Danish firms either have subsidiaries, production activities, or sales offices, or have gone into joint ventures in Poland. Fifty Danish companies are going to take part two weeks from now in the European Union's company contact fairs, Europartenariat Polska, in Gdansk.
