Sethuraman: "`Super 301' To Stay Despite GATT Accord"] [Text] The Clinton Administration, which subordinates the economic interests of other nations to its own, is confident that the Uruguay Round Final Accord in no way limits its ability to use its legislative "trade arsenal," especially Section 301 and its own anti-dumping and counterveiling duty laws. US undoubtedly stands to gain the most from the Final Accord for its agriculture, businesses, services other than financial, and the economy in general. It has enumerated the benefits for agriculture (with the phasing-in of global farm supports by way of reductions in tariffs for market access, export subsidies and internal supports) as well as gains for US pharmaceuticals, construction equipment and the electronics sector. Yet, a US administration `Fact Sheet' claims that cross-retaliation, between sectors, would be possible if a settlement procedure in the Accord would also not weaken US trade laws or change the way it uses Section 301. "Our negotiators made sure of that," it contends. In textiles and clothing, where the developing countries had merely to be satisfied with the phase integration of the restrictive quota-based multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) over a 10-year period, with significant liberalisation back-loaded, US has given notice that exporting countries would not receive increased quota growth (in the intervening period) unless and until they submit schedules which would open their markets and bind their tariffs. Although this approach is strongly opposed by several textile-exporting countries--and India stood its position till the end--US and the European Union propose to seek an amendment to the textile and clothing text to "directly link the phase-out of MFA with opening of markets by exporting countries." While maintaining that several of its key objectives in the Uruguay Round have been met in areas like anti-dumping, procurement (to facilitate US bidding for goods and services contracts), and intellectual property besides agriculture, the Clinton Administration expects greater use of Section 301 in areas not covered but where countries "do not meet their Uruguay Round commitments." Some American economists and trade analysts question the assumptions of the Administration in regard to the use of bilateral weapons after the Final Act of the Uruguay Round comes into effect from January 1, 1995 as scheduled at present. In any case, trade tensions, already at a peak with countries like Japan and China, are not likely to lower in the near future, US is also likely to step up its anti-dumping actions. The Commerce Department has ruled that companies in India and Taiwan are dumping forged stainless steel flanges on the US market. Earlier, US had imposed anti-dumping duty on imports of steel pipes and tubes and sulfanilic acid imports from India. Trade Commission has made a final determination of dumping involving levy of 48.8 per cent duty affecting over seven million dollars of imports from India. At the same time, US is pushing for more "tied aid" loans by the Export-Import Bank for subsidising US exports to Asian countries. A major disappointment for US in the just-concluded Uruguay Round was the failure to include financial services, like banking and insurance, along with audiovisual and maritime services, in the Accord. Given its stake in the 900 billion dollar services market, the US Administration has decided to try bilateral negotiations over the next two years, and if unsuccessful by January 1, 1996, it would block firms of countries like Japan, Korea and many developing countries from expanding their services in US. The hope is that though MFN exemptions would be obtained for banking and other financial services, including insurance, for an initial period, it would be able to pressure other countries to open financial markets and put in place a solid set of commitments in this vital area of interest to American services.
