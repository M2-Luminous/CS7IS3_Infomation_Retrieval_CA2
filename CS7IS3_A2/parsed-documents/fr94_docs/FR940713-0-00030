FR940713-0-00030 FR940713-0-00013 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300304A; FRL&hyph;4896&hyph;7] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 N,N-Bis 2-(Omega-Hydroxypolyoxyethylene/Polyoxypropylene) Ethyl Alkylamine; Tolerance Exemption; Correction AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule; Correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects the amendatory language to an amendment to a listing for N,N - bis 2-( omega -hydroxypolyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene) ethyl alkylamine in 40 CFR 180.1001(d) table to stipulate that a revision of the already existing entry was to be made, not the addition of a new entry, and to correct ``360 moles'' in the table entry to read ``3-60 moles.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: July 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Tina Levine, Registration Support Branch, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8393. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In FR Doc. 94-277 in the Federal Register of January 7, 1994, the amendatory language at page 952 in the second column incorrectly stated that the entry was to be added. The amendatory language is corrected to state that the entry was to be revised. The entry in the ยง180.1001(d) table also incorrectly stated ``360 moles'' but the preexisiting entry had clearly stated that the proper amount is 3-60 moles: the 360 mole amount is the result of an inadvertently omitted hyphen. Therefore, the entry is corrected to state ``3-60 moles.'' Dated: June 21, 1994. Daniel M. Barolo, Director, Office of Pesticide Programs.
