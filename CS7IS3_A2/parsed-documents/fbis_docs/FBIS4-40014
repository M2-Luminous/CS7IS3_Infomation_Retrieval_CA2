The leaders of the two republics have agreed to comment in the "Novosti- Plyus" program on the statement made by chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, who suggested that in all probability a confederation state will appear on the one-sixth of the dry land [former Soviet Union], which in future can easily change into a federation. [Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus] This is at present a rather difficult question. In principle, I do not reject a confederative structure in any state or group of states. But at present a somewhat different principle triumphs in the world. At present, it is difficult to find a federative state or group of states that would merge on purely federative terms, or confederative terms. There are elements of one and the other, and even something new is emerging, like in the proposals put forward by Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev. These contain a new proposal on the establishment of a new union. All this deserves attention, discussion, and careful examination. But in my view the first thing we should do is achieve economic union. This, I think, is the most important thing. And meanwhile it is a holiday in Russia. We rejoice in this holiday and we send our heart-felt greetings. I convey greetings on my own behalf, on behalf of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and the people of Belarus to the people of Russia, the Russian Government, and the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, on the occasion of this holiday, and wish them all the best on their road of independence. [Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk] First of all I would like to convey greetings to the peoples of the Russian Federation on their national holiday. I would like to take this opportunity to wish success, happiness, well-being, and prosperity to all the peoples of the multi-ethnic Russia, to our closest neighbor and, shall I say, kinsman. Another important aspect for all of us is that the proclamation of Russia's independence became a starting point for the proclamation of independence of other states. I recall that as soon as the Russian parliament adopted the declaration of independence, Ukraine, and later other states of the former Soviet Union, adopted their own declarations of independence. Therefore both in time and in geographical terms, and in any other imaginable way, this Russian independence holiday is related to the independence of other peoples and states. For me, independence is the right to resolve independently those issues that every people, every state has to resolve for itself. At present we and Russia are at a very crucial stage. I would describe it as a singularly important stage. We have begun drawing up a treaty of friendship, cooperation and partnership. A basis for this treaty is already in existence. We ought to resolve those issues that can, shall I say, complicate the signing and adoption of this most important document between the two peoples and state. One such is the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are making very difficult step, but they are still steps forward. That's what I would like to say.
