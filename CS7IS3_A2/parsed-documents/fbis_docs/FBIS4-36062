A 25,000 tonnes container of crude oil burst into flames after northern warplanes launched an air-to-ground missile, setting fire to the neighbouring tank, refinery director Fadl Haydar told AFP. Firemen aided by volunteers used foam to try to contain towering flames in a desperate bid to stop the blaze spreading to the four neighbouring tanks. Haydar warned the whole plant "could be set alight if we don't extinguish the fire quickly." Hundreds of people living nearby fled their homes in panic as waves of intense heat and smoke radiated from the burning tanks. "It's hell, it's hell," shouted one lorry driver, heading east away from the scene with his family towards the southern stronghold of Aden. A southern military spokesman said fire "broke out in a fuel storage tank at the refinery," which is about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the center of the southern stronghold of Aden after the northern air raid. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the others escaped, he said without specifying how many took part in the attack. The facility, which refines some 140,000 barrels a day, is the largest in Yemen and the only one supplying southern troops who have been locked in a grim battle with northern rivals since May 5. Haydar said the refinery's other installations had not been touched and there had not been any casualties. A southern military spokesman denounced it as a "cowardly" raid and a "flagrant challenge" to the UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the month-old war. It is the third attack in a week on the refinery. The two others missed their target and wounded about 10 people in neighbouring districts. Meanwhile in Aden queues quickly formed at petrol stations as residents learnt of the attack in a statement broadcast by southern leaders. Neither side in the war which has pitted troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southerners who back 'Ali Salim al-Bid has respected the UN's ceasefire call adopted Wednesday.
