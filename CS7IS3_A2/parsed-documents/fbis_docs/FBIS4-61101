One year ago, there was an extreme shortage of fuel. Today, people put it differently: There are no problems related to fuel; there are money-related problems. That is why an air ticket to Moscow costs between 1,200,000 and 1,400,000 karbovantsi. Despite such a situation, today there are already about 70 aviation companies operating in Ukraine. Some of them have just one plane, others -- just two. However, the state-owned "Ukrainian Airlines" company remains, undoubtedly, the largest one. President of the air company Leonid Pohrebnyak calls it "aviation enterprise." It may be readily realized that, like the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian enterprises, it finds it quite difficult to become integrated into market conditions. For example, today, the company owns quite a sizeable fleet of aircraft -- seven "Il-62," 15 "Tu-154," 15 "Tu-134," and 25 "An-24." Even though the technology functions without fail and with great precision, some of the aircraft will only be used until the year 2005. However, this technology is obsolete. Besides, is Ukraine capable, today, of replacing all of its old aircraft with new ones? For example, when flights to the United States were organized, at the U.S. side's demand, our planes were re-equipped with special technology. One such system costs $300,000. The low fuel efficiency of the aircraft has considerably reduced the amount of air transportations. Today, the fuel price accounts for 70 percent of the ticket price. That is why it is difficult to compete in terms of ticket prices. It is one thing that Ukrainian aviation companies must coordinate prices with the "Ukrainian Airlines." In flights to the United States, Russian and Finnish companies turn out to be competitive. There also exists yet another problem. The aircraft are mainly repaired in Russia. This means that rubles must be paid. Today, "Ukrainian Airlines" needs 9.6 billion rubles to be able to take back our repaired technology from there. It is, therefore, perfectly understandable that in present conditions the aircraft largely make charter flights, when the customer pays for the flights. The "Ukrainian Airlines" arranges much fewer regular flights than we would like it to. There are regular flights to Tel Aviv, Athens, Cairo, Istanbul, Prague, Warsaw, Beijing, Delhi, and some other cities. At the same time, the flight to Toronto that was initiated on 23 April is on charter terms -- there is a contract for 19 flights. However, regular flights to Canada are being negotiated for 1995. There are also attempts to compete in terms of the quality of services. People say that, on the flight to Moscow, food is now served and that even wine is on the menu. Other flights abroad are also maintained at a proper level. In summer, weekly flights to Washington and Chicago will open. Tickets for these flights are on sale.
