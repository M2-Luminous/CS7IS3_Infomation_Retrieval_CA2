At a meeting of the party's central executive committee, SDP leaders agreed to demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa insert into the tax legislation a provision that all the revenue from the proposed tax be used to finance welfare-related outlays only. The SDP also decided to demand the setting up of a consultative body to study the rate of the proposed tax and the timing of implementing it. Unless these demands are met, the SDP, the largest party in the coalition, will pull its cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa administration, SDP officials said. The SDP decision came on the heels of Hosokawa's comments that items of government outlays to be financed by the "welfare tax" would not be specified in the tax legislation. Koken Nosaka, an SDP executive, told reporters Thursday morning, "we would not be able to help withdrawing from the cabinet" unless the premier dropped his plan to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax with the 7 percent "national welfare tax." Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, and five other SDP ministers met Hosokawa on Thursday and urged him to reconsider his new tax program. Hosokawa responded by instructing the leaders of the seven coalition partners to band together for a meeting later in the day to work out a consensus on the tax measure. The tax, whose mechanism is almost identical to that of the current consumption tax, is to be imposed on most goods and services sold in Japan from April 1, 1997. The SDP, which was in the opposition camp for 38 years of the postwar Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule, succeeded in placing six of its legislators in the coalition cabinet last August, after the LDP was ousted from power in a general election. The SDP had since lent vital support to the coalition government. The party holds 76 seats in the 511-member House of Representatives, where the coalition now has a combined strength of 261, only five seats more than a simple majority of 256. The LDP has 222 seats in the lower chamber. In a predawn news conference, Hosokawa said the government decided to impose the indirect tax to offset a revenue shortfall from planned income and corporate tax cuts and to finance the cost of increased welfare expenditures stemming from the rapid graying of society. The government is expected to include a 6 trillion yen tax cut as a major pillar of a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package planned to be decided before Hosokawa's meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11.
