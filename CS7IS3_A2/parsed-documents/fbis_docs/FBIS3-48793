Opposition to the combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representative erupted suddenly. To the government and the ruling parties, it was an "unexpectedly" deep-rooted opposition. Why did the lawmakers of the SDPJ, the largest ruling party, try to kill the bills, on which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa "staked his political life?" How did the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] manage to restrict to five the number of its upper house members who voted for the bills? And what about the behind-the-scenes moves by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to get the bills enacted? We will look at why the ruling parties lost by a wide margin. The twenty "rebels" from the 73-member upper house SDPJ and the Democratic Federation for Safeguarding Constitution [goken minshu rengo], who voted against the political reform bills, completely reversed the power balance between the ruling and opposition parties. Seventeen of them voted against the bills and three abstained. This means that a group, an "opposition faction," was formed very skillfully without coming to the notice of the SDPJ executive council or other coalition parties until immediately before voting on the bills. The rebels came from all sections of the party, neither bound by age or sex -- from senior members to "madonna lawmakers" who won election to the upper house for the first time in 1989 when Takako Doi was chairperson of the SDPJ. Moreover, Hideo Den, permanent adviser to the Social Democratic League who seceded from the SDPJ's "leftist and labor union line," and Masatoshi Ito, who was involved in "anti-military base struggles" and ran for the post of SDPJ chairman last September based on his opposition to the combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation -- also voted against the bills. They have different political beliefs and views. We can say that many of the rebels feel a stronger affinity with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama than with Secretary General Wataru Kubo. Jinichi Ogawa, chairman of the Regional Administration Committee and a senior figure among the rebels, said: "Each individual had doubts about the bills and decided on his or her own will to vote against them." His comment showed he thought there was a difference between their group and a party faction which might force its members to vote against bills. The Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] and other organizations started to apply serious pressure on SDPJ members in mid-January when Diet discussions on the bills entered the final stage. The party convention which ended on 12 January confirmed its resolve that the "bills be approved." Once that had happened, the SDPJ's executive department and the prime minister's close associates intensified efforts to persuade SDPJ upper house members to vote for the bills. At that time the party's executive department confirmed that up to 19 lawmakers would vote against the bills. On 18 January, the ruling and opposition parties started to talk about the idea of revising the bills. The concept included a plan which would leave some room for corporations and groups to make political donations. The executive department tried to persuade the rebels to support the concept, saying "the bills will be changed for the worse if we continue to oppose this idea." As a result, though, the rebels became more distrustful of the bills and strengthened their unity. On 20 January, the day before the vote, a rumor leaked out that said: "It seems as though Shinseito has managed to persuade 10 LDP members to vote for the bills." Lawmakers who planned to abstain from voting, firmed up their resolve to vote against the bills for the fear they might be approved. Five upper house LDP members actually voted for the bills. "Twelve" rebellious members, the difference between the `yes' and `no' votes, was enough to kill the bills, even though five more LDP members than expected voted for them. The figures suggest the rebellious SDPJ members had a well-planned strategy. In fact, the rebels had a further strategy. They had a secret plan to hold a meeting immediately before the vote to deliberate on a resolution to censure Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and Eijiro Hata, agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister, following the liberalization of the Japanese rice market. According to the plan, several lawmakers from agricultural areas, and who align themselves with the SDPJ group, would be asked to attend the deliberation meeting and thereby abstain from voting on the reform bills. Eventually, the LDP gave up the idea of calling for a deliberation on the resolution on 22 January. As a result, the SDPJ group had to shelve its secret plan. However, it seems that dissatisfaction -- including the abstention by Takao Mikami, a member of an agricultural cooperative association -- over the government's decision to accept liberalization of the rice market had some impact on the voting. The opposition faction confirmed: "It is likely that any 20 people would agree and act in concert on all proposals." However, there is no doubt that the opposition faction now has the casting vote in the upper house between the LDP and the ruling coalition parties. Although there are many tasks to be settled, including compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, the positions of the ruling and opposition parties have been reversed in the upper house. A senior upper house member of a ruling party muttered: "The political reform bills will not be approved, no matter how many times we submit them to the upper house, as long as the current composition of the upper house remains."
