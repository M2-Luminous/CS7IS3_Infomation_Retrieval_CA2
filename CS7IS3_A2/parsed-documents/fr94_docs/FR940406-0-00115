FR940406-0-00115 FR940406-0-00011 While ORVR systems have not been used to control refueling emissions on HLDTs and HDVs, EPA does not believe that an ORVR requirement constitutes substantial work as defined in the NCP regulations nor does EPA believe that a technological laggard will exist in the vehicle groups. The ORVR system is expected to be a minor extension of existing evaporative emission control technology rather than the application of new technology or the significant modification of existing technology or design. EPA expects manufacturers would use activated carbon for storage of refueling vapors and air stripping for regeneration, just as are now used in evaporative emission control systems on LDTs and heavy-duty gasoline vehicles. The purge systems will essentially be the same as those used for evaporative controls. While there may be some subjective disagreement on whether ``substantial work'' will be involved in meeting the standard, EPA believes all the manufacturers of HLDTs will be able to comply with the standard and that no technological laggard will exist. EPA recognizes that effort will be required to equip the HLDTs with ORVR systems, but the control technology required is well defined and available to all affected manufacturers. Furthermore, this regulation provides a generous leadtime and control is phased in over a three-model-year period. Both of these factors will provide relief to any manufacturer who is having difficulty. In addition, the adopted test procedures address the manufacturers' technical concerns and should negate the need for an NCP for any manufacturer. The regulations also permit consideration of NCPs for other emission standards, for which NCPs are not already provided, if the standards become more difficult to meet as a result of a new standard. However, as the test procedure is structured, EPA does not believe that manufacturers will encounter significant additional difficulty in maintaining compliance with exhaust or evaporative emission standards as a result of the ORVR requirement. In sum, ``substantial work'' will not be required and no technological laggards are expected. Therefore, EPA will not make NCPs available for refueling exhaust or evaporative emission standards. 4. In-Use Performance As in the case of other evaporative emissions, the control of refueling emissions is highly dependent on vehicle operating and environmental factors such as vehicle speed and ambient temperature. EPA recognizes, therefore, that simply passing a test procedure cannot always ensure vehicle designs that achieve good control in use. EPA expects that manufacturers will design vehicles that pass the test and perform well in use. However, in order to best achieve the statutory goal of a high degree of control efficiency, the Agency will, if necessary, make full use of existing regulations against defeat devices. Thus, EPA may deny certification upon determination that a particular refueling emission control system design constitutes a defeat device (40 CFR 86.094&hyph;16). 2 EPA could also invoke the defeat device regulations in the course or on the basis of the results of selective enforcement audit (SEA) and recall testing. 2 ''Prohibition of Use of Emission Control Defeat Devices,'' MSPC Advisory Circular No. 24, December 11, 1972. The following discussion, while not necessarily all-inclusive, provides examples of potential defeat devices related to compliance with refueling emission standards. EPA's main concern is that some purge strategies used to pass emission tests may be ineffective over a wide range of in-use driving patterns. For integrated systems, this concern will be addressed in the Agency's evaluation of evaporative system purge strategies during the certification process, as discussed in the evaporative emissions final rule (58 FR at 16007). The Agency will extend this evaluation to non-integrated refueling system purge strategies as well. This evaluation is intended to identify vehicle designs that, though capable of passing emission tests, may not function effectively in use. These would include non-integrated system designs that purge well during the prolonged warm-vehicle driving allowed in the refueling test drivedown, but not in the driving patterns involving frequent cold starts often encountered in use. EPA also will consider to be defeat devices those designs that purge at substantially higher rates during high-speed operation than during low-speed operation, such that they primarily depend on the high-speed purge to pass emission tests. Even if such designs do pass the test, they may produce high refueling emissions if they purge substantially less during typical non-freeway urban driving than during the refueling test drivedown. Also, designs that shut purge off at any time for other than safety reasons would be closely examined by EPA for possible classification as defeat devices.
