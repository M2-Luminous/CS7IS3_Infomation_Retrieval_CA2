One that is, of course, also very important. We know you are all waiting eagerly for this information. We are referring to the situation in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, where the peace and reconciliation talks are being held. The usual news conference was not held after the fifth day of talks today. During this week, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, Subcommander Marcos on behalf of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army], and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, as mediator in this conflict, held a daily news conference to give an update of the talks to reporters at approximately 1800 to 1830. Good evening, Jose Luis Sarmiento in San Cristobal de las Casas. Can you tell us what happened? Why was there no news conference? [Sarmiento] As you said, there will be no statements to the press on advances in the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas. Francisco de los Santos, the official spokesman of the San Cristobal de las Casas bishopric, reported there will be no reports on the talks between Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN delegates until further notice. This is all we were told. We were also told the EZLN list of demands received positive responses. [Announcer] We understood from the information you reported to the first edition of the ACIR Radio News newscast at 1300 that Subcommander Marcos met with reporters who write for newspapers in Mexican states and told them there is still a long road to traverse to achieve peace with dignity, although important advances had been made and significant points resolved, 50 percent of them positively. He also said the talks are now entering a more difficult stage. [Sarmiento] Correct. As you reported Subcommander Marcos said this morning the most difficult part of the talks for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas had begun. He said peace will not come out of San Cristobal de las Casas, only the mechanisms to reach it. He said, as you already stated, although there have been favorable responses to problems--especially those dealing with health, housing, education, among others--in the Chiapas Indian communities, those are local demands. They now also expect a positive response to their national demands, such as justice, land, liberty, and self- government for all the Indian communities in the country. [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] The points that have yet to be discussed are the most difficult ones. We decided to start with the points that were apparently easier to resolve, so as to advance. The most difficult, controversial points are the ones that follow. The talks will become more difficult, because now we will discuss demands the companeros have asked, not for themselves, rather, for the country. [Words indistinct] respect for the Indians, [words indistinct] self-government program, reform of the Fourth Article, guaranteed self-government, and other measures [words indistinct] [end recording] [Sarmiento] Subcommander Marcos and the 18 EZLN delegates who are participating in the talks, as you said, met with representatives of the provincial newspapers in Mexico this morning. In addition, the seven bishops who comprise the Reconciliation Commission, which is presided by Adolfo Suarez Rivera, visited the Chiapas highlands for the third time. They said they have already seen encouraging signs in favor of peace; nevertheless, they called on Mexican society not to close their hearts to the just demands of the communities. Tapachula Chiapas Bishop Felipe Arizmendi stated: [Begin Arizmendi recording] I hope we do not close our minds and hearts to hear the community's just demands. From the start, the three Chiapas bishops have stated we do not agree with the armed action, but it should serve as a warning, because violence will erupt at any time and in any manner if margined groups are neglected. [end recording] [Sarmiento] All the domestic and foreign reporters who are here in San Cristobal de las Casas are still attentive to the peace and reconciliation talks.
