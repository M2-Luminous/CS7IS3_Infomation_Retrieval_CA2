Due to the ratification process, EU entry could be delayed until 1996. The coalition and parliamentary leaders have now agreed on an EU accession schedule: The EU Accession Act is to be passed by parliament on 5 or 6 May, and it will be made subject to a referendum on 12 June -- not on 19 June, the alternative date that had been discussed. Government circles say that the actual entry could be delayed until March 1996 due to the ratification process in the other countries. Vienna is not unhappy about this, these circles said yesterday. Any delay decreases compensation payments to be made to Austrian agriculture from public funds. Negotiations on these compensation payments are proving most difficult. Time is running out: A decisive round of talks between government representatives, social partners, and representatives from the provinces has been scheduled for Tuesday [12 April]. As has been reported, the demands made on the government are in the double-digit billion-Austrian-schillings range. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said yesterday that the parties' agreement on Austria's accompanying measures to EU entry should be concluded by Friday next week.
