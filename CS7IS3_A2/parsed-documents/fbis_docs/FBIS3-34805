However, contacts between Sudanese authorities and Israel over Khartoum's mediation with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the occupied territories have continued in Europe and the United States. The Sudanese move took place in December when "mutual friends" conveyed a message from Khartoum to Paris. The Sudanese message said that an alliance between "the Armed Forces and Islamists along the lines of the Sudanese model" could solve the Algerian problem. A senior Sudanese intelligence officer visited Paris twice in January and met with Defense Ministry officials. The French sources confirmed that a meeting was held between Colonel Jean-Claude Mantione [as transliterated], an expert in black Africa affairs, and the Sudanese general. However, the sources said that the meeting did not broach the situation in Algeria. Instead, the two men discussed the regional dispute between Central Africa and Sudan. There are reports that Bangui is planning to occupy a strip of Sudanese territory which it claims belongs to it. First reports about the secret contacts between Paris and Khartoum emerged last month. The news provoked opposition and criticism from Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo. They met with the French ambassador in Cairo. He denied the report, describing them as baseless. Khartoum has for some time persisted in presenting itself to the West as a mediator with fundamentalist forces in Africa and the Middle East. And Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of the National Islamic Front in Sudan, expressed his support for the agreement between the PLO and Israel. He also criticized Algerian FIS leader Abassi Madani for not taking account of France's opinion during the general elections two years ago. FIS leaders in exile have rejected Khartoum's move vis-a-vis Algeria. In a press interview yesterday Rabeh Kebir said that he had heard about these contacts from the media only. He said "if that is true, it is regrettable, because it represents a biased move in favor of the military group in Algeria." Contacts with Israel began in Geneva last year when two Sudanese envoys met with a Swiss businessman close to Tel Aviv. Western intelligence sources say that Khartoum offered to help win over the support of the Palestinian rejectionist movements, especially Hamas, opposed to the agreement between the PLO and Israel. In return, Khartoum wanted Israel to help to open the channel of dialogue with Washington. In December Hasan al-Turabi persuaded the Islamic Conference in Khartoum not to adopt hard-line positions against the West and Israel. Khartoum's attempt to move closer to Paris is attributable to the Sudanese belief that France is seeking to open a dialogue with some of the "isolated regimes," including Iran and Iraq. But the French sources said that "no wants to buy what Sudan is offering." Khartoum's recent initiatives have led to a state of coolness in relations with Tehran. Late last year Iranian media services described al-Turabi's attempt to mediate in Afghanistan as "suspicious." Tehran turned down al-Turabi's request to visit it to discuss Afghanistan, so the mediation failed before it began. Western analysts say that recent Sudanese moves are linked with the deterioration of economic conditions and the Sudanese leadership's hopes of neutralizing the West while the Sudanese Army prepares to launch large-scale new military operations in the south.
