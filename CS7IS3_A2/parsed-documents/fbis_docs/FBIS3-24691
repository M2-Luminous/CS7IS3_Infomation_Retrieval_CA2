So demonstrators stopped vehicles, from which they removed people. They injured people and damaged cars. What's more, they blocked the road. [Unidentified correspondent] It has been reported that the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] left the premises of the National Development Council [CND] and shot at demonstrators. What do you have to say about this? [Dallaire] This is absolutely untrue. An armed escort of the RPF that was accompanying an RPF leader came out of the CND to attend a meeting. When they encountered the demonstrators, they shot in the air--only in the air--so that they could pass. This was done twice. [Correspondent] But it has been said that there were wounded people among the demonstrators as a result of the shots fired by RPF elements. [Dallaire] This is totally untrue. [Correspondent] So you are saying that no one was wounded? [Dallaire] There was no one wounded as a result of shots by the RPF or the gendarmerie. Those wounded were injured by the demonstrators because they were [word indistinct] from their vehicle to block the road. [Correspondent] What caused the exchange of shots between the gendarmerie and RPF elements? [Dallaire] This happened because the RPF was without a UNAMIR escort. [Correspondent] People say that the RPF elements operated with the complicity of UNAMIR. What is the truth about this, General? [Dallaire] Well, I would like them to provide proof [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] General, are you planning to ensure that such cases do not recur in the area? [Dallaire] [Words indistinct] I hope I will convince the prefect of Kigali to [?support] the [?communique] [word indistinct] we presented on [?1] January in which we asked him to support the gendarmerie chief of staff and ourselves in halting demonstrations in the area surrounding the CND premises that accommodate the RPF. This is one thing. Second, we are [?carrying] a document of [word indistinct] to the RPF that reflects our dissatisfaction regarding the procedures that were [word indistinct] in the arms consignment area and that were not respected this morning. I must also add that we are taking measures to meet the local burgomaster and local people to explain to them the existing security procedures in the area lying between the gendarmerie and UNAMIR.
