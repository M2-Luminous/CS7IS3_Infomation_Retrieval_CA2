As everyone knows, the significance of that meeting stems from the fact that it was the first meeting after the three-year official boycott between the two sides as a result of the position taken by the PLO in support and in defense of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. As the announcement is made of the closure of the dispute file, it is wise to talk about ways of maintaining special relations which could deteriorate if not kept at the right temperature. The golden advice given to the PLO at the beginning of the crisis after Iraq occupied an entire country and displaced its people in a serious precedent, still stands. It is that the PLO should adopt one of two lines: Adhere to the Arab League's bylaws which condemn such acts, or take a neutral stand and choose isolation that would spare it embarrassment. One could understand the Sudanese president standing up and insulting an afflicted fraternal state at the summit conference held in Cairo after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, for the Sudanese Government was then and is now a military government whose hands were smeared in blood of the coup which toppled a civilian government not long before that. At that conference, the Sudanese president deliberately ignored the legitimate call by Kuwait and nine other Arab states for the condemnation of the occupation in principle and for an end to that occupation, and instead called for the formation of a committee to study the matter and to visit Baghdad (?), finding the condemnation call too much. One could understand this, coming from a man whose action in his own country was equal to the Iraqi president's crime, but 'Arafat committed an even worse act when he raised his hand in support of the Sudanese request, to the amazement of the majority. But in 'Arafat's case, his [Palestinian] territory is occupied and his people displaced. Before anyone else, he should have immediately condemned the occupation instead of supporting the call for the formation of a committee to study the matter. No Arab had called for the formation of a committee before Israel was condemned. This is not the day of reckoning but the PLO might find itself in similar difficult political situations in the future, whether after it has its own state on its own territory or while still an airborne government, as the Libyan leader calls it. If the PLO has complex interests it fears for, the least it can do in such a case is to take a neutral stand, the best known diplomatic invention in politics. The PLO lost its honor, its resources, and many friends in that crisis and the situation reached a dangerous point for the Palestinian cause because of the PLO's impartiality. Now it is urged to stay out of the whirlpool of regional alliances because it is the only party whose cause everyone has agreed to support.
