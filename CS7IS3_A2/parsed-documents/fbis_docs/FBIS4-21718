FBIS4-21718 "jptot014__l94018" JPRS-TOT-94-014-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 30 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Report Accuses U.S. Agency of Torturing MIR Deputy Report Accuses U.S. Agency of Torturing MIR Deputy PY3003151394 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 30 Mar 94 PY3003151394 La Paz Radio Fides Network Spanish BFN [Text] We have a report from our agency, the Fides News Agency, on Carmelo Meco Dominguez' testimony that we think our listeners should hear. The U.S. Embassy and the DEA tried to involve former President Jaime Paz Zamora in drug trafficking in 1990 by violently torturing Carmelo Meco Dominguez, seeking to force him to incriminate the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leadership in trafficking activities. This revelation was made public yesterday when MIR Deputy Mario Rueda Pena released a tape of a recorded voluntary declaration by Meco Dominguez at the La Paz Departmental Command of the Special Antinarcotics Force on 1 October 1990. Meco says in his voluntary deposition that a few days before 1 October he was kidnapped from his home by U.S. agents who tortured him violently, seeking to get him to accuse the then-President Jaime Paz Zamora and other MIR leaders of involvement in drug trafficking. Could this just be a show organized by the DEA with information obtained through torture? It is a very serious accusation. Legislators should ask Meco Dominguez during his testimony at the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon if the accusations against Jaime Paz Zamora were obtained through torture. The press must report everything. We do not want stories here, and least of all stories about gringos who torture people. Do you not agree? They can torture in their country if they want, but not in ours.
