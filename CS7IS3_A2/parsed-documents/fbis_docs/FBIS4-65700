Parliamentary sources say that there will be changes, either at the level of the secretary general of Cesis [Executive Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services] (a post currently held by General Giuseppe Tavormina, very close to Andrea Manezella, the former secretary general of the Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister] during the Ciampi era and a Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] candidate for the European elections), or at the head of Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security Service] (a post occupied by Cesare Pucci), or at the head of Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] currently run by Domenico Salazar. The favorites to take over at Sismi are General Carlo Jean (already the military attache under former President Francesco Cossiga) and Franco Angioni (former commander of the Lebanon mission). Where the military secret services are concerned, however, a candidate from within could also have a very good chance. Possible successors at Sisde (routed by scandal and developments in the inquest into the fake bomb "discovered" on a train) are Milanese police chief Achille Serra, a Northern League favorite, and the current District Attorney of Florence, Pierluigi Vigna. Vigna could also be the right man for Cesis, where he would be in the running with General Pietro Sotgiu (from the drugs squad) and General Domenico Pisani, commander of Rome's Second Carabinieri Division. However, while there will be some rotation of staff, informed sources say that the changes will not be immediate. One of the reasons for this is the extremely important G-7 summit in Naples from 6 to 8 July which will involve the security organizations to a maximum and which suggests it would be ill-advised to make any changes at the head of the intelligence services for the time being. Other sources say, on the contrary, that for this very reason the government wants to make sure immediately that the services are headed by totally faithful people. The plans that Berlusconi's government has for these departments do not stop there. Admiral Fulvio Martini's plan for reform is picking up speed again and has also received the approval of Ugo Pecchioli, chairman of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee. In practice, this plan would create a single service of around 6,000 to 7,000 men at the direct disposal of the prime minister via an ad hoc undersecretary of state and which would take on the role of a national security authority. As a result, the prime minister could go over the head of the interior and defense ministers. The secret service, which in this plan would be a strictly professional force, would be split into six departments, one of which would be charged with tackling organized crime. To counterbalance the resulting centralization, the powers of the parliamentary committee would be increased, especially for budget control and for timely information on the operations carried out.
