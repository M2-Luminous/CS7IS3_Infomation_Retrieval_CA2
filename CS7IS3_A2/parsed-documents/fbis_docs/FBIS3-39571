Answering a Parliamentary Question from Rod Richards MP (Clwyd North West), Mr Aitken said: "A contract worth some 300 million pounds has been awarded today for the development, production and delivery in orbit of two Skynet 4 Stage 2 military communication satellites. These will replace the existing Skynet 4 Stage 1 satellites as they approach the end of their operational life. "British Aerospace is the prime contractor for this work. The main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for satellite communications payload work and McDonnell Douglas and Arianespace for the launch vehicles. This is an important contract which will ensure the continued well-being of the UK's space industry and contribute to its long term future." Notes To Editors: Skynet 4 Stage 2 will be accepted into service in March and December 1998. The satellites will be for the sole use of the UK military forces and are expected to be positioned in geostationary orbit at 1 degree west for the first satellite and either 53 degrees east or 34 degrees west for the second.
