FBIS4-57452 "drlat097_r_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-097 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Peru Dincote: 20 MRTA Bases Dismantled; `Only 4' Left Dincote: 20 MRTA Bases Dismantled; `Only 4' Left PY1805121694 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 8 May 94 p A13 PY1805121694 Lima EL COMERCIO Spanish BFN [Text] The only place where the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] still has some strength is in the central jungle. There, it has a column that is allegedly headed by Nestor Serpa Cartolini himself, and which allegedly has a considerable number of weapons, according to two MRTA chiefs arrested by the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] and presented to the media on 6 May. The area of influence of this armed group is located between La Merced, Satipo, and Pichis, and in the jungle in Junin and Pasco Departments. There they continue to carry out attacks, although these are not as harmful as those carried out in the past. In the January and February issues of the MRTA mouthpiece LA VOZ REBELDE, the MRTA claims responsibility for several attacks, most of them in the central jungle, a few in the north, and a few in Lima. The group that acted in the north, however, was deactivated with the arrest of Juan Antonio Leon Montero, also known as "Perseo," a member of the MRTA national directorate. The MRTA also suffered harsh blows in Lima, especially last month with the Alacran 3 Operation carried out by the second Dincote division, which arrested Emilio Villalobos Alva, also known as "Celso" or "Polo," and nearly all the members of its "Special Forces" -- a detachment that specialized in kidnappings and in collecting protection money from businessmen. Dincote said 20 MRTA bases in Peru have been dismantled so far. In face of this, MRTA members who no longer have a regional command have retreated to Lima and to the Central Jungle area, as well as to Jaen and the surroundings of Huancayo. This means there currently remain only four MRTA bastions. The main one is in the central jungle. Those in Jaen and Huancayo are unstable, and the command in Lima is trying to recover the lost time, this time under the command of the number two man of the MRTA: Miguel Rincon Rincon. Dincote has said that in general terms, the MRTA forces are disbanding. For example, the members of the "Martin La Torre Escalante" platoon, which carried out actions south of Peru, especially in Puno, are fleeing to Bolivia, where MRTA leader Sonia Cuentas supports them. This platoon, which bears the name of one of the terrorists who died in the Los Molinos operation in 1989, is headed by Justino Soto Vargas, also known as "Lucho Chico," among others. The MRTA members who remained in Trujillo and Chiclayo have retreated to Jaen. Many MRTA members of Lima have also emigrated to Tarma and Junin. According to documents that were found, the MRTA plans to take what remains of its military forces to La Convencion (Cuzco), and Aguaytia (Ucayali). According to Dincote detectives, this is a strategic retreat with the purpose of recovering the control of the coca producing zones as well as the financing for their actions. Given the action of the forces of order, the MRTA has lost a lot of its area of influence at a national level, especially in the Huallaga region and in other coca producing zones that constituted its emporium and had become its base of actions. Now it will be very difficult for the MRTA members to return to these zones, not only because of the Armed Force's actions, but also because the voids it left were quickly occupied by the Shining Path.
