Explains New Anti-Theft Measures FL2803172394 Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 28 Mar 94 FL2803172394 Havana Radio Progreso Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN ["First of a series of interviews" with Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the Interior Office by police reporter Alemany; place and date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Alemany] In Havana Province, a number of measures have been taken by Interior Office police to guarantee that agricultural products harvested this year will reach the population and to avoid their being diverted or stolen by unscrupulous people. In this struggle against those who illegally get their hands on foodstuffs earmarked for the population, the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] forces play a fundamental role, Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the Interior [Minint] Office stressed. [(Geronez)] We have formulated a joint plan this year. SUVP forces play a fundamental role in this plan, from the community level to the provincial level. The objective is to have all the products being harvested in Havana Province reach their fundamental destinations, either to cold-storage facilities or directly to the population for consumption. [Alemany] It has been pointed out that according to calculations made in the past, almost 30 percent of the agricultural products harvested in Havana Province have gone into the underground economy. For that reason, these agricultural products did not reach the consumer through the local produce markets [agromercados y placitas]. [(Geronez]) The plan we have formulated covers particular times or places, basically, from the time the product is harvested in the fields to the time the product arrives at the cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site [mercado concentrador]. For the moment, SUVP groups have been activated at places dealing with the fields, that is to say where the product is harvested, taken out of the ground, SUVP groups belonging to the miscellaneous crops enterprise, the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC], or the community, that is, all SUVP groups that, through residency or organization, have anything to do with watching over and protecting the product in the fields. That vigilance is maintained 24 hours a day until the product is loaded onto trucks. They have to guarantee the vigilance and protection of those products at the site with their personnel and resources and with the methodological help of the comrades from the Ministry of Interior. Thieves must not be allowed to go there and carry things off and then go and do all the wheeling and dealing that they do with these products. [Alemany] Lt. Col. (Geronez) also said that during these months of harvesting tubers, vegetables and other products in Havana Province, strict controls have been established, among these, establishing fixed routes for the trucks. [(Geronez)] Once the product is loaded onto the truck or trucks, a set of measures has been taken, measures that cover the vehicles' entire travel itinerary, all the way to the cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site. The basic elements of the measures are that basic fixed routes are established for the trucks to follow. Because of the number of product-producing municipalities we have, we have established five basic fixed routes in the province. We have given each of these fixed routes a particular identification. This identification appears on the documentation that every truck carries. For every itinerary, we have chosen a color and a number, and this color and number appear on the documentation that the driver carries. This permits the checkpoints that we have set up to quickly determine when a truck is not following the proper itinerary, is off the fixed route it should be following. And, precisely, when a truck is found to be out of its fixed route, an investigation is conducted by the police, to determine the reasons, the causes, to see why the truck is deviating from its set route. [Alemany] The second part of this interview with Lt. Col. (Octavio Geronez) will be given tomorrow on Radio Progreso's "First Thing in the Morning" program, at this same time. This is reporter Alemany, on the "First Thing in the Morning" program.
