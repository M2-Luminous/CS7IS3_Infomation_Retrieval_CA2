Seven international companies are expected to bid for the construction contract of a new Bt4.5 billion atomic centre in Nakhon Nayok province. Suchat Mongkhonphantha, secretary general of the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), claimed yesterday that feedback to the proposal from local residents was "positive". The centre, to be built on 316-rai of land in Nakhon Nayok's Ongkharak district, will include a five-to-10 megawatt reactor, a laboratory for atomic isotope production, a chemical nuclear laboratory, a radioactive waste management plant and other nuclear facilities for scientific and medical purposes, he said. However, resident groups in the province told THE NATION they are concerned that the OAEP had not given them full information. They were worried about possible radioactive contamination of the environment and waterways. They had also not been told about safety measures or how to behave in case of an accident. "OAEP public relations officers only informed us how the new centre will be useful in terms of scientific and economic progress," said a resident of Ongkharak who asked not to be named. "But as local residents here, we also need to know about the possible negative effects -- whether it will pose a danger to our health and the environment. "We need more details about the transportation route of radioactive fuel and waste management." Suchat said the OAEP office will also be relocated to the new site from its 30-year-old office on Bangkok's Wiphawadi Rangsit Road, about eight km from Don Muang International Airport. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations require nuclear reactors to be at least 14 km away from an airport to diminish any danger from an aviation accident. The seven firms expected to bid for the project are: Atomic Energy Canada Ltd, the US-based General Atomic, Technical Atom from France, Siemens from Germany, Invapp from Argentina, C. Zec from China and a Japanese consortium. OAEP and the Bechtell International, a US consultancy company, will draft the terms of reference (ToR) for the project, Suchat said. Contractors will be invited to discuss the ToR before submitting their bids. OAEP expects to select a contractor by January next year. Construction will start after preparation of a Safety Analysis Report, which will include an environmental impact assessment. The Nuclear Facility Regulation Centre, based in the OAEP office, and the National Environmental Board will examine the report. "We expect construction and establishment of a new nuclear reactor and other facilities to be completed in 1998," Suchat said. OAEP spends about Bt4 million annually purchasing Uranium-235 from General Atomic for its present two-MW reactor, Suchat said. Waste from the plant is treated and stored at the OAEP office on Wiphawadi Rangsit. "The solid waste is stored in 200-litre buckets after being treated. There are about 200 buckets' of low-level radioactive waste being stored here," said an OAEP's waste management specialist. "OAEP also encourages hospitals to send their wastes to us for treatment. Therefore, our space is almost full. Treatment and storage will be moved to the new centre when it is completed," she said. Liquid waste from the plant such as radioactively-contaminated water is released, after being treated, into the waterway in front of the OAEP office building before flowing into a canal in Bang Khen area. She said the office monitors the water closely. The new research reactor will be the third in the country. The first, a one-MW reactor, was given to Thailand by the United States under the Atoms For Peace Programme of President Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. The government paid Btl6 million to purchase the second, two-MW reactor from General Atomic in 1977. Suchat said the new atomic centre will also give priority to staff training in preparation for the future if Thailand decides to build a nuclear power plant.
