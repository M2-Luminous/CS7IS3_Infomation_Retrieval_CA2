In a statement to AL-AHRAM to be published on Tuesday, Izetbegovic stressed that the Arab and Islamic countries played a major role in the Washington negotiations through calls for a fair Bosnian solution. He expressed his hope that strong political and economic ties will be established between his country and Egypt. Croatian President Tudjman made a statement to AL-AHRAM in which he welcomed the decision by most Arab countries to establish diplomatic ties with Croatia. He noted that as Egypt is a major country, Croatia will establish strong political, economic, and cultural ties with it. The Bosnian president said the Washington agreement between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims is positive and fulfills the most important aspirations concerning maintaining Bosnia's unity. The Croatian president said the Washington agreement will end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and described it as the path toward fair peace in the country. Izetbegovic and Tudjman praised the U.S. efforts and the efforts of Western countries, primarily Germany, France, and Austria, and the Arab and Islamic countries to reach the federation agreement. They said they welcome the Serbs joining the agreement, providing they accept the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic said the return of the Bosnian areas occupied by the Serbs is a condition for any cooperation with them. Tudjman stressed that the return of Croatian territory occupied by the Serbs for three years is a fair demand. On Bosnia's new constitution signed in Vienna, Izetbegovic said that it preserves the national identity of the Muslim Bosnians and Catholic Croats by establishing cantons based on distinctive national characteristics. He said the new constitution that will be ratified by the Bosnian Parliament will guarantee the presence of a strong central authority and broad powers for the cantons to address issues relating to purely national interests. The Croatian president stressed that the new constitution guarantees complete equality between the Muslim and Croatian peoples in Bosnia. Izetbegovic noted that the federation between the Republics of Bosnia and Croatia will achieve two practical gains for both parties: Bosnia will obtain the port of Ploce on the Adriatic in return for Croatia obtaining an unrestricted transit route through Bosnia.
