In a petition for rubber stamp Diet approval, Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], said only that he will inspect social and economic conditions in Britain. His office simply said the trip is private. Ozawa, 51, visited Britain and Italy in March. News magazine reports said Ozawa's rather frequent overseas trips are related to the treatment of his heart ailment. On Monday, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), will leave for Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.
