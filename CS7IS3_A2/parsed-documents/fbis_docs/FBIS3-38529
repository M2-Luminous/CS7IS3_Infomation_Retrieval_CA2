The conference was organized by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "In the wake of the recent successful NATO summit, the Alliance must follow a magnanimous strategy of integration and cooperation. The NATO summit set in motion an irreversible process aimed at reorganizing European security," continued the defense minister. In his opinion, for historical reasons Poland is strongly pushing for accession to all Western institutions. "Germany's neighbors in the East need a political shield that offers them security and stability. Germany fully supports the integration process," said Ruehe.
