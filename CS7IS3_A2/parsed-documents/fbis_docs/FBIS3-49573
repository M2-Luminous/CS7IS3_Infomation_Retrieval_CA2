We have asked Slavoljub Susic to comment on these decisions. However, before saying anything, let us cite the Voice of America. VOA is claiming that some high-ranking U.S. officers expressed reserve toward possible air raids, despite the U.S. arsenal of accurately guided weapons and the probable lack of Serbian fighter aircraft that could intercept the allied bombers. The said officers, the radio says, assess that the Bosnian Serbs could easily hide heavy artillery weapons in woodlands or mountainous regions or transfer them to populated areas that pilots would hesitate to attack. One general compared this military action to that of searching for a needle in a haystack. Colleague Susic, these considerations in Washington are interesting, but one could say something about the respectable forces of the Srpska army when talking about antiaircraft defense. [Susic] Well, yes. It sounds paradoxical, but it is a fact that during the last several years, particularly during the last year of President Bush's term of office and during the first year of President Clinton's term, it has been the politicians who have been more militant than the soldiers; it is the soldiers who warn about all the possible consequences of hasty decisions to set off into a military adventure, especially in the Balkans. I would also point out that the Srpska army possesses a respectable number of artillery-missile forces, which are not to be underestimated. After all, this is an army of a formed state community in which, whether one cares to admit it or not, organs of civilian power and the army as an institution are already functioning. Apart from tactical-technical measures of antiaircraft defense and protection that the Srpska army would undertake in the event of an air raid, such as the scattered disposition of units, the frequent transfer of forces, engineering security and protection measures, the discipline of fire [discplina vatre], and the like, the Srpska army possesses a number of respectable forces for antiaircraft defense. First, what is involved are massive antiaircraft artillery pieces, including the most modern antiaircraft guns of the Bofors type, of Swedish production. This weapon has a laser sight that enables a maximum precision of hitting targets in the air. It has a great fire concentration of several thousand rounds per minute. I would also like to stress that numbers [masovnost] of these weapons and the density of fire not only aim to down the enemy plane but also hamper it in performing its task. Second are the portable missile launchers of the Strela type -- Strela 1, Strela 2M, and the latest type of Strela. These launchers are held on a fighter's shoulder and can hit a target of up to 3.5 km on arrival and departure. These weapons are a special threat to fighter bombers, for whom the said altitude is the most suitable in order to successfully hit targets. Therefore, when attacking, planes would have to descend to this altitude and then they would find themselves within the range of these missiles. Of course, the next significant missile system is the KUB, which has a high maneuvering capability. It consists of three launchers mounted on one vehicle. It is used to hit targets at medium and high altitudes. These systems protect a territory and a disposition of units over a large area of land. Finally, one of the significant systems of antiaircraft defense that the Srpska army possesses is the stationary missile system (Volhov). These are the largest and most powerful antiaircraft missiles that the Srpska army possesses. The present model of this missile system has been considerably modernized with a built-in special control system. This was done several years ago in one of the factories that is still operating in the Serbian Republic. It efficiently hits combat aircraft at the altitude of as much as 30 km and flying at all speeds that modern combat aircraft can reach. What is characteristic about this missile system (Volhov) is that apart from being able to hit aircraft at very low altitudes, they can also hit targets on the ground, which would be the weapons that [word indistinct] possesses. Let me also point out that despite all the modern technology for discovering targets, even throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, that NATO pilots certainly possess -- and they certainly possess information acquired with the help of the AWACS system and directly in the field, as well as with other electronic devices -- they can hardly discover Serbian forces' targets for the already mentioned reasons, something that the U.S. generals have also warned about. Even when a target is found, one has to attain a direct hit in order to destroy that target, something that is hardly possible even under the ideal conditions of training. After all, let us take a look at experiences from the Gulf war, where a view of the terrain is considerably better and camouflage less possible, and still efficiency attained was only 15 percent of direct hits with all launched missiles and projectiles.
