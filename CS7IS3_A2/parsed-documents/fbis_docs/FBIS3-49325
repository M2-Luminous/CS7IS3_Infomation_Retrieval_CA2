It is obvious, the radio said, that a big operation is in question and that the general staff of the army of neighbouring Croatia is involved. Since the beginning of the 21-month-old war in Bosnia-Herzegovina over 50,000 regular troops of Croatia's Army have fought on the side of Bosnian Croats. Radio Sarajevo also said helicopters of the regular Croatian Army have been flying to and fro throughtout the night between Friday and Saturday on the course Croatia-western Herzegovina-central Bosnia despite the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina introduced in October 1992 by the United Nations. A woman and three children were wounded on Friday in Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia-Herzegovina during Croat fire from mortars, howitzers, tanks and multiple-rocket launchers on Moslem-controlled parts of the town, the radio said.
