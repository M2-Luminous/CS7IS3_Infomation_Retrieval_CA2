The decisions have demonstrated, in a clear and unambiguous fashion, the existence of a strong central authority in Iran today, which can take hold of Iran's inhabitants with a strong and unflinching hand and guide them in the direction this central authority desires. These decisions have also proved that what used to be called a duality of authority has now become a thing of the past. At the same time, they have indicated that the revolution's centers of power, which possessed clout and influence, have in fact been cut down to size. The first step taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i in the direction of strengthening the authority of the state was to give free rein to the minister of interior--a person in whom he has confidence--to take charge of matters and strike down those who would do damage to the nation's security and stability. This was done by entrusting him with the power and authority of commander-in-chief of the armed forces--authority which was previously entrusted to learned clergymen--and command of the police and security forces, the gendarmerie, and the mobilization forces--for a period of three years. There was a reason for making this period of time three years. The second and last term of rule by Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a period of time totaling four years, and more than six months of this term have already gone by. In three years' time the end of this term will be near, and the duties undertaken by his minister of interior will then be almost concluded. The name of this minister of interior, who currently has such broad authority, is 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi. "Jahrom" is a city in southeastern Iran and is famous for the quality of its date crop. It is in the region called "Fars," and its capital city is Shiraz, the city of the two poets Sa'di and Hafez. Also, the moon as seen from Shiraz was celebrated by the Iraqi poet al-Bayati in his famous poem "The Moon of Shiraz," and other Arab poets as well have celebrated the beauty of this city. Before 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi took over the Ministry of Interior, and before the nation's spiritual leader entrusted him with the powers of commander-in-chief of the forces responsible for internal security, he undertook two initiatives that left no doubt as to his decisiveness and determination to curtail the intervention of the centers of power in matters that were to be within his area of responsibility. The first of these initiatives was to prevent the so-called "Moslem students marching along the path of the Imam" from demonstrating in front of the [former] U.S. Embassy on the anniversary of its occupation. This is the same group that had occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1980. [date as published] Every year, on this anniversary, the group had been accustomed to demonstrating across from the [former] U.S. Embassy and burning the U.S. flag, and hearing speeches from their leaders such as Mohtashemi and Kho'iniha. The demonstration took place [this time] on the anniversary, across from the [former] U.S. Embassy in Tehran, but under the supervision of the government organizations, who did not permit the burning of the U.S. flag, since this was considered to be an insult to the people of the United States and their nation and regime. The second initiative was to prevent Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Mohtashemi--the former minister of interior, who had also been, before that, the Islamic Republic's ambassador to Damascus and was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon--from giving a speech to the public in the city of Sari, in northern Iran. These two initiatives, which were the first signs of what Besharati would do, were like a clear and unmistakable announcement of the fact that this man was serious and did not joke around. It is interesting to note, in the case of Besharati, that he is the first minister of interior in the days of the Iranian Islamic Republic who does not wear a turban and is not one of the clergy. All of those who had preceded him in this high-level position since the rise of the new regime in Iran had borne the title of "Ayatollah" or "Hojjat ol-Eslam," such as Ayatollah Mahdawi Kani, Hojjat ol-Eslam Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, and the last one, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Abdollah Nuri. If it is true what people say concerning the possibility that this strong and decisive man will be nominated and elected president of the republic and thus succeed Hojjat ol-Eslam Hashemi-Rafsanjani, then this will be another weak spot in the make-up of the Iranian Islamic Republic, which will be broken. Perhaps it would be more appropriate, in the Velayat-e Faqih regime, not to have a clerical leader be chief of the executive power of government in order that he not issue individual interpretations of religious law. 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi was the first deputy to Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati before the Ministry of Interior was entrusted to him. He was also one of the candidates to succeed his minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but Dr. Velayati was retained in his ministry and the portfolio of the Ministry of Interior was entrusted to him. Besharati was successful in his former position as first deputy minister of foreign affairs. Before leaving this ministry, he made a trip to North Africa, during which he visited Tunisia and Morocco. One of the positive results of this trip was the fact that normal relations were once again established between Iran and both Tunisia and Morocco. Besharati maintained his interest in foreign affairs issues even after he was transferred to the Ministry of Interior. As evidence of this interest on his part we have the statements he made, while visiting Qatar a few weeks ago, concerning the necessity of developing Iranian-Arab relations and his expectation that good-neighborly relations and cooperation would develop between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Besharati's appointment to the Ministry of Interior during the second week of August 1993 was welcomed by various circles of people in Iran. They include extremist press, which made reference to his past services and praised his prominent role in the Revolution Guard and its intelligence bureau which foiled many plots hatched against the regime of the Islamic Republic during a critical period of its history. One fact that Arab readers should know is that Besharati, when he was first deputy minister of foreign affairs, forwarded a report three days before Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and in this report he gave a very accurate assessment of the consequences expected as a result of the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq, and his report also listed all the benefits Iran would reap by adhering to a policy of neutrality in this dispute. This accurate report was the reason for Ayatollah Khamene'i's sending him a message of praise and appreciation in March of 1991, in which he provided his assessment of Besharati's capability and his political astuteness. It was an official message that was signed by Khamene'i himself, and it constituted an exceptional gesture on his part. Besharati is considered to be one of a group of pioneers in the Iranian Islamic Republic. During the previous regime he was in jail and spent about four years under arrest, and during that time he was the object of respect on the part of his jailers because of his reasonable and responsible behavior. He is known for his strong enmity toward leftist and extremist organizations and those who belong to them. At the present time he enjoys the favor of Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles and head of the parliamentary majority known as the "Resalat bloc." ("Resalat" means "mission.") The members of the Resalat bloc consist of about 170 deputies or members of the Majles. This bloc is a conservative one which fosters Islamic traditions, adopts the policy of free trade, and represents the Iranian bourgeoisie. We have dealt, at great length, with the Iranian minister of interior, 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi, because it is expected that he will rise quickly and take on major responsibilities. Besharati was born in the town of Jahrom in 1944 and graduated from both elementary and secondary school there. He received his higher education in Tehran where he specialized in education, and then he entered government service in Qom. He utilized this opportunity to attend courses in Islamic sciences, and later on he studied in the College of Law in Tehran. Then he joined the revolutionary movement, and because of that, he went to jail. When the revolution took place, he became responsible for guarding Khomeini during the Imam's return to Iran. Then he was appointed head of the intelligence bureau of the [Revolution] Guard in the Command Council of the Revolution Guard. He became a member of the Majles as a result of the first elections held after the revolution, representing the people of Jahrom. He was given great responsibilities in the parliament, including membership in the fact-finding commission that investigated abuse and torture of prisoners in jails. He acquired a good reputation as a result of this work since he stood up for prisoners who suffered abuse and argued in their defense with the overseers of the prison system. In general, Besharati, during the various stages of his political activity, became known as an opponent of reckless and extremist behavior in the name of the revolution, and he has written some works, including one called "Humaneness in Islam." In connection with the beginning of the 16th year since the establishment of the regime of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khamene'i, the nation's spiritual leader, in addition to supporting Besharati as minister of interior, embarked upon the taking of other measures that indicated that he was beginning to curtail the role of some of the centers of power. These measures included the dismissal of the brother of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Mohammad Hashemi, who had been the overseer of Iran's radio and television for 13 years and who was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the appointment of the minister of Islamic guidance, 'Ali Larijani, as the new overseer of Iran's radio and television. Ayatollah Khamene'i sent a long letter to Larijani in which he explained the policy guidelines to be adhered to by Iran's radio and television. These recommendations included the necessity of being concerned about the Persian language used over radio and television and raising its usage to a higher level. Groups opposed to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed this new appointment and had high praise for Larijani's personality, capabilities, revolutionary past, and great knowledge of literature, art, and politics. He is expected to bring about basic changes in these important media, of which he will be in charge. Ayatollah Khamene'i then appointed Mostafa Mirsalim as minister of Islamic guidance. This man is known for his maturity and impartiality, and occupied a number of sensitive posts during the days when Khamene'i was president of the Islamic Republic, including the post of director of public security. These basic changes have been accompanied by other important steps taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i. They have included the removal of Engineer Mar'ashi (brother-in-law of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani) from his post as governor of the province of Kerman in southeastern Iran, the province which contains the town of Rafsanjan. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then hastened to appoint Mar'ashi to the post of chief of the Office of the Presidency of the Republic. Other fairly important changes in other institutions have also taken place, including the dissolution of the agency that was responsible for setting policy for Iran's radio and television programs. This agency had existed ever since the beginning of the new regime. After undertaking all these measures, the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, was the prayer leader for the faithful during the first Friday prayer this year after the sighting of the crescent in Iran during the blessed month of Ramadan. This initiative, that is, Ayatollah Khamene'i's serving as prayer leader for all the faithful during the Friday prayer, is something that rarely happens. One of the most important things that the spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic announced to the faithful during last Friday's prayer, the date of which corresponded to 18 February this year, was the fact that he will turn a blind eye to opponents of the government in Iran who express their opposition in newspapers published inside Iran and who make statements to foreign radio stations abroad. It appears that, with this statement, he wanted to demonstrate the magnanimity of the government agencies toward those who are in the opposition. Before we conclude this article, we should make it clear that the measures taken in recent weeks by the spiritual leader of the nation cannot really be considered to be a challenge to the authority of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani or an effort to degrade his position. One thing that attracts our attention is the fact that Ayatollah Khamene'i never misses an opportunity to praise the personality and laudable qualities of the republic's president. In fact, he praises him so highly that some people feel that there is a large measure of exaggeration in what he says. Whoever closely follows events in Iran, especially the debates that take place in the Majles, knows that these measures have been taken in accordance with the opinions of the majority of the members of the parliament. One of these measures that was widely acclaimed was the dismissal of Mohammed Hashemi, the overseer of Iran's radio and television, concerning whom parliament selected a committee to investigate what was going on in the organization that he was the head of, and the results of the investigation were not at all in his favor. Merciless attacks occurred between Mohammed Hashemi and the members of the parliament, and perhaps President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was embarrassed about his brother and unable to take any measures against him, so Ayatollah Khamene'i chose to save him from this anguish. It could be said that the current session of parliament represents the traditional merchant class, and it is known that this class of people has ties to devoutly religious Shiite circles and clergymen other than the extremist revolutionary types, as previously mentioned. Most of the members of parliament who are members of this economic class are united under the banner of the "Resalat" bloc and the current speaker of parliament, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, who is its spokesman. Perhaps we can conclude from all of this that Iran's general policy is moving in the direction of being a religious national bourgeois policy.
