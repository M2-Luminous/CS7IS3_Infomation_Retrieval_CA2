Politically, this has been evident in rising political tension in the region, an embargo and blockade against Greece's neighbors, the toleration of acts of aggression on neighboring territory such as the case of Peshkepi near Gjirokaster, and the training of Kurdish terrorists for action on Turkish territory. The last two represent acts of aggression against sovereign states. Most recently, there have also been serious threats of a possible Greek-Albanian war from Greek politicians on both the governments and the opposition sides, as the Greek politician Militiadis Evert said. The question arises of wily, despite the Commitment of international bodies (of which Greece herself is a member) to ending the war in the Balkans, every move by Greece conflicts with this commitment. In fact, Greece has used all its resources, through various forms of covert action, to exacerbate regional tensions and to create the kind of relations that could lead to open war with its own neighbors of Albania, Macedonia, and Turkey. What Makes Greece So Tetchy? Many commentators and analysts have seen the Greek Government's decision to suspend dialogue with Albania and to cancel the preparatory meeting for the talks between the two Greek and Albanian foreign ministers as part of Greek cooperation with the official policy of the Serbs, who aim to distract attention from their brothers in Bosnia to the south of the Balkans: Serbian policies are also, with Greek help, destabilizing Macedonia, which is not developing regional cooperation to the taste of Athens and Belgrade. Those who make such claims may be quite right. However, if one thinks of Greece's position in Western institutions such as the MU and NATO and the status and economic, political, and diplomatic benefits that flow to Greece from membership in these institutions, it is difficulty to believe that Greece does not have its own strategic interests, not necessarily connected and coordinated with Serbian strategic interests. The question arises of why Greece is so tetchy at a time when a model for solving the question of Bosnia is being formed, and, second, why Greece always expresses this tetchiness whenever the issue of Kosova is broached, as now when there is so much talk about the start of Albanian-Serbian talks and about international bodies opening their files on Kosova? It is interesting to note that after the statements by Berisha and Rugova about talks with Belgrade in the presence of an international third party, after Berisha's visit to Turkey and Bulgaria and his recent meeting with Gligorov, Greece has been intensifying its destructive tendencies toward her northwestern neighbor. Greek policies and their interests are in accordance with the current expansionist policies of Serbia. However, the repeated creation of crises with Albania, in cyclical form, by the Greek state and Greek political groups of all colors leads one to suspect that Greece, in the strategic sense, is not always in accordance with the policy of Belgrade. The possibility of a start to solving the Kosova question represents something still more serious for this anachronistic Greek policy, and the possibility of even a formal rapprochement between Serbia and the Albanians terrifies both members of the government and the opposition in Greece. In Serbia, despite the prevailing chaos, chauvinism, and war fever, various statements have been issued here and there calling for a revision of Serbian policies toward the Albanians, such as the recent statement by Dr. Ratko Markovic, the compiler of all Milosevic's constitutions in recent years, who spoke of a possible reorientation of Serbia toward the Albanian factor through economic cooperation on the Adriatic highway. Intellectuals who were standard-bearers of the idea of Greater Serbia, from Cosic to Ljubomir Simovic, are also calling for a revision of megalomaniac Serbian policies. Simovic has come out in favor of "a new, real, and objective definition of ourselves," and for a realistic position for the Serbian nation in the represent time of general national realignment. Fear of Solitude There may be full justice on the side of those who think that Greece is frightened of a major Serbian turnaround after the issue of Bosnia is solved, a turnaround that will result in Serbia's return to cooperation and a Serbian demand for integration on the East-West axis, an axis in which the new Italian prime minister Berlusconi explicitly expresses ltaly's interest as he received Macedonian Prime Minister Crvenkovski. Greece appears to be worried at the possibility of being "left by itself." Thus, when the international community discourages Serbia is its aggressive policies Greece attempts to embolden Serbian aggression again, even more than the interests of the Serbs in this direction demand, by tolerating terrorism and enforcing blockades and embargoes against her neighbors. This is what the Greek Government has done in its anti-Albanian decision to block 35 million ECU's from the EU, which were earmarked for Albania's financial policy. This is what Greece has done in Evert's threats of war, and so forth. All these things mark out Greece as the most destabilizing factor in the Balkans after Serbian militarism, and a factor that could ignite the spark of a war that would be the overture to a general Balkan conflagration. The question is how long the international community will tolerate Athens' duplicity. In all probability, a general opening up of everybody toward everybody else in the Balkans will not suit Greek ruling circles for their own internal reasons. It is well known that Greece in recent decades received largescale economic aid from the West as a bulwark against communism in the East. However, the Greek ruling families like those of Papandreou, Venezilos, Mitsotakis, and Kalderis have still not accounted for how all this aid was spent and where it went, when the Greek economy is known not to be in terribly good shape even today. If there is any truth in these opinions, Greece, thanks to its own government and ruling circles, might be left out in the cold, with or without its current ally Serbia, when the Balkans are redirected and integrated into the new world order and when the exploitation of the East-West axis begins. The second variant, more beneficial to the Greek people and state, would involve Greece's integration in intra-Balkan cooperation, in an area in which no visas would be required and there would be unrestricted movement of goods, people, and ideas. However, for the almost feudal Greek families who still hold sway, this would mean accounting for the profligate expenditure of the large-scale Western economic aid and for the political and diplomatic errors that resulted in the loss of Cyprus and the creation of hatred and tension between the Greek people and their neighbors, which could have repercussions for decades to come. Greece can no longer threaten the existence of any state in the Balkans, thanks to the new balance of power that is in greater equilibrium than at any time during the last seven or eight decades. On the contrary, it can only weaken its own position and hasten the decomposition from within of the Greek state, in which Macedonians' Bulgarians, Vlachs, Albanians, and trucks have now begun to demand the affirmation of their own national characteristics. Neither Macedonia with its flag of Philip of Macedon nor Albania, "friend of the United States, Germany Turkey, and Italy," pose a danger to the future of the Greek state, but only Greek state policy itself, which, as we have seen, is detrimental to the citizens of Greece itself, as far as the borders with Greece's neighboring states are concerned, and with its toleration of the racism of different political groups toward neighboring peoples. Albania and the Albanians may for the moment be prevented from receiving $30-40 million of European aid, but it is the Greek people themselves who will eventually pay the price for Greece's feudal government, as they paid in Cyprus and elsewhere.
