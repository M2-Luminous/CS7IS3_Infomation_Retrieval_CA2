FR940119-2-00004 FR940119-2-00001 Department's Position: We disagree. Although FOMEX was examined in this administrative review, there were no outstanding loans under this program during the review period. Therefore comments on this program are moot. With regard to BANCOMEXT, the Department fully addressed this issue in the previous administrative review of this countervailing duty order. See Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 24247; June 8, 1992). The cost to government standard which defines an export subsidy in Item (k) of the Illustrative List does not limit the United States in applying its own national countervailing duty law to determine the countervailability of benefits bestowed on merchandise exported from Mexico. See Certain Textile Mill Products From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Order Administrative Review (54 FR 36841, 36843&hyph;36844; September 5, 1989) and Certain Textile Mill Products From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (56 FR 12175, 12177; March 22, 1991). BANCOMEXT loans have been determined to be countervailable because they are limited to exporters.

Furthermore, when we compared our benchmark with the interest rates reported under the BANCOMEXT financing, we found countervailable benefits. Ceramica Regiomontana has not provided any new evidence or arguments on this issue. Comment 3: As in past administrative review, Ceramica Regiomontana contends that the Department incorrectly treated the benefit from the PITEX program as a grant and this overstated the company's net benefits. Ceramica Regiomontana claims that after five years the company will have to pay the import duties and should be treated as an interest-free loan instead of an outright grant. Department's Position: We fully addressed this issue in the previous administrative review of this case. See Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 24247; June 8, 1992). Although exporters anticipate re-export of machinery after five years under PITEX, an exporter may choose to keep the machinery as a permanent import. It appears that after the five year period, any reimbursement made to the Mexican Government of import duties previously exempted would not be significant. Therefore, duty exemptions under PITEX are properly treated as grants and we expensed them in full at the time of importation, when the exporters otherwise would have paid duties on the imported machinery. Id.; Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination; Silicon Metal From Brazil (56 FR 26988; June 12, 1991). Ceramica Regiomontana has presented us with no new evidence or arguments on this issue. Comment 4: Ceramica Santa Julia contests the Department's determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order with respect to them. Ceramica Santa Julia contends that they should be revoked because: (1) Ceramica Santa Julia met all regulatory requirements for a company-specific revocation; (2) the administrative record contains sufficient evidence of non-use of export subsidies by Ceramica Santa Julia; and (3) the administrative record contains sufficient evidence that Ceramica Santa Julia will not apply for or receive countervailable benefits in the future. Department's Position: Upon further examination of Ceramica Santa Julia's record, we agree that the company should be revoked. For the purpose of revoking a countervailing duty order in part pursuant to 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3), the Department's current policy is that administrative reviews must be requested and conducted for each of five consecutive years, with the year of request for revocation being the fifth consecutive year of review. See Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Basis for Revocation of Individual Companies from Countervailing Duty Orders under 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3) regarding Ceramica Santa Julia in the Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of Ceramic Tile From Mexico, dated January 10, 1994. This is consistent with the Department's recently established policy for revocation of countervailing duty orders in full pursuant to 19 CFR 355.25(a)(1), set forth in Roses and Other Cut Flowers from Colombia; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Intent Not to Terminate Suspended Investigation (58 FR 52272; October 7, 1993). Although Ceramica Santa Julia did not participate in the administrative review the year prior to it's request for revocation, the Department chose to review whether Ceramica Santa Julia had met the minimum requirements for revocation because the above-stated policy had not been clearly articulated prior to their revocation request.
