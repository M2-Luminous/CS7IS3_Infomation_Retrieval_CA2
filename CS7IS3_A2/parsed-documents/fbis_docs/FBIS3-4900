The inter-Korean contact is one of two preconditions for the announcement on Team Spirit's suspension. The second is the arrival in Pyongyang of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. Last Saturday, Pyongyang agreed with Washington to allow unrestricted IAEA access to its seven declared facilities and to accept Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on an exchange of presidential envoys. In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month. The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension of the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North Korea cooperated with the IAEA's nuclear inspections and agreed to hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday. But since North Korea postponed the contact until Thursday, Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers' suspension.
