If the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopts economic embargoes against North Korea, the Japanese Government is expected to follow with curbs on trade and transport between the two countries. The possibility of sanctions has grown since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Saturday its negotiations with North Korea over the fuel rod issue failed. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has been asking to be allowed to examine the spent fuel rods to determine if plutonium had been siphoned off to make nuclear bombs. The failure of the nuclear negotiations has put Japan in a quandary, leaving the country sandwiched between international calls for action against its neighbor and the fear of angering China. The sources said the government will make a final decision after taking into account the moves not only by the UNSC but also by China, which maintains close ties with Pyongyang. For the possible sanctions, the Ministry of Finance is considering suspending all remittances to the country, which amount to 60 billion yen a year. Private banks have already voluntarily refrained from sending dollars to North Korea. On the trade front, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is thinking of the possibility of a virtual halt in North Korea-bound exports by requiring all shipments to be approved by the MITI chief. Two-way trade amounted to 50 billion yen worth last year. Furthermore, the Transport Ministry, for its part, can reduce the number of charter flights between the two countries -- there are about 80 a year at present -- and curb tourism. Japan imposes similar sanctions against Libya and Iraq. The sources said such steps would likely put a serious strain on the bilateral ties and may damage Japan's business with China.
