I. Introduction Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on October 5, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., on September 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), and on September 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''), respectively (each individually referred to herein as an ``Exchange'' and two or more collectively referred to as ``Exchanges''), submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes relating to extending certain market-wide circuit breaker provisions. On September 30, 1994, the NYSE and the Phlx each filed an Amendment No. 1 to their respective proposals. 3 The NYSE proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on October 14, 1994, 4 and the Phlx proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on October 14, 1994. 5 No comments were received on either of these proposed rule changes. This order approves the Exchanges' proposals and the Exchanges' Amendments. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 NYSE Amndment No. 1 requests that the Commission approve the NYSE's proposal on an accelerated basis pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act to allow its circuit breaker provision to continue uninterrupted. In addition, NYSE Amendment No. 1 corrects a typographical error appearing in Section I of Exhibit 1 to its filing by replacing 1994 with 1995. See letter from Brian M. McNamara, Vice President, Market Surveillance, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated September 29, 1994 (``NYSE Amendment No. 1''). In Phlx Amendment No. 1, the Phlx also requests accelerated approval of its proposal pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Regulation and Trading Operations, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division, Commission, dated September 30, 1994 (``Phlx Amendment No. 1''). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34799 (October 6, 1994), 59 FR 52204. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34800 (October 6, 1994), 59 FR 52205. II. Description of Proposals In 1988, the Commission approved circuit breaker proposals by the Exchanges. 6 In general, the Exchanges' circuit breaker rules provide that trading would halt for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA'') were to decline 250 points from its previous day's closing level and, thereafter, trading would halt for an additional two hours if the DJIA were to decline 400 points from its previous day's close. 7 These circuit breaker mechanisms are an important part of the measures adopted by the Exchanges to address market volatility concerns in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break. 6 See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26386 (December 22, 1988), 53 FR 52904 (Phlx); and 26198 (October 19, 1988), 53 FR 41637 (Amex and NYSE). 7 If the 250-point trigger were reached within one hour of the scheduled close of trading for a day, or if the 400-point trigger were reached within two hours of the scheduled close of the trading day, trading would halt for the remainder of the day. If, however, the 250-point trigger were reached between one hour and one-half hour before the scheduled closing, or if the 400-point trigger were reached between two hours and one hour before the scheduled closing, the Exchanges would have the authority to use abbreviated reopening procedures either to permit trading to reopen before the scheduled closing or to establish closing prices.
