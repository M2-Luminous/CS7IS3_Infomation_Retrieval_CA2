[Granic] Good evening. [Correspondent] Could you briefly summarize the strenuous day that you have had today. Shall we start with your Bonn meeting? [Granic] Maybe it is necessary to say that the day before, President Tudjman decided to inform some of the most important and influential European countries about our policy and problems that we faced during the negotiations in this very sensitive phase of the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the search for a lasting peace. The Bonn meeting passed in a friendly atmosphere in the course of which we informed Minister Kinkel about our standpoints in detail and also about all the problems that exist at the moment in our negotiations with the Muslim side. I think that they showed full understanding for our stands. [Correspondent] After that, you left for Rome where you had talks with your counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta,. [Granic] Right. Ten days ago, I paid an official visit to Italy. At that time, we discussed not only bilateral relations in detail, but also the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the reintegration of UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system. I briefed Minister Andreatta about all the problems and difficulties of this phase of negotiations, but also about the successes. As you already know, as it has most probably been made public, General Roso and General Delic have signed a cease-fire agreement. On the other hand, we have had intensive talks on finding a permanent peace between the Muslims and Croats and permanent solutions within Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of course, between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. Likewise, we got several interesting suggestions, we believe that Italy will be able to considerably influence the position of the United States at this moment. [Correspondent] Maybe it will be interesting to hear some details of the Vatican talks with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran. [Granic] As you know, I also paid a visit to the Holy See where I was received by the holy father. I had long talks with Cardinal Sodano and Monsignor Tauran about all problems, particularly about all the humanitarian problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the suffering of the population, and also about political solutions. On that occasion, we received several very useful suggestions, and I conveyed some messages from President Tudjman to the holy father. That was a very useful and friendly meeting. At this moment, permanent communication with the Vatican is very important to us. [Correspondent] My colleague, Jozo Curic, told me earlier on the phone that you had a phone conversation with your Austrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Alois Mock. [Granic] Minister Mock is a great friend of Croatia, but also of the Muslim side. This is very favorable in this phase of negotiations. He was interested in obtaining first-hand information about the current situation. Of course, he is constantly ready to help both sides, and I think he will be able to offer considerable help in this phase of negotiations. [Correspondent] Can you give us an overall assessment of all these meetings today. Actually, what have the commentaries on the latest Russian initiatives, and the stepped-up U.S. involvement in this area been like? [Granic] Globally speaking, there have been positive assessments of America's heightened interest in restoring permanent peace and, of course, reaching a lasting solution between the Croats and Muslims. But on the other hand, in all the meetings our hosts expressed understanding for the stands of the Republic of Croatia. [Correspondent] And in conclusion, please tell us about your participation in the session of the Commission for Human Rights in Geneva tomorrow. What are you going to speak about? [Granic] I will speak about the observance of human rights in the Republic of Croatia and openly about problems that we have faced over the past three years, about missing persons, about all the problems of war and suffering, and also openly about all other problems in connection with human rights, about the protection of human rights. [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for replying to our call despite the strenuous day that you have had. [Granic] Thank you.
