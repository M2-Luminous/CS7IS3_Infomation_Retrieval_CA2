According to a statement from the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security, the peaceful people of Samba Dramane hamlet yesterday between 0630 and 0700 GMT were waken up by gunshots by 17 Peul aggressors coming from Senegalese territory. This attack, the statement said, left four victims including two inhabitants from the Segui village -- one hawker and one inhabitant from Samba Dramani hamlet. The Samba Dramane self-defense brigade pursued the assailants who left obvious footprints in their retreat. These footprints led to Jagi hamlet situated on Senegalese territory where all the inhabitants are of the Peul tribe. The Senegalese security forces went to the area and arrested members of the Samba Dramane self-defense brigade. The regional and local administrative authorities are now on the spot and are actively preparing the meeting which our minister of territorial administration and security and his Senegalese counterpart will hold on Wednesday 9 March. These two officials met on 13 January at Bakool. According to latest reports, following the meeting of the governors of the two border regions in Kidira and upon instructions by the Senegalese authorities, these Malian citizens will be handed over to the Kayes governor this evening.
