FR940617-0-00175 FR940617-0-00026 (3) Noise. The analyzer peak-to-peak response to zero and calibration or span gases over any 10-second period must not exceed 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on all ranges used. (4) Zero drift. The analyzer zero-response drift during a 1-hour period must be less than 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on the lowest range used. The zero-response is defined as the mean response including noise to a zero-gas during a 30-second time interval. (5) Span drift. The analyzer span drift during a 1-hour period must be less than 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection on the lowest range used. The analyzer span is defined as the difference between the span-response and the zero-response. The span-response is defined as the mean response including noise to a span gas during a 30-second time interval. (b) Operating procedure for analyzers and sampling system. Follow the start-up and operating instructions of the instrument manufacturer. Adhere to the minimum requirements given in §89.314&hyph;96 to §89.323&hyph;96. (c) Emission measurement accuracy_Bagged sampling. (1) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 15 percent of full-scale chart deflection should generally not be used. (2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems may be used provided that additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves. If a gas divider is used, the gas divider must conform to the accuracy requirements specified in §89.312&hyph;96(c). The following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may be used: (i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas meeting the accuracy requirements of §89.312&hyph;96(c). (ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the requirements of, §§89.319&hyph;96 through 89.323&hyph;96. (iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for calibrating the CO 2 analyzer) with a concentration midway between the two lowest calibration gases or non-zero gas divider increments. This gas must be ``named'' to an accuracy of # 2.0 percent of NIST gas standards, or other standards approved by the Administrator. (iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, check the concentration of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The concentration derived from the curve must be within # 2.3 percent ( # 2.8 percent for CO 2 span gas) of the original named gas concentration. (v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the calibration points. Fit a calibration curve per §§89.319&hyph;96 through 89.322&hyph;96 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range. (d) Emission measurement accuracy_continuous sampling. Analyzers used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. Exceptions to these limits are: (1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 100 percent of full scale if automatic range change circuitry is used and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection; (2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full scale if: (i) Alternative (c)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below 15 percent; or (ii) The full-scale value of the range is 155 ppm (or ppmC) or less. §89.311&hyph;96 Analyzer calibration frequency. (a) Prior to initial use and after major repairs, bench check each analyzer (see §89.315&hyph;96). (b) Calibrations are performed as specified in §§89.319&hyph;96 through 89.324&hyph;96.
