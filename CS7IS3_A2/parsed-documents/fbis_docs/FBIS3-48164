Altogether, 19 delegates contributed their views to the party Central Committee's political report. During today's animated and serious debates, the delegates pointed out the important success of the renovation undertaking two years following the seventh party congress. The socioeconomic achievements, which we scored at a time when the socialist camp has ceased to exist and the former Soviet Union has collapsed further, testify to our party's clearsighted leadership and to the correctness of the application of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought to the specific conditions in Vietnam. The evaluation results of the political report are accurate and modest. Regarding the four menacing dangers, most of the views held that they are interrelated. They felt no single danger should be considered the most serious one, and that all dangers must be traced back to objective and subjective causes. We must take precautions against them as a result. Some opinions, however, maintained that one should not call these as dangers, but rather basic challenges which could obstruct our renovation policy and national construction and defense efforts. These dangers will exert a more adverse impact on us if we are not strong enough. Regarding the key tasks for the days ahead, the delegates attached much importance to the need to improve our economic infrastructure, build more industrial bases, and carry out the industrialization program step by step to benefit key areas of the country. Priority investment in mountain regions and areas where difficulties abound is necessary. It is important to pay due attention to nationalities-related issues and formulate economic development policies to benefit mountain, border, and island areas. The delegates discussed mass mobilization and party building work and maintained that our party has attached importance to mass mobilization work since the seventh party congress. Progress has been made in this domain. This is an important cause leading to recent achievements. Our party should pay attention to training for cadres in charge of mass mobilization work and formulate appropriate policies for cadres in order to develop mass mobilization work a step further. Regarding party-building work, the delegates maintained that our party is large in size but is not as strong as it should be. For the party to be strong enough to direct the entire people in national construction, measures must be taken to consolidate grass- roots party organizations, especially party chapters at villages and city wards. More vigorous efforts are needed to purify grass-roots party organizations. Deviant and degenerate party members definitely must be expelled from the party. On the anti-corruption front, it is necessary to clarify corruption cases involving party cadres and members as well as take appropriate action against them. It is important to consider the possibility of making influential cadres declare their assets. Regarding culture and art, many delegates also stressed the need for the party to look after the well-being of cadres in charge of artistic activities and talented artists of both sexes so they all can have a sense of security while engaging in creative work to serve the people. It is necessary to work out an appropriate pay scale and a long-term training program. Tomorrow, 24 January, the delegates to the Mid-Term National Party Conference will continue to work in groups.
