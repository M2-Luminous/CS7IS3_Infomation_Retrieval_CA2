FR940304-0-00007 FR940304-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;09&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8845; AD 94&hyph;05&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes, Excluding Model 747&hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive visual inspections of wire bundles to detect damage due to chafing, and repair of damaged wires. This amendment revises the inspection and repair procedures, and provides a terminating action, which, if accomplished, will eliminate the need for the currently required inspections. This amendment is prompted by data that substantiates the need for new inspection and repair procedures. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent smoke and fire in the cockpit emanating from wire bundles and loss of essential cockpit instruments necessary for continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. DATES: Effective April 4, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Oshiro, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;130S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2793; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12, Amendment 39&hyph;8447 (57 FR 61255, December 24, 1992), which is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31481). The action proposed to supersede AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12 to require revised repetitive visual inspections of wire bundles to detect damage due to chafing, and repair or replacement of damaged wires; and to clarify the location of the affected wire bundles above the P6 panel. That action also would provide an optional terminating action for the repetitive visual inspections. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposed rule. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests an extension of the compliance time for the proposed initial repetitive inspection of 120 days to 4,000 flight hours for Model 747&hyph;100 series airplanes, since its airplanes were not manufactured with BMS 13&hyph;51 type wire (Kapton insulated). The member points out that the description of the wire bundle failure which prompted issuance of AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12 is typical for aromatic polyimid (Kapton insulated) type wire bundles. The member notes the similarity between that incident and the incident involving a Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011 series airplane that prompted the FAA to issue AD 84&hyph;04&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;4815 (49 FR 6705, February 23, 1984). The member asserts that neither AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12 nor this proposal compare the different failure modes and effects of aromatic polyimide (Kapton insulated) type wiring with other types of wire insulation. Finally, the member notes that the service history of Boeing Model 747&hyph;100 series airplanes indicates that there have been no reported wire bundle chafing problems in the area of concern. The FAA does not concur on the basis of the following reasons: The proposed AD addresses a potentially hazardous condition involving the manner in which certain wire bundles were installed in the affected airplanes. The type of insulation used on the wires is not directly relevant to the hazardous condition. It is the position of the FAA that the short circuit hazard will eventually occur on any Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, or &hyph;300 series airplane with improperly installed wire bundles, regardless of the type of wire insulation. The intent of the proposed AD is to prevent the occurrence of a short circuit, not to alter the failure mode and/or effects of such a failure. The relevance of the type of wire insulation is limited to the amount of time required for the short circuit to occur, once chafing has begun. Types of wire utilizing harder, more abrasion resistant insulation will endure chafing for longer periods of time before occurrence of a short circuit. In this respect, Polyimide insulated wire could possibly be superior to softer types of wire insulation, such as Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insulated types of wire. Further, the FAA points out that the Model L&hyph;1011 incident that prompted the issuance of AD 84&hyph;04&hyph;01 was not the direct result of the use of polyimide insulated wire. That incident was apparently due to ``*␣*␣*␣mechanical damage to wire insulation due to continuing chafing *␣*␣*'' This information was published with that AD in the Federal Register (49 FR 6705, February 23, 1984).
