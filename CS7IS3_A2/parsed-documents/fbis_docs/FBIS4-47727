It is something along the lines of an international get-together to reflect on political and economic issues. Among those present this year will be, among others, Mozambique's foreign minister, the secretary general of Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola], and Miguel Trovoada, the president of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. Earlier this evening the latter granted an interview to our colleague Walter Medeiros. [Medeiros] Good evening, Mr. President. [Trovoada] Good evening. [Medeiros] I would like to begin with a question to which some political analysts have been addressing themselves of late, that of the very survival of the state of Sao Tome. Twenty years after the Portuguese April 1974 revolution, many observers are saying that Sao Tome and Principe and, by the way, Cape Verde as well, do not need to be independent, that an autonomous status similar to that enjoyed by Madeira and the Azores might be a better solution. They back their argument with the fact that Sao Tome and Principe, for example, subsists practically on foreign aid, that the feebleness of its economy makes self-sufficiency impossible. What are your views on this, Mr. President? [Trovoada] I think those are people nostalgic for the colonial era who have not yet realized that history moves on, that some of its stages must be left behind, that the historical process is irreversible. You mentioned economic problems that might lead some people to wonder about Sao Tome's viability as a state. I would point out that Sao Tome is not the only state depending on external aid, there are numerous cases.... [Medeiros, interrupting] But its dependence is huge. You do recognize that, don't you? [Trovoada] The dependence is huge. The dependence is huge, but it is only a temporary stage. We must not forget that ours is still a type of economy that was not created in the interests of the Sao Tomeans, but rather in those of the colonial power. This is an important point. Most African countries have not yet managed to get out of this kind of situation. [Medeiros] Mr. President, is democracy not in danger in Sao Tome? [Trovoada] Democracy is in danger wherever there is an inability to solve the basic problems of the populations. [Medeiros] That is what is happening in Sao Tome. [Trovoada] It is happening in many countries. [Medeiros] Including Sao Tome? [Trovoada] Including Sao Tome and Principe. It is true that there is disenchantment stemming from the fact that the people had pinned great hopes in seeing their problems solved by the establishment of a democratic system. They were expecting immediate results. [Medeiros] Some three or four years have already gone by, Mr. President. [Trovoada] Yes, but well, listen, have all of Portugal's problems been solved in the 20 years since April 1974? [Medeiros] Of course not. [Trovoada] We are talking here in connection with the 20th anniversary of the 25 April revolution. Have all of Portugal's problems been solved? [Medeiros] Of course not. [Trovoada] Right. So it seems that there is tendency to expect miracles from the African countries that other peoples are unable to perform. Democracy in the African countries....[pauses] As soon as there is the slightest turbulence it is immediately seen as evidence of the African peoples' inability to manage a democratic system. How many centuries did it take the other countries, namely the European ones, to establish democratic systems? Let us not lay down criteria for African countries that are not applied to others. [Medeiros] Speaking of managing. At the very beginning of your term of office, Mr. President, I believe you had to manage a crisis. The government fell, the prime minister was replaced, and there was a huge movement of popular protest in Sao Tome. Relations between yourself, President Trovoada, and the government, are not exactly the best. How do you deal about this, Mr. President? [Trovoada] I do not agree with your view that there is a lack of institutional cooperation. We -- namely the president of the republic -- must deal with the situation within the framework of our institutions, of our Constitution, with absolute strict respect for boundaries defining each body's area of jurisdiction. [Medeiros] But there have been clashes, Mr. President. [Trovoada] I say it again: Can you name anywhere in the world where such clashes do not occur? Not the United States, not Portugal, not even the world's oldest democracies. As I said before, let us not hope for miracles from the African countries that others have not performed and are in no position to perform. [Medeiros] Do you not fear that there may at present be a certain nostalgia for former President Pinto da Costa? [Trovoada] That is a question that should be addressed to former President Pinto da Costa. [Medeiros] But do you not fear it? Surely you have your opinion polls. [Trovoada] Fear? Fear? [Medeiros] Yes, yes. [Trovoada] Why? We have a democracy. Former President Pinto da Costa is a Sao Tomean citizen. He was our country's first head of state. He certainly has a role to play in Sao Tome and Principe. Therefore, I do not see why in a democracy one should be afraid of a citizen like any other. [Medeiros] Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity of this interview to raise the Francophone versus Lusophone question. Allow me to explain: There are increasingly insistent voices pointing to a growing French presence, not just in Sao Tome and Principe, but also in Guinea Bissau and throughout that part of Africa. I will give you an example: Under its cooperation agreement with Sao Tome and Principe, Portugal has paid for the construction of the Principe dam that will provide electricity for the island of the same name. Now people are saying that when the power station is ready it will be run by the French. Moreover, there is also the question of the media -- television, radio, and so on. Only recently, I believe, there was an agreement signed with Radio France International. Is this because the Sao Tomean elite is markedly influenced by Francophone culture? What is going on? [Trovoada] I am frankly astounded.... [Medeiros, interrupting] I would just like you to clear this up for me. [Trovoada] No, but I am astounded when such questions are put to me. [Medeiros] But it is good that they should be asked. [Trovoada] Why so? [Medeiros] So as to clarify matters. [Trovoada] Why? You know, I lived in France for nine years during my second term of exile. There are hundreds of thousands of Portuguese in France. You also know that nowadays French interests are increasingly represented in Portugal. And yet no one is afraid that Napoleon Bonaparte, or a new Napoleon, might land on Portuguese shores, or cross the Pyrenees bent on invasion. [Medeiros] It is not my personal view, I am merely echoing concerns. [Trovoada] I fail to see why people should still regard Africa as a game reserve for competing hunters. We are independent countries, we have the most open of relationships with various states.... [Madeiros, interrupting] And a special one with Portugal? [Trovoada] In the context of cooperation, relationships are made special by historical and cultural ties, as is particularly, the case regarding Portugal. But we are open to cooperation with other countries. It seems to me tantamount to treating us as though we were underage, if people think that because we have relations with country A, B, or C, it must follow that we have a special relationship or wish to be taken into its sphere of influence. You mentioned the Principe dam built by Portugal. In effect I formally opened it about a year ago. I must tell you that it has not yet come into operation. [Medeiros] Quite so. [Trovoada] So when you talk about France running it, I do not know how France can run something that has not come into operation. [Medeiros] No, I said France will be running it when it is ready. [Trovoada] Well, we are in the here and now....[pauses] As for the matter of future intent, we do not know. [Medeiros] But don't the French run the whole of Sao Tome's electricity supply grid? [Trovoada] But is that in any way an anomalous situation? I must tell you, in effect our water and electricity supply networks are run by a French company, yes, operating with huge subsidies from France -- for equipment, for fuel, and everything else. If we are speaking about running things, it is a known fact that there are Portuguese companies in Sao Tome and Principe in much better positions than French ones, such as Marconi with its Sao Tomean subsidiary CST [expansion unknown], such as TAP [Air Portugal] with Sao Tomean Airlines, such as our sole commercial bank, the BISTP [expansion unknown], whose majority holdings are Portuguese. [Medeiros] So the more anxious spirits can be reassured that Portugal has its role in Sao Tome; our ties with Sao Tome will definitely not be loosened... [Trovoada, interrupting] Portugal has its role in Sao Tome. I am convinced that Portugal will continue playing a role in Lusophone Africa, and the bigger that role the better, but the Lusophone African countries are now independent and are totally at liberty to establish ties also with other countries, in their interest, and in the interest of the development of their peoples. [Medeiros] The voting has ended in the South African elections. How do you envisage the future for South Africa? Very quickly, if you would, Mr. President, as we are running out of time. [Trovoada] It is an extraordinary process, yet again a historical process of extraordinary importance, insofar as it signals the end of a regime, frankly, words fail one to qualify it -- the apartheid regime, and ushers in a new era of democracy for the entire South African people. I can say that, as far as we Africans, the black community in general, are concerned, this is a high point in the history of this community. And for mankind too, it is a high point, as a climate of greater fraternity, greater equality, and inextricably, greater freedom begins to be established in South Africa. [Medeiros] Have a good stay in Portugal, Mr. President. Thank you for coming to Antenna-1's midnight newsreel. [Trovoada] Thank you very much. Good night.
