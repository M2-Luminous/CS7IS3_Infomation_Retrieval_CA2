T16 was tested with subfragments in dot hybridization with Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica, as well as with enterobacteria such as shigella, salmonella, and various strains of intestinal bacilli. The fragment was used to construct a 980 bp DNA probe species-specific for Y. pestis. In a number of strains of the pseudotuberculosis microbe, the researchers found nucleotide sequences with a relative homology for Y. pestis. The restriction map indicates the absence of the EcoRI site of the CM fragment in the T16 sequence, suggesting either that the authors cloned DNA fragments similar to those cloned by Bardarov et al. (FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 1990, Vol.71, pp 277-280) or that there are structural differences in that region of DNA in the strains Y. pestis TWJ and EV. A nucleotide repeater was, indeed, found.
