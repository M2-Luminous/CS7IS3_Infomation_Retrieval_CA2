We sincerely rejoiced when the Supreme Council adopted its decision on suspending the operation of this notorious monster. However, unfortunately, ignoring public opinion and without holding a nationwide discussion, a decision was adopted in secrecy not only on the resumption of the Chernobyl AES operation, but also on commissioning new units at the Zaporizhzhya, Khmelnytskyy, and Rivne AES, as well as on a significant expansion over the whole of atomic power engineering and even on the creation in Ukraine of a nuclear-fuel cycle, starting from the extraction of uranium ore and ending with reprocessing radioactive waste and its burial. We reiterate that all of this is being planned without the public's knowledge. At the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency, as a result of the work of its commission at the Chernobyl AES, arrived at the conclusion that there are many "unresolved problems" at the plant. For eight years, Chernobyl and other Ukrainian atomic plants have been giving rise to alarm in European countries. The European public, just like us, demands that the dangerous reactors be stopped. Stressing again the inadmissibility of ignoring public opinion, we are calling upon the Ukrainian president to suspend the action of the unpublished edict on the development of atomic power engineering in Ukraine and to carry an extensive and open discussion of this burning problem. Kiev, 14 April 1994
