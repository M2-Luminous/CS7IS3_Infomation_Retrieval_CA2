Joining the OECD enables Brazil to move closer to the organization that groups together the 24 most-industrialized countries in the world. The exchange of letters formalizing Brazil's joining of the OECD will take place on either 16 or 17 March during the meeting to be held between Itamaraty Secretary General Roberto Abdenur and OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye at the Hotel de La Muette. Brazilian Ambassador to France Carlos Alberto Leite Barbosa has been furthering Brazil's rapprochement with the OECD for two years. The organization has no members from Latin America except for Mexico, which will become the 25th member of OECD as of June under the aegis of the United States and Canada. The first stage to be completed in order to achieve full-member status is to sit on the Development Assistance Committee. Brazil will sit there next to countries like Argentina and the ROK. The OECD is a sort of exclusive club, whose members are the richest countries in the world, that promotes greater cooperation and a broad exchange of information on economic and development matters. The center was created by an OECD council decision. Its mission is to embark on research on international economic relations, suggest solutions to overcome problems identified in research, and establish a dialogue with developed countries. Members are Germany, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Spain, the United States, Finland, France, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Seminar The first consequence of Brazilian participation will be the OECD's organization of an international seminar on privatization at the Hotel Mofarrej in Sao Paulo during April. The most important members, with some experience in privatizations, will attend the seminar. At the same time, Ambassador Rubens Barbosa is coordinating a seminar on the privatization process in Brazil in London next week with the participation of Brazilian economists, Persio Arida among them.
