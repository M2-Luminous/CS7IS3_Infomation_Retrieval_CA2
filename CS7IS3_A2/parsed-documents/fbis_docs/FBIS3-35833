Bentsen has stated that Moscow's abandonment or slowing of the course of reforms will inevitably lead to a scaling down of the volume of foreign aid offered to it. "Russia's future is in the Russians' hands," he remarked at a meeting with journalists in the White House. "The assistance which we and international financial organizations are giving will match the pace of the Russian reforms, which means that the choice is Russia's."
