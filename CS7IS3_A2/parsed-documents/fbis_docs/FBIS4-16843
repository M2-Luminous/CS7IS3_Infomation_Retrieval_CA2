Center Fails To Appreciate Eduard Rossel's Good Intentions"] [Text] The State Duma hearings on the Urals Republic that never materialized reminds one of a discussion about the rise and fall of an ancient state. Deputy Vladimir Lysenko outlined five conceptual models of Russia's administrative system. The first one calls for making all the current Federation components guberniyas (that is, for lowering the republics' status). The second, on the contrary, calls for the raising of the status of krays and oblasts to that of the republics. The third one calls for creating lands, letting the republics be. The fourth one is about creating lands all over Russia. And finally, the fifth one calls for a development of regional economic associations. Eduard Rossel, current member of the Federation Council and recent head of the administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast and chairman of its soviet, and who was discharged from his position by the president precisely for the idea of a Urals Republic, complained about overcentralization of the economy; he was trying to prove that the people of Yekaterinburg had no separatist goals in mind and were simply trying to shift the burden of reforms into the regions. At first the republic was seen as an association of six territories. Mr. Rossel had taken this idea for equal rights for Federation components to 18 ministries in Moscow and received 18 rejections. After that the oblast held a referendum where the idea of a republic obtained 84 percent of the votes. On 27 October, a session of the oblast soviet passed the constitution of a Urals Republic (so far to be comprised of Sverdlovsk Oblast). The same day regulations for the elections of a legislative assembly were confirmed, with the president dissolving the Sverdlovsk soviet two weeks after. The heads of the contiguous territories, naturally, feared the same fate as Mr. Rossel's, and the Urals republic did not materialize after all. Speaking next, Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council, agreed that the architects of a Urals Republic had not been separatist-minded, and put the spotlight on an important mistake made at the time of organizing the new administrative entity, a mistake that largely contributed to the initiative's failure. Public opinion, hence of those in power at various levels, took the Urals Republic idea precisely as separatist. This attests not only to an inadequately analytical perception of the described idea at the federative level, but also to the fact that those who elaborated the social project may have supposed that no public opinion was going to be formed, or they ignored it, or they hoped for the common sense of average Russians and those in executive positions. Which is, as usual, a pity.
