These letters have welcomed and voiced support for the establishment of our Commission and have exposed and demonstrated the bad consequences of the previous U.S. war of aggression and the consequences that will result from the continued fueling of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war by the U.S. Administration in Cambodia. Our Commission has been greatly encouraged by this vigorous support. The commission would like to issue this communique summing up the essence of these letters. 1. What were the tremendously destructive effects and what was the nature of the suffering that resulted from the first U.S. war of aggression? The first U.S. war of aggression in Cambodia lasted from March 1970 to April 1975. This war was a large-scale one involving land, naval, and air forces, and artillery, including the forces of [late Cambodian general] Lon Nol and (Thieu-Ky) [former South Vietnamese leader]. Then, the entire Cambodian territory was the victim of bullets, shells, and all sorts of bombs dropped from aircraft. Some of the bombs weighed up to 1,000 kilograms and made craters as big as ponds and reservoirs. Some bombs damaged the soil, as for example in Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal, Takeo, and Kampot. To this day these craters remain visible. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of oxen and buffaloes, the farmers' livelihood, were killed by bullets and shells. The United States used B-52, B-57, F-105, F-4, F-111, OV-10, L-24, C-130, C- 121, DC-3, and DC-7 aircraft, and all types of helicopters, to drop various kinds of bombs, which destroyed entire villages, property, water jars, plates, cooking pans, fish paste, and salt. Everything was destroyed. Forests in eastern Cambodia, such as in Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng, and Kompong Cham were razed and transformed into open fields. Some trees were damaged, shattered, or pierced through. Thousands of cubic meters of timber were destroyed. People fled their houses and villages to avoid aircraft; they lived in the forest and were affected by malaria and fever. The health of tens of thousands of people was affected; these people are still suffering. Consequently, the children of these people were also affected with limb disability, blindness, and neurotic diseases. Apart from this, tens of thousands of our people died; and hundreds of thousands more were disabled in provinces in eastern Cambodia as well as in the central part of the country and in areas around Phnom Penh city. Women, men, adolescents, babies, and elderly people all suffered from this savage U.S. war. Some have become abnormal due to the effects on their brains, nerves, and body. All this was the result of the U.S. reliance on the strength of its war machine to kill the Cambodian nation and people. Nobody forgets this; no Cambodian forgets this -- neither do the land, rivers, lakes, ponds, forests, and hills. The results are permanently engraved and will be visible everywhere for generations. 2. Another bad consequence of the U.S. Administration's involvement in the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war of aggression in Cambodia was the deaths of American people. The United States interference in Cambodia now comes on top of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war in the form of military advisers and specialists, and through the supply of tanks, aircraft, and ammunition. This amounts to a declaration of war. Later on, more military advisers, specialists, or U.S. troops will be directly involved in various ways or on different battlefields in Cambodia. Later on, the United States will send 500, 1,000, or 5,000 soldiers to Cambodia, saying that these troops are for protecting U.S. experts and advisers. In fact, these troops will come to participate directly in the fighting in Cambodia. Now that the United States has dispatched advisers to wage war to kill the Cambodian nation and people, the problem is this: Will U.S. soldiers be killed or not; will they be wounded or not? No one can be certain about this because a war is the fighting among warring parties. If you have come to kill others, other people also have the right to defend themselves. If the United States has a lot of weapons and can kill 100 or 1,000 Cambodians on each battlefield, some U.S. soldiers will unavoidably be killed or wounded, from a few to a dozen. If the war continues, more Cambodians and increasing numbers of Americans will be killed. This is the law of war: if you play with fire, you will be burned. The Cambodian people do not want war, neither do the American people. This is certain. Therefore, on this occasion, the Cambodian people in all circles would like to appeal to the United States, which loves peace, justice, and mankind, not to let Americans die in vain in Cambodia. The American people have clearly understood the bad consequences of the military involvements of previous U.S. Administrations. 1. War sowed great destruction for the Cambodian nation and people, who have suffered for 15 years from the Vietnamese aggressors' war. 2. War will kill Cambodians as well as Americans, if the U.S. Administration ventures into and get involved in the communist Vietnamese's war in Cambodia. 3. The Cambodian and American people, who love peace and justice, want peace and not death. The two peoples want to have peaceful and friendly relations. This is the profound request of both the Cambodian and American people. The Cambodian and American people should cooperate to prevent the U.S. Administration from sending troops to fight in Cambodia through any means -- whether through military advisers and experts, aircraft pilots, or those who repair roads and bridges for transporting troops and war equipment. These persons will all be involved in war. We hold that the American people, like the Cambodian people, want peace and peaceful and friendly relations. We repeatedly appeal for the use of peace and friendship to solve the Cambodian problem. This way is a thousand millions times better than fueling the war. Involvement in war is a thousand millions times worse than ending it. The Cambodian people and the American people want peace and are totally opposed to war.
