Hopper, Marketing Specialist, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, suite 102B, Fresno, California, 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901; or Kenneth G. Johnson, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, room 2522&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456: telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR part 910], as amended, regulating the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 2,000 producers of lemons in the production area and approximately 70 handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
