This stand which placates Israel is a continuation of the U.S. policy adopted for decades by the successive U.S. administrations. This has encouraged Israel to pursue its human rights violations in the occupied territories, and has placed it above the law, and out of reach of any possible international inquiry. Following the Hebron massacre that has been condemned by the entire international community, the current U.S. Administration under the pretext of not endangering the peace process, adopts a stand that lacks wisdom and far-sightedness when it seeks to prevent the implementation of the international community's will and the UN Security Council from responding to these calls which demand some kind of international protection for the Palestinians. Does the Clinton administration need more than this torrent of innocent blood that was shed in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip last Friday to be convinced that a defenseless people need some kind of international protection, especially since Israel--army, border guard, and fanatic settlers, persist in shedding the blood of children, elderly people, and women without remorse and without fearing any possible international inquiry? The issuance of a UN Security Council resolution providing the Palestinian people with international protection is another test of the seriousness of the U.S. role as a fair mediator in the Middle East crisis, how ethically credible it is, and how genuine are its continued claims that it defends human rights throughout the world.
