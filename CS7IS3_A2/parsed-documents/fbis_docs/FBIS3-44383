As of 1993, the province has consecutively stabilized its grain output of more than 15 billion kg in the last four years. The province has basically become self-supporting in its supply of grains and major nonstaple foodstuffs. The long-standing economic pattern with its large portion of industrial production and small agricultural production portion has incurred fundamental change. This is a historical breakthrough made by the province in its economic development. However, the major topic discussed at the provincial rural work conference was not aimed at maintaining the achievements. Opinions raised at provincial rural work conferences by attendants from units at province, city, county, and district levels were concentrated on how to guide peasants to enter markets and how to deal with the deep-rooted problems of rural areas. During the discussion at the provincial rural work conference (Ding Zhonghuo), mayor of Kaiyuan city, described problems they ran into the city's called on peasants to plant a large number of hawthorn trees and to greatly develop the production of wild sesame over the past few years in order to help peasants increase their incomes. It was unfortunate that the 7.5 million tonnes of hawthorns produced this year were not sold out and peasants who had engaged in the cultivation of wild sesame also suffered losses. Thus, the government's good deeds for the people have ended in complaints being heard everywhere. After hearing the speech made at the discussion by the mayor of Kaiyuan city, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, said: This experience shows us that we no longer need to do such things without [words indistinct]. He urged leading personnel at all levels to make more efforts in the future to study the affairs of markets, to establish markets, and to do a good job in conducting market management. Efforts should be made to reduce the blindness in the rural work and to deal with in a down-to-earth manner, the problems encountered by peasants who have already entered markets so as to enable peasants to hold their ground in markets. In discussing the issue of developing secondary and tertiary industries during the provincial work conference, the participating personnel from various counties and districts generally professed a shortage of funds. (Zhang Hong), secretary of the Dongming district party committee in Shenyang, voiced his opinions during the discussion and said: The 80 percent of investments made in the secondary and tertiary industries of Dongming district in 1993 come from funds raised by peasants. Participants at the discussion were surprised by continuously nodding their head. Many participating comrades said: Developing secondary and tertiary industries at county and district levels by depending on banks, loans, and [words indistinct] is not a good long-term method. We should share development with rural areas and develop systems of shareholding and cooperation in rural areas with peasants who possess funds. It was pointed out at the discussion that currently, the slow progress in purchasing grains was a prominent problem that will result in large differences in grain prices. Turning the contract for purchasing fixed-quota grains into an economic contract for procuring grains will cause deep-rooted problems of distrust between the government and peasants. In citing the issue of how to establish a rational mechanism of grain purchase and sale to foster the mechanism of the province's grain markets, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, put forward the following three principles: 1) Efforts should be made not only to take the state interests into consideration but also to give more profits to peasants. 2) Attention should be paid to building small cities that may serve as bridges to the advance of rural areas into markets. 3) Efforts should be made to regard changes in several rural policies as supportive, keep up with the ideological education conducted among peasants, make formal deals with peasants, and refrain from neglecting the ideological education of peasants.
