This is a timely and important reminder. His reminder acutely lays bare an important move of the British colonialists before they withdraw from Hong Kong, and their intentions. You may remember that in October 1989 the British Hong Kong Government put forward a plan entitled the "Port and Airport Development Strategy," which was then estimated to cost 127 billion Hong Kong dollars. In addition to this, it also engaged in a package of large-scale capital construction projects, which will go beyond 1997, such as a drainage project, reform of road networks, a railway development program, and so on, whereas the British Hong Kong Government had just over 50 billion Hong Kong dollars in its financial reserves at that time. In managing their finances, the British Hong Kong Government has also changed their usual practice, putting aside its long-standing policy of a balanced budget and practicing a deficit budget, i.e., draining the pond to get all the fish. Hong Kong citizens are deeply worried about this, fearing that this will exhaust the financial reserves of Hong Kong and lead to intensified inflation. The Chinese Government, thinking of the present and long-term interests of the 6 million countrymen in Hong Kong and of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, has advised the British Hong Kong Government several times in different ways. As early as 1990, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said the British Hong Kong Government must not do the trick of "you give a dinner party and I pay for it," spending lots and lots of money now but leaving a heavy burden to the future SAR Government and adding to the burden of Hong Kong people. Concerning the fiscal policy of the British Hong Kong Government, Jiang said that the policy of "spending no more than what one gets" should also be adhered to. Especially on the issue of the new airport, the Chinese Government upholds the Hong Kong people's interests according to reason. The Chinese Government has made its position clear: Hong Kong needs a new airport, but the construction of a new airport should be in conformity with the principle of "low cost and high efficiency." But the British Hong Kong Government has ignored this, and has even raised the cost of the new airport a great deal after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding. The construction of the airport and its railway will be mainly paid for with a huge loan of 70 billion Hong Kong dollars, and the loan is not due for repayment until after the setting up of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997, thus leaving a heavy economic burden on the SAR Government. In fact, the new airport will not be ready for use until seven or eight years later, and the British cannot wait for that day. So why do they show such enthusiasm for the construction? We can learn something from the fact that the British Hong Kong Government has given most contracts for project consultation and major contracts to British-funded companies who charge higher fees. The truth is that, on the one hand, they are trying to use the construction of the new airport and other projects to spend all of the financial reserves -- and even use the revenue of the future Special Administrative Region Government -- and, on the other hand, using various "modern packagings," they are putting as much money as possible into the pockets of British businessmen. This money is the blood and sweat of the Hong Kong people! Colonialists have their own gangster logic. Out-and-out invasion is claimed as help, and out-and-out plunder is claimed as charity. The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong today should be owed to the efforts of Hong Kong countrymen, to the backing of the whole Chinese nation. But the British are trying to make themselves look good. For the past 100 years or so, they have taken away whatever they could. Who knows how much they have robbed from Hong Kong! (The income of a Hong Kong governor is more than that of a British prime minister -- this is just a minor example.) Is it not clear who has fed whom after all? Now that it is not long before their withdrawal, they have begun to move away what they can, take away what they can, and spend and use up what they cannot with grandiose pretexts. Some Hong Kong people have already pointed out that it is easy to see from the newly published "(Draft) Regulations of the Airport Corporation" that the British Hong Kong Government intends to keep the new airport away from government supervision so that they can continue their influence in Hong Kong by controlling the new airport. Such behavior has been exposed and criticized by some wise Hong Kong people, who pointed out that the British, especially Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, have stepped onto a road of no-return against China, and we should guard against more of their confrontation and chaos-making tricks in the future in the way of finances, taxation, public construction, retirement benefits, civil service system, people's livelihood, and so on. Following the wind and rain in the transition period of the past several years, the Hong Kong people now have a stronger sense of belonging and identity with the motherland. Never before have they linked their love of the country with their love of Hong Kong so closely, and never before have they, as masters of their own affairs, concerned themselves with and taken part in the social affairs of Hong Kong and protested against various acts of obstructing Hong Kong's return to China and sabotaging a stable transition as they are today. More and more people are coming together for the love of both the country and Hong Kong. If there are people who, risking universal condemnation, dare to cause disorder in Hong Kong in an attempt to gut Hong Kong financially and leave Hong Kong in a mess, they will definitely be smashed to pieces in the strong deluge of patriotism and love for Hong Kong. Sincerely, [Signed] Bao Xin [Dated] 19 March
