FBIS3-18226 "drweu040__a94005" FBIS-WEU-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Germany 300,000 Metal Workers Hold Warning Strikes AU2402161694 Hamburg DPA in German 1510 GMT 24 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2402161694 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The IG-Metall trade union has once again tightened the screw of warning strikes. A record number of 300,000 working people of the west German metal and electrical industry participated in brief warning strikes on Thursday [24 February] -- five days before the strike ballot on a regular strike in Lower Saxony. The trade union had called for an "action day" so as to demonstrate once again its readiness to fight. On Wednesday 183,000 metal workers had gone on strike. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the trade union had 130,000 metal workers take to the street, as it reported. Speaking to rally participants in Remscheid, IG-Metall chief Klaus Zwickel called for the "red card" for the "nay-sayers in pinstripe suits." The strike concept stands, Zwickel stressed. In Baden-Wuerttemberg about 54,000 metal workers went on temporary strikes, in Bavaria 35,000. Dieter Hundt, the leader of the employers in the negotiations for Northern Wuerttemberg/Northern Baden, stressed that the employers will not give in. On Wednesday evening in Stuttgart he did not leave any doubt that in case of a strike in Lower Saxony, which might begin on 7 March, the employers will react with lock-outs. Then there might be "cold" lock-outs in the southwest, Hundt said. In this area there are companies that depend on supplies from Lower Saxony. Dieter Kirchner, main manager of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, accused IG-Metall of having falsely claimed that the employers want to abolish the vacation bonus and reduce incomes. "It is correct that there must be cutbacks in the vacation bonus so that the companies can get out of the cost crisis and jobs become more secure," Kirchner said. After all, Gesamtmetall does not want a general reintroduction of the 40-hour work week, either, but a regulation with which individual branches, such as research, development, sales, and customers' service, "may regularly work more than 36 hours per week." The trade union, on the other hand, demands up to 6 percent higher wages. However, it is willing to tone down its demands if measures to ensure employment are taken. This morning about 10,000 employees in the Opel works in Ruesselsheim closed down production for about one hour. At a rally in front of the company gate, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, assured the employees that if her party wins the election it will make sure that the old strike article 116 is again put into the Labor Promotion Law. This would deprive the employers of the possibility of a "cold lock-out." Nowadays companies can send their employees home without payment if they have to stop or reduce their production because of a lack of supplies due to a strike. In Saxony several thousand working people expressed solidarity with their colleagues in western Germany. At the same time, they protested against the hesitant behavior of the Association of Saxony's Metal and Electrical Industry concerning the still lacking transfer of the Bavarian framework wage contract to the wage area of Saxony.
