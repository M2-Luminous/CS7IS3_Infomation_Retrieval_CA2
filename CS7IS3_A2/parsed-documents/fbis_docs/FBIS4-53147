A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed as "totally false" a report by the Paris-based International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB) that the four members of the dissident Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church were on a hunger strike to protest their conditions at the Ba Sao re-education camp south of Hanoi. The monks were arrested and charged with "disturbing public order" after demonstrations in the former imperial capital of Hue last May 24. They were sentenced to prison terms of three to four years after a trial in November. In a statement released in Paris, the IBIB called on the Vietnamese government to allow representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the monks. Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the repair or renovation on nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas in the past three years and the increase in the number of monks and nuns from 17,000 to more than 20,000. They maintain, however, that all Buddhist "sects" should be integrated into the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was founded in 1982 under the umbrella of the Communist Party's Fatherland Front. Authorities also refused access to French lawyers who applied to defend the three monks at their trial and has not allowed journalists or human rights groups to visit the re-education camp where they are held. The leader of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Church, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, is also believed by human rights groups to be held under house arrest. The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated Hanoi's stance that the monks were tried legitimately for causing public unrest. The protest flared after monks thought police had come to arrest the head of the Link Mu pagoda in Hue.
