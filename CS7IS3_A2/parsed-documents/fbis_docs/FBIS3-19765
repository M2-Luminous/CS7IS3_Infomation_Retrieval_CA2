In an interview with DPA on Saturday [19 March] the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politician said that, in view of the Ankara regime's escalating military attacks against the Kurdish people, the federal government must impose a complete arms embargo. Otherwise, the minister said, "Germany will be contributing to Turkey's slide into a maelstrom of military violence from which it will not be able to escape." Schnoor stressed: "Anyone who supplies military weapons to a NATO partner without making sure that these weapons are not used against minorities in this partner's country gives people reason to flee instead of eliminating such reasons." The SPD politician emphasized: "A tragedy is taking place in southeast Turkey that will not be without effect on the internal peace of our country." According to him, many more than 70,000 mostly Kurdish refugees have come from Turkey to Germany over the past there years. This corresponds to the number of inhabitants in a city like Castrop-Rauxel in the Ruhr area. At the same time, the recognition quota for asylum applications is higher than for any other primary country of origin. Against the background of escalating conflicts between the Turkish army and the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is also becoming increasingly violent in Germany, Schnoor warned the Turkish Government "to give political reason priority over military operations." On the occasion of the forthcoming Kurdish New Year Nevruz, the minister appealed to Kurds in Germany not to let themselves be tempted to commit criminal acts, neither by the PKK nor by other organizations. The celebrations will begin next Monday and will probably be held throughout Germany until mid-week.
