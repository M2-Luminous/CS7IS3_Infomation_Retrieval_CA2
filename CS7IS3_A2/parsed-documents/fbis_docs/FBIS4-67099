To date no one--including the Thai Government and the Office of Narcotics Control Board--has been able to confirm or deny the rumor. We feel the Thai Government and the House of Representatives have a duty to clear up the facts on this issue. This is because regardless of whether the rumor is true, the MP's party and the House will suffer damage, as will the country's reputation. Even if the seizure of assets did take place, the question of whether the MP's conduct conforms with the accusation is another matter. The concerned U.S. authorities may have seized the assets in line with the relevant U.S. law, but it does not mean we have to believe the U.S. accusation is true. On the contrary, the Thai Government must carry out its own inquiry to provide justice to a Thai citizen. In this context, the U.S. Administration's role in dealing with the Singapore Government in the case of a caning sentence against a U.S. citizen is no different. It is strange that the Thai Government does not seem to be paying much attention to this issue. This is evident in the fact that it was the private news agency INN that broke the news, and no Thai agency has been able to confirm or deny the story. This is despite the fact that the Office of Narcotics Control Board maintains regular contact with the DEA to exchange information on the arrest of narcotics traffickers. We wonder what the government has been doing, or whether it is considering using this issue as a political weapon to cover up the bombing reports or discourage the opposition's planned no-confidence motion. It is becoming a joke that instead of benefiting from this, the government could be suspected of planting the rumor or using it to subdue the opposition. We feel that if the government promptly verifies the story and clears up the facts it will gain credit. If the Nakhon Phanom MP is guilty as charged, no one can help him.
