To all appearances, officers and retired servicemen of the armed forces will have to part with many benefits. In his letter to Chernomyrdin, Deputy Finance Minister Astakhov proposes that servicemen be deprived of free medical service (that is to say, the network of military outpatient hospitals should be closed down), and that compensation for treatment at sanatoriums and health resorts and transport fares be abolished. At the same time, Astakhov proposes that staffers of the Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs entitled to retirement pensions but continuing to serve should receive additionally an average of 75,000 rubles each. Deputy Minister of Economy Mikhaylov, responding to the same request, thinks that benefits for servicemen cannot be available in 1994, and he suggests that federal budget possibilities be studied once again. Deputy Social Protection Minister Kisilev writes to Chernomyrdin that their agency is against the mandatory state insurance of servicemen's property, and for abolishing reduced prices in trade outlets for military personnel. The Finance Ministry also insists that even if servicemen are to keep their benefits, it should only be done from the Defense Ministry's own budget -- which has been considerably reduced through the efforts of this same Finance Ministry.
