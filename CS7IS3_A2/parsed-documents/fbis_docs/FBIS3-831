Arde] [Text] Durban March 11 SAPA -- Flags were still flying in Ciskei's capital Bisho on Friday [11 March] afternoon, and the homeland government said order had been restored to the ranks of dissatisfied soldiers who protested against pension payments this week. Ciskei government spokesman Cedric Harrop allayed fears of an uprising. "There's orchestrated political incitement to scare people stiff about their pensions, but it's totally under control and everything is back to normal," he said. The Ciskei Civil Servants Association (Cisa), however, said there was still cause for concern about pension payments. On Thursday and Friday soldiers from 1 Ciskei Battalion demanded a direct address from the homeland's military ruler, Brig Oupa Gqozo, who later spoke to them. Senior civil servants in the homeland said soldiers wanted to be paid their accumulated pensions before the April elections, to secure their money before a new government took control. Mr Harrop said a new government could not interfere with the fund because it was independently managed by an international company. "It's immune from interference from this or any other government." He said the only people who could benefit from the fund were Ciskei civil servants after retirement. Other sectors of the civil service had expressed disquiet about their pensions in the past, and the soldiers' protest was just another ripple of general discontent. Mr Harrop said: "Ciskei people, particularly civil servants, occasionally get excited when they've had a bit to drink, but they calm down after a while." Cisa spokesman Mthimkulu Mashiya said although Bisho was calm, there was no telling how civil servants would react to decisions made about their pensions, especially because the fund was controlled unilaterally. He said a meeting was planned next week when civil servants would address the pension fund issue directly. The fund was administered without workers' representation and "I don't see how they can be happy with it", he added. Rumours of an uprising were doing the rounds in Bisho on Thursday, some prompted by events in Bophuthatswana and others by South African Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel telling a meeting there was talk of a Ciskei coup. Mr Harrop said as far as he could gather the soldiers were satisfied and had returned to their posts -- "the flags are still flying."
