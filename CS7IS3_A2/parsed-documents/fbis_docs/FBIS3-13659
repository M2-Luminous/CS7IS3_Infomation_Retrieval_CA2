The message concerns the latest developments in the talks with Israel in light of Arab moves to ensure security for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, disarm the settlers, and obtain a Security Council resolution condemning the Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This can be achieved by providing international protection and by tangible measures by the Israelis to ensure security for the Palestinians. Sa'id Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, noted that he and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid discussed U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent remarks about the status of Jerusalem. He noted that the Arab League secretary general promised to take the necessary measures to back the Palestinian side should the talks with Israel resume, especially with regard to the call for disbanding the settlements and not recognizing Israel's measures on Jerusalem. Kamal added that he briefed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid on the recent contacts held between PLO officials and Arab and international officials, including the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. He pointed out that these contacts dealt with the future of the Middle East peace process following the massacre. He noted that a meeting among officials from the cordon states [Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt and the PLO] is likely to be held on the sidelines of the Arab League ministerial meeting in Cairo on 26 March.
