[passage omitted] The president has taken his arguments further in a long and fascinating interview given to the weekly NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Jerome d'Orville has the details: [d'Orville] Mitterrand has given his firm support to the government against [Socialist Party leader] Michel Rocard and against Bernard-Henri Levy and his intellectuals. To deny the role and the usefulness of the United Nations, he says, would be -- under the cover of an apparently pacifist stance -- the surest way of prolonging the war. Sarajevo is breathing, and so is Gorazde; thanks to whom? the president asks. Francois Mitterrand is categorical: condemning negotiation is equivalent to opting for war. Today, we can glimpse the chance of a peaceful solution, and we have to seize hold of the opportunity, he declares. The president does not have very positive things to say about the situation in Italy either. He describes the circumstances in which Silvio Berlusconi came to power as dubious. It is an approach to democracy to which we are not accustomed, he says, and which seems dangerous. The time has come to say: beware -- danger, Mr. Mitterrand asserts, condemning the pressure put on public opinion by the vast information networks controlled by Mr. Berlusconi. Asked about Algeria, the president says that France should welcome those people whose lives are in danger because they have chosen progress. Finally, the president speaks of the achievements of the Left in government, achievements of which he is proud, even though Socialist governments have not done enough for equality of opportunity. Francois Mitterrand reminds readers that the Left has traditionally been a minority in France because conservative forces still control the main information networks and the major financial centers, and because the administration is permeated with their ideology.
