Every year when he is in Shanghai, he has a talk with Shanghai municipal party and government leaders, and expresses his views on the development of Pudong and the further development of Shanghai; he even puts forward suggestions for the CPC Central Committee. All this serves to show his earnest concern for the city of Shanghai. Deng Xiaoping blamed himself during his trip to southern China in 1992: "Shanghai has all the conditions for faster development, for it enjoys superiorities in able personnel, technology, and management, and it has a greater capability for spreading its influence. Looking back at what I have done! I realize that one of my major mistakes is my failure to add Shanghai to the existing four special economic zones. If I had done so, the Chang Jiang delta, the entire Chang Jiang Valley, as well as the nationwide situation of reform, could have progressed in the same wave." Thus it can be seen that the reason Deng shows special concern for Shanghai is that to him, the overall situation of nationwide reform and opening up depends on the development of Shanghai. There Is No Limit to the Emancipation of the Mind This year, driven by his high hopes for Shanghai, Deng Xiaoping set his foot in Shanghai earlier than previous years. Accompanied by his daughter, Mao Mao, and others, he arrived in Shanghai before New Year's Eve. After his arrival, he inspected the grand Yangpu Bridge and the busy Shanghai streets around New Year's Day, and expressed his views to the municipal party and government leaders on how to speed up the pace of development in Pudong and in Shanghai as a whole. According to a source in Beijing, on 3 January, after hearing reports by Shanghai municipal party and government leaders on Shanghai's development in 1993, Deng Xiaoping said: "I have come to Shanghai every year in the past few years, and I feel very pleased to see the development and changes that have taken place in the city. Practice has proved that the line of regarding economic construction as a central task is correct, for it tallies with our national conditions and has won the popular support. Shanghai has very good industrial, as well as scientific and technological foundations, and enjoys superiority in able personnel, so Shanghai should make greater accomplishments in reform and opening up; should persistently push forward Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic construction with high standards and from high starting points; and should render service to the reform and opening up of the entire country. To this end, leading cadres are required to further emancipate their minds. It is true that Shanghai has attained great achievements and that Shanghai's leaders are open-minded. However, because society is undergoing development and because great changes are taking place every minute, there is no limit to the emancipation of our minds. Some people are worried that they may make mistakes and go to extremes if they overdo emancipation. Their worries are totally groundless. Static and metaphysical concepts go against the basic outlook of Marxism. In the final analysis, what these people have is fear; they fear that the nature of China's socialist system will be changed and that China will take the road of capitalism. Of course, they have good intentions, yet some people inside our party cannot bear the sight of many new things, even today, and they have become critics and commentators. Now they are playing a negative role and have hindered cadres from giving full play to their initiative and creativity." People from Beijing's political circles believe that by claiming that "there is no limit to the emancipation of the mind," Deng Xiaoping aimed to call on cadres in Shanghai and the entire country to have the courage to open up a new situation in reform and development, and to reach a new realm of thought in the emancipation of the mind. Without constant emancipation of the mind, our cause will not undergo constant development. On 13 January, Shanghai's JIEFANG RIBAO carried a commentator's article entitled "Further Emancipating the Mind." The article's detailed expositions of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on the issue of emancipating the mind has drawn the attention of the entire country. We Need To Employ New Ideas in the Course of Reform According to the source, Deng Xiaoping added: "To push Shanghai's economic construction to an all-time high, the key issue is to employ new ideas in reform and opening up. This task requires us to further emancipate our minds. To attain the goal of further emancipating our minds, we need to overcome our fear and have greater courage. We can achieve new ideas only when we are willing to give it a try. To further emancipate our minds, we should oppose arrogance and shatter complacency. Do not be complacent over occasional successes. In short, to attain fairly great development in our economy, we need to make a change in our concepts. Yet we should not change only some of our concepts and keep the others; neither should we change our concepts in name only. "We communists advocate socialism. What is socialism? To put it frankly, some of our comrades are not clear about the definition, even today, or we can say that they have not entirely extricated themselves from the set patterns of dogmatism. The essence of socialism is to free and develop productive forces, to eliminate exploitation and polarization, and to reach the final target of common prosperity. We should tell people this truth over and over again until they can gain a thorough understanding," added Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping continued: "I made it clear two years ago that we can hardly make new accomplishments if we do not have the courage or the energy to open up new paths. There is nothing in this world concerning which we can be 100-percent sure of its success and correctness. We need to rely on practice." People in Beijing's political circles believe that by calling for "new ideas in reform and opening up," Deng Xiaoping actually is making known his hope that cadres should give rein not only to their enthusiasm, but also their initiative. There is no mistaking the target of his remarks, for many cadres nowadays are excessively sedate and lack initiative. They are afraid of taking risks, of being "the first" to make mistakes in explorations, and of losing their vested interests in reform. If they are worried by so many things, how can they set up an operational mechanism for the market economy and for pushing economic development onto a new level? It has been learned that, in order to counter this situation, the CPC top leadership has decided to make a serious change to its customary way of thinking concerning the selection of leaders, by which stress generally was placed on cadres' enthusiasm, instead of their initiative. It is imperative to have the courage to promote young cadres who have great potential and who dare to open up new paths. By so doing, we can appoint people on their merits, and give them jobs suited to their abilities. Corruption Has Become a Malignant Tumor The source noted that Deng Xiaoping also touched on the current campaign against corruption. Deng Xiaoping indicated: "If party members and party cadres are corrupt and abuse their authority for personal gain, what right do they have to represent the people, and how can the people support them? We should dismiss cadres of this kind from their posts, and resolutely send to the people's courts those who deserve it. We must not be vague in this matter. Shanghai has attained results in this field, and it is correct for Shanghai to focus its campaign to build clean administration on department-level cadres. Your former mayor, Zhu Rongji, also has made some contributions to this achievement, and you should keep up the good work in the future." Deng Xiaoping is telling the truth. During his tenure as mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Rongji always paid close attention to the building of clean administration and set strict rules for government cadres. At a people's congress meeting marking the commencement of his term of office, Zhu Rongji made it clear that his goal was to build a "clean, highly efficient, and highly authoritative" municipal government. He often cited an ancient saying: "The public will obey only a government that is clean, not one that is strict. Clean administration is the mother of authority." Shortly after he took office, Zhu Rongji instructed the municipal supervisory bureau: Your primary task is to keep a close watch on Shanghai's 506 department-level cadres. He believed that clean practices can be spread among all cadres of the municipality only when the senior-ranking cadres of the municipal government succeed in maintaining their cleanliness in administration. Under his leadership, the municipal government drew up and put into strict implementation rules for cadres on the building of clean administration, and all violators have been handled sternly. Under the influence of Zhu Rongji, Shanghai indeed attained remarkable results in the building of clean administration. However, the problem of corruption is becoming increasingly serious on a national scale, and corrupt practices have become common social phenomena, a malignant tumor, and the biggest social contamination in mainland China today. Hu Anga1ng [5170 7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342], two experts from the National Conditions Analysis Group under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have submitted to the CPC top leadership a "Report on National Conditions" entitled "Fighting Against Corruption Through Innovations in the System," yet so far, people can see no sign of new policy decisions by the CPC top leadership on a radical cure of the problem. People now believe that it was not alarmist talk when Deng Xiaoping pointed out 10 years ago that "the trend of corruption has broken out with tremendous force. If our party fails to pay serious attention on the problem and to resolutely check the trend, our party and country will have to face the possibility of changing color."
