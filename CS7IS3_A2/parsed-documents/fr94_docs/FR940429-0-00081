The Secretary indicated in the Notice that he intended to issue regulations establishing procedures for schools to appeal their default rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The notice solicited public help in developing those procedures. The Secretary invited public comment on any aspect of implementing the statute, but in particular, the Secretary solicited comments on the following issues: 1. What procedures should the Secretary use in determining whether to exclude from the calculation of cohort default rates loans, the inclusion of which due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of a school's cohort default rate?
