An Israeli-Arab arrested in 1988 is still in prison on charges of spying for Washington, said Yosi Melman, co-author of "Friends Indeed, Inside the US-Israel Alliance." In another case a member of Israel's Shin Bet General Security Service passed on documents to double agent Major Yosi Amit, an Israeli intelligence officer he knew, Melman said. The Shin Bet man has never been identified, nor has the Israeli-Arab, but Amit was released in October after serving seven years of a 12-year term. "Israel has never wanted to admit which country Amit spied for," Melman told AFP. "All we know officially is that he supplied information to foreign agents. Although the United States denies it, I believe he spied for them. "The Shin Bet agent who handed over documents to Amit claimed that he did not know what Amit did with them," Melman said. He was jailed for only three months. "The first arrest in 1986 led Israeli investigators to suspect that the United States has set up a spy ring in Israel," Melman added. With co-author and American Dan Raviv of CBS, he claims that the United States monitors Israel from a giant intelligence-gathering base in northern England which also watches Europe. "One unit specializing in Hebrew listens permanently to Israel," Melman said. However he added that "the United States is cautious and uses a limited number of spies in Israel." The book also backed previous press reports that Israel offered the United States a spy exchange in 1991, four years after the United States jailed for life Jonathan Pollard, a US naval officer, who spied for Israel.
