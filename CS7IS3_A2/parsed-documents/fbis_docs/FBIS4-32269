It quotes Igor Nemec, the head of the Government Office and chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities, as telling it that under the Law on Czech Citizenship, the people who would not apply for Czech citizenship by the end of June, will get the statute of foreigners as of July 1, and will become subjects to the alien regime. In 1993, the Czech Government charged district authorities to appoint advisers to people wanting to acquire Czech citizenship. For long months, the Romany press has been urging Romanies to settle the question individually, Nemec said. People can also ask for Czech citizenship after June 30, but only as foreigners. Foreigners have neither the right to social and health security, nor the right to vote. They are not obliged to serve in the Czech Army, and are allowed to run businesses only under special terms, the paper writes. Nemec told the daily that the Romanies had found themselves in an absurd situation. In the past decades their problems were settled by the paternalistic state and they became accustomed to it. It is impossible for this trend to continue, Nemec stressed. The daily also quotes Vaclav Trojan from the Romany section within the Helsinki Civic Assembly as stating that many Romanies will not be able to meet the conditions set by the law for acquiring Czech citizenship, mainly that of a five-year clean record. LIDOVE NOVINY quotes the Czech Republic's Alien Police as saying it would later specify the steps to be taken towards the Romanies without Czech citizenship after June 30. Some 200,000 Romanies are estimated to live in the Czech Republic, but they are migrating between the country and Slovakia, a habit surviving since the times of the Czechoslovak Federation.
