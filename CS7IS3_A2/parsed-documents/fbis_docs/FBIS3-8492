I would first like to express my deep gratitude for the contribution made to Albania's associate membership in the North Atlantic Assembly through an accelerated process, President Berisha said. I also have the pleasure of ascertaining that this visit of yours came after Albania clearly and finally demonstrated its Western pertinence. During the days of the ultimatum, Albania offered the alliance its ports and airports. We did so, first of all, to respect our Western roots, but to also defend those prominent values and principles that the North Atlantic Alliance has decided to defend in Bosnia. We also signed the Partnership for Peace plan with pleasure because we consider it an active and dynamic process in Albania's full and dignified membership in the pact. We hail the achievements that are being observed toward a solution to the extremely complicated crisis in Bosnia, Berisha continued. However, we observe with concern that this facilitation in the north is also accompanied by an increase in tension toward the south. There is an undeniable escalation of violence and terror in Kosova today. Out of revenge for the defeats suffered in the north, Milosevic is closing the last remaining legal institutions in Kosova one after another, such as the recent closure of the Albanological Institute and the harassment of its Albanian scientists. This is being carried out in full conformity with the memorandum of the Academy of Serbia, which anticipates the extermination and ethnic cleansing of the non-Slavic peoples in the territories included in Greater Serbia. We welcome and support the contribution made by the European Union, the United States, and Russia in resolving the Balkan crisis, but we ask for determination so that no one's presence can serve as an encouragement for the Serbs, who are the only aggressors, or serve their certain imperial aims. This would have had very serious consequences in the region's stability. I am happy to be in Albania, Mr. Bouvard said, and I am very enthusiastic about Albania's associate membership through an accelerated process, because Albania has showed itself worthy of this membership. We applaud your achievements in the determined and difficult reform that you have undertaken in the army. We consider Albania a country that belongs to Western Europe and a country that is working for stability in the region. We are determined to contribute to its strengthening, because in this way we are contributing to stability in the region. We see every possibility of granting Albania full membership in the North Atlantic Alliance.
