FBIS3-54139 "drnes015_l_94017" FBIS-NES-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 ISRAEL Defense Sources View Regional Arms Race TA2301191594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1700 GMT 23 Jan 94 TA2301191594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Text] Defense establishment sources said that Russia and eastern European countries are continuing to supply arms to the Middle East in order to earn foreign currency. According to the sources, the arms race would continue in the long run because there were cheap weapon stockpiles in eastern Europe and Russia. Additional countries, such as China and North Korea, had also begun selling arms to the region. The sources noted that increasing pressure from Western arms industries to produce weapons would lead to a continuation of the arms race. These trends would effect the scope of the threats that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] would have to face over the coming years. Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that according to the defense sources, Iraq remained in regional and international isolation and the efforts to supervise its nuclear capabilities continued. Iran was purchasing weapon systems and submarines and rapidly emerging as the main danger to the region. The Persian Gulf, the sources explained, would remain a source of instability and it could be safely assumed that Saddam Husayn's behavior would remain a constant cause of tension. It was also reported that approximately 25 percent of the IDF's budget last year was earmarked for its military buildup, approximately 25 percent was spent on training, 10 percent on operational activities, with the remaining 40 percent going to maintenance and wages. Last year, the Intelligence Branch focused on improving early warning capabilities, pinpointing threats, and coping with long-range challenges. The Intelligence Branch invested great efforts in supplying all the information needed for the political process. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January carries a report by Yariv Ben-Yehuda about a briefing to military correspondents by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Major General 'Uzi Dayan, respectively the deputy chief of staff and the head of the IDF's Planning Branch. Referring to the IDF's work plan for 1994, Shahaq is quoted as saying that the plan "does not foresee changes in the deployment of the troops on the Golan Heights," and that "the entire security budget totals 20.24 billion shekels."]
