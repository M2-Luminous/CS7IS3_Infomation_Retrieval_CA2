After addressing the National Assembly, he departed for Bulgaria's second largest city Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria). "I commend highly Mr. Berisha's address to parliament as it spelled out clearly, without using diplomatic language, the key problems threatening our region: a communist legacy, imperial ambitions and rampant nationalism," Mr. Yordanov told reporters. According to him, it is not by accident that a number of Balkan heads of state are interested in expressing their countries' stands in the Bulgarian National Assembly, of all places. In his view, this is due to the key role which Bulgaria is playing in the Balkans now. On Tuesday [26 April] the Bulgarian National Assembly was also addressed by Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov. Mr. Berisha told the Bulgarian Parliament that "history confirmed on a number of occasions that Greater Serbia has always been a transitional, unstable structure and a source of war, conflicts, destabilization and aggression." Asked if he shared Mr. Berisha's stand on the war in former Yugoslavia, the National Assembly chairman said that sometimes "Bulgaria really forgets who started the war, while the whole is clear that this was the Serbs' aspiration to territorial aggrandizement." According to Mr. Yordanov, the war in former Yugoslavia was a natural result of the traditional nationalism in the Balkans, the xenophobia and ethnic intolerance which were catalyzed by the post-communist situation. "We should not forget that democratic changes in Yugoslavia are too slow and that the communist structures and leaders are still predominating," Mr. Yordanov said. Asked if he expected that the closeness in the positions of Sofia, Skopje and Tirana would arouse fears in Belgrade and Athens, Mr. Yordanov said that he was convinced that Mr. Berisha's speech would be read very carefully both in the Greek and in the Serbian capitals. "No matter how other countries will react to Mr. Berisha's address to the Bulgarian National Assembly, its frankness and sincerity cannot be denied," Mr. Yordanov said. Asked whether Bulgarian-Greek relations had soured over Macedonia, Mr. Yordanov said that "the Greek policy is clearly oriented towards Europe and that the Greeks are justified in certain respects to express concern over some texts in the Constitution of Macedonia which are inconsistent with the principles of the European Union member countries." Mr. Yordanov added that "contacts between Bulgaria and Greece are built on principles which matter far more than historical memories like, for example, integration into the European structures. And it is a fact that we consider Greece a country through which Bulgaria could practically integrate into these structures," the National Assembly Chairman said. Mr. Yordanov said that the positions of Bulgaria and Albania on the inclusion of Turkish blue helmets in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in Macedonia had not been discussed. "I do not differentiate between Turkish, Bulgarian, American, Finnish, Russian or other blue helmets. I would rather prefer blue helmets crossing Bulgaria than green ones," Mr. Yordanov said. According to him, it is another matter that the presence of Turkish blue helmets in particular could play a destructive role in the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where nationalism is extreme.
