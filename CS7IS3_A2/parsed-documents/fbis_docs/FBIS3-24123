His latest attempts to strengthen the bank's control of the previous metals market provide unequivocal evidence of this. The first step in this direction was the telegram that was sent to commercial banks yesterday to explain the new procedure for using the Ministry of Finance's "gold" certificates. The document, which was compiled by the Central Bank without the ministry's knowledge, imposes strict limits on possibilities for the use of the certificates. While the Russian banks were wondering whether they could trust the Ministry of Finance's gold at all, the Central Bank quickly put the finishing touches on its own plan for the development of the precious metals market. It is designed mainly to show Russian financiers that Central Bank personnel can handle this market as well as their colleagues from the Ministry of Finance. At one of his press conferences in January, the chairman of the Central Bank reaffirmed his dissatisfaction with the development of the Russian precious metals market and said that the Ministry of Finance had been negligent, in particular, in organizing the campaign for the more widespread use of the "gold" certificates. As a result, 50 of the 100 tonnes of gold securing the certificates were sold to the Central Bank, and it used this gold to pay part of the debt assigned to commercial banks. After complaining about the insufficient preparations for the issuance of the certificates, Mr. Gerashchenko suggested that the Central Bank had its own plan for the establishment of the gold market in Russia. For a long time it has been no secret that the country's current chief banker has had a sincere wish to reorganize the Russian gold reserve system. When he was still the acting chairman of the bank, Viktor Gerashchenko repeatedly proposed that the State Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones be removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and that the gold reserve be administered directly by the Central Bank. There were several arguments in favor of this. The Central Bank would have gained the ability to heighten the liquidity of its own assets and regulate the amount of money in circulation quickly and efficiently by selling gold on the domestic market. Russian banks would have had an alternative to foreign currency investments, which are usually used as a hedge against inflation. This might have strengthened the ruble. At that time, however, Gerashchenko's opponents--former Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and former acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar--informed the Central Bank that the Ministry of Finance could sell gold itself. The "gold" certificates issued last September corroborated this. After the Russian banks had gained access to the "golden altar" of the finance market, they could conduct a fairly broad range of operations. In particular, in the event of the resale of the certificates, the banks could "split" their value, equivalent to 10 kilograms of gold (just over 203 million rubles at this time), and thereby attract the attention of less prosperous investors. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY sources, this was the intention of virtually all of the banks that bought the certificates--the Inter-Economic Savings Bank, the Industrial Construction Bank, "Menatep," Most-Bank, "Mytishchinskiy," "Russian Credit," and "Stolichnyy." The liquidity of the certificates, meanwhile, left much to be desired: A decision was made to liquidate them once a year. Besides this, the banks could not use the purchased gold on the international market. The recent slight decline in the rating of the certificates apparently motivated the Central Bank to promote its own plan for the organization of the precious metals market (especially in view of the loyalty of Viktor Chernomyrdin's new cabinet to the head of the Russian bank). The first step in this direction was the telegram defining the new procedure for servicing the Ministry of Finance certificates, which clearly diminished their appeal. The telegram specifically said that, in the event of the resale of the certificates, the banks would be allowed to issue only their own bonds (instead of receipts for a specific share of the certificate, which had been a common practice--KOMMERSANT-DAILY). Central Bank staffers explained that all of the banks operating in the market for shares of certificates would have to draw up new sales documents. This would require the payment of the applicable tax (0.5 percent of the amount issued) and a registration procedure. In addition, the bonds could be issued only by banks which had been operating at a profit for the last three years, had no late payments to the budget or the Central Bank on their record, had complied with all standards, and had distributed all securities issued to date. This meant that many of the banks selling the certificates would have to collect all of the "split gold" and wait until September for its liquidation. It is most likely, however, that the banks still have a chance of using the sold certificates more effectively. This is suggested by the absence of any mention in the telegram of the mechanism for the "re-recording" of certificate sales (KOMMERSANT-DAILY received all of this information in verbal reports from Central Bank staffers) and by the possible intervention of the issuing party--the Ministry of Finance--in this conflict. Finally, the Central Bank, which intends to publicize its own plan for the organization of the precious metals market soon, probably will try to reach a compromise with agents of the Ministry of Finance and it needs the support of the other banks. Obviously, this will not be that difficult, because the Central Bank plan appeals more to commercial banks than the Ministry of Finance's "Statute on Certificates," and the Central Bank plans to limit the group of banks authorized to conduct "gold" operations. In this atmosphere of fierce competition, the contenders are not likely to openly oppose the Central Bank's attempts to change the rules of play in the middle of the game.
