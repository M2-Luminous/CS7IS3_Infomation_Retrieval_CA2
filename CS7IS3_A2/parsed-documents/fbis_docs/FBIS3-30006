The SDP had been hoping to join the union for a long time, but other members from the Liberal Democratic Party, Democratic Socialist Party and Komeito Party rejected it because the SDP attached importance to North Korea and refused to change its policy toward South Korea. The nine SDP lawmakers joined the union on a personal level and the SDP's membership on a party level is still not permitted. Yamahana, who is now state minister in charge of political reform in the cabinet, visited South Korea last September for the first time as SDP chairman.
