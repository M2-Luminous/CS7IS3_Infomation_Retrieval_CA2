PRD presidential candidate Perez Balladares on Friday publicly challenged President Endara to broadcast on television all the videos the president has on how the people were mocked during the cabinet council meetings during the past military regime. Endara phoned Circuito RPC Television station during the "Let Us Find Solutions" program hosted by Julio Miller to make a statement. Endara recommended that the PRD presidential candidate withdraw his challenge or face the consequences. The president told Perez Balladares several times to "withdraw your challenge, because those videos will affect you." Endara explained that he had not officially decided whether he would broadcast the unedited videos, but he warned that he had already set aside the time slot between 2000 and 2100 on Channel 11 [Panama City Sistema de Television Educativa] to air the videos on the abuses of the past military regime. "Perhaps the scenes you will see on Channel 11 will not be as dramatic as those you saw on Thursday, but they will confirm the cynicism and disregard for the people upon which the PRD prided itself in the past," Endara stressed. Endara denied that the videos he broadcast on a national network were part of the 15,000 boxes that the U.S. Government has had since the 1989 military invasion. "With God as my witness, that video was given to me on 5 April and I went through a real calvary before making my decision," the president added. Endara said he knew about these videos filmed at the Presidential Palace but that until he was shown the contents he had never been interested in watching them, because he was too busy with the huge task of rebuilding the country. "In addition to those videos, I know there are rooms full of documents that belonged to the previous regime. I have never looked at them because I am not interested in the problems of the presidents who were in office before me," Endara said. The president added that before deciding to show the video on television he consulted with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the Arnulfist Party. Endara said that Mireya advised him to think hard before making a decision because it could hurt him. Endara added that at no time did the Arnulfist Party candidate try to benefit from the videos. Likewise, President Endara said that his decision to publicly air the videos did not violate the Santa Maria Pact because he never used his office to support political interests. "At no place in the Santa Maria Pact did I commit myself to being impartial. I promised to abide by the Constitution and the laws, and that is what I have done throughout my term in office," Endara said. Meanwhile, at 1900 on Monday, the Peace and Justice Commission will meet with all the political parties to analyze the president's speech during the radio and television network. The meeting will be held at Santa Maria La Antigua University auditorium. A bulletin issued by the commission advised that its members met on 15 April to discuss the president's actions and decided to inform the delegates of the political parties that signed the Santa Maria Pact of their views on Monday.
