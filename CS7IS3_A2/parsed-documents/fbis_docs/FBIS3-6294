"It seems difficult" for the share to reach the 20 percent level because there is no room for U.S. suppliers to export because the American economy is strong, the source said. Under a 1991 agreement on semiconductor trade, Japan and the United States agreed to a 20 percent goal for foreign market share by the end of 1992. In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign share exceeded that goal, but has been on the decline since. The foreign share of Japan's microchip market has been a major source of contention between Washington and Tokyo, as the 20 percent share is viewed as a commitment by the United States but as a nonbinding target by Japan.
