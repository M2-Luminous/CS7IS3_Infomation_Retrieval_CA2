As I worked on chemical weapons I could not help but realize for what purpose they were being made. Just as I realized that by breaking my silence I would end up in jail sooner or later. A few days ago I came back after spending 27 days in custody. There I realized that it is not just the "chemical generals" who are willing to go to any length to settle scores with those who would spoil their comfortable and peaceful lives under the veil of secrecy. The same kind of "generals" are to be found in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the procuracy and the courts. Some of them poison bodies and some of them poison souls, and it is hard to say which is worse. In a word, politics is poisoned. But the generals are not the only problem. We have become too accustomed to slavery to behave like free people. When released, former prisoners often attempt to forget the nightmare of degradation that they have experienced -- it no longer concerns them! But to forget is to condone the tyranny that is now being imposed on others. Until recently my images of prison and prisoners were derived solely from movies. I thought that criminals and their behavior were a terrible world inaccessible to us. And, as an ordinary individual, I was actually glad that I did not understand it. The initial holding cell at Matrosskaya Tishina is legendary. It is the waiting room of hell. Dirty, worn walls and slovenly guards. A 16-square-meter box into which 50 people are crammed, going for almost 24 hours at a stretch without sleep, food or water. The very first morning proved just how little the life of a prisoner is worth, a prisoner whose guilt might never even be proven. A drunk guard brutally beat a Kurd who was trying to ask for something. "You scumbags," he screamed, "you bandits -- I'll destroy anybody who talks back to me!" Then a few more hours of humiliation: photographs, fingerprints and, finally, one's "own" cell: four iron bunks and three mattresses for seven people. When the doors slammed shut behind me I inwardly cringed, expecting a continuation of the mockery. But the first thing I heard was: "Sit down! Do you want some tea?" They saw that I had brought nothing with me and offered me some food. Simple human gestures... This may shock some people, but in our inside-out world, in a world poisoned by politicians, prison is genuinely fair. People will share the only thing they own with you without expecting anything in return. There is no hypocrisy and no lies. Over there is a murderer, and I am a political prisoner -- yet we are the same. I am respected for my mind, not for my past achievements. You are perceived for what you are. In everyday life -- I am a Tatar myself -- one can often hear people used words like "chuchmek" [derogatory term for person of Central Asian origin] or "natsmen," [ethnic minority] and as for calling a Jew a "Yid"... In prison there is neither Greek nor Jew, and ethnic hatred does not exist as a concept. I saw people help a Vietnamese man. He could not understand a thing -- and people explained things to him, interpreted for him, showed him... But look at how foreigners are viewed in Moscow -- "as if we didn't have enough criminals of our own." The newspapers print it, television broadcasts it and the Moscow government takes measures to eradicate crime "by persons from the Caucasus region." But in prison there is none of this. I was told: do not worry, in prison no one will ever lay a hand on you. Anyone who breaks the truce faces complete ostracism, because for the slightest infraction they drag out everyone, beat them up and throw them in solitary. Anyone who causes a row is not just putting himself at risk. In order to survive there you must become an optimist. In the larger cells, where there are 100 or more prisoners instead of just 25, there are "families" of 5-7 individuals. They share everything they get from outside. Those who get no packages do the dirty jobs and get a piece of sugar -- the common currency here -- from each of the others. One cellmate of mine in Cell 238 was a businessman who sells woodworking equipment. He was just driving along, at a roadblock they found a pistol in his car -- and now he is doing four months' time. That is not much. A driver from Sheremetevo used to take whatever he found lying around. One prisoner is a pickpocket, another is in prison for petty theft, and yet another is there for brawling. None of them likes the Duma or Zhirinovskiy. "He," they say, "is a fascist, just like our prison guards." In prison I realized that human rights are just as important a struggle as the fight against chemical weapons. Many people have been in prison for three or four years without a trial. The chairman of Tellur Cooperative is in his fifth year in prison for "embezzlement of socialist property": he used a short-term loan to buy computers instead of food items. Yet the law states that no one may be held longer than two months without trial. Our constitution and laws, imperfect though they may be, are our only protection against those who have the power. Even in prison you have rights and obligations under the Investigative Detention Center Charter. But you will not be allowed to look at that charter -- it is "for official use only." Yet as long as it applies only to the prison guards, every one of us is in danger. My former colleagues are still afraid to speak up, both those who work for the defense industry and those who are already retired. It has been almost a year and a half since I came out publicly, but still I am the only one. Whether they will put me in jail again (going to jail is one of those things that are out of my hands) will depend on the new general procurator. I hope that things will be easier for those who come after me...
