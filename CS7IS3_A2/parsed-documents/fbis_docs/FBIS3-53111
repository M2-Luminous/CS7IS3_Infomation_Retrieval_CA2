The two sides described today's talks as satisfactory. Our correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba: Today was the test of the immense diplomatic effort invested in the past few weeks in Oslo, Paris, in Cairo which was ultimately crowned with success. The agenda for the continuation of the Taba talks was set today. It was decided to resume the talks tomorrow morning, apparently once again in a limited forum. In a news conference with dozens of television and radio crews from all over the world, Nabil Sha'th described today as a useful day. Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, was asked whether it was a positive day: [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I cannot point to any impressive progress today, but we exchanged ideas and picked up from where we left off almost two months ago.
