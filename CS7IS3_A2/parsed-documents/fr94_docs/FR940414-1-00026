The Dietary Risk Evaluation System (DRES) chronic analysis for thifensulfuron methyl used a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.013 mg/kg body weight/day, based on a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.25 mg/kg bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 2-year feeding study in rats which demonstrated as an effect lower body weight gains in males. Serum sodium in males and females was sporadically lower throughout the study. This RfD has been approved by both the HED (2/25/88) and Agency RfD (3/23/88) committees. Food uses evaluated in this analysis for thifensulfuron methyl were the published tolerances (barley, soybeans, and wheat) found in 40 CFR 180.439 and the Tolerance Index System (TIS), plus a pending tolerance on corn. This chronic exposure analysis was performed for thifensulfuron methyl using tolerance level residues and 100 percent crop treated information to estimate the Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population and 22 population subgroups. The TMRC for the general population from all published tolerances is 1.1 X 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 1% of the RfD. The tolerances proposed for the oat grain contributes 5 X 10 -6 mg/kg bwt/day, or less than 1% of the RfD ( viz . 0.03). If proposed new tolerances and the pending tolerance on corn are considered, the resulting TMRC would be 1.3 X 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 1% of the RfD. The highest exposed subgroups are nonnursing infants (less than a year) and children (1 to 6 years). The TMRC for all uses, including the pending tolerance on corn and the proposed tolerance on oats, for the non-nursing infants subgroup would be 3.1 X 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day, or 2% of the RfD. Using the same exposure assumptions, the subgroup for children would result in a TMRC of 2.8 x 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day, also 2% of the RfD. The DRES chronic analysis for tribenuron methyl used a RfD of 0.008 mg/kg bwt/day, based on a NOEL of 0.79 mg/kg bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 1-year feeding study in dogs which demonstrated as an effect elevated serum bilirubin and AST levels. Tribenuron methyl is considered a class C carcinogen with no Q * established for quantification of potency. EPA considers the cancer risk from tribenuron methyl to be negligible. Food uses evaluated in this analysis for tribenuron methyl were the published tolerances (barley and wheat) found in 40 CFR 180.451 and TIS. Currently there are no other pending tolerances for tribenuron methyl. The chronic exposure analysis performed for tribenuron methyl used tolerance level residues and 100-percent crop treated information to estimate the TMRC for the same 22 subgroups as thifensulfuron methyl. The TMRC for the general population from all published tolerances is 7.4 X 10 -5 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 1% of the RfD ( viz . 0.92). The proposed tolerance on oats contributes an additional 5.0 X 10 -6 mg/kg bwt/day, which represents less than 1% of the RfD. If the new tolerance is established the total TMRC would equal 7.8 X 10 -5 mg/kg bwt/day, or 1% of the RfD ( viz . 0.97). The highest exposed subgroups are children (1 to 6 years) and children (7 to 12 years). If the proposed tolerance on oats is established the resultant TMRC, from all uses, would be 1.7 X 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day, comprising 2% of the RfD for children (1 to 6 years). If the tolerance on oats is established the TMRC from all uses would be 1.2 X 10 -4 mg/kg bwt/day for children (7 to 12 years), also 2% of the RfD. DRES considers the dietary risks from thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl on oats to be of minimal concern. Also, considering that the proposed uses are given at tolerance level and 100% crop treated values were used there is likely an overestimation of exposures. Exposure from residues for thifensulfuron methyl through oats represents less then 1% of the RfD for the U.S. population. Similarly, exposure from residues for tribenuron methyl through oats represents less then 1% of the RfD for the U.S. population. Based on these values, EPA concludes that the chronic dietary risk for residues of thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl through the proposed use on oat grain is minimal. Section 409 tolerances for thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl on oat processed commodities are not needed because residues are not expected to concentrate on processing. There are no pending regulatory actions against the registration of these pesticides. These pesticides are useful for the purpose for which these tolerances are sought. Adequate analytical methodology is available for enforcement purposes. The method is not yet published in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), but can be obtained in the interim period as follows: By mail from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Crystal Mall #2, Rm. 1128, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5805. Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
