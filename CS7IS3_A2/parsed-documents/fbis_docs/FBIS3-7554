[Ichikawa] There are three factors that will affect the course of political realignment. One is how the ruling parties should form a political force strong enough to compete against the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. The other is how to select recognized candidates for single-seat constituencies. The last is when the next general election will be conducted. None of them has been given apparent answers. However, if the budget bill is passed during the current Diet session, the pace of political realignment will be greatly accelerated. If this happens, the chief factor that gears up the realignment will be the way to select candidates. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How does Komeito intend to deal with the realignment? [Ichikawa] We characterize the new electoral system as a tool to select a force that can take the reins of government. The change of government is the most effective measure to prevent political corruption. Together with other ruling parties, we want to establish a new political force that can compete against the LDP and has only one name. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There are also moves within the ruling coalition to unite social democrats and liberals. [Ichikawa] Right now, it looks as if the ruling parties were announcing their own ideas at separate studios. We will be able to understand each other if we discuss at the same studio and the same table. We all know that, unless the ruling parties unite, the Hosokawa reform government will collapse. I think the ruling parties will be merged into a large political force under the goal of promoting reforms together. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP] should form a parliamentary group first? [Ichikawa] It is ideal that all the ruling parties form a parliamentary group at one time. But because there is still concern, which has been caused by misunderstanding, that the realignment of political parties might be promoted under the initiative of Shinseito and Komeito, I think it is favorable if Shinseito and the JNP play a major role in uniting the ruling parties. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How will the ruling parties select candidates for the next general election? [Ichikawa] Leading Diet members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and other ruling parties all think that "the ruling parties will not be able to win in the election unless they cooperate" and that "it is better to begin as soon as possible the work to select candidates." Once the budget bill is passed, down-to-earth arguments of this kind will crop up all at once and arguments over whether Japan should take a bipolar or tripolar political system in the future will fade away. A block of frozen ice melts quickly once it begins to melt. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also an opinion that because the ruling parties find it difficult to unite themselves, they should only cooperate in the election. [Ichikawa] Under the new electoral system, it is impossible for the ruling parties to win in the election unless they campaign as a single party. When the work to select candidates actually begins, those who say "I should be separated [from the other group that supports a bipolar system] in the selection because I advocate a tripolar system" will be excluded from the selection. Sakigake [Harbinger] has power only because the party, in cooperation with the JNP, can hold the post of chief cabinet secretary. If Sakigake stands by itself, it will become just like the now-defunct Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Unless the party is free from emotion and ideals, it will take a wrong course. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Some people are critical of the alliance between you and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, saying you two act high-handedly. [Ichikawa] After its inauguration, the ruling coalition was urged to make decisions on important issues, such as the partial liberalization of the rice market and political reform. Who made the decisions? While others were arguing, Mr. Ozawa and I made the decisions and took the blame for it. It is the people who evaluate what we have done. As a politician, I do not regret what I have done. Mr. Ozawa and I have different political ideas and styles. Mass media's reports on our alliance are based on their imagination.
