Before Spring Festival, the cadres at various levels should go to the grass roots -- particularly the enterprises and households experiencing difficulties -- hold heart-to-heart talks with the people, render service and express warmth to the people, support the poor, do solid deeds for the people, and help the people have a good festival. From 4 to 7 January, accompanied by Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee; Shao Qihui, governor of the provincial government; and Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee, Li Ruihuan visited some state-owned large enterprises, institutions of higher learning, and scientific research institutes in the province to conduct investigations and to solicit their opinions. He heard the work report of the provincial party committee and fully affirmed the provincial party committee and government's achievements in guiding the broad masses of cadres and people to implement conscientiously the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, to tide over difficulties, to promote economic development, and to safeguard social stability. In regard to the current work, Li Ruihuan said: We should notice that the national current situation in various aspects is good. All localities are full of enthusiasm for engaging in construction and making developments. A faster economic growth rate has been maintained. The people's livelihood has noticeably improved. Simultaneously, we should clearly notice that some people still fail to improve rapidly their living conditions due to various reasons and some people are even confronted with some difficulties. We should always remember these people. We hope that the speed of construction will be faster and the scope of construction will be wider. In the final analysis, we do this in order to improve the people's livelihood. Therefore, in the course of construction, we should consider the interests of the people and particularly ensure that serious difficulties to the people's basic life do not result. Li Ruihuan said: It is certain that reform will bring about benefits to the majority of the people. The reform measures relating to the readjustment of the interests of the people should thoroughly and cautiously be studied before implementation, strictly adhere with the changes of the situation after implementation, and be timely readjusted or supplemented if necessary. We should be concerned about the feelings of the people, conscientiously hear people's opinions, and strive to help the masses overcome difficulties. This is not only what the basic purpose of our communist party requires, but also a demand for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening up. Li Ruihuan said: Spring Festival is also a juncture of the two years. We have the responsibility to help the people who have difficulties experience a good festival. The cadres at various levels should be aware of the people with difficulties, call on them, actively solicit their criticism and suggestions, urge them express their difficulties -- even words they are not pleased to hear, provide timely help, and try with every possible means to help them solve some practical problems. We should reduce other expenses and allocate necessary funds to ensure their needs in this aspect. Li Ruihuan also met with the comrades of the provincial and Harbin city CPPCC committees and exchanged views on strengthening the establishment of democratic politics and the self-construction of the CPPCC.
