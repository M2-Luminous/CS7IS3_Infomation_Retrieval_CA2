FR940208-2-00112 FR940208-2-00075 8. The Funds will offer exchange privileges to shareholders in each of their classes as described in the application and in each Fund's prospectus. All exchanges will comply with section 11(a) of the Act or rule 11a&hyph;3 thereunder. 9. The Funds may offer classes of shares to one or more of the following five limited categories of investors (``Institutional Investors''): (a) Unaffiliated benefit plans such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual retirement accounts (``IRA''s) and self-employed retirement plans, with total assets in excess of $10 million or such other amounts as the Funds may establish and with such other characteristics as the Funds may establish; (b) tax-exempt retirement plans of the Adviser and its affiliates, including the retirement plans of the Adviser's affiliated brokers; (c) banks and insurance companies purchasing for their own accounts; (d) investment companies not affiliated with the Adviser; and (e) endowment funds of non-profit organizations. These shares (``Institutional Shares'') may be offered under a variation of the Front-End Load Option, the Deferred Option or a no-load option, and may be subject to shareholder services fees under a Shareholder Services Plan. 10. In addition, the Funds may offer classes of shares to institutions not included in the categories of Institutional Investors, such as corporations, foundations, and financial institutions, designed to meet the needs of such institutions (``Financial Shares''). Class A, Class B, and Class C shares and any future classes of shares which are not Institutional Shares or Financial Shares are referred to collectively as ``Non-Institutional Shares.'' 11. The unaffiliated benefit plans in category (a) of paragraph 9 above will have several common features. Such plans will have total assets in excess of $10 million or such other amounts as applicants may establish, a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets, certain limitations on the ability of plan beneficiaries to access their plan investments without incurring adverse tax consequences, and such other characteristics as the Funds may establish. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category. 12. The tax-exempt retirement plans in category (b) of paragraph 9 above will consist of qualified defined contribution plans maintained, pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), by the Adviser or its affiliates for the benefit of employees. Under such plans, the assets are held in trust by a trustee and employees have limited pre-retirement access to the assets. 13. The entities included in categories (c), (d), and (e) of paragraph 9 above will not be affiliated with the Adviser. These offerees will have in common the essential features of substantial assets under management and investment decisionmaking by institutional management on behalf of the entity with respect to the purchase of Institutional Shares of a Fund. Banks and insurance companies typically employ professional staff to manage the investment of cash assets, and portfolio managers make investment decisions on behalf of investment companies. Likewise, an endowment fund of a non-profit organization is professionally managed and individual donors to such endowment funds exercise no investment discretion on behalf of the endowment fund, nor would such an individual donor consider a direct investment in shares of a Fund as an investment alternative in lieu of a donation. Thus, no possibility exists that an individual investor would be able to use these entities as a conduit for individual investing in the Institutional Shares. 14. Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to invest in Institutional Shares. All other investors will be eligible to invest solely in Non-Institutional Shares and/or Financial Shares. There will be no overlap between the investors eligible to invest in Institutional Shares and investors eligible to invest in Non-Institutional Shares and Financial Shares of any Fund.
