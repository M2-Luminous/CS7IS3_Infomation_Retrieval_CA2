Please note: The Commission has requested emergency review of this item by June 3, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18. OMB Number: None. Title: FCC Rate Regulation Impact Survey. Action: New collection. Respondents: Business or other for-profit. Frequency of Response: Other: One-time survey. Estimated Annual Burden: 100 respondents, 25 responses each, 2500 total responses; 1 hour average burden per response; 2500 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``Cable-Act'') required the Commission to establish rules to govern rate regulation of cable services offered by cable systems that are not subject to effective competition. On 2/22/94, the Commission adopted revised cable rate regulations in a Second Order on reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation, wherein we revised rules to implement section 623, subscriber rate regulation. The new rules became effective on May 15, 1994, and, pursuant to §§76.932 and 76.964 of the rules, cable systems must give subscribers 30 days notice of any proposed rate change or restructuring made by the cable system. In connection with these orders, the Commission will conduct a survey on the impact of these new rate regulations. The purpose of this survey is to determine the effect of our regulations on the rates for regulated cable services since the 5/15/94 effective date. This survey will be addressed to the largest 100 multiple system operators. Surveying the largest multiple system operators will permit a review of rate practices under our revised regulations of cable operators providing a majority of cable service in the United States. The consequences of not conducting this survey will impair our ability to assess whether our rate regulations have been effective. Respondents will be requested to submit copies of documentation which verifies subscriber notification, via facsimile, and respond to both written and telephone inquiries by FCC staff. Any responses may be made by telephone or in written format via facsimile, upon request by Bureau staff. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
