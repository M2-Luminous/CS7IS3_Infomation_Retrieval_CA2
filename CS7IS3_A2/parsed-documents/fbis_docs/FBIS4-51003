The 800-ton boat was reportedly sunk off the coast of San Julian after being hit by machine-gun and cannon fire. The Argentine Navy had been trying to get the Chin Yuan Hsing to stop so that it could be inspected after it was caught illegally poaching within Argentine waters. The 30-odd crewmembers were rescued by another Taiwan fishing vessel, the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was also operating off the coast of San Julian when the incident occurred. The full story behind the attack is still under investigation, the association said, adding that the current situation of the crewmembers was unclear because of communication difficulties resulting from poor weather conditions in the Southwest Atlantic. Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture and Taiwan Fishery Representatives called on local fishing boats to respect relevant laws and regulatons set by foreign governments when fishing in foreign waters to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
