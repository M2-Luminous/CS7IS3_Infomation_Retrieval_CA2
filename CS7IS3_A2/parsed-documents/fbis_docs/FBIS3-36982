Vladimir Petrovich, certain differences have emerged between Russia and its Western partners. What do you think, is this a result of the Zhirinovskiy factor? Or is it a question of deeper, fundamental changes in our foreign policy? [Lukin] Well, in the first place I would not dramatize, or globalize the Zhirinovskiy factor. What is the Zhirinovskiy factor? Sometimes a politician here only has to start squealing like a piglet or screaming like a woman in labor, and some factors or other start appearing. We are talking about one of the factions, not a majority faction. The statement adopted by the State Duma on Yugoslavia was not a statement proposed by the Liberal Democrats. So we are talking about the mood of the Russian people, and as an expression of this mood, the mood in the Duma itself, not in one faction, but in many, practically the overwhelming majority of factions. This is the mood of our public, which consists of this, that what is needed is international efforts to eliminate this crisis, and in this we differ radically from the Liberal Democrats, they are needed not by way of using violence -- violence will entail further violence, not stop violence. [passage omitted] [Lukin] I was speaking to the well-known U.S. politician and diplomat James Collins yesterday, at his request, and he admitted that the process is under way, that both the Serbs and Muslims are surrendering their artillery, that is, the process of disarmament is really under way. [Kalyagin] So you think force will not be used by NATO? [Lukin] I cannot think that, because there could be two alternatives here. The alternative of genuine interest on the part of NATO and the Western countries in Sarajevo not being shelled -- this is a legitimate interest -- and the alternative of looking for any pretext, which is unfortunately being whipped up by some of the Muslim leaders, to intervene at any price and foist their own understanding and their own solution to this matter. Just look at what happened with the so-called mortar bomb at the Sarajevo market. This is really very similar to the Reichstag fire, it was as though it was done to order immediately prior to the foreign ministers' conference, the day before. [Kalyagin] And if the bombing still goes ahead? What could that lead to? What do you think? [Lukin] If that happens, it could lead to very bad consequences in terms of Russia's relations, our trust in the countries of the West. You see, there are two kinds of relations -- relations between partners, and relations with a boss. When a decision is made first, and then the other side is informed of the decision that has already been made, that is relations with a boss. Relations between partners mean that first of all there is very careful and serious discussion of the issues, and then a joint, considered decision is made. That is what I am in favor of.
