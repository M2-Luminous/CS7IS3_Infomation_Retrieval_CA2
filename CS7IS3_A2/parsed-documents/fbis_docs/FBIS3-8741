According to the paper, the Slovak Information Service (SIS) did not offer jobs to former members of the Federal Security and Information Service [FIS] who had undergone training in Western intelligence services but, quite the contrary, has employed several former State Security Corps [communist-era secret service] members. Because of the operation of a permanent Russian intelligence adviser with the SIS, the Slovak secret service disqualifies itself from close cooperation with the secret services of Western countries and reduces this cooperation to the mere exchange of essential information. The new Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, which is a direct successor to the First KGB Administration, is identical to its predecessor in terms of staff, the paper writes, adding that "SIS members will be dealing with essentially the same people as under Brezhnev." In this context, the daily draws attention to the fact that the seizure of power by the communists and the enforcement of Moscow's will in the former socialist countries after World War II had also been anticipated by agents and advisers of the former NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, predecessor of the KGB] occupying the ministries of interior and the secret services. According to Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and his Slovak interlocutors, cooperation between the two services will be geared mainly toward the struggle against terrorist and drug mafias. The daily points out, however, that the Law on the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service does not provide for such activity. "Rather, this is a matter for counterintelligence," PRACA adds.
