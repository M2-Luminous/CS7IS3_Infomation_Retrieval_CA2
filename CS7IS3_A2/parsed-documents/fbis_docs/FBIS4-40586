Andrey Kozyrev informed State Duma deputies of this on Friday. Asked at what level and with what effectiveness the situation concerning the Korean Peninsula is being discussed with Beijing, the Russian foreign minister said in particular, that there is a regular exchange of views. Over the past two years alone the head of Russia's foreign policy department "has had five or six meetings with the PRC foreign minister, and on each occasion this problem was discussed." "Like Russia," A. Kozyrev said, "China is also definitely against the DPRK breaking with the nuclear nonproliferation regime and in favor of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In other words, it favors neither one of the Korean states possessing or taking steps to possess nuclear weapons." According to the minister "this is the fundamental basis of the coincidence and fundamental closeness of the approaches of Russia and the PRC." Of course, he went on to say, there are nuances of detail and tactics, but in the main the positions of the two countries coincide.
