FR940922-1-00032 FR940922-1-00008 The options for developing an alternative program are somewhat limited. As explained above, section 202 bars EPA modification of the Tier I standards prior to model year 2004, and the states cannot, under section 177 and 209, adopt standards other than the California standards. Thus, the only alternative method for requiring vehicle manufacturers to achieve reductions in tailpipe emissions from new light-duty cars and trucks is a program in which manufacturers voluntarily agree to be bound by more stringent standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed in greater detail in section V of this notice, below. It is this first kind of alternative that underlies the basis for EPA providing in its SIP call for the possibility that an alternative program may be developed that would achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles that are comparable to or greater than those from OTC LEV. If such a program were developed, it would not be necessary to apply the OTC LEV program to vehicles subject to the alternative standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed in greater detail in section V of this notice, below. Second, the availability of alternative measures that are sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions without further reductions from new motor vehicles or trucks could likewise render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. The question here is not whether EPA will mandate such other measures in response to the OTC's recommendation. The OTC did not recommend such other measures and; for the reasons described in section III.B., EPA is not ready to consider mandating them under sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D) at this time. Rather, the question is whether such other measures are available so that it is unnecessary for EPA to require the OTC LEV program. As EPA explained in its April 26 proposal: To the extent more reductions will be needed even with the LEV program [to mitigate significant contribution to nonattainment in the OTR], other measures that address that shortfall would not, for that reason alone, qualify as ``alternatives'' to LEV. Rather, other measures might qualify as ``alternatives'' only if such other measures, singly or in combination, generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV. 59 FR at 21734. EPA has established a precedent for interpreting the ``necessary'' standard that is consistent with this approach. EPA's interpretation is guided by its approach to interpreting that term (ultimately codified by Congress), under section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, as explained in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21734. That interpretation is important to evaluating the availability of alternatives sufficient to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Under section 211(c)(4)(C), controls are necessary if they would still be needed after adoption of all other reasonable and practicable measures. That is, EPA would consider alternatives available if they are comparatively reasonable and practicable. And the reasonable and practicable alternatives must be sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions in order to conclude that the proffered control is unnecessary. 17 17 EPA also suggested in its April 26 proposal a different possible approach to the ``necessary'' standard. Under that approach, EPA might consider as necessary any additional control measures that contribute to attainment, as long as measures specifically required by the Act or that are otherwise in place are insufficient to achieve attainment. That is, as long as the States in the OTR still need more reductions to address the transport problem, then EPA would consider the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program necessary. Assessment of alternative control measures would not be relevant. See 59 FR at 21725. While EPA is not proposing here to adopt that approach, EPA notes that the facts showing that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under the approach discussed in the text would, a fortiori, be sufficient to show that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under this different approach. Of course, whether potential alternative measures are ``reasonable and practicable'' as well as sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions may not be self-evident. In its April 26 proposal, EPA described approaches to factual uncertainty and other policy considerations that could influence these determinations. See 59 FR at 21726&hyph;27. As with its decisions under section 211(c)(4)(C), here EPA does not consider drastic measures such as gas rationing, or plant shutdowns to constitute reasonable alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Congress could not have intended that EPA should consider such drastic alternatives, since such alternatives would clearly be adequate to achieve any necessary reductions, and hence no proffered measure would ever be necessary. This would essentially read section 184 out of the Act. Further, EPA believes cost-effectiveness of potential alternatives is a criterion in evaluating reasonableness and comparing other measures to the measure proffered as necessary. But the comparison of the reasonableness and practicability of various measures, including what is ``too drastic,'' is a complicated policy determination requiring consideration of cost and public acceptance, and need not be supported by a highly specific technical record. See 59 FR at 21726. While EPA believes that it is important to assess the sufficiency of reasonable and practicable alternatives, states have the continuing opportunity to come forward to adopt sufficient alternatives and prove that the OTC LEV program indeed turns out to be unnecessary. EPA does not believe states would seriously entertain unreasonable or impracticable measures to adopt in place of OTC LEV in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Nonetheless, EPA recognizes that states which do in fact adopt such other measures sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) might thereby render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. EPA therefore is proposing that it would retain authority under the SIP call to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt controls sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), including those controls EPA might now believe to be unreasonable or impracticable. As states in the northeast have not yet adopted sufficient measures proving that the LEV program (or LEV-equivalent) is unnecessary, EPA believes that it should evaluate whether sufficient reasonable and practicable alternatives exist based on the best current information and policy judgment. EPA also discussed in its April 26 proposal various approaches to factual uncertainty regarding issues such as cost and the amount of reductions needed for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). There, EPA raised the question of whether the statutory structure, together with the legislative history, support giving substantial weight or ``deference'' to the OTC's recommendation that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR. EPA suggested that it could reasonably interpret the provisions to mean that EPA is to start with a presumption of approving the OTC's recommendations and approve the recommendation unless EPA found that the recommended measures were unnecessary. EPA pointed to floor statements in the conference debate in the Senate regarding section 184 that EPA bears a ``heavy burden'' to ``demonstrat[e] that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary.'' See 59 FR at 21726 (quoting Baucus-Chafee Statement of Managers and Senator Lieberman). EPA's public hearings and round-table discussions reflected some confusion about the meaning of ``deference'' to the OTC. EPA questions whether there is any basis under any provision of the Clean Air Act to relieve the Agency of an obligation to consider independently all of the factual information available in determining whether the OTC LEV program is necessary. In this case, EPA believes the facts affirmatively show that this measure is indeed necessary. In addition, EPA believes that its general policy of prudence in making decisions regarding highly complex scientific issues affecting public health should apply to its analysis here. EPA believes this policy is reasonable and permissible in addressing what is ``necessary'' to achieve and maintain the health-based ambient air quality standard for ozone. 18 18 Courts have recognized that scientific evidence is cumulative, and that EPA has discretion to take an environmentally protective approach to protecting public health and welfare. In Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 941 (1976), the court of appeals considered EPA's action to regulate the lead content of gasoline on grounds that emissions ``will endanger'' the public health or welfare under prior section 211(c)(1)(A). There, the court recognized that EPA's decision may be based on ``the inconclusive but suggestive results of numerous studies.'' Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 38. Further, the court found that the Administrator appropriately acted ``conservatively'' based on ``suggestive'' evidence to make a ``prudent'' determination. Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 39. EPA believes such prudence is likewise appropriate here, where the public health and welfare is at stake.
