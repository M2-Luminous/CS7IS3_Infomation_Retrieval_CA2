The dissolved branches have more than 1,000 PBS members who have accused him of failing to develop the constituency. The dissolution of the branches was confirmed by (Bonong Mulung), a PBS official in Bengkoka. Members of the dissolved branches were disappointed with PBS leaders who had refused to listen to their views. Meanwhile, (Tayu Memayu), a PBS member of parliament who decided to quit the party said his main reason for quitting was that the PBS would not be able to lead the state and promote a multiracial society in Sabah. He said PBS leaders have always given priority to one ethnic group only, adding that this would worsen the state's racist policy. People now believe that if PBS is returned to power, the hope for an economic recovery in Sabah will be dashed.
