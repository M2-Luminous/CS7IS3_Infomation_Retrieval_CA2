Tokyo Electric Power Co. honorary chairman Hiraiwa's office desk is cluttered with huge stacks of books that appear about to topple down. Ranging from Shonen Jumpu (a book for boys) to books on pure literature, philosophy, and economics, his scope of reading may be considered "eclectic." He is a rare well-read person. He is usually extremely courteous. For example, he responds to a question with a query: "I believe thus and thus... but what do you think?" He is apparently uneasy about confrontations. However, his true sentiments are quite strong. He is able to name the successive professional boxing champions of each class in Japan wihout hesitation. He is a great fan of such hand-to-hand combat sports as sumo, boxing, and Western wrestling. He regularly played the shortstop position on the baseball team at the former Nagoya High School. His front teeth were knocked out by a fierce grounder that rebounded with a hop, and he continued to play in the game despite a mouthful of blood. Such brave exploits are not very well known. Despite his small stature, he participated in swimming, horsemanship, kendo [fencing], baseball, and tennis. "Golf is like walking, so I do not consider it a sport." A typical example of a person who is gentle in appearance but sturdy in spirit, Hiraiwa displays rare determination and "self-assertiveness." Recently, at the Keidanren meeting of the chairman and the vice chairmen on 2 September [1993], he advocated the "abolition of mediation by the Keidanren regarding political contributions." Among the dozen vice chairmen, three strongly opposed Hiraiwa's proposal to abolish mediation. The usual Hiraiwa would give in, to no one's surprise, but he did not retreat a step concerning the abolition of mediation in political contributions and he pushed forward toward a "decision." Regarding the political, financial, bureaucratic cozy alliance structure, the source is of course the political contributions by the financial circles and companies. In other words, the politicians of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] are weak-kneed in front of the financial circles from whom they receive contributions. The financial circles are weak-kneed before the bureaucrats from whom they receive permits and licenses. The bureaucrats are weak-kneed before the politicians in connection with personnel authority and budgets. This "three-way struggle" is considered to constitute Japan's power structure and is called the 1955 system. In fact, more than 20 years have passed since this political, financial, and bureaucratic triangle began to be distorted from an equilateral triangle. First, the power of the financial circles began to weaken. Then the LDP began to squeak and became fractured. Next, with deregulation and the difficulty of obtaining appointments to the private sector for retired government officials, an era of ordeal will soon come for upper-bracket bureaucrats. The political, financial, bureaucratic equilateral triangle structure rarely seen in the world has definitely wrought a miraculous economic prosperity. The true identity of "Japan Inc." could be said to be the political, financial, bureaucratic joint corporation. The change in the industrial structure is a major factor for the decline in this section of financial power. What would happen if the growth of such industries and enterprises as autos and distribution that deal with the masses surpasses the growth of such industries and enterprises as electric power and steel on which permits and licensing and administrative guidance have considerable impact? The interests within the so-called total capital clash. The monolithic financial era has long since passed. In other words, the long-term decline of the financial circles began more than 20 years before. It can be rephrased as the power decline of Keidanren, which is the central organization of the financial world. Comparing the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] with Keidanren is based on the fact that both are in a long-term decline. There was once an era when the Keidanren chairman was called Japan's "shadow prime minister." However, one could never call Gaishi Hiraiwa--the seventh chairman--a "shadow prime minister," even in flattery. The Keidanren method of allocating political contributions to the various enterprises and distributing them to the LDP and DSP [Democratic Socialist Party] en bloc is considered to be extremely clean. However, Hiraiwa says that the national sentiment will not tolerate even that. He means that political contributions in the future should be left up to the companies to do as they wish. To whom is Chairman Hiraiwa's "unusual firmness" directed?
