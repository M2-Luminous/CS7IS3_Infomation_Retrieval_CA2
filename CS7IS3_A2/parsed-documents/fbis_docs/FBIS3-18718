Is your word still true today? [Kanther] The issue has not been artificially put up, but it is simply there. Internal security is a political issue that the citizens are interested in, which is why the differing approaches to it are, of course, also the subject of an election campaign. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The Social Democratic party of Germany [SPD] has presented an election campaign motto, and it is: Security Instead of Fear. Do you like that motto? [Kanther] It is an empty phrase. The citizens are concerned. I do not want them to have fears. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What motto can you come up with? [Kanther] The longer I am in the business of politics the less I am interested in coining such slogans. They give the people stones instead of bread and simplify difficult problems. Permanent concern about internal security, adapting state measures to the situation of threat; creativity in observing the permanently changing situations of threat -- with such statements I can outline the basis of my conviction better than with a hackneyed phrase. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This does not sound very bold compared to the reputation you have. When you took office you were described as the "Black Sheriff." Have you started to change your image? [Kanther] Interior Minister Kanther does not have image problems at all, but was never interested in taking any image people gave him particularly seriously or even change it. I do not care much about such labels. I think that, in politics, one can make oneself best understood through success and not through announcements. What is important to me is progress in the issues I have to deal with. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So let us come to those issues. Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein has accused you of being to lenient in the negotiations with you coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- for example as far as the issue of bugging private homes of suspected criminals is concerned. [Kanther] The anticrime law includes two dozen important points on which this coalition agreed. Since we have treated our coalition partner as a partner, we have also achieved the State's evidence regulation for organized crime. This was not all that easy. What is the point of overthrowing an entire law because of individual controversial issues such as the bugging of apartments? If the Federal Government wins the election, an new coalition agreement can be concluded -- then the bugging of apartments will get a new chance. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Members of your Bundestag group have criticized that, for the first time, an interior minister is concentrating too much on issues of substance and does not engage enough in the election campaign. [Kanther] I regard that as a compliment, because the election campaign can be understood as empty words. For me, the election campaign is something completely different, something permanent. Moreover, consumer behavior toward politics and politicians is changing. If, as a politician, one fails to be aware of it, then one will quickly find oneself standing with one's empty words in an empty room or in front of 13 believers. I think that the public develops an understanding for whether politicians work seriously on an issue and advance it step by step -- if necessary, step by step. I would also prefer the bugging issue to have been contained in the anticrime law that we agreed with the FDP. Yet, had I culminated the controversy, the coalition climate would have been damaged and the other two dozens points of the anticrime law could not have been adopted either. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The assignment Helmut Kohl gave you when he called you into his Cabinet was: "Strengthen my right wing." It has been said that this wing feels it is not getting enough from you.... [Kanther] There is not the slightest reason for that within the party. First, everybody was murmuring that the Black Sheriff would get the republic under control, starting at the right margin -- and six months later this person is simply too conciliatory. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So far, your time in office has been dominated by the Bad Kleinen disaster. The operation was a Waterloo for the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], which is why, immediately after you took office, you issued the slogan that a new spirit must move into the BKA.... Has it moved in yet? [Kanther] A new spirit can only partly be decreed, and it is not enough that it moves in. One has to assay the origins of the mistakes and then undo the mistakes. Coming to terms with the circumstances of Bad Kleinen is a tiresome procedure that only works on the basis of close cooperation with all parties involved. One cannot decree something by pressing a button, but one has to convince the people of the right course. This is leading to new insights as far as the [special antiterrorist task force] GSG-9 is concerned and to new leadership structures in the BKA. There is considerable need to understand things, to reflect on the necessity to change the work. The idea, particularly at the level of the BKA, that one was immune to any mistakes, has been quite rightly shattered. In the wake of Bad Kleinen, essential basic mistakes were made. It was certainly not a leadership question. There was too much routine, in the sense that "we can do all that single-handedly." There were, of course, also mistakes at the leadership level, particularly deficiencies regarding the BKA's behavior regarding communication; internally, and toward the public. Information was concealed, from man to man, that should have been exchanged. Information was passed on wrongly. My predecessor did not sit at one desk with those who had the information and he never got it. Besides, in such a situation, public relations are not of secondary importance that should merely be left to the press office, but the police must focus on making the results of public-relations work clear to everybody. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What was the reason for the news blackout imposed by the BKA? [Kanther] Explanations are not easy. It cannot be compared to stress on the site of the action. The man who leaves his position during the operation because he receives a garbled radio message or comes to a wrong assessment of the situation at the moment the shooting starts is faced with different demands than the person who sits 500 km further back and is guarding the information. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is the BKA currently fully or only partly operational? [Kanther] I consider the BKA to be fully operational. In principle, the BKA's authority has not been challenged by the Bad Kleinen affair. Basic mistakes can happen everywhere, also at the level of the Land Offices of Criminal Investigations. The connection between the Ministry and the BKA has been filled with new people in important positions. One thing is still pending -- the formulation of a new leadership structure of the BKA, which should rather become something like a board, and must facilitate cooperativeness to a greater degree, instead of a pyramid-like hierarchical leadership. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This means a cold-blooded stripping of power of current President Zachert, who cannot be transferred under the civil service regulations.... [Kanther] No. The president has a large number of international, representative external responsibilities based on the federal structure of the FRG. The internal effect of the leadership can be intensified by strengthening the cooperative features. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Something like a directorate at the top of the BKA? [Kanther] Not in a formal sense. Let me put it this way: The Ministry will have greater influence on, and participate more intensively in, a leadership that is more strongly characterized by cooperativeness. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Your ministry's influence should increase. [Kanther] Correct. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the moment, the president is not a political public servant. What you said sounds as if you wanted to change that. [Kanther] No. This is not what we have in mind. I am absolutely unemotional in this connection. There are various ways of improving the situation. The basic mistakes of Bad Kleinen have nothing to do with the legal status of the president. I do not see any need for change in this connection. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You will soon present the final report on Bad Kleinen. Will there remain any doubts that Grams really shot himself? [Kanther] I have never had the slightest doubt that the police could not have "executed" Grams -- as conveyed by some media, which is what created the special dimension of the case. If this had ever become a real question, then DER SPIEGEL could have given the name of its witness. Still, the dilemma was that the public's confidence in the police was so shattered by the daily changing and obviously wrong information that such a grotesque claim could no longer be countered with authority. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] An office that has been shattered, an office whose organization is in a process of change, such an organization should receive even further tasks from you on the basis of the new BKA law: You are intending to give the BKA the authority to carry out so-called preliminary investigations, that is to say to let the BKA investigate when there is only a first suspicion. [Kanther] The so-called preliminary investigations -- the authority to investigate even before a concrete suspicion -- will not be included in the draft law. This issue contains an element of irritation -- not so much toward the FDP but toward the laender. By carrying federal thinking to extremes, the laender -- all of them -- regard preliminary investigations carried out by the BKA as an infringement of their authority regarding criminal persecution. I do not exactly regard that as a modern approach. Nevertheless, It would be insensible to face the Bundesrat deliberately with a set of laws it cannot accept and then, finally, to eliminate a passage at the end that was known to be unacceptable to the Bundesrat from the very beginning. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In your speeches you often talk of the authority of the state. Is this authority not being questioned by the constant propagation of new and stricter laws and by making people believe that such laws (for example the law on bugging private homes) would improve things enormously? [Kanther] Of course, the problems of the world would not be solved for good afterwards, either. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your party also contributed to the exaggerated hopes that have been pinned on the bugging of homes private homes. [Kanther] The debate has started to spiral. This cannot be denied. It was like this with the asylum issue, too -- with the result that the law, ultimately, included 75 percent of what the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] wanted. Now we no longer have 30,000 but 10,000 refugees [arriving in Germany each month]. That is, at least, something. This result confirms that our policy is right. We could have not achieved that without the public debate -- which, of course, led to some hot controversy and friction. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] There was fire and it keeps flaring up. Do you have nothing to do with the generation of the heat? [Kanther] Those who ask such questions owe me the answer to how democratic politics should be made in general -- together with the people, I hope! I am not generating heat. I am trying to keep debates under control with the adequate measures. In the asylum debate, I strongly represented the CDU's position for many years, which brought me sharp attacks in the Hesse Landtag for many years. I have put in my files all letters that were imbued with references to morals without ever doubting that the policy was correct. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The way in which you conducted the asylum debate is, thus, unrelated to the murderous attacks against foreigners? [Kanther] No. Only there was no other way to conduct the debate -- because the SPD had assumed an unacceptable position and could not have been moved otherwise. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So the murderous attacks have been the consequence of the SPD's unyieldingness? [Kanther] I have been in this business too long to give you such a headline -- particularly after such an important constitutional compromise. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not regret anything? [Kanther] I have never conducted a debate against foreigners -- but one on the inability of the SPD-Greens-ruled Hesse land Government to accommodate asylum-seekers and to deport those who had their applications for asylum turned down. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Emotionalizing.... [Kanther] ...is one possible political instrument. Yet one has to use it very, very cautiously, otherwise one will share the experience of the sorcerer's apprentice. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And do you really think that you acted very cautiously? [Kanther] I am sure. I am always making a point in controlling what I say in public, because it cannot be easily revoked. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Whenever you speak of the dwindling authority of the state, the term degeneration of values will inevitably follow. You like to blame the movement of 68 for this alleged degeneration of values. Yet, 1968 was a long time ago and you had nothing to do with it. So it is easy to put all the blame on it.... [Kanther] But I am not doing so.... [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are talking of 68 when you refer to the decline of values, while I attribute it to private television. A professor worked out that a 12-year-old child has seen an average 12,000 murders on television.... [Kanther] 18,000. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In Hesse, you fought for private television for 10 years, and now we are shocked about its extreme developments. You are -- in legal terms -- under a guarantee obligation, an obligation for doubtful past actions.... [Kanther] Responsibility cannot be denied. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In what way are you doing justice to it? [Kanther] I have to change the picture that you have drawn. The fact that a carpenter sometimes cuts himself is no evidence against the necessity of the saw. Authorizing private radio and television stations was a necessary step. Germany cannot be an island. Yet, first of all it is the journalists who are responsible for the program. Journalists have to be held accountable for any representation of violence on public or private television. Second, the business community that runs commercials on television has to take action. It is insufficiently assuming responsibility. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no more commercials during violent programs? [Kanther] If possible, such programs should not be broadcast at all. It is first and foremost those who put a program on television who have to reflect on the problem. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no activities by the legislative power? [Kanther] I do not see any need to take action, as far as I am concerned at the moment. I want the phenomenon to be solved by the television people. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us stick to the issue of television. The chairman of the Central Council of Jews has just endorsed a general ban on election spots for all parties. Are you finding it hard to do without a few colorful pictures in commercials for the CDU? [Kanther] I think this debate is bizarre. Why should we do without television spots? [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Because you have enough other possibilities to promote your party and because the profit the radicals are making from such commercials is dangerous. [Kanther] What makes you think that? The clips that I have seen so far in this connection are all absolutely stupid and will hardly cause any damage with people who are in their right mind; moreover, there are limits under the Penal Code. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So you think there is no audience for such films? [Kanther] Only a very limited one. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not fear that certain extreme groups might only become popular with the help of election commercials on television? [Kanther] No, this has to be ruled out; that is absolutely overestimating this medium. The political parties of the center must not knuckle under.
