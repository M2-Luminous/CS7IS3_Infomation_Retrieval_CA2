FR940930-1-00025 FR940930-1-00009 In addition, corrections are made to the names of three compounds which have previously been exempted from the definition of VOC; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC&hyph;113) is changed to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC&hyph;113); chlorodifluoromethane (CFC&hyph;22) is changed to chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC&hyph;22); and trifluoromethane (FC&hyph;23) is changed to trifluoromethane (HFC&hyph;23). These changes are corrections to nomenclature only and are not substantive. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it relaxes current regulatory requirements rather than imposing new ones. The EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is, therefore, not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. This action does not contain any information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Assuming this rulemaking is subject to section 317 of the Act, the Administrator concludes, weighing the Agency's limited resources and other duties, that it is not practicable to conduct an extensive economic impact assessment of today's action since this rule will relax current regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Administrator simply notes that any costs of complying with today's action, any inflationary or recessionary effects of the regulation, and any impact on the competitive standing of small businesses, on consumer costs, or on energy use, will be less than or at least not more than the impact that existed before today's action.

Dated: September 23, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. For reasons set forth in the preamble, part 51 of Chapter I of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 51_REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS 1.
