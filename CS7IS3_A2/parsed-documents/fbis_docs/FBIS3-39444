The CBI added that the recovery in manufacturing industry had spread to all mainland regions of the UK. The CBI's upbeat analysis of the economy was tempered by a warning from Mr Davies that the economy might not grow as rapidly as it had been as a result of the tax rises that are due to come into force in April. The CBI leader said that a study of past large tax rises did not suggest that a slowing down in consumer spending was inevitable, if the savings ratio fell. Giving the biennial Bridge Lecture in the City, Mr Davies said the Government would be advised to reduce interest rates "a little further" this year, especially if the exchange rate strengthened or there was some adverse effect on confidence from the tax rises. Mr Davies's remarks came after the CBI's latest regional breakdown of its authoritative industrial trends survey indicated that the recovery in manufacturers' orders has now spread to all mainland regions of the United Kingdom for the first time since the recession began. Apart from Northern Ireland, the CBI's survey showed that total orders rose in all regions, with the largest increases in Yorkshire, the South East, Scotland and Wales. Business optimism is also up in all regions, while output has risen in eight areas of the UK. Overall demand and output are also expected to rise further in all mainland regions over the next four months. But the survey shows that manufacturing employment is still falling in all regions, except Scotland, although the rate of job losses has eased. Job losses are forecast to be acute in the South East, where the CBI estimates that 16,000 more jobs will be lost alone in manufacturing industry in the first quarter of this year. However, despite the still gloomy job prospects, the survey's findings prompted optimistic views of the economy.
