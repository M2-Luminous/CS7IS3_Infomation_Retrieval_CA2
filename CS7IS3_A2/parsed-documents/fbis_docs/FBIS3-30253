At a press conference in Ljubljana Peterle underscored Slovenia's official stand that the normalisation of the relations with the F.R.Y. was of interest for this former member of the Yugoslav Federation, especially after the increasingly successful contacts between Belgrade and Zagreb. The Slovenian Foreign Ministry has been actively monitoring all recent changes in the Ljubljana-Belgrade relations, said Peterle but did not elaborate. Slovenia's Foreign Ministry is studying what should be done for the setting up of the contacts between Ljubljana and Belgrade, said the minister and added that proposals would be submitted to the Slovenian Government in order to examine them at one of its next sessions. The F.R.Y. recognized Slovenia in late summer of 1992, as part of the preparations for the London Conference on resolving the Yugoslav crisis. At that time, Slovenia did not show any interest in the normalisation of the relations with the F.R.Y.
