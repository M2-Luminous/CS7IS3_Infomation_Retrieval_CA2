He said today that people whose hands and conscience have been party to bloodshed, people who were ready to push Russia into the bloody maelstrom of the civil war have been released without trial. The press secretary of the Russian president believes that the State Duma and in the first place those parties who initiated and supported this blasphemous action are wholly responsible for this act of moral violence. This is the first time in the history of world parliamentarism. He believes that the State Duma is becoming the coparticipant of unlawfulness. Having abused the people's trust, the deputies have for the the first time in history -- the statement he has issued says -- taken the side of evil-doers against the state. The State Duma, which was called upon to be the guardian of law, the initiator of civil accord, and a participant in building a rule-of-law state, has by its own will removed from the framework of justice persons accused of the gravest of state crimes, preferring hasty political demarches to a just court. The document points out that an outrage has been committed against justice, public opinion has been rejected, and the opinion of a president elected by popular vote has been challenged. The haste and urgency with which the State Duma strove to achieve the immediate implementation of its resolution, and in essence the covering up of the evil done to Russia, is evidence not of the Duma's desire to achieve civil peace and accord, but of its effective incitement to political extremism. In the unlawful situation that has come about, the president of Russia reserves the right to act in accordance with the powers granted to him by the Constitution, Kostikov declared.
