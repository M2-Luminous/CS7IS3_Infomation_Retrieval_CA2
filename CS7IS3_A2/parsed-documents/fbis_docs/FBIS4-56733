FBIS4-56733 "drlat089_t_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Venezuela Police on Alert Due to Strike Police on Alert Due to Strike PA0805180894 Paris AFP in Spanish 1642 GMT 8 May 94 PA0805180894 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Caracas, 8 May (AFP) -- Caracas police units have been placed on alert and will be deployed in the streets on Monday to prevent potential disturbances in light of the complete work stoppage by 35,000 transportation drivers in the Venezuelan capital, it was reported this Sunday. The transportation workers' show of force will effect 4 million Caracas residents, and it is possible that drivers in the countryside affiliated with the sole union of small transportation vans and buses (interprovincial vans and buses) will join the strike. The drivers demand a readjustment in fare prices and the immediate payment of government commitments owed them since December under a subsidy agreement for student bus tickets. Meanwhile, Sucre Municipality -- the second largest municipality in the capital -- prohibited public demonstrations and suspended all classes in its jurisdiction. Political analysts recommended canceling classes throughout the capital to avoid disturbances such as those that occurred on Thursday, when a police officer killed student German Sotillo with three gunshots. Deputy Transportation Minister Francisco Urdaneta met with transportation workers the previous evening and promised to pay the subsidy debt in full as of next week. The drivers, however, did not accept the offer and stated that the final hour had arrived. Newspaper sources reported that given the looming difficult situation, an emergency unit was organized in Sucre Municipality by the Caracas Metropolitan Police, the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ-detectives), the Directorate of Intelligence and Preventive Services (Disip), and Civil Defense. Their spokesmen assured that the officers of these police units are on a state of alert and are studying strategies to prevent street disturbances.
