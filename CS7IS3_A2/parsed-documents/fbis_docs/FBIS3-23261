They have been in custody for 15 days pending the interrogations. The defendants in this case face several charges, including membership in a group established in violation of the law and the Constitution that seeks to change the regime by force; criminal agreement to carry out several bombing operations to disturb security and damage the national economy; and possession of explosives, bombs, and weapons without a license. The defendants gave a detailed confession about the role of each one of them in the recent bombings in front of a number of banks in Cairo and al-Jizah. They also admitted that they planned to assassinate some figures and police officers and blow up a number of other banks. The Prosecution Office has decided to seize the money found with the defendants and to bring experts from the criminal laboratory to examine the explosives and ammunition impounded. Officials from the Prosecution Office examined six places where the defendants used to hide and keep their weapons and explosives. Eyewitnesses will later testify before the prosecutors about the crimes of the defendants. Meanwhile, the questioning of the defendants by prosecutors will continue.
