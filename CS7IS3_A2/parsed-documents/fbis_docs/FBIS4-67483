The report said China is generating 2.5 to 24.5 times more carbon compounds and 2.5 to 184 times more sulfur oxides than Japan to produce the same amount of steel, electric power, cement, paper and pulp. The report was compiled by the International Trade and Industry Inspection Institute at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and China's State Statistical Bureau, in cooperation with Keio University in Tokyo. It said Japan and other industrial nations should cooperate with China to help control air pollution. Carbon compounds are known to contribute to global warming and sulfur oxides are believed to cause acid rain. The report said China depends on coal for 80 percent of its primary energy supplies but has no system for recycling energy. To produce the same amount, steel mills in China used 3.0 times more energy than in Japan, power utilities 1.6 times more, cement plants 1.8 times and pulp mills 1.3 times more in the second half of the 1980s, the report said. Few Chinese production facilities have desulfurization equipment and China generates 70 percent of Asia's sulfur oxides and 40 percent of its carbon compounds, it said.
