A spokesman for the North Industrial Co (NORINCO) said, "Our arms exports to the United States have always been made in conformity with US law." "The US side unilaterally decided to ban arms imports from China only. This measure is clearly discriminatory, and we would like to express our extreme displeasure," he said. The spokesman denied information published in the United States that NORINCO was owned by the Chinese military. "These reports are completely without foundation," he said. Clinton announced Thursday the renewal for one year of most- favored-nation status for China, but at the same time slapped an embargo on about 200 million dollars in Chinese arms and ammunition imported annually into the United States. China is the United States' primary foreign supplier of rifles and handguns. Over the last three years, companies such as NORINCO, Polytechnology and Jinganco have sold about two million handguns to the US market, western experts said. According to foreign experts, NORINCO has mainly exported hunting rifles, pistols and ammunition for non-military use to the US market. The Chinese are, in addition, suspected by some US circles of copying famous brands of guns and selling them overseas at prices that undercut the originals, one arms expert said. The defense sector, to which NORINCO belongs, has been forced in recent years to devote most of its activities to producing civilian items such as buses, mopeds and washing machines. About 70 percent of such companies' production is now for civilian purposes.
