The Trust Agency had already written them off. "Incapable of reorganization," was the assessment of the privatization agency of Berlin in May 1991. They made a fundamental error. For a long time, the Samag Maschinenfabrik Sangerhausen GmbH, located on the southeast edge of the Harz Mountains in Saxony-Anhalt, has been making hefty profits. This year, the profit is expected to be five million marks. By the end of next year, the company will employ 1,400 people -- 100 more than before the unification. At this time, it employs 1,150. In 1995, it plans on moving onto the stock market. Rescue came in the form of the South Tyrolean industrial scion Kurt Mayer, 50, who took over the operation two years ago. Using sugar production systems, the professional in barter trade first pepped up the regular Eastern European customers who had broken away. The people from Sangerhausen supplied centrifuges and pulp presses. The customers, Russians and Ukrainians, paid with oil, high-grade steel, and sugar. With part of the proceeds from this barter, the white-bearded, shaggy-haired dynamic individual with the baroque figure expanded environmental engineering "to the second pillar" of the company. Mayer calls it "a gigantic growth market." In the meantime, systems for sewage sludge disposal and sewage and effluent handling make up one third of production. The people from Sangerhausen want to turn a hefty profit. They have more than tripled their revenue from 1991 to about 200 million marks today, primarily with a newly developed recycling system that detoxifies soil, slags and building rubble. A lot of contracts are beckoning. At the end of October, Federal Minister for the Environment Klaus Topfer presented the draft for the soil conservation law. This law would obligate the party responsible to eliminate hazardous waste from the past. The Federal Environmental Office in Berlin estimates that the restoration of about 240,000 locations suspected of containing hazardous waste from the past in Germany will consume up to 390 billion marks. Of these locations, 80,000 are in the New Lands. The Samag engineers are particularly proud of the fact that in their washing method, no residue remains that must be placed in a landfill. The dissolved pollutants which, at the end, adhere to tiny grains of earth and stone, are sealed. In technical language, they are immobilized. This happens, for example, by adding insoluble phosphates into the wash water. The encapsulation is so dead-certain, swear the engineers, that even acid rain could not rinse the poisons out in a thousand years. The immobilized granulate can then be used as building material for example for curb stones and noise abatement walls or it can be mixed with gravel. "With the hundred percent reuse, we are ahead of the competition by a nose," says Mayer joyfully. There is something to this. In the high-pressure soil washing system of Klockner Oecotec GmbH in Duisburg, one of the market leaders in Germany in cleaning contaminated soils, after washing 1000 metric tons of contaminated earth, 100 metric tons still end up in landfills for hazardous waste. "We must reduce this amount," promises the marketing director Winfried Brull. Immobilization such as that practiced by the people from Sangerhausen is one conceivable method. The Samag tinkerers also view themselves as having an advantage over thermal methods of soil cleansing such as that offered by Ruhrkohle Umwelttechnik GmbH (Rut) in Bottrop. This is because incineration only renders organic pollutants harmless but not heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury. Decontamination costs 250 to 800 marks per metric ton, depending upon the degree of contamination. This amount is about the same for Samag and its competitor Oecotec. To protect the procedure against imitators, the people from Sangerhausen operate their mobile recycling system which, depending upon the design, can cost between 25 and 32 million marks, "in principle by ourselves," says Mayer. The 40 to 60 modules are built in at most four weeks on location, assured Rainer Sonnenberger, director of environmental engineering at Samag. The system passed its baptism by fire in Wolfen near Bitterfeld. There, under contract to the Trust Agency, they are cleaning up to 1000 metric tons of building rubble daily from demolished buildings of the Orwo film factory. Hot steam and water, mixed with lyes and surface-active agents, dissolve heavy metals and acids from the heavily contaminated rocks in several washing stages. Finally an attrition mill, a type of vibrating machine, rubs particularly difficult toxic substances from the fine-grained debris left after passing through sieves several times. The toxic water in the closed circuit of the system is extensively cleaned again and again. "The system can be easily modified so that it cleans every contaminated material optimally," enthuses the Samag boss Mayer. The necessary analyses come from their own laboratories. After Christmas, a second recycling system will start operation on the ground of Chemie AG in Bitterfeld. This system is to decontaminate the soils, building rubble and industrial sludge of the former chemical combine. In addition, there are four orders from Italy, one from New York, and two from the New Lands. Precisely there is where the business is particularly difficult, complains Mayer. "East Germans still have a very low opinion of East Germans." Even worse, the old boys' network makes sure somebody in the network gets the lucrative contracts for restoration of hazardous waste from the past. According to Mayer, "We have to fight with a knife between our teeth." The go-getting entrepreneur also had trouble with the chairman of the board of the Wolfen Vermogensverwaltung AG (WVV), Rolf Rattunde, who was placed in that position by the Trust Agency. Mayer wants to create three new operation with 450 jobs on some of the land of the Orwo film factory that he has restored: - a precast concrete form factory in which the immobilized granulate from the recycling systems is to be reused, - a system for solvent recover from the Orwo film production, - a system to obtain biological diesel from the sewage sludge and rape. However, Rattunde has been dragging his feet for five months over the sale of the necessary land, grumbles Mayer. However, such objections cannot turn the steadfast South Tyrolean from his expansion plans. Mayer is not going to make the same error committed by many eastern companies that fired research and development personnel by the dozens. "Only with innovative marketable products will we be able to stand on our own two feet again," he recognized early on. He employed 62 engineers, brought experts from Italy and the Czech Republic. To obtain the best know-how fast, he hired scientists from the universities in Tubingen, Milan, Graz, and Berlin. In the next year, Mayer will put another 20 million marks into research. The investments are bearing fruit. The Samag boss firmly expects acceptance of the bid for renaturation of the Silbersee near Wolfen that was completely contaminated by the sewage and effluent from the nearby Orwo film factory. With a water purification method, Mayer will restore the sewer for 80 million marks and, so he promises, "make the lake odorless." He has spent 2.5 million marks on the development of this water purification method. The people from Sangerhausen have proven that the method works using a demonstration system. They have pumped large quantities of air into the lake through hoses. The oxygen contained in this air activated bacteria that ecologically annihilate the stinking sulfur gases rising from the sludge layer at the bottom of the lake. Actually, the decision regarding restoration of the Silbersee should have been made at the beginning of December. However, the fall of the government of Saxony-Anhalt stopped the project. Temporarily, Mayer believes, who would rather look toward the future. "If we succeed with the Silbersee trial, millions of marks in business beckon us in restoring dead waters."
