The "presidential council" of the breakaway southern state said the truce declaration made minutes earlier by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was "aimed at buying time and to prepare a new offensive." The spokesman said: "Salih, who will never accept a halt in fighting, is looking to prepare a new attack." Northern Yemeni authorities earlier said the truce -- the fifth declared in the two-month-old civil war -- would be supervised initially by the French and U.S. military attaches in Sanaa until a joint Yemeni military commission was reactivated. But the southern spokesman rejected this mechanism, saying: "As far as the military commission proposed by Sanaa to supervise the ceasefire is concerned, we had already rejected it." The south has called instead for international observers to monitor any accord. Earlier Saturday northern troops cut the coast road between Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, seriously threatening fuel supplies to the besieged southern city, an AFP correspondent reported. Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which lies only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic on the road. Sources said that if northern forces keep the road cut to the refinery -- the south's only oil refinery -- Aden's fuel supplies will be seriously jeopardised, because tanker trucks will not be able to reach it. Long queues of cars formed outside the city's petrol stations when Aden residents heard of the northern advance along the road. After an uneasy calm overnight, Katyusha rockets slammed into the northern Aden suburb of Dar Sa'd close to the frontline early Saturday, leaving five civilians dead and 30 wounded, hospital officials said. Six southern soldiers were also killed and 48 wounded in fierce fighting along the frontlines, mainly at Bi'r Ahmad, 15 kilometres (nine miles) northwest of the city. Attacks around Aden continued late Saturday, a southern military spokesman said. But southern forces inflicted "enormous losses in men and equipment" on northern troops, the spokesman said on Aden television. He said 27 tanks and five military vehicles had been destroyed. The latest unsuccessful ceasefire initiative came after a meeting of the National Defence Council, chaired by Salih, the official northern agency SABA' said. The decision was taken "in response to the call (Friday) by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali" for an immediate ceasefire, SABA' said. In all, Sanaa has now declared five ceasefires since June 6. But the first four collapsed within hours, with both sides blaming each other for renewed fighting.

["A southern spokesman accused northern forces of having taken advantage of the announced truce to move troops into position for an assault on the oil refinery, 18 kilometers (12 miles) west of here. ["Fresh frighting erupted at 6.00 a.m. (0300 GMT) along battle fronts 15 to 30 kilometers (nine to 18 miles) from this southern Yemeni stronghold."]
