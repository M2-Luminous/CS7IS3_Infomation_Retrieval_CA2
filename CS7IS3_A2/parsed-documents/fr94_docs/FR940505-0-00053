FR940505-0-00053 FR940505-0-00015 There are approximately 9,750 TCM IO&hyph;346, IO&hyph;520, and IO&hyph;550 series piston engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 8,300 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per inspection, and if the engine mount brackets must be replaced, an additional 4 work hours will be required. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $320 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,395,000. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air Transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;09&hyph;07 Teledyne Continental Motors: Amendment 39&hyph;8896. Docket 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;50. Applicability: Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) engine models IO&hyph;346A, IO&hyph;346B, IO&hyph;520C, IO&hyph;520CB, and IO&hyph;550C; rebuilt engine model IO&hyph;520C with serial numbers (S/N) 287051&hyph;R and lower; rebuilt engine model IO&hyph;520CB with S/N 282226&hyph;R and lower; rebuilt engine model IO&hyph;550C with S/N 271742&hyph;R and lower; and all factory overhauled IO&hyph;520C, IO&hyph;520CB, and IO&hyph;550C engines with a build date prior to August 6, 1992. These engines are installed on but not limited to Beech model A23, A23A, 95&hyph;C55, 95&hyph;C55A, D55, D55A, E55, E55A, 58, and 58A airplanes. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent engine separation from the aircraft due to cracks in the engine mount brackets, accomplish the following: (a) For engines with engine mount brackets that have completed at least one engine overhaul cycle, or have accumulated 2,500 or more hours time in service (TIS) on the effective date of this AD, inspect the lower left engine mount bracket, Part Number (P/N) 630695, for cracks using the dye penetrant techniques specified in this paragraph and in accordance with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M92&hyph;13, dated September 4, 1992, within the next 50 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD. (1) Perform the dye penetrant inspection as follows: Note: Military Specification MIL-I&hyph;6866 and American Society of Testing Materials specifications ASTM E1417&hyph;93 and E165&hyph;9 contain additional information on dye penetrant inspection processes.
