U.S. President Bill Clinton "will think that Hata is hopeless," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a scheduled news conference after a panel meeting. Regardless of the political situation, the advisory panel to the prime minister will "definitely" issue its report in June before the Naples summit of Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations in July, Kato said, stressing that a detailed tax reform plan has become an international commitment. Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to make a decision on tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, by July and to turn it into law by the end of the year, in reaction to U.S. criticism that 6 trillion yen in tax cuts limited to the current fiscal year is insufficient to boost domestic demand and thus help curb persistent trade surpluses. Kato also said that if Hata wants a long-lasting rule, he should present concrete plans for administrative reform to win public support for the tax reform which is to include a heavier burden on taxpayers through offsetting tax hikes. "Even if a cabinet holds a minority of seats in the Diet, no party will try to pull down a prime minister that has strong public support," Kato said. He noted that in its June report the panel intends to call on the government to pave the way for tax reform, particularly citing spending cuts, deregulation to spur market activity, and other administrative changes. "The government should stop just saying that it will conduct administrative reform without showing concrete plans," Kato said, noting that only one-third or one-fourth of past initiatives have been implemented so far. The panel wants to show the direction for cutting and hiking taxes as well as to revamp the current consumption tax system for a more efficient taxation, the chairman said. But he noted he is still not sure whether concrete figures will be included. Kato said earlier that the report will cover various options for politicians to decide on later, and added at the Friday press meeting that it will be an interim report, with a final report to be issued at the end of the year for fiscal 1996 tax revision.
