Meanwhile, the inflation rate under 20 per cent a month automatically makes NBU's refinancing rates (at 240 per cent annual interest rate) positive, which Mr. Yushchenko considers the most beneficial factor under the present circumstances. As NBU vice-president Igor Mityukov noted, the bank's major objective in the monetary regulation domain has been to create the essential prerequisites for evolving a real currency market in Ukraine, since presently this market is absolutely centralized. However, as Mr. Mityukov further noted, Ukraine's financial structures were technically able to function in an absolutely decentralized currency market environment back in August 1993. Since then the government has taken a series of rigid administrative moves tightening its grip on currency regulations. These included, in particular, imposition of a mandatory sale by exporter enterprises of 50 per cent of their hard currency earnings at the NBU-fixed rates, as well as suspended hard currency trading by the Interbank Currency Exchange and the Ukrainian karbovanets fixed rate. Despite inflation, NBU has to work under the fixed karbovanets rate conditions, which results in multiple rates for the Ukrainian karbovanets. Thus, to prop up the engineering, coal-mining industries and agriculture their relevant ministries will be allowed to purchase hard currency earned through exports of their enterprises' products at the 30,000 krb.:1 USD rate instead of the official rate of 12,610 krb.:1 USD. Meanwhile, hard currency acquisition through tenders and auctions (Ukraine's sole legal source of non-cash currency purchases), will be allowed, same as before, only for purposes, which the government's officers deign to consider as expedient (purchasing fuels, timber, medicines, for instance). Relations with International Financial Institutions Granting credits by the World Bank, IMF and other international financial institutions involves Ukraine's strict observance of certain commitments and requirements, primarily its economic reform's efficacy. In Mr. Mityukov's opinion, this agreement allows the West to indefinitely and rather arbitrarily delay credit granting to Ukraine, though such credits could be very helpful in creating the stabilization fund for Ukraine's new monetary unit. Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic stabilization would allow the nation to apply foreign credits to other than pressing needs, purposes. As Mr. Mityukov disclosed, an agreement was reached with IMF experts on the correctness of the national monetary unit's regulated rate vis-a-vis absent currency exchange operations, necessary to define it. However, they remain adamant in their demand to abolish multiple karbovanets rates. Relations With Russia Ukraine has not abandoned hope for settling with Russia the sensitive issue of sharing the late USSR's assets and liabilities. Negotiations to this effect have not been successful, so far, with Russia having declared itself the USSR's sole legal successor and denying Ukraine's right to use the USSR's assets and service its debt. According to Mr. Mityukov, by the time the USSR disintegrated its assets were composed of 74 billion foreign currency rubles (one such ruble was roughly equal to 1.5 USD) in credits granted to developing nations, 47 to 48 billion rubles in debts of the former COMECON nations, 3.5 billion rubles in realty and property abroad, and 295 tons of gold. The USSR's gross debt amounted to 81 billion dollars and 17.3 billion rubles to COMECON nations. In addition to the problem of sharing the former USSR's assets and liabilities Ukraine has been trying to push Russia to extinguishing internal currency indebtedness, which in Mr. Mityukov's opinion, should be the Russian Finance Ministry's responsibility and task. According to NBU estimates, the Soviet Vneshekonombank owes 400 million dollars to Ukrainian natural person-citizens, while other banks of the former USSR owe 81.5 million dollars for exported Ukrainian grain plus 25 million dollars in Ukrainian collective farms' means. Foreign Banks' Operations in Ukraine Igor Mityukov tends to believe that foreign banks' activity in Ukraine cannot significantly improve the national financial system. Foreign bank affiliates in Ukraine employ predominantly Ukrainian personnel, and their operations are executed within a very narrow field. The only bank, out of eight foreign banks established in Ukraine, whose presence is tangible on the Ukrainian market , is the First Ukrainian International Bank. However, it utilizes sizeable state capital. Thus, as the NBU vice-president asserts, the National Bank's decision to limit the foreign banks' scope of activity to only non-residents, was a justified and well-grounded one.
