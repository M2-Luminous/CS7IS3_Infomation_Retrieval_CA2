(b) Every person who engages in more than one group of independent activities shall obtain a separate registration for each group of activities, unless otherwise exempted by the Act or §§1309.24&hyph;1309.26, except that a person registered to import any List I chemical shall be authorized to distribute that List I chemical, but no other chemical that the person is not registered to import. §1309.23 Separate registration for separate locations. (a) A separate registration is required for each principal place of business at one general physical location where List I chemicals are distributed, imported, or exported by a person. (b) The following locations shall be deemed to be places not subject to the registration requirement: (1) A warehouse where List I chemicals are stored by or on behalf of a registered person, unless such chemicals are distributed directly from such warehouse to locations other than the registered location from which the chemicals were originally delivered; and (2) An office used by agents of a registrant where sales of List I chemicals are solicited, made, or supervised but which neither contains such chemicals (other than chemicals for display purposes) nor serves as a distribution point for filling sales orders. §1309.24 Exemption of agents and employees. The requirement of registration is waived for any agent or employee of a person who is registered to engage in any group of independent activities, if such agent or employee is acting in the usual course of his or her business or employment. §1309.25 Exemption of certain controlled substance registrants. (a) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who distributes a product containing a List I chemical that is regulated pursuant to §1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, if that person is registered with the Administration to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance. (b) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who imports or exports a product containing a List I chemical that is regulated pursuant to §1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, if that person is registered with the Administration to engage in the same activity with a controlled substance.
