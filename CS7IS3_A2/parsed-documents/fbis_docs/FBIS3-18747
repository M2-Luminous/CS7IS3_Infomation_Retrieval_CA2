During the whole bleak recession, the government has repeated over and over that it would not undertake to "stimulate through borrowing." Now the government announces that the recession is over and at the same time starts to stimulate the economy through borrowing. The government's attitude toward stimulation changed suddenly last fall. The government justifies its conversion by the achievement of equilibrium in the balance of payments or by the fact that Finland no longer is incurring debt abroad overall. The change in the balance of payments to a surplus, however, was not a surprise at all, nor did the government in addition promise before last fall to turn its sleigh when the balance of payments changed. Iiro Viinanen, the minister of finance (Conservative), and Aho rejected stimulation through borrowing once and for all as impossible. "There is reason to emphasize that a disciplined fiscal policy has not been just a slogan for the government, but rather a choice that constitutes one of the central anchors of a credible economic policy," Viinanen said when presenting the government's 1994 budget proposal last fall. In October Viinanen said that an "unconditional no" must be said to support for investment that occurs through additional borrowing. Viinanen was absent from the Friday news conference at which the government presented the supplementary budget implementing the stimulus package. The real reasons for the government's change of direction can only be guessed. Perhaps the government has come to the position that record unemployment will not improve of its own accord. Perhaps the hawks are getting the upper hand over the doves in the government. Perhaps the Conservatives and the Center Party have begun to fear for their support before the spring Eduskunta elections. One would like to think that announcing the stimulus projects two days before the second round of the presidential elections was pure chance, although Elisabeth Rehn (Swedish Peoples Party), the minister of defense, stubbornly defended the government policy in her campaign. The government would not have the gall to play games with so serious matters, would it? The Finance Ministry opposed stimulation up to last fall, because it believed that stimulation would deepen the government's long-term indebtedness and stop the reduction in interest rates. The interest rate fear seems to have been unnecessary; interest rates continued to fall after the government announced the beginning of stimulation through borrowing. The government may have delayed the beginning of stimulation also to keep the labor market organizations and the Eduskunta under control last fall. Planned gloominess promoted arriving at income solutions that suited the government and budget deliberations in the manner desired by the government. Finnish economic policy has traditionally reinforced business cycles: Through government measures declines have been deepened and booms heated up. This time too the beginning of stimulation has gone awry from the standpoint of breaking up the recession. When presenting the stimulus package on Friday, Aho himself said that the recession had ended already in the last quarter of last year.
