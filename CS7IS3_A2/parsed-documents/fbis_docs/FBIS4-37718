This resulted in human and material losses among the civilian population. This was the third aerial attack by the Zionist regime's fighter bombers on Lebanon's residential areas in the past two days following the valiant operations by the Islamic Resistance against the Zionist usurpers. On 'Ashura, the combatants of the Islamic Resistance attacked the Zionist aggressors inside the areas they occupy, emulating the lord of the martyrs. Instead of the Zionist regime terminating its 16-year occupation of the border strip in south Lebanon under pressure of international public opinion--by withdrawing--it continues its policy of blind terrorism with the support of foreign and international powers. The Zionist regime attacks residential areas in a blind and cowardly manner with its bombers and artillery. The Zionist regime's pretext for these acts of aggression and the repeated violation of international norms is that it is combating the cells of the Islamic liberation struggle against the usurpers. In reality, the Zionist regime is pursuing other political objectives. Political experts believe that the Tel Aviv echelons are striving to bare their fangs and talons in these operations before the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the Middle East. This visit implies that the wheels of diplomatic machinery have been set in motion and therefore the Zionist regime--this uninvited and inauspicious guest in the region--feels that before he arrives it should show off its fangs and talons to its host country to impose peace from a position of strength. It is no coincidence that at the same time as the bombing of south Lebanon the Zionist regime's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin should participate directly in military maneuvers in the occupied Golan Heights, which belong to Syria. Interesting that during these maneuvers Rabin expressed his dissatisfaction with the current talks in Washington and called for direct talks with Syria. It can be concluded from such behavior that the occupying Zionist regime is first willing to embark on all kinds of atrocities and second is also enjoying international immunity and the support of world powers in this regard. The Lebanese Government has realized the regime's political objectives and has adopted a completely appropriate stance by extending its serious support to the anti-Zionist resistance as the country's legitimate right. This means that the Zionist regime will reap nothing from these crimes but disgrace.
