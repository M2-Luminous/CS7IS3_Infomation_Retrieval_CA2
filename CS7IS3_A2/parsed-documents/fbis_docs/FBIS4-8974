"We will preserve the sound dinar, we will create a market system, we will crush inflation, there will be no printing of money without backing, we will quickly increase production, we will help the `borderlands,' there will be no loans for the unqualified, we are encircled--but we will persevere and emerge even stronger than we were before the sanctions." With these words, a slightly milder variant of the speech from the 5th Congress of the KPJ [Communist Party of Yugoslavia] in 1948, the "mandatary for forming a Serbian government," Mirko Marjanovic, sold a demagogic haze to the Serbian parliamentary deputies and to the Serbian public. This "gentleman" with 50 years of party service, a native of Knin, a Belgrade scholarship recipient at red universities in Moscow, is now the main smuggler of gas from Russia for the second winter in a row, through the company "Progres," of which he was the director. The gentlemen did not explain how he "will not print money without backing" while the budget of the "Armed Forces of Yugoslavia" is $700 million and the "superdinar" has backing in gold and foreign exchange amounting to 230 million German marks; nor did he explain exactly what "there will be no loans for the unqualified" means in a country from which all qualified people among them and 350,000 young people have long since fled head over heels. Even a cursory glance at the team that will lead the country, the "ministers," provides an indication of what this latest Serbian government will be like. The man concerned with pushing this government's proposals through parliament will be socialist fossil Dragan Tomic, a person who with a trembling voice, as "president of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Belgrade" at the time, announced Milosevic's first rallies in 1987 and 1988 at the "source." There is Zoran Sokolovic "Pirocanac," for several years now Serbia's top policeman, a person who has performed immeasurable services in suppressing all attempts at "popular happenings" that are against Milosevic's will. His sphere of activity will remain the truncheon. There is Ratko Markovic, a professor at the School of Law in Belgrade, known for his writing of the so-called Zabljak Constitution, a piece of legal hanky-panky through which Montenegro became Belgrade's captive without the right to appeal and remedy, a "jurist" for whom the Orthodox church in Vienna is plenty of proof that Vienna is an "old Serbian city." There is Slobodan Unkovic, the former chancellor of Belgrade University and chairman of one of the former sessions of the Serbian Assembly, known for having submitted his own irrevocable resignation midway through a session over which he was presiding, with the words: "Colleagues, I cannot go on!" There is also Radovan Pankov, who will lead one of the key areas, the "Ministry for Serbs Outside Serbia" (translation: "ministry for the borderlands"), and with Kertes the leader of the "yogurt revolution" in Vojvodina, the former party leader in Backa Palanka (the place from which the occupation and deportation of Ilok was conducted), and one of the ideological thugs of the Milosevic regime. The sphere of information has been entrusted to Ratomir Vica, the former manager of RTV [Radio and Television] Serbia, and there is also the director of the "Red Star" soccer club for many years, Vladimir Cvetkovic. His club has long since lost its radiance, but nonetheless Cvetkovic, as minister of sports, is still a "rising star." This team will have at its disposal as flank support the good services--and it will need them--of Brana Crncevic, who needs no special introduction, Milorad Vucelic, the director of TV Serbia and ideologue of the "red chetnik movement," the unique Margit Savovic, as "federal minister for human rights," Mihalj Kertes--about whom no one knows exactly what he does, although many have experienced how it does it, and Radmilo Bogdanovic, Serbia's former top policeman. There is also Bora Jovic, who is less and less in demand, and there is Zeljko Simic, our great friend from the Geneva Declaration, and there are retired and active generals. What is actually present here is the entire apparatus of a crumbled state that has been completely useless for several years now. Each of them could gain a certain role at a certain moment. The number of roles is unlimited, but they are all of an episodic nature. The latest convocation of the Serbian government is only the logical continuation of Milosevic's red camarilla, which for seven years now--amid war cries--has been on the march across the Balkans, leaving arson, ruins, and death in its wake for tens of thousands of members of other nations. These are "all the free comrades" who will leave only after they have literally spent the last para and pfennig of all the possible reserves of the former Yugoslavia. Even then, however, they will not leave willingly, and someone will have to ask them to give up power. Naturally, "ask" them using their methods....
