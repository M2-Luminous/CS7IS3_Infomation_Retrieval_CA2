He said that the security of some of the military facilities would be enhanced to exclude the seizure of weapons and military equipment. "But there are no plans to draw forces to Moscow from other regions," he said. To quote Kulikov, on May 1, interior troops will be in reserve and help the police if necessary. Kulikov referred to the law which says that the interior troops shall not be used for dispersing unsanctioned rallies or demonstrations, but shall be involved in dealing with mass disturbances. He also announced that in a number of regions, above all in the North Caucasus, the interior troops had to act in the backdrop of a complicated criminal situation. In 1993, interior troops came under fire 130 times in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. As a result, seven servicemen were killed and 133 were wounded. This year, interior troops were attacked more than 20 times. He proposed that the Interior Minister be allowed to change the structure and dislocation of the interior troops depending on the criminal situation. He also noted that almost 17,000 interior troop servicemen had no housing. "Spending on the interior troops meets only 60 percent of our needs," said Kulikov.
