[Lezsak] I do not believe that the country voted against the change of the regime, and not really against us, either. People probably made this decision because of the afflictions and disappointment. I am very sorry that even the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] did not manage to take over and save what was impossible for us to keep because the majority of voters lost confidence in us. We knew that we would reach fewer votes at these elections than in 1990; nevertheless, we were quite wrong in our estimates. It is only now, with hindsight, that we can precisely see that the country felt that it had been unable to have a say in the details of changing the regime. In a period when more than 400 laws had to be passed, dialogue was forced into the background because of the pressure of time. [Joo] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which gained the second largest number of votes, now claims that it is the alternative to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] which has so far dominated by far. [Lezsak] This is a campaign trick of the SZDSZ. This is the only chance of the Free Democrats to gain many mandates. This is a temporary phenomenon; after the second round, the SZDSZ will be seeking the factors that link it with the MSZP. This is leading directly to their coalition. [Joo] It is a common occurrence that the big losers of the first round face further difficulties in the second round because many people like to stand by the winners.... [Lezsak] We are over the abyss. It is impossible to make the failure of the first round any worse. We have realistically assessed our possibilities: Every single electoral district that we win can only improve our situation. [Joo] Will the MDF's basic political attitude change in the new situation? According to some speculations, a move over to the right, and according to others, a move in the liberal direction can be expected. [Lezsak] We will continue to represent the MDF's fundamental values -- this party will remain in the center right. We began to reorganize the MDF in the autumn of 1993. The result of this was that we managed to remain in the contest in more than 100 electoral districts and avoided a total defeat. It seems that we will be the strongest opposition party in the new parliament. The MDF has some experience from the period before 1990. For the first time, a period is starting when we have to fulfill our tasks having gained experience both in opposition and in government. Our main goal is to prevent the situation from falling back to the level of a tamed dictatorship. [Joo] Will there be another four years, a full parliamentary cycle? [Lezsak] In the interest of the country's stability, the protection of domestic and Western investments, and new owners, it is essential for the new parliament to operate undisturbed. It would be a crime against the country's security if we questioned these four years. [Joo] Do you think that the MDF will be given as big a scope for maneuver from the victorious political opponents as they received in 1990 from the MDF? [Lezsak] I do not think that the MSZP-SZDSZ government will be capable of self-restraint. The negative experiences of the past four years confirm the feeling in me that the discrediting of the MDF and some of its politicians will be continued -- now on a governmental level. [Joo] Do you feel that the MDF is responsible for the fact that the media organs that were fair to it are left without any guarantees for survival? [Lezsak] We already admitted earlier, not only with hindsight, that the MDF and the government did not have enough strength to create a sound media organization. It has to be acknowledged that, between 1988 and 1990, the MSZP had prepared its media policy for the past four years very professionally. However, we were not incompetent, rather, we were forced to concentrate on other issues.
