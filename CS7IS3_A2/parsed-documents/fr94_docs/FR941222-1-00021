ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the regulations for hazardous waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA is listing, as hazardous, five wastes generated during the production of dyes and pigments because certain ways of disposing of these wastes may present a risk to human health and the environment. EPA also is proposing not to list as hazardous six other wastes from this industry, and to defer action on three wastes due to insufficient information. The proposal would add the toxic constituents found in the wastes to the list of constituents that serve as a basis for classifying wastes as hazardous. This action also describes EPA's policy on making listing determinations, and the risk-based criteria used by the Agency. This action is proposed under the authority of Sections 3001(e)(2) and 3001(b)(1) of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), which direct EPA to make a hazardous waste listing determination for dye and pigment wastes. If finalized, this regulation would regulate these wastes as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. Additionally, this action proposes to designate the wastes proposed for listing as hazardous substances subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA is not taking action at this time to adjust the one-pound statutory reportable quantities (RQs) for these substances. DATES: EPA will accept public comments on this proposed rule and on EPA's hazardous waste listing determination policy until March 22, 1995. Comments postmarked after this date will be marked ``late'' and may not be considered. Any person may request a public hearing on this proposal by filing a request with Mr. David Bussard, whose address appears below, by January 5, 1995.
