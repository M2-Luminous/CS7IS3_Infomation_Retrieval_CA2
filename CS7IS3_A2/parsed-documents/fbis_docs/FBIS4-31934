The two organizations are cooperating closely. We interviewed two high-ranking officials of the National Security Office, who do not wish their names to be revealed. They asked for our understanding because, in the course of investigating such affairs, there are always moments that cannot be made public. We first asked them to deal with the speculation here and abroad. [NEPSZABADSAG] Is it possible that an international terrorist organization is behind this bombing at the parliament? [Official] Like other versions, this is not impossible. However, these organizations generally declare themselves after the event or immediately beforehand. In other words, they "claim responsibility." No such signal has arrived in this case. [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you consider it possible that a domestic extremist organization is behind it? [Official] One cannot exclude this possibility, but there is no tradition of such a thing in Hungary. The fact that Parliament is also the symbol of our national past and history speaks against this possibility. Most known extremist organizations we can think of in this respect stress their national roots, and this does not seem to be compatible with an action against this historical site of our statehood. [NEPSZABADSAG] There are autonomous forces operating beyond our southern borders, forces that are not under state control. Threats against Hungarians in Vojvodina have also been mentioned in the press. There are rumors about the possibility of such organizations extending their operations beyond their own borders. Could all this be connected with the explosion? [Official] I do not know your sources of information. Consequently, I do not want to comment at all on what you have just said. I repeat: We will investigate every possibility. We will not leave out any possibility. [NEPSZABADSAG] Including the possibility that this action could somehow be connected with Magda Marinko's affair? [Official] I am sorry that I have to repeat: We will not leave out any possibility. Not even such a possibility. Nor the possibility that a "lone wolf" or a crazy man carried out the bombing. [NEPSZABADSAG] You saw the location. What would you add to the descriptions that appeared in the press? [Official] The fact that the front of Gate No. 19 was protected by a fence; at the same time, this is a building area. The attacker had to get over the fence, but this was probably not difficult because there were holes in the fence. A man of average physical condition could reach the gate from the Danube, place the bomb, and disappear in 3-4 minutes. If we take into account the approximately 6 minutes between two appearances of the guard in this area, the bomber had enough time. [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, a single person could have done it. [Unnamed official] It is not impossible. It is another matter that, in such cases, there is preliminary surveillance of the guards' movements and the placement of the television cameras, and there could be accomplices to choose the location and provide accommodation. However, with exact knowledge of the specifics of the location, a single person and 3-4 minutes would be enough. [NEPSZABADSAG] Is the bomb found at Parliament a "relative" of the one in Szeged? [Official] Yes, but I would entrust my colleagues with the details. [NEPSZABADSAG] You have been on location since early morning. What did you do? [Official] We cooperated closely with the police bomb disposal experts. We collected everything that remained from the explosive device. Everything goes to the lab. It is tedious work, but it is worth it. The location and what remains there tell a lot even about the most sophisticated bomb. [NEPSZABADSAG] What did you find? [Official] We found many pieces of a green-colored plastic, presumably pieces of a soap-holder-type box which held the alarm-watch-type timing device. There must have been somewhat less than one kilogram of TNT in the bomb. [NEPSZABADSAG] Is this a lot or little? What if this amount explodes on or in a car for example? [Official] It is a strong bomb that would kill all the passengers and destroy the car completely. [NEPSZABADSAG] How big could this bomb be? [Official] Altogether not bigger than 20x15 cm. It could comfortably be placed in a shopping bag. [NEPSZABADSAG] In what range can the timing device be set? Could you reconstruct the bomb? [Official] The explosion can be set from 15 minutes to 26 hours. Theoretically, it can also be set for a shorter time than 15 minutes, but if the time span is too short, it could also endanger the terrorist himself. Of course, we cannot say when the device was set before the explosion. Not only can we reconstruct the bomb but, thanks to what the bomb disposal experts have collected, we can see the exact model. Everything on this model is identical with this bomb before it went off. [NEPSZABADSAG] In connection with the bomb in Szeged, your colleague said only that it was a "relative" of the bomb that exploded at the Parliament. [Official] If I may use the term here, I would say it was its little brother. We tested its power by analyzing the deformations on the pillar. The result: We are talking here about the same device, the same mechanical timing device, the same bomb, only with half the amount of explosive material. [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, it could be the same perpetrator. Is it possible that he is preparing for a third attack? [Official] We cannot answer this question. Together with our police colleagues, we are working to discover and arrest the perpetrator or perpetrators....
