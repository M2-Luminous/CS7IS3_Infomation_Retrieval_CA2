In Dabija's view, Yeltsin's decision to create army bases in Commonwealth republics was out of keeping with the Moldovan military doctrine. The Moldovan and Russian military could negotiate only one issue, Dabija said, the full withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army from Moldovan soil. On 7 April, however, the eighth round of Russian-Moldovan negotiations was held in Kishinev [Chisinau]. A draft agreement was initialled on the legal status and reciprocal legal aid in cases related to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on Moldovan territory. The Moldovan and Russian delegations signed a few other documents to decide how they would schedule Russian troop withdrawal and the removal of Russian army property from Moldova. They failed to agree on deadlines for the Russian troop withdrawal, but agreed to meet again in May.
