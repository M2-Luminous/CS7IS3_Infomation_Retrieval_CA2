And this is "just the beginning of the election campaign." This was announced 24 hours earlier by Achille Occhetto [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) secretary], who was starting his campaign. He was referred enthusiastically to the agreement among the eight progressive groupings on using a single symbol for their electoral lists. The same words were spoken, quietly, 24 hours later. And it was immediately apparent that he did not expect this cold shower from Milan. Was it really so cold? Not at all. It has already been denied. And yet an annoying breeze is already upsetting the political contest. At PDS headquarters they refused to believe it at first. What? Mr. Sama again? Right now? They did not start taking it seriously until mid-afternoon, after a deluge of telephone calls from all over Italy: It was like having a fever, with everyone asking how do you feel; are you alright, despite everything? It was later, as they watched the television news, that they started to take Sama's latest statement to [Judge] Di Pietro seriously. It then became impossible to maintain the low profile that they initially wanted to adopt, confining their response to an angry denial from the press bureau, an indignant statement to ANSA by Occhetto. Much more was needed, following the accusation that has tainted the start of the election campaign. An attack on those who are maneuvering, not even so secretly. By late evening the roll of drums could be heard throughout the capital, and newspaper and television reporters were summoned urgently. The PDS leadership was assembled, as befitting an important occasions. It fell to Visani to issue the angry denial. Occhetto displayed all the incredulity proper to a complete fabrication, provided a political interpretation of the operation, and expressed his contempt for those who "right on cue, have tried to spoil the party for the progressive forces, the very day after an extraordinary agreement was reached. But the party goes on." [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema yielded to the temptation of sarcasm: "Of course they pondered it for a long time, and examined things carefully for months in order to fabricate this nonsense. Who could it have been? Let me see: Didn't Cusani work for Craxi?" D'Alema was the only one of the PDS leaders to go beyond an expression of outrage and to explore possible leads. The corruption investigation has nothing to do with it, and their respect for Di Pietro has not been undermined (indeed, "he is doing his job; it is Sama who is telling lies," Visani admitted). But certainly "it is a strange trial; it is not clear who is being accused. Sama said these things months ago, and we have already given evidence. Now he is trying again. He is repeating himself, with some additional novelties, figures, and details. He must have studied hard in the interim. They are rather strange charges: We do not know how, when, or where. We do not even know who should be accused, since it is unfortunately impossible to sue a dead man -- Gardini." The honor of destroying the Romagnese Sama fell to Visentini, another, ice-cool, Romagnese. "Why is he now recycling this old and clearly groundless story? It is a fabrication, with some shameful allusions. There is proof. Dragoni and Tassinari, identified as the couriers who accompanied the billion lire, issued a denial. Dragoni, the mayor of Ravenna, merely obeyed Gardini's request to meet with Occhetto. All the rest is a fabrication. The facts are clear -- unfortunately for Sama and fortunately for us." His words stung like whiplashes. "Let us forget about the remarks on television" (which can do enormous damage during an election campaign), "but neither Sama nor anyone else can say to whom the money was consigned, where, or when this supposedly took place. But the fact that remains is the vote in parliament in which the PDS turned down Gardini's request to drop the Enimont inquiry." So who is vilifying the PDS, two months before the elections? Suspicions were voiced. Occhetto tried his hand as a reporter. Wearing his blue jacket and Clinton-style dark necktie with yellow squares (the same one he wore on the great day the progressive pact was signed), he announced "a spectacular piece of news." "An expose is fabricated artificially, implicating a dead man who cannot confirm it and two living people who deny it. Some scoop. So the real news is this: Someone is already trying to undermine the March elections. It deserves the loud laugh due to such a macabre and grotesque event. As a citizen, together with D'Alema, I call for the utmost protection because from now on anybody could cite a dead person, attributing to him who knows what accusations to the detriment of who knows whom. Beware: Somebody is secretly planning further carefully calculated coups." After the statements came the round of repetitive interviews for the television networks. It must really have been a terrible moment to make Occhetto angry ("No, your question is wrongly formulated; it is not true that I am implicated") with a Fininvest reporter. The day after the left-wing party was one of great irritation. The inevitable question was: Why is Sama lying, why now? D'Alema attempted a reply: "I do not know whether he is just raving or performing a role written by someone else. I judge the reliability of his recollections on the basis of certain details: He has always spoken about an imaginary dinner with me. Actually, I went one morning, at breakfast time, to the hotel that he used as his base in Rome. It may be just a detail, but I only had coffee. What can I say? I think that Carlo Sama is now very heavily influenced, or easily influenced, and heavily involved in some excessively complex affairs. I also think that we do not yet know what happened to all that money from the Enimont kickbacks. I have seen the figures, and they do not add up. There is still a lot missing. And I think that there may still be someone to whom he cannot deny certain favors." Be that as it may, Franco Bassanini pointed out, the PDS acted "extremely scrupulously in parliament. We voted against Gardini's request to shelve the inquiry. That day 82 percent of PDS deputies were present. With regard to Sama's lies I would put forward three hypotheses: He fabricated the whole thing because somebody asked for his help. Or Gardini told him to do so, because he really hoped to soften the PDS' stance, and then gave up. Or, again, he did try it with somebody. But he was given to understand that it was impossible."
