In the preface the booklet notes that a fine socialist system has been established in North Korea, but fascist dictatorship is rampant in South Korea. The preface says the South Korean authorities, with a view to keeping the country divided forever, built the largest ever concrete wall under the aegis of the United States and have ceaselessly staged provocative military exercises against North Korea. Saying North Korea put forward a proposal for reunification through a confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, the preface stresses this proposal is the best way of achieving the reunification of the country.
