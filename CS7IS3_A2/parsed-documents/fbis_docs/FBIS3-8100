According to him, representatives of the executive and the presidential institution passed secret information about the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence General Nikos Grylakis [name as published]. In that context the PD-FSN deputy named Paul Teodoru, current transportation minister, and [General] Vasile Ionel, counselor of President Ion Iliescu. The presidential counselor is supposed to have personally handed over a file containing secret information to the Greek general. Basescu claims that the information had been previously obtained from Petromin Director Romanuel Posedaru. Until now the representatives of the government, as well as those of the presidential institution, have not officially denied anything. The press remained speechless when it learned about the accusations of such gravity. If the accusations are sustained by evidence, the Petromin-Forum Maritime scandal will eventually be cleared up by simply revealing the details of an espionage affair the perpetrators of which are top officials in Bucharest and Athens. Here are some details for our readers. The persons directly accused or merely hinted at by Basescu are: General Nikos Grylakis, the man who in 1993 triggered "the scandal of the century" in Athens, Stellos Katounis, owner of the Forum Maritime company, and the Palestinian Fathi Mohamad Taher [name as published], the owner of the Elite restaurant in Bucharest, the Greek business adversary of the previous two persons, the shipping tycoon Iannis Alafouzos, who also owns a number of radio and television networks, while on the Bucharest side of the affair they are Paul Teodoru and General Vasile Ionel. On a secondary plane the names of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, the former prime minister of Greece, Nicolae Vacaroiu, the head of the executive in Bucharest, and Ion Iliescu have also been mentioned. If Basescu's allegations are true, the center figure of the whole affair is General Grylakis. His career came to an end in September 1993, previous to which he held the office of Prime Minister Mitsotakis' counselor for security and defense issues. Born on the isle of Crete he later graduated from the Military Academy and the War Academy. He was specially trained by the Mosad (Israel's intelligence service.) During the 1967 military dictatorship he was the head of the Greek secret service. In 1989 he organized an illegal network to tap the telephone conversations of various Greek political figures and gather information about them. Three years ago he set up the Bureau for Balkan Affairs. He had contacts with many Balkan leaders. He publicly claimed that he supported and influenced things to have Ion Iliescu elected as president. For that service, according to the Greek press, in 1993 he received a medal in Bucharest. Iliescu does not deny this. In the same year Premier Vacaroiu invites him to Snagov to celebrate the conclusion of the Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. He is a friend of Stellos Katounis and the Palestinian Taher (both of whom have very tight business connections with Moscow), and an enemy of Andreas Papandreou, the current Greek prime minister, and of Alafouzos, the influential shipping tycoon, who last September managed to bring General Grylakis to justice. In the same month [September 1993] our daily already signaled, for the first time, that he is involved in the Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. From first-class Greek sources (who for the time being wish to remain anonymous) we learned that immediately after "the scandal of the century" erupted in Athens, General Grylakis made an unexpected move: In exchange for the extinguishing of the conflict he offered a number of confidential documents to his adversaries. Among those documents was the file referred to by Basescu and which contains evidence regarding the involvement of top Romanian officials in an espionage affair. In those documents Grylakis describes in detail the persons from whom he obtained classified information and how. Basescu's accusations are so serious that they place the Romanian intelligence services in a difficult position. The Foreign Information Service, the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], and UM 0215 (the Intelligence Service of the Ministry of Interior) are now compelled to urgently provide answers to the Romanian public.
