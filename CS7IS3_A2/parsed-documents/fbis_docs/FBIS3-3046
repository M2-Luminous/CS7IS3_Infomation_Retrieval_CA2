Recently a famous Beijing university successively released and printed in booklets, three batches of fruits from several hundred scientific research projects. However, the university only listed research project titles and technology transfer fees in the booklets, without making any substantive effort to transfer technology. Such a passive work style plus expensive technology transfer fees, which was beyond the budget of units urgently in need of technology, resulted in very few technologies transferred. It is understood that China currently has 17.6 million scientific and technical personnel. They complete over 10,000 province- or department-funded research projects and turn out some 20,000 patents annually. However, only 15 percent of the research results are put into application, and even fewer are used extensively by more than one unit. The gradual establishment of a socialist market economic structure poses a new challenge to China's science and technology management system. In the past, science and technology management departments made inventory of research results, evaluated or awarded them, and locked them up in archives offices. Such a practice is incompatible with the development of the market economy. Research fruits should be put into markets, circulated, and exchanged as commodities. As enterprises shop in markets for suitable technologies, scientists will direct their research and development to meet market demands. Therefore, research institute administrators should look squarely at the reality and change their perception of management in certain ways. According to experts, administrators should not only make good inventory of, but also effectively manage research results. In managing research results, administrators should work as agents, conducting market survey and forecast to match buyers with sellers, and working as a catalyst to transactions by providing information service. At present there are many unauthorized agents with all kinds of qualifications. Quite a few are swindlers, and only a handful are professionals with real science and technology information and expertise in technology transfer. Since Chinese research institutes already have an edge in this regard, they should set up various management and service organizations to market high-quality creditable research results. Experts suggest the use of economic and legal means to guide enterprises and scientific and technical personnel to the technology market for voluntary buying and selling of research fruits. Meanwhile, it is necessary to do everything possible to set up auction centers and to increase the rate of auctioning technology. As technology investment involves risks, many enterprises are hesitant to move ahead. Administrators should help enterprises set up the mechanism to deal with investment risks so that enterprises have less worries and more hopes for successful utilization of new technology.
