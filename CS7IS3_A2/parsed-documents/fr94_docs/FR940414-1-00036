FR940414-1-00036 FR940414-1-00010 Pesticide formulating is the mixing of pesticide active ingredient with inert ingredients without a chemical reaction that changes the active ingredient. Pesticide formulations take all forms: Water-based liquid; organic solvent-based liquid; dry products in granular, powder, solid forms; pressurized gases; and aerosols. The formulations can be in a concentrated form requiring dilution before application or can be ready to apply. The packaging of the formulated pesticide product is dependent on the type of formulation. Liquids generally are packaged into jugs, cans, or drums; dry formulations generally are packaged into bags, boxes, drums, or jugs. Pressurized gases are packaged into cylinders. Aerosols are packaged into aerosol cans. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [cite] requires that all products making a claim of killing, mitigating or repelling pests be registered with EPA and bear a label directing the safe use of the product. In addition, production of all pesticide products must be reported annually to EPA. Thus, EPA has extensive data on the contents of pesticide products, their annual production, who formulates, packages or repackages these products and the uses for which these products are registered. EPA's Office of Water made extensive use of this data in its analysis of the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry. Based on 1988 FIFRA establishment registration data, EPA identified 3,241 pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging facilities in the United States for the 272 active ingredients. Subsequently, EPA surveyed a stratified random sample of these 3,240 facilities. Based on this survey, facilities were identified, an estimated 1,305 as pesticide producing establishments involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging pesticide products and the remaining 1,134 facilities as refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sales that only repackage pesticide products. Based on these survey results, EPA estimates that for all of the PAIs covered by this rule, that in 1988 there were 2,000 facilities involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging pesticide products and 1,810 refilling establishments, using 1991 regulation data, these numbers increased to 3,200 and 2,800 facilities respectively. In addition, there were 48 pesticide manufacturing facilities that also formulated and packaged pesticide products. EPA estimates that there could be as many as 13 additional manufacturing facilities that also formulate, package and repackage pesticide products. As described above, the formulating, packaging and repackaging industry produces products in different forms. EPA has observed formulating, packaging or repackaging done a number of different ways ranging from very sophisticated and automated formulation and packaging lines to completely manual lines. In general, for liquid products the process involves mixing the active ingredient with liquid inert ingredients in a tank and then transferring the product to containers. For dry products, the active ingredient may be sprayed in liquid form onto a dry substrate or it may be mixed in dry form. Dry products may undergo processes for mixing, grinding, sifting and finally packaging. Formulating aerosol products is the same as other liquid products, but the packaging is more complex and involves filling the container, capping it, drawing a vacuum on the container, adding propellant under pressure, and sealing the container. Some other types of pesticide products manufactured include collars to repel and kill fleas and ticks, pesticides that are micro-encapsulated, and pesticides that are formed into solid shapes. The pesticide industry is changing and efforts are being made to improve products to meet demands of consumers for less toxic and safer pesticides. For example, water-based solutions are gradually replacing organic solvents in liquid pesticide formulating. Developments in packaging also are underway. For example, the growing use of water soluble packages can reduce worker exposure to pesticides and minimize problems with disposal of packaging. The 1,130 refilling establishments represent a new population of facilities that was identified in the Agency's Survey of Pesticide Producing Establishments. The survey sought to identify all facilities that reported formulating, packaging or repackaging pesticide products in their annual report of 1988. (This survey is described more fully in section V.A.2.) Somewhat unexpectedly, EPA discovered a significant population of facilities that reported repackaging only. These facilities are retail dealers of agricultural chemicals and farm supplies. These facilities repackage pesticide chemicals, usually herbicides, into refillable containers which are used to transport the pesticide to the site where it is applied. The use of refillable containers became widespread during the 1980's to reduce the numbers of empty pesticide containers needing to be disposed of by farmers. In general, registrants distribute large undivided quantities of pesticides to dealerships (refilling establishments) where the products are stored in large bulk tanks. The dealer then repackages the pesticide from the bulk storage tanks to portable minibulk containers that generally have capacities around 100 gallons. The increased use of refillable containers led to an increased amount of herbicide stored in bulk quantities and the need to have a secondary containment system built around the bulk storage tanks. Based on the results of the survey conducted to support this rulemaking, and focussing on the 272 PAIs, EPA estimates that 1,130 refilling establishments existed in the U.S. in 1988. This number is significantly lower than the population estimates for these types of facilities based on all PAIs and registration data, it is also lower than the estimates for the number of these facilities presently in existence, made by EPA in its proposed containers and containment standards rule (40 CFR part 165, 59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994) and by estimates of members of this industry. EPA believes this discrepancy between the 1988 and current numbers of facilities is due to the fact that repackaging into refillable containers was still a growing market, particularly in 1988. In addition, some industry representatives indicated that because it was so early in the creation of this market, many of the refilling establishments were unaware that their new service of repackaging pesticide products required them to be registered establishments and to report their annual production to the Agency. Thus, it is possible that many refilling establishments were not included in the population from which our sample was drawn. B. Source Reduction Review Project Section 6604 of the PPA directs the Administrator to set up an office for the purpose, among other things, of reviewing for the EPA Administrator the impact that Agency regulations would have on source reduction. See PPA section 6604, 42 U.S.C. 13103; S. Rep. No. 526, 101st Congress, 2nd session at 2 (1990). This office is to ``consider'' the effect of Agency programs on source reduction efforts and to ``review'' EPA's regulations prior and subsequent to their proposal to determine their effect on source reduction. The Source Reduction Review Project (SRRP) is a pilot program of the U.S. EPA to demonstrate the value and feasibility of taking a source reduction approach in designing environmental regulations. The project's goal is to ensure that source reduction measures and cross-media implications of rules are fully considered during development of regulations. To the extent practicable and consistent with existing law, and considering cost-effectiveness as appropriate, the Agency will emphasize source reduction as the basis of its rules. Where source reduction cannot be implemented, the Agency will consider recycling, then treatment and if necessary disposal technologies and practices as the basis of its rules. Even in cases where EPA cannot base its rule on source reduction practices, the Agency may encourage the regulated community to consider using innovative source reduction measures to comply with rules by providing information and economic incentives. To investigate opportunities for source reduction, EPA will consider source reduction in every phase of rule development: data collection, site visits, bench-scale technology testing, economic and technical analysis, multi-media impacts and agency and public reporting. The PFPR effluent guidelines regulation was one of approximately 25 rules chosen for this pilot effort. Since initial data collection for this rule preceded the PPA, the Agency did not directly ask questions about source reduction in the industry survey. In every phase since the survey, however, the Agency has considered and evaluated opportunities for source reduction. In addition, the Agency has tried to coordinate this rule with efforts of the Office of Solid Waste in developing a hazardous waste listing for carbamates, a family of pesticide active ingredients.
