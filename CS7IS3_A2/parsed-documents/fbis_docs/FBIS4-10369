FBIS4-10369 "drlat070_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 Peru Poll Shows Fujimori's Popularity Recovering Poll Shows Fujimori's Popularity Recovering PY0804184694 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 27 Mar 94 p A9 PY0804184694 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] According to the last report issued by the Apoyo survey company in March, President Alberto Fujimori obtained 61 percent support for his government, which shows a three-point recovery of the eight points lost in February as a result of the promulgation of the polemic Cantuta law. Moreover, the way in which the government is handling the economic policy obtained the approval of 42 percent of the polled people, which is the same as last month. Apoyo also asked people what they thought about the current government: 51 percent said they thought it was democratic and 31 percent a dictatorship. In February, however, 61 percent believed Fujimori's government was democratic. This 10 percent drop is probably an indication that the effects of the Cantuta law still prevail. This probably also explains why the number of people who would vote for Fujimori remains at 40 percent (although the number of people who approve of his performance has increased), while those who would vote for Javier Perez de Cuellar has increased from 41 to 44 percent. This also shows in the fact that 43 percent have said they will vote for Fujimori, 28 percent for an independent candidate, and 12 percent for an opposition candidate. Which means that the people favor an independent rather than an opposition candidate, which, in turn, is in line with the increasing support for Perez de Cuellar, who is not viewed as an opposition candidate but rather as a continuation of Fujimorism without Fujimori, as a "democratic" Fujimorism or free of Fujimori's "dictatorial" aspects. However, approval for the political opposition has increased by one point (34 percent) and disapproval dropped by two points, that is, from 45 to 47 percent, which reveals a slight improvement. Moreover, Clae [Latin American Center of Business Counseling] President Carlos Manrique's popularity has dropped since last November. The percentage of people who consider him a dishonest person has increased from 54 to 61 percent. There are, however, 27 percent who consider him honest. But only 10 percent believe in what Manrique says. Which means that 17 percent believe he is honest but do not believe what he says. Can one be honest and a liar at the same time? This is a paradox of polls.
