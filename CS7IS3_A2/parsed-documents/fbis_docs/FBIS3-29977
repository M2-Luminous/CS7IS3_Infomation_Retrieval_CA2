The government would also relax regulations for South Korean businessmen wishing to set up pilot business ventures in North Korea if the nuclear problem was resolved, they said. Seoul is studying a revision of its stance on inter-Korean economic cooperation to allow business contacts "when South-North dialogue makes significant progress." Until now, it had maintained it would allow inter-Korean business contacts only "when a breakthrough in the nuclear issue was found." The new government policy would represent a considerable relaxation on other pre-conditions that call for Pyongyang's return to the Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty, acceptance of the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] ad hoc and special inspections, an inter-Korean agreement on simultaneous inspections of each other's nuclear facilities and reactivation of the South-North joint nuclear commission. In addition, the government plans to relax conditions for South Korean businesses to establish small, pilot ventures in North Korea. Seoul had said it would only approve such ventures after the two Koreas conducted mutual inspections of their nuclear facilities and Pyongyang accepted special inspections by the IAEA. The proposed changes are being contemplated to actively promote economic cooperation with Pyongyang while maintaining Seoul's original policy of linking inter-Korean economic cooperation with the nuclear issue. If the current government policy was maintained, it is possible that inter-Korean economic cooperation would be delayed considerably, one official said. "The government has decided to apply its economic cooperation policy flexibly while watching North Korea's attitude closely," he said, asking for anonymity. The official stressed, however, that the government would not separate the economic and nuclear issues because South Korea was committed to going along with its allies on the nuclear problem. Overall economic cooperation with North Korea could be possible only after suspicions about North Korea's nuclear intentions were cleared up, he added.
