Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the government, has arrived to take part in this conference. He is being accompanied on this working visit by Aleksandr Zaveryukha, a vice premier; Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia Board; and Gennadiy Romanenko, president of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Without anticipating speeches that have already been prepared but have yet to be delivered and a final document that has yet to be adopted, let us note that the conference bears a clearly marked "cardiological" character for Russia for two reasons. First, no matter how the discussion turns out, the utmost attention will be paid to the foundation of the state's life--the agrarian sector. Second, the 17 oblasts located in the river basins and on the watersheds of the Volga, the Don, the Oka, and the upper Dnieper do indeed form Russia's heartland. They account for only around 4.8 percent of the country's territory, but in 1992, for example, they produced 30.5 percent of gross agricultural output. And, of course, the central region is suffering greatly, as is our whole state. The difference of opinion over the definition of the main question on the agenda which preceded the conference--an unexpected fuss for an event at this level--was awkward, however. V. Shuteyev, the head of the Kursk Oblast Administration, described his expectations on the eve of the trip in these terms: "I want Viktor Stepanovich to confirm his recent promise to settle accounts with country people in January for last year's grain harvest." I would like to note that even before that, during the election campaign for the Agrarian Party, Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha spoke in Kursk, where he gave the local agricultural aktiv a cast-iron guarantee that the oblast would receive the money for its grain in the next few days. There was a great rush after those words--the cash-starved leaders of rayons and farms really hammered on the doors of the oblast agricultural administration, fearful that they would be too late for the share-out. But so far there has been no sign of the grain payment--around 21 billion rubles. The miserable transfer of payments between partners on Russia's territory and the lack of credit resources threaten to wreck the spring sowing campaign. There is no money for seed or spares, and 12,000 tonnes of fuel have been stockpiled in Kursk Oblast as against the 182,000 tonnes that are needed. Nor is it clear how the local budget is to provide advances or credit for the purchase of agricultural produce under the new scheme if the local budget does not include sources of finance for that purpose. Furthermore, the long-term questions of the region's development are foundering on the lack of resources. This is what worries V. Shuteyev. Meanwhile Orel was prepared for a fundamentally different debate. In all the documents and studies prepared here the conference's main idea was formulated thus: "A State Program for the Revival of Central Russia." Ye. Stroyev, head of the Orel Oblast administration, puts the argument like this: "We are categorically opposed to an analysis which deals with the present-day and relates to the agrarian sector alone. A narrow departmental approach will produce nothing but disaster again. What is needed is not a departmental or technocratic program, but a multisectoral state program that uses all the historically accumulated potential, both economic and cultural. The oblast leaders' views hardly conflict with one another; some will focus attention on present-day problems, others on the need to take a long-term view. Without sowing our daily bread there will be no long-term progress. But unless we take a long-term view we will, figuratively speaking, sow the wrong thing in the wrong way. I wonder what medicine will be prescribed in Orel for the agrarian sector and for the entire economy of Russia? Will it enable them to cease being a "black hole," swallowing up financial and other resources and giving nothing in return? Much depends, clearly, on whether there is at last a sober and honest assessment of the present-day stage of the reforms. Will it be said clearly that what we actually have achieved in the countryside so far is progress of a psychological nature alone: We have accepted private ownership, but that is all. However, the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has not actually turned the peasant into a landowner. "The reforms have taken the path of the misappropriation of property by the leadership" -- it was Igor Chukhrayev, deputy chief of the Kursk Oblast Agricultural Administration, who let that phrase slip. We shall be hearing similar opinions increasingly often.
