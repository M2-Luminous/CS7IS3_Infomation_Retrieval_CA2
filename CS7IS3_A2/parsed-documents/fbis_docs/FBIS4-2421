Thirty-two people, including 24 Taiwan tourists, were killed. All urged mainland authorities to make public the cause of the incident and measures being taken to cope with the aftermath. They should give the victims' families a clear detailed account rather than making excuses like causes of death unknown. In addition, government spokesman Jason Hu said the government will call a series of international press conferences to recount the inhuman treatment the Taiwan visitors suffered in the Qiandao Lake incident.
