Palestinian and Israeli officials reached the decision over the telephone on Thursday morning, Sha'th told AFP. The two sides had agreed to reconvene on Sunday after adjourning autonomy talks on Wednesday. They will meet Friday on the Moslem traditional day of rest. Sha'th had criticized Israeli negotiators for heading home to observe a Holocaust remembrance day on Thursday, and said it would be difficult now to finalize an accord on launching autonomy by an April 13 deadline. Under the September accord the two signed in Washington, Israel was to have begun withdrawing its troops from Gaza and Jericho on December 13 and completed the move by April 13. The first deadline was missed, but PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat insisted in Jordan on Wednesday that the withdrawal take place in a week's time.
