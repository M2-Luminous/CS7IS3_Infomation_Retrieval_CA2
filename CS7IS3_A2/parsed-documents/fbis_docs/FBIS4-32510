A statement by General Rasim Delic, head of the Muslim army, calling on his soldiers to leave trenches and launch an offensive to liberate the country was like adding fuel to the fire. Here is a commentary by our journalist Ivica Tomic: The Bosnia-Herzegovina army has in these 10 or 15 days of truce made large steps in liberating the Vlasic plateau, Gen. Delic, the chief of the general staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army, has told VECERNJI LIST. This statement by Delic and some other of his statements make it clear that an all-out war is being prepared and that signatures on truce agreements do not have any meaning any more, since the general openly admits that his army has made biggest advances during the truce period. The justification for this lies, of course, in Serb attacks in some other areas. While not disputing the right of the Muslims to regain with weapons what the Serbs had taken from them in the same way we still cannot be indifferent to the escalation of the war, since we are all living in the same state and the war cannot leave us unaffected. The Croats of Herceg-Bosna were the first to take up arms and show everyone that they were ready to defend their own territory, but never in this war have they launched conquest operations. It is clear now more than ever before that opting to defend was the correct decision. We can see now that it was much easier to defend one's home than have to fight to regain territory given up without fighting. The chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at its latest session called on the belligerent parties in western Bosnia to sit at the negotiating table and put an end to senseless killing. Croats of Herceg-Bosna are for a just peace with the aggressor's, Serb side. The Serbs must--if not in any other way then under pressure from the great powers--accept the peace solution under which they keep as much as 49 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory--more than belongs to them. The Muslims must also relax their position and give something for peace. It is obvious that the great powers do not accept the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, therefore they do not want the war to continue. It is indeed absurd to wage the war without the blessing of Clinton and the allies, except--of course--in obvious self-defense. We have never been closer to peace, but also to an all-out war. Croats are for peace. Let us hope that Muslim and Serb politicians are also for peace, and generals should in any case not be in charge of politics. Generals [words indistinct]. This is why Delic and Mladic should before the show-down ask their soldiers whether they are still prepared to get killed.
