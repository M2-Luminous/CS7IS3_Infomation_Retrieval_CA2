The advent of the blessed night of the Koran's revelation, a night better than a thousand months, represents an opportunity for the Muslim to purify his soul and educate his spirit, lifting it, via his supplications and prayers to God, from the swamp of materialism to the realm of light and meaning. It is a success that I wish you will all have, brothers and sisters. All vicious hands are seeking to drag humanity toward corruption and materialism. The Muslims must guard themselves against being dragged into this overwhelming flood through piety and seeking God's protection. They must erect the Islamic nation's structure on a solid foundation of souls strengthened by the repetition of God's name and a will reassured of the fulfillment of the divine promise, especially as we mark the martyrdom anniversary of the lord of the pious and prince of the faithful 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib, may God's peace be with him. Let us therefore turn this great man's saga into a beacon lighting our way. The basic issue in our Islamic world today is the painful, bloody incident at the venerated Ibrahimi Mosque where fasting worshippers were massacred en masse by the hand of international Zionism. The massacre cloaked this month of fasting with the garb of sorrow and overwhelmed Muslim hearts with anguish and distress. The media of global arrogance and their stooges are strenuously and cunningly seeking to impose a blackout on this news and downplay its heinous character. But its grave implications are clear to everyone who has an enlightened heart. I find it necessary to present the following points to our brothers and sisters: First, those who perpetrated this incident are not a small group. No, everything indicates that the incident occurred after careful planning, preparation, and support from those who usurped Palestine. The Israeli Government is the criminal and its accomplices are those who have been giving it backing, thus encouraging it to dare to carry out this act. The unconditional U.S. backing for Israel, particularly at the recent humiliating negotiations, provided a safe climate for the Israeli Government to perpetrate this crime. The other accomplices are all those writers, politicians, and media personnel who beat the drums and did their utmost to undermine the Islamic ranks who are struggling against usurper Zionism and to transform the conflict into a conflict between two wings of our nation. They did this in line with U.S.-Israeli wishes. Second, this incident marks the beginning of a new stage in the progress of Zionist policy. It will not be the last incident; the Zionists are still pursuing the policy they adopted soon after the occupation, which aims to produce stifling and insecure conditions for the Muslims. On the threshold of this unjust solution to the cause, they seek to prevent something called the Palestinian people from continuing to exist in the usurped territories. They have succeeded in turning the Palestinian people into a minority on their land. They are seeking to weaken them more and terrify their ranks so that the Palestinian cause can be handed over to oblivion and loss. It is the usurpers' beautiful dream and naive imagination. This incident is proof of their self-deceiving imagination. Third, this incident teaches all the Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims the lesson that the usurpers of Palestine are continuing their policy of assassination, terror, and deception. Polite talk with them, compromise, and so-called peaceful solutions will be to no avail. Had this incident occurred during the armed fedayeen struggle carried out by Palestinian groups, it could have been described as a retaliation. But its occurrence, after those individuals who profess to be Palestinians signed, with dirty and trembling hand, a document selling off Palestine, demonstrates the inveterately hostile, uncompromising, and usurping nature of Zionism. Fourth, the zealous and heroic Palestinian people must, as a consequence, decide their own future and not leave it for the enemy to decide. The United States, Israel, and the corrupt regimes who are U.S. puppets will not adopt a humanitarian decision that honors the Palestinians. Those who opted for negotiations think only of keeping their seats of power for a few more days. They are heedless of the people who are wronged and oppressed in their own country. Their youths are killed, their women dishonored, their homes turned into graves, and their mosques, worship, and prayers are transformed into massacres. The Palestinians are Muslims and must therefore draw inspiration from their great Koran, which says: "And why should ye not fight in the cause of God and the cause of those who, being weak, are ill-treated and oppressed, men, women and children." [Koranic verse] The Koran also describes the enemies of God: "In a believer they respect not the ties of kinship or of covenant. It is they who have transgressed all bounds." [Koranic verse] Jihad is a difficult endeavor that needs endurance but it pleases God almighty, shatters the chains of bondage and humiliation, and guarantees an ideal future. Palestine has no security even in its own territory. Its life without struggle is not easier than a life of struggle. No right is greater than God's words: "And if any strive, they do so for their own souls, for God is free of all needs from all creation." [Koranic verse] I ask the exalted to bestow enlightenment and vigilance on the Islamic nations so that they can fulfill their duty to the Palestinian cause, especially as this issue has become more bitter and more afflicted. International Jerusalem Day next week is drawing near. It is the arena in which the will of the Muslim masses becomes evident and is an opportunity that expresses Islamic maturity. Let us all appreciate this opportunity and raise our voices on that day in the face of the usurpers of Palestine and all those who back them. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. "When comes the help of God, and victory, and thou dost see the people enter God's religion in crowds, celebrate the praises of thy Lord and pray for his forgiveness, for he is oft-returning in grace and mercy." [Koranic verse]
