The group of masked men, brandishing sticks and stones, positioned themselves at the Ministry gates and prevented people who were paying their taxes and making other transactions in the morning of 16 March from exiting. Castillo Figueroa and a group of bullies entered the facilities in search of Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera to demand an increase in the the National University allotment, but Sagrera was not in his office at the time. The criminals said that they would stay in the area holding employees and private citizens hostage until the minister returned to discuss the problem. Many women feared that something serious was going to happen and fled through a small fence, leaving their purses and other possessions on the premises. National Police riot officers moved to the site in order to protect public property. The police presence prompted the masked men to draw the weapons they had been hiding and begin provoking the officers, who were staying several meters away. Several vehicles belonging to UN Observers for El Salvador members were parked at the main entrance as though to protect the masked men, who refused to let the employees and private citizens leave. Castillo Figueroa told the officers: "There will not be any problems, we have control over the youths." Moments later the riot police left the site, and the masked men remained inside the building.
