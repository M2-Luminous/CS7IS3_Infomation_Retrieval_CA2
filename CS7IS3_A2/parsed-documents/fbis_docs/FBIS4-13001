At first glance, it appears that due to laxity on the part of the navigation facilities in the region, especially the Yerevan facility, and the lack of serious and responsible support for the aircraft resulted in it deviating from its course into the war zone, where it ultimately was downed by the Armenians. In any case, Armenia is responsible for this incident because the Georgian air control facility reported that it had safely guided the aircraft into Armenian airspace, so whatever occurred thereafter was the responsibility of Armenia as the host country. There are certain other clues that point to a second possibility--that is, that the downing of the plane was not an accident but a preplanned plot. If this hypothesis is assumed to be correct, we have to consider who stood to gain from such an incident. It appears that the Armenians do not stand to gain, for this would only result in straining relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and generate mistrust between the two neighbors. Therefore, such an act would not seem to be to Armenia's benefit. On the other hand, even though Azerbaijan stands to benefit from any worsening of relations between Iran and Armenia, in this particular case it could not have been able to interfere as the air corridors are designated by Russia, Georgia, Iran, and Armenia. However, for quite some time Russia has considered this area its domain; and now that these countries have gained independence Russia's interests lie in the continuation of a state of instability and insecurity in the region so that it can use this as a pretext to justify the presence of its forces. On the other hand, it is possible the Russians refuse to remain passive while there is a growing trend of friendship and trust between Iran and regional countries such as Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, especially since at the same time these countries' displeasure with Russia is growing. Perhaps it is within the framework of these factors that we should view the growing unrest in that region and the fomenting of crises in order to erode the trust between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the rest of the region. If we view the downing of the Iranian cargo airplane from this angle, there is much evidence to bolster this theory. First of all, news reports cite Moscow airport as saying that the flight route of the Iranian aircraft was suspicious, passing in the vicinity of the war zone--that is, the corridor [preceding word in English] over Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Iran. The other corridor, which is the safe one and the one normally used--passing over Russia, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian Sea--goes over Baku and the Caspian Sea and is far away from the war zone. If an airplane were to develop the slightest technical problem while transiting the Georgia-Armenia corridor it would stray into the dangerous war zone of Nagorno-Karabakh. Proof of this is that when this happened to some airplanes earlier, Russia and Yerevan were able to inform the commander of the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh immediately and thus forestall the downing of those aircraft. In this particular case, the navigation facility did not act as responsibly as before and simply let the aircraft remain in this dangerous zone. The other proof, which is stronger than all the other evidence, is that less than 24 hours after the incident the Russians presented a detailed report by their military experts on the downing, which was carried by ITAR-TASS. This report attempted to disseminate for the first time at the regional and international levels a false and baseless rumor that the Iranian aircraft was on an espionage mission over Nagorno-Karabakh. From the technical and practical point of view, this rumor is quite ridiculous, as the Iranian aircraft was only carrying family members of high-level Iranian diplomats and of some military personnel. It had remained on the ground in Moscow for three days prior to the flight and was directed toward Armenia by Moscow. What is interesting is that the pilot requested permission for an emergency landing at an Armenian airport. How could an airplane that had remained on the ground in Moscow for three days and later requested permission to land at an Armenian airport be on an espionage assignment against Armenians? Therefore, this preliminary report confirms the spuriousness of this rumor disseminated by the Russians. In view of the extensive bureaucracy [preceding word in English] that we know characterizes the Russian system, how did the Russians obtain an expert analysis of the issue and manage to fabricate a rumor and even disseminate it so quickly by means of the ITAR-TASS news agency at the regional and international levels? All this points a premeditated plan with the specific objective of undermining trust and generating an atmosphere of suspicion in the region. It is also possible that this detailed report by ITAR-TASS had been prepared earlier. Thus, on the basis of the information gleaned, the relevant high-level Iranian officials have contacted the Russian authorities to protest such troublemaking and ask them to deny the rumor publicly. The Russians expressed regret at the dissemination of this false rumor at the meeting, but not only did they not take any steps to issue a public denial, they even attempted to play up the issue in various ways in the Russian newspapers. Just yesterday [30 March] another Russian newspaper fanned this rumor once again. Therefore, the speed with which the rumor was concocted and disseminated and the Russian officials' insistence on spreading the rumor confirms the scenario of a there being a premeditated plot with regard to this painful incident. The above points should be taken seriously into account. Armenia must be vigilant, and regardless of whether it was a premeditated plot against the Armenian regime or the result of carelessness on the part of the Armenian system in general the Armenian government should decide independently as a reliable neighbor to take responsibility for the incident. In a sincere and farsighted manner, it should try to pacify this great neighboring nation [of Iran] and should strive to restore and consolidate once again the mutual trust between our two nations. Otherwise, this incident will continue to fester painfully like a sharp bone protruding from a wound, and will prove costly for Armenia, all because of its irresponsible neighbor [Russia).
