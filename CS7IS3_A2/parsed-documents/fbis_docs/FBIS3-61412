I. Logvis and N. N. Krot; UDC 546.7993] [Abstract] Neptunium sols are important for the preparation of neptunium dioxide microspheres, although information on Np(IV) sol preparation in the published literature is sparse. It has been demonstrated that heating a solution of neptunium (IV) hydroxide in excess nitric acid results in 70 percent conversion of neptunium to the colloidal state, depending on the temperature and acidity. Also, preparation of uranium (IV) sols by oxidation- peptization has been well established, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that neptunium (IV) sols may be prepared by an analogous method. In the present work neptunium (IV) hydroxide was prepared by treating neptunium (IV) oxalate with ammonia. The hydroxide had minimum oxalate ion content and Np (V) impurity. It was then peptized with hydrochloric, nitric, and acetic acids to yield Np (IV) sols in 2-2.5 mole/liter concentrations and not over 4 percent Np (V) content. Absorption spectra are presented.
