Soskovets regards the petroleum and gas industry as one of the most promising areas of Russo-Turkish cooperation. He moved to set up an international consortium for building a pipeline between Russia and Turkey with the participation of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. He said that Russia had efficient technologies for the production of pipes and could help train highly skilled specialists. Taking into account Russia's rich experience in power engineering, Soskovets offered the Turkish side to build a new atomic power plant in Turkey. "Russian nuclear power plants have dependable safety systems," he said. "Moreover, they are much cheaper than the world prices". Kumbaracibasi went on record for the construction of a new pipeline for transporting petroleum from the former USSR to Turkey. He said this would partially help solve the problem of the passage of tankers through the Bosphorus. Russian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, who took part in the talks, drew the Turkish delegation's attention to the "prospects of cooperation in marketing Russian special technologies". He said a 95 million U.S. dollars contract had already been concluded. "This will help Russia settle its debt to Turkey in the Paris Club within three years," he stressed.
