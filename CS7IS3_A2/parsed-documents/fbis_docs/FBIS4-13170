The paper was drafted in parallel with similar work done by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the Foreign Ministry. The plan, drafted at the initiative of that body's research department, assumes that, in the framework of the agreement, there will be a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and that the negotiations with Syria will focus on security arrangements and stages of normalization and withdrawal. The authors of the document propose a staged withdrawal over a period of more than 10 years, during which the IDF will maintain its military presence on the Golan. They believe that future peace relations between Israel and Syria will be similar to those existing between Israel and Egypt -- perhaps even cooler. The team that drafted the document on the arrangement with Syria prepared a proposal four months ago on an arrangement with the Palestinians. That paper determined that the preferable solution for Israel is the establishment of a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation. Of the three staff works prepared in anticipation of the resumption of the negotiations with Syria, only the one prepared by Major General Ilan Biran was done by order of the prime minister and followed his guidance regarding the principles of the arrangement. Biran's paper speaks of a withdrawal on the Golan Heights, but not a full one. The Foreign Ministry and the state body, which assumed that a full withdrawal will be carried out, based their work on their own assumptions. [passage omitted] As U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the Middle East approaches, Israeli sources in Washington have reported that Israel will not relay detailed plans on peace arrangements and a withdrawal to Syria through the United States. The prime minister will again ask the secretary of state to propose to Syria to begin a practical discussion of the security arrangements, but it is not clear whether al-Asad will accept this proposal and waive his demand that Israel pledge a full withdrawal in advance.
