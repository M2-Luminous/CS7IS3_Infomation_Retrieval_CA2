FR940616-0-00124 FR940616-0-00013 Discussion : Applications for loan forgiveness should be directed to the Secretary. Change : None. Comment : Some commenters felt that there should be a provision whereby a borrower who qualified for forgiveness one year but did not receive it due to limited funding should be first to be considered for forgiveness the following year. The commenters also wanted to know if a borrower who qualified and received the forgiveness one year would be automatically eligible for the following year's forgiveness. Discussion : This approach was discussed at the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The Secretary believes that given the limited amount of funding, there is no statutory basis to allow eligible applicants from one year to automatically qualify for the next year. Similarly, borrowers who were denied forgiveness due to lack of funding one year will not be given priority over the next year's applicants. Borrowers are required to reapply for each year for which they wish to receive the forgiveness benefit. Change : None. Comment : Some commenters wanted to know how to treat a borrower's incomplete forgiveness application. The commenters asked whether a borrower should be disqualified, or if allowed to provide the missing information, how much time should a borrower have to submit the information. They also wanted to know if the borrower's first-come, first-served status would be affected by submitting an incomplete application. Discussion : An incomplete or inaccurate application will not qualify a borrower for receiving loan forgiveness. However, the Secretary will attempt to notify the borrowers who submit inaccurate or incomplete applications so that they will have an opportunity to complete and submit a complete application by the October 1 deadline. Change : None. Comment : A number of commenters expressed confusion over the treatment of borrowers with regard to forbearance. Some commenters questioned whether forbearance for eligible borrowers under the forgiveness program was necessary or administratively feasible. Discussion : The Secretary reminds the commenters that all borrowers who request forbearance while they are serving in areas that would qualify for forgiveness are entitled to forbearance as stated in section 428J. The ability to obtain forbearance is based on the borrower's being engaged in qualifying service and is not dependent on whether the borrower actually receives the loan forgiveness. Change : None. Comment : Some commenters asked when a borrower could request forbearance since the borrower does not apply for forgiveness until after the year of service has been completed. The commenters questioned whether forbearance would be granted retroactively at the time the borrower applied for forgiveness or if the lender or servicer would be expected to grant forbearance to a borrower the year prior to application while the borrower was serving in an eligible position. The commenters felt that the wording of the NPRM regarding forbearance may be confusing for a borrower who may think that payments do not have to be made during the period of service. The commenters also wished to know if the forbearance applied only to the loans eligible for forgiveness or on all loans. Discussion : The Secretary wishes to emphasize that the holder or servicer is to grant forbearance to a borrower upon the borrower's request while the borrower is serving in one of the categories of service eligible for forgiveness under ยง682.215. A borrower shall receive forbearance while serving regardless of whether sufficient funding is available for forgiveness at the end of that year of service. The forbearance will apply to all loans held by the borrower that would normally be entitled to forbearance. A borrower who is not in an authorized deferment or forbearance status while serving is expected to follow the terms of the promissory note regarding repayment. Change : None. Comment : Some commenters recommended that all borrowers in qualifying service that wish to apply for forbearance be given explicit instruction as to the terms of the forbearance and the fact that receiving forbearance for service under ยง682.215 was not related to receiving loan forgiveness for performing qualifying service. The commenters were concerned that a borrower would be incurring additional costs with a forbearance with the potential of not receiving the loan forgiveness benefit for performing qualifying service. Discussion : The Secretary shares the concerns of the commenters and expects holders to provide information on the option of forbearance under this program as is required under the FFEL programs. The holders will inform borrowers that funding, if available for this program, is limited and that receiving a forbearance during qualifying service does not guarantee loan forgiveness under this program and as such may result in additional costs to the borrower. Change : None. Section 682.215 (e), (f), and (g) Comment : Some commenters asked that the Secretary clarify that a borrower must apply for forgiveness each year following the year of qualifying service in the teaching, volunteer and nursing categories.
