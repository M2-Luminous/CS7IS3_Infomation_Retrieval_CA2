In a letter to the chairman of the Paris Club May 24, Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin agreed on behalf of Russia to hold the talks on rescheduling Russian foreign debt in Paris on June 2-3. The minister told a press conference the same day that Moscow was prepared to pay 4.1 billion dollars (the sum set aside by the draft federal budget) in 1994 towards servicing the debt. Shokhin stressed that Russia was concerned above all about the servicing of the Russian debt (which accounted for around 10 pct of the 80 billion dollar debt). He said that the "creditors of the former USSR had to view the situation realistically and be patient for the time being." Shokhin stressed that the repayment of the debts to members of the Paris Club depended largely on the position of Italy. Moscow and Rome, he said, had not yet been able to agree the terms for repaying Italian loans from 1993. As far as the London Club (which incorporates western banks to which Russia owes money), Shokhin said that talks were continuing. However, he admitted that no firm decisions had yet been made regarding that part of the foreign debt. President Yeltsin's senior economic adviser Alexander Livshitz has reported that the first package of 6 presidential economic decrees issued on May 23 may be extended to other documents. Speaking at an economic reform congress in Moscow on Tuesday, he suggested that new decrees may touch upon foreign investment, social security, and bankruptcy legislation. By some evidence, up to 30 such presidential decrees are to be issued by the end of this year. At the same time, Lifshitz voiced confidence that for furthering economic reforms, such documents should be worked out in a civilized way through the Duma and other representative bodies. "The presidential administration hopes that next steps to adopt necessary economic laws will be taken by Duma members themselves," Livshitz said.
