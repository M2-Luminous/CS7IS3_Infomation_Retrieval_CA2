These films are prepared on substrates of flexible Kapton, Mylar and FEP Teflon by magnetron sputtering. Tests indicate that their stabilities under various conditions are quite good. The conductivity of the antistatic films in the simulated substorm environment is also measured. The results show that the modified flexible SSM can eliminate the charge accumulation on their surfaces and control the surface voltage below 80 Volts. On the contrary, the potential on the uncoated SSM surface can have a value up to 8-10 kV.
