It was attended by concerned government and private representatives of three countries; Japan, the United States, and Russia. During discussions, which were held for two days, the United States and Russia proposed that joint military exercises among Japan, the United States, and Russia in north Pacific regions be carried out. Japan disapproved the proposal, citing, among other things, that: 1) the forum's purpose is not to counteract other nations except the three countries; and 2) there are things needed to be done first, including fostering trust. At the forum, the participants agreed that it is definitely important for Russian reform efforts to take root for stability in the region.
