In response to a question by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency, Zlenko said that "all signatories of the statement on nuclear disarmament of Ukraine should fulfil their obligations." Earlier this week Ukrainian leaders stated that Ukraine may suspend the withdrawal of warheads unless Russia starts transportation of nuclear fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power stations. "We are entitled to issue a statement and take corresponding measures in order to fulfil obligations assumed under the trilateral statement," Zlenko said. Asked about the U.S. role in the fulfillment of obligations under the statement, Zlenko said: "We are talking about equal partnership. Each side should assume equal obligations."
