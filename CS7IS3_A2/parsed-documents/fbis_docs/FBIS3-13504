The delegation will be headed by Ibrahim Nimr Husayn and Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Syrian foreign minister approved the delegation's arrival; however, the delegation preferred to put off its departure to Damascus in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Our correspondent's inquiries revealed that immediately after Basil al-Asad's death was reported in the media, Dr. al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, sent a letter to Nayif Hawatimah in Damascus requesting permission to send a delegation to offer condolences on behalf of the Galilee Arabs. Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi also specified the names of the proposed members of the delegation.
