The double occupation by the former servicemen and former Nicaraguan resistance members, aimed at demanding the distribution of land for the building of homes and other assistance, prompted the police to assume positions near the scene of the events. The police arrested nearly 10 people who participated in the brief occupation of the Managua Cathedral. The police are searching the area near the cathedral, which is located near Managua's heavily used eastern highway. Deputy Commander Pedro Aguilar, head of the Public Security Police, told reporters the deployment of troops had been carried out in order to guarantee "security." Other police officers stated they were awaiting orders and had not breached the embassy grounds where the retired former servicemen are. At least six Venezuelan diplomats are reportedly still inside the diplomatic mission. It is possible Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant could be negotiating, given he is aware of the demands being made by the former servicemen, who claim they belong to the Movement for a Just and Honorable Compensation [Movimiento Pro Indemnizacion Digna y Justa]. This group contends that for the past years it has been demanding retirement benefits from the Chamorro government.
