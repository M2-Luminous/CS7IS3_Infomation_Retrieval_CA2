Dmitri Ryurikov, the presidential aide, in an interview with BNS said similar "provocations" had taken place on several occasions and that such action "would hardly contribute to progress in the negotiations" between the two countries. Referring to an incident last month in Latvia, when a regional leader ordered two Russian generals detained and sent out of the country, Ryurikov called the sequence of events a "rather coordinated policy" of the Baltic countries. He said the events were viewed by Russia as "regrettable." In his words Russia, having done "quite a lot" for the Baltics becoming sovereign and independent countries, "has the right to count on a definitely different attitude." "Russia hopes that no such episodes will occur in the future," he said. Ryurikov said there was going to be no reaction to the incident from President Yeltsin. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday delivered a protest to Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn. "It is difficult to say how much effect such protests will have on the hotheads, on extremists, but one would like to trust that the authorities will implement measures to protect the Russian military units," the presidential aide said.
