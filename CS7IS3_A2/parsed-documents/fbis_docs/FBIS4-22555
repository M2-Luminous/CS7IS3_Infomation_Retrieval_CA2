Sorochynskyy; place and date not given: "If We Continue Living As We Are Now, We Will Not Survive Even for A Year"] [Text] As long as I can remember we have always spoken about the equality of village and city. But that slogan, just as another one, equally popular in bygone times: overtake and surpass America, remained merely a slogan. We never overtook America and the city and village is a misalliance just as before. That difference has become particularly perceptible today when all the painful sides of our life showed up as if on a piece of litmus paper. The village appears to be particularly unequal compared to the city at the present time. Even though, to be truthful, the latter is also experiencing difficult times. Enough about facts, however. As they say, whoever does not want to work is seeking a reason, whereas those who want work seek a possibility. Many economists in Ukraine and abroad formed an opinion of Anatoliy Holubchenko, the minister of industry, as a politician and a member of the government who is looking for ways to resolve the crisis in a branch that recently made-up 38 percent of the total industrial potential of the former USSR and currently finds itself in a very difficult position. At the same time the level of development of industry in many ways determines how fast and how successfully our agriculture can get up off its knees, how it will occupy an equal place next to industry and gradually, step by step, transform Ukraine into a powerful agroindustrial European nation. Today's conversation of journalist Nikolay Sorochynskyy with Anatoliy Holubchenko deals with the possibilities of an equal partnership between the village and the city, agriculture and industry. [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, no matter how much we talk about price parity, one thing is indisputable: today's prices for industrial products are much higher than those for agricultural products. How is it possible to achieve the desired parity? [Holubchenko] Speaking about parity, according to data of the Agroindustrial Bank, in 1993 prices for agricultural products rose by a factor of 36, while material resources utilized in the production of those goods increased by a factor of 92. That is, prices for agricultural products lagged behind by a factor of 2.5. That is felt in everything and a logical conclusion comes to mind: presently it is necessary to take steps in order to bring prices for agricultural products and for material resources into correspondence. If we have firmly decided that it is necessary to preserve prices for agricultural products, we must also firmly decide that they must be subsidized. For example, if a kilogram of meat costs 10 dollars on the world market, meat should cost the equivalent in our case as well. But it turns out that our meat combines receive meat at 15,000 karbovantsy per kilogram while at the exchange rate of 12,600 karbovantsy to the dollar, meat should cost 126,000 karbovantsy. The same applies to milk, bread, etc. In the world there are certain proportions in the exchange of goods. In essence, those proportions determine the monetary equivalent. In our case, however, the proportions have been violated and definitely not in favor of the village. That is why it is now so difficult for the kolkhozes: there is nothing to spend on mineral fertilizers, construction has been practically halted, and many facilities in the social sphere are in a decrepit condition. People are not going to visit the club I saw, for example, in Mikhaylovka of Chernigov Rayon in Zaporozhye, where the temperature indoors is lower than out on the street. I believe that the policy of the state with regard to the countryside is simply unfair. [Sorochynskyy] What is your attitude toward kolkhozes as a form of collective management in the countryside? [Holubchenko] As indicated by data 80 percent of the people today favor the collective form of management--kolkhozes and sovkhozes. But it is necessary to understand something else as well: private farming should not be rejected. We must combine all forms. Each one of them shall find its place and will survive. To change something unequivocally today is unrealistic and should never be done. Therefore it is necessary to build a basis on something that the people are accustomed to and what they want, while for innovations it is important to create conditions for normal existence, while supporting legislation not with words alone but through action. [Sorochynskyy] The industrial branch has always been closely linked with agriculture: plants produced equipment for the countryside, along with mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides and herbicides, etc. These are difficult times, however, not just for agriculture but for industry as well. Where do orders for the countryside stand in industrial plans? [Holubchenko] For as long as I have worked in industry in executive positions--from deputy foreman to minister, we have always flagged agriculture. That flag was always red. At all times. Meaning that it had to be prioritized. Regardless of the level of production, 100 percent fulfillment of orders for the village. I feel that way especially strongly today. After all, branches of the Ministry of Industry are inseparably linked with the village. For instance, metal is needed for the production of machines which we provide and we also know precisely that such metal is needed specifically for agricultural machinery. Its shape and amount for each machine is indicated for every plant. We also produce all rubber parts for agricultural machinery. All types of fertilizers are made by us as well. We conduct joint consultations with agricultural workers along with monthly conferences on the fulfillment of orders coming from the countryside at the Ministry of Industry: for tires, fertilizers, and herbicides. In other words with regard to everything that must today be delivered for the countryside, and we deliver it. In March, for instance, the branch headed by me produced planned mineral fertilizers on schedule worth some 500 billion karbovantsy. At the end of March fulfillment of the April assignment was started. I believe that the countryside must receive priority attention and, as in former times, perhaps to someone's dislike, red flagged. That is, orders for agriculture must be filled with any level of production that exists. It is necessary not to reject what was good before even if it was in a system which does not appeal to all right now in part because of the priority of the countryside. [Sorochynskyy] The harvest is now under way. It is for good reason that the people say you will reap what you sow. You have just returned from the agricultural regions of Zaporozhye. What are your predictions? Will Ukraine have bread this year? Are we threatened by famine? [Holubchenko] I met many grain growers, cattle farmers, heads of sovkhozes, and deputies of rural soviets and must say that with all of the complications they are facing, with the problems and their standard of living, the attitude they have toward labor and the way in which they understand that they are feeding all of the people--we will have no famine. That is unquestionable. These people, I would say, perform feats every day. But they do not elevate this to the level of a feat. They understand the work that must be done as normal daily tasks. They arise at four in the morning and race to milk the cows, then return home in order to milk their own cows and feed the livestock. Then they hasten back to work. They are also training their children to handle this work. [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, I know that you yourself also come from a labor dynasty. [Holubchenko] Yes, I come from a dynasty of metallurgists. In his younger years my father worked as steel-maker's apprentice in an open-hearth shop of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine, and after the war he worked as a brigade leader in a rolling-mill department until he retired on pension. Except for one brother who is a doctor, two of my sisters and another brother have also worked and are now working at industrial enterprises. I myself began work as an apprentice roller in a rolling-mill department of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine. I am particularly proud of the fact that our dynasty continues: my eldest son is graduating from the Zaporozhye Industrial Institute, while my daughter-in-law works at Zaporozhstal. It is good when your children select the occupation of the father. That means you did not make a mistake in selecting a correct path. It would be better if the efforts of those who are constantly attempting to frighten us with the prospects of famine could be directed at something else: creation of improved working conditions in the countryside, achievement of an upturn in industry, the resolution of domestic and external problems of the country, and at making certain that we finally stop complaining about all kinds of difficulties and start working. [Sorochynskyy] The question of Ukraine joining the economic union of CIS countries with the rights of a full and not an associate member, has come up once again. It was a topic of discussion at the latest session of the Cabinet of Ministers as well. What are your views regarding the economic union? [Holubchenko] We will come to that anyway. We are not ready yet, but we will be. A majority in east Ukraine favors full membership in the economic union of CIS countries. In west Ukraine, however, there are other opinions. It would be good to find a golden center such as a sensible compromise in that sphere. We have no other way out. CIS countries are our principal markets. Another 10 - 15 years will be required at the very least for structural reorganization and integration. But if we continue living as we are now we will not survive even for a year. It is already clear where we are headed. It is necessary to simply understand the objective realities and not depict wishes as actuality as this will result in a fiasco in addition to harming others. Therefore the question as to whether to join the economic union must be studied intelligently. No one, however, will be able to simply walk away from that problem. No matter what kind of parliament and government there are, and no matter how much we elevate this issue--higher of lower, we will still have to resolve that question.
