[passage omitted] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political Bureau, has told AL-HAYAH that meetings will be held in a few days between officials of the new state and the Egyptian Government. He pointed out that an envoy from Aden will tomorrow submit a request to join the Arab League. Al-Dali said: "'Ali Salim al-Bid and the Yemeni people in the south are most appreciative of President Husni Mubarak's position on the Yemeni crisis," describing it as a "courageous position." Last week Mubarak held Yemeni President 'Ali Salih responsible for the continuation of the fighting and urged him to observe an unconditional cease-fire and to initiate a dialogue. He also described the northern forces' presence in the south as "occupation." Al-Dali added: "Al-Bid would not have barked on the secession step without consulting with a number of Arab leaders. He did not name them. He interpreted the Arab silence about the the question of recognizing the state as "positive and aimed at studying the situation." He expressed his belief that "Arab recognition will take place within days." He noted that "President Mubarak, United Arab Emirates President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, and most Arab states stressed that the continuation of the war means destroying unity."
