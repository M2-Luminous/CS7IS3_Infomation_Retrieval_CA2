Leaving aside the frills of expanding bilateral links, various possible fields of investment in Albania, and promises by our friends (that in fact have remained only on paper), the dialogue has always been focused on the problem of Kosova and its future, which is our nation's number one problem. This problem has become more acute in view of the close prospect of a solution to the Bosnian-Serbian conflict and the creation of a Bosnian-Croat Federation. In this respect, there is a lot of talk about the danger of the war spreading toward southern Serbia, into Kosova and beyond. Warnings and predictions that such an extension of the conflict would involve several Balkan countries come from various quarters. In order to avoid a new Balkan war, almost all European and Balkan diplomatic circles, in conjunction with the United States, are insisting that the Albanian issue be sacrificed. Calls of alarm and intimidation are heard by the Albanians from all sides: "Be careful! Keep calm, control yourselves, and be wise enough not to anger Serbia. We are ready to help you in everything, provided you give up the idea of a 'Kosova Republic' or 'an independent and neutral state of Kosova.' Hold on and be patient, just be patient" (meaning "submit, submit, always submit"). Our diplomacy seems to be greatly committed to the solution of the Kosova issue and the problem of all the other Albanians living outside their motherland. As already mentioned above, there is a lot of talk going on, interviews given, and articles written. However, what will be the ultimate outcome of it all? President Berisha's diplomatic mission in March 1994 to London -- a traditionally anti-Albanian capital as far as the Kosova problem, and therefore the Albanian problem, are concerned -- was evidence of our national policy succumbing to the request, or rather the European and U.S. decision, that Albania be compelled to accept "enlarged autonomy" for Kosova under the former Yugoslavia. Even that kind of autonomy -- and one never knows what is actually meant by the term "enlarged" -- could be achieved only if Serbia were to accept it. President Rugova's line for Kosova to be "an independent, neutral state under UN control" still hangs in the air. London, for the third time this century, has buried our hopes of liberating Kosova from the Serbian-Slav yoke. The Albanians' policy of peace and restraint in the face of the barbarous Serbian repression, a policy that was highly commended on both sides of the Atlantic, resulted almost in suicide. International diplomacy again left the Albanians in the lurch with an extremely bitter taste of frustration and disappointment, but this time the reasons for it included also our political naivete, tribal ego-tripping, and national disunity. Leaving the British capital with a feeling of legitimate anger and admirable energy, our president found himself two days later in Turkey, where he was received with the highest honors. It is clear that all this haste had nothing to do with either the signing of an agreement, the lifting of reciprocal taxes, the smooth payment of the debt we owe Turkey, or boosting Turkish investment in Albania. His main concern was again the Kosova issue, where he hoped that the failure suffered in London would in some way or another be compensated by support offered to us by our traditional friend. From what we could learn from the interview given by Turkish President Demirel to Albanian Television journalist Reis Cico about the stand that Turkey would take if the Serbs spread the conflict toward Kosova, the Turkish leader replied that "we will assist Kosova and Albania" -- a declaration of particular importance. However, that declaration did not speak of any support for the Kosova people's desire for self-determination, and far less did it mention any Turkish acceptance of Kosova as an independent, neutral state being an option. Why then did Mr. Cico not ask the Turkish president this question, which constitutes the Albanians' fundamental national problem? It is not difficult to understand the reason for such "carelessness." We think, as far as this problem is concerned, that it is because our president's visit to Ankara had extremely bitter results. It seems our Islamic ally is much more interested in reviving its ancient influence on our troubled peninsula, solving the Serbian-Bosnian conflict, and creating an independent Bosnian state, than in creating a neutral state of Kosova, independent of Serbia. At the same time, Demirel's fatherland cannot opt out of implementing the other NATO countries' policy. Its aid toward Albania also has to be within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. It could raise certain objections to the EC sluggishness over the Balkan crisis, but not to the sluggishness over the Albanian-Serb issue. Moreover, one must not forget the strained Greek-Turkish relations over the Cyprus affair, and Turkey's desire to play a prominent role in the Black Sea countries' cooperation project. The conclusion is that the Turkish rejection of our option for Kosova was yet another failure of our diplomacy following the one in London. On his return to Albania, President Berisha on 8 April met with another top dignitary, a Western one -- the commander-in-chief of NATO troops in Europe, U.S. Army General George Joulwan. During the talks, our president assured the general that Albania would fulfill all her obligations stemming from the Partnership for Peace agreement with the utmost readiness and devotion. It became clear from those talks (as far as we could learn from the television) that our President Berisha was mainly asking NATO to guarantee Albania's independence against any possible Serbian-Montenegrin aggression. Yet the Kosova problem was once more left out of the discussions, and thus out of NATO's concern. The commander-in-chief of the great Western military alliance showed considerable interest in, and remained very satisfied with, the airfields, port facilities, and military bases that Albania, as a country of strategic importance in the region, has put at NATO's unconditional disposal. As for our national question -- the Kosova question -- not a single word was uttered by the U.S. army general (again according to what was said on the television) during a news conference by [Albanian Minister of Defense] Zhulali and Joulwan. Berisha's request for increased U.S. presence in the region has to do with the Balkan crisis, the restoration of peace in Bosnia, and the prevention of the conflict from spreading toward southern Yugoslavia, rather than with the Kosova people's aspiration for an independent and neutral state. Finally, there are the results of the talks with Klaus Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister. He assured Albania of support in all fields, promising heaven and earth. However, as for the Kosova issue, nothing concrete was promised, because, as it transpired from the discussions, the German minister gained the impression that even his Albanian interlocutors did not know precisely what they wanted. Why, then, has our diplomacy entered a blind alley over the Kosova issue -- the problem of our entire nation? There are a great number of reasons that require individual, deep analysis -- well- argued, mature, analysis showing patriotic courage. In this analysis we are going to deal with just one of them. Our Albanian diplomacy, on both sides of the border, does not have any national political platform. The commendable work by certain political and intellectual forces to chart a unified and binding national policy has been attacked and sabotaged by the Albanian state and its ruling parties. Our Albanian diplomacy is faced with an impasse, and it will never result in any achievements, because it is unable (or unwilling) to devise a just resolution of the Albanian question, which is not only a problem relating to Kosova. It has not properly formulated the options that it has presented to the world, and, which is worse, it has mangled them, reducing to an absurd level the will expressed in a referendum by the Kosova people living in their own lands occupied by the Serbs. There can never be any prospect of success for a policy or diplomacy that fails to tackle the Albanian problem as a whole, including the Kosova issue as its indisputably main constituent part. The creation of a union of all Albanians living in their ethnic territories will be the only good solution for the Albanians, the Balkans, Europe, as well as Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] themselves.
