Seleme's arrest was neither confirmed nor denied by Interior Minister German Quiroga. Seleme is considered to have been one of Paz Zamora's closest aides both during and after his presidential tenure. Quiroga stated that he could not talk about arrests or arrest warrants because this is a confidential matter. He did not rule out, however, the arrest of other politicians linked to Paz Zamora's administration (1989-93).
