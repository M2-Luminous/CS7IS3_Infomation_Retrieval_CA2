Yermolin and A. Pelts report: "Federation Council Elects Speaker. State Duma Ruled by Elders"] [Text] Yesterday's Federation Council sitting can rightly be called a deciding one. The deputies were electing the chairman of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. When discussion of the candidacies started it showed the deputies in the upper chamber so far unable to express their sympathy in favor of one particular contender in a clear-cut way. Their main task, however, was to elect a "silent speaker," that is, one who could take the interests of all the representatives of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly into consideration to the utmost degree and would be able to lead it skillfully along the path of unity and constructive work. As Boris Nemtsov, head of the Nizhnyy Novgorod administration, emphasized in an exclusive interview with a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, it is not mandatory to elect a representative of the regions; the main task is to get work under way with maximum efficiency. Ramazan Abdulatipov also adheres to this opinion. He notably considers it most important to establish a link between the upper chamber of the parliament and the president. In his opinion, Vladimir Shumeyko possesses all the necessary qualities, and, most importantly, experience. By 1400 the results of the secret ballot became known (it was conducted in booths). None of the contenders had gained the necessary number of votes. Vladimir Shumeyko with 85 votes and Petr Romanov with 56 went through to a second round. Shumeyko was left one vote short of victory. The first day of the State Duma sitting was marked by two noteworthy episodes, which could be called a test of strength. As evening was approaching Georgiy Lukava, who was chairing the sitting and who anyway has no experience as a speaker, clearly started to descend into improvisation and reacted to virtually every exclamation from the hall. The simplest questions took 20-30 minutes to discuss. Suffice it to say that, one hour after the beginning of the afternoon sitting, the registration had not yet been done. That is, it had not been established whether there was a quorum in the hall and whether the Duma had the power to adopt any decisions or not. Then Vladimir Zhirinovskiy came to the microphone, and, in the "Sturm und Drang" style, instructed his party comrade to switch off the microphones, not allow anyone to speak, and remove anyone who disobeyed with the help of the militia. Then the first episode, which could be called a test of strength, occurred: Twice Georgiy Lukava announced the registration, and twice the board lit up the words: "No quorum." Later, Mikhail Poltoranin commented on this episode as follows: "We landed one on Zhirinovskiy." And Zhirinovskiy backed off. Lukava was replaced by his colleague from the Council of Elders. The work of the session continued. But the second episode -- the vote on the question of the size of deputies' groups -- showed around 200 deputies gravitating toward the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] stance, while somewhere between 140 and 180 votes supported the Russia's Choice proposals. In the end, the figure named by Gennadiy Zyuganov -- 35 -- went through. That is how many deputies must be registered in a deputies' group for it to obtain the same rights as a faction. The votes came out 256 for and 146 against. And although Gennadiy Burbulis does not consider the outcome of the vote a defeat for the democrats (who sought a figure of 12-14), the disposition of votes clearly promises a hard life for them in the State Duma. As for the "nonregistration" ploy, it must be assumed that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will not always help his opponents to set all and sundry against him with unsubtle tricks. The democrats should not forget that this man knows not only how to "take a punch" but also how to learn lessons from doing so. On Wednesday, following its turbulent start, the State Duma worked in factions. Deputies' groups were being formed. There will be a joint sitting on Thursday.
