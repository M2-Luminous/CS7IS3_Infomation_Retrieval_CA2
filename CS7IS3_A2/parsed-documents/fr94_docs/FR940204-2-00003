FR940204-2-00003 FR940204-2-00001 This notice advises the public that APHIS has prepared a record of decision based on the final EIS. This record of decision has been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). The Agency record of decision is set forth below. Record of Decision; Final Environmental Impact Statement; Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program Decision The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program. The EIS analyzed alternatives for eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), a serious pest of agriculture that may in the future infest areas of the conterminous United States. After considering fully the analysis presented in the EIS (including supportive documents cited or incorporated by reference), I have accepted the findings of the EIS. As described in the EIS, selection of an alternative (and associated control methods) for future Medfly programs will be on an individual basis, made only after site-specific assessment of the individual program areas. The selection of an alternative (and control methods) will consider the findings of the EIS, the site-specific assessment, the public response, and any other relevant information available to APHIS at the time. APHIS will conduct environmental monitoring, as described in ``Environmental Monitoring Plan, Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program'' (incorporated by reference in this record of decision). I have determined that this course of action includes all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from Medfly control measures that may be employed by APHIS in future cooperative Medfly programs. Alternatives Considered The alternatives considered within the EIS include: No action, Medfly suppression (including chemicals), Medfly suppression (no chemicals), Medfly eradication (including chemicals), and Medfly eradication (no chemicals). They were broad in scope and reflect the major choices that must be made for a future program. The action alternatives combined variously the use of control methods, also analyzed within the EIS. The control methods included chemical control, nonchemical control, and combined control (including integrated pest management or IPM). They are limited in scope and reflect the specific means by which the program objectives may be met. The EIS considered and compared the potential impacts of the alternatives as well as their component control methods. Decisional Background In arriving at this decision, I have considered pertinent risk analyses, chemical background statements, a biological assessment for endangered and threatened species, and other technical documents whose analyses and conclusions were integrated into and summarized within the EIS. I have also considered APHIS' responsibilities under various statutes or regulations, the technological feasibilities of the alternatives and control methods, and public perspectives relative to environmental issues. Although scientific controversy may exist relative to the severity of potential impacts, especially with regard to pesticide impacts, I am satisfied that APHIS has estimated correctly the impacts of alternatives for Medfly eradication. APHIS understands the potential consequences of control methods (especially chemical methods) used for Medfly eradication. Chemical control methods have greater potential for adverse environmental consequences than nonchemical control methods. Chemical pesticides have the potential to adversely affect human health, nontarget species, and physical components of the environment. APHIS fully appreciates the dangers pesticides may pose, especially to sensitive members of communities. APHIS is committed to the rational use of chemical pesticides and strives to reduce their use wherever possible. However, APHIS has statutory obligations that require it to act decisively to eliminate foreign pest species such as the Medfly. Given the current state of control technology, we believe that nonchemical control methods (used exclusively) are not capable of eradicating the Medfly. We know too that the net result of a decision not to use chemicals would be that other government entities or commercial growers are likely to use even more chemicals over a wider area, with correspondingly greater environmental impact. APHIS is convinced that, if eradication remains the objective, a coordinated and well-run government program that limits the use of pesticides to the minimum necessary to do the job is therefore in the best interests of the public and the environment. APHIS continues to support and favor the use of IPM strategies in achieving Medfly eradication. Final Implementation In all cases, a site-specific assessment will be made prior to the time a decision is made on the control methods that will be used on a particular program. The site-specific assessment will consider characteristics such as unique and sensitive aspects of the program area, applicable environmental and program documentation, and applicable new developments in environmental science or control technologies. The site-specific assessment will also confirm the adequacy of or need for additional program mitigative measures. The site-specific analysis process is described more fully in the EIS. Site-specific assessments will be made available to the public and APHIS will consider the public's perspective relative to individual programs. To avoid or minimize environmental harm, APHIS will follow all standard operational procedures and program mitigative measures developed for the Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program. These procedures (incorporated by reference in this record of decision) are fully described in the EIS, and include but are not limited to the following: Pesticide applicator certification, training and applicator orientation, special pesticide precautions for pesticide application, identification of sensitive sites, public notification procedures, and interagency coordination and consultation.
