This source well versed in the situation of the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia reported: China is paying special attention to the fact that North Korea has formed a new South Korean operation team in the Workers Party of Korea and appointed Kim Yong-chu, a moderate who had been excluded from power for almost 20 years; and Kim Tal-hyon, who recently retired from vice premier of the State Administration Council, as the top and assistant leaders of the team. China is saying that this shows North Korea's will to improve relations with Western countries. This sources also said: China views that North Korea's agreement with China on a joint promotion to construct indirect social capitals in the Najin-Sonbong area and to enlarge and develop Chongjin Port forms a link in the chain of its long-term policy for opening up. It has been learned that the Chinese view of the North Korean situation, in particular, was revealed in a classified document which was secretly circulated recently among ranking Chinese cadres in charge of party policy.
