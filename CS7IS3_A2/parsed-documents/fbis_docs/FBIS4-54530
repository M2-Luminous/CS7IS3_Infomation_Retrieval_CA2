Coal supplies to power plants have been resumed. But Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not want to give up escalating the strike action beginning on 4 May. On Saturday [30 April] and Sunday, 18 hard-coal mines were on strike. Labor Minister Miller is surprised with the escalation of the protest. The "Solidarity" All-National Strike Committee of Brown-Coal Mines decided to suspend its strike action effective Saturday afternoon. The government committed itself to initiating an amendment to a law on retirement pensions for miners that would place brown-coal employees on an equal footing with those employed in the sulfur-mining industry. It was determined that the extra money that will go into the budget as a result of energy price rises will be distributed in agreement with trade union experts. Strike participants will not be punished, either. In return, the miners obliged themselves to supply brown coal to power plants. "The level of supplies will depend on the magnitude of the power generation factor that the National Power Distribution Center will determine for a given day," said Czeslaw Maconko, a strike committee member. The trade unionists have announced that the strike action will be stopped after the government presents a schedule for meeting the trade union's demands. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski stressed that, so far, the trade union has not received such a schedule from the government, and it is the same case with a proposal for negotiations. "There is a need for strikes, but we also need an openness to compromise," Krzaklewski said during Saturday's rally at the Stalowa Wola steelworks, which has been on strike since 28 April. But the chairman of Solidarity also stressed that a compromise cannot amount to the trade union giving up on any of its demands. During Saturday's press conference in Przemysl, Krzaklewski accused the government of ignoring Solidarity. In his view, the precise reason the trade union carried out 774 strikes this year is the government's arrogance toward Solidarity. Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on Saturday that, in the context of Friday's talks with representatives of the trade union within a trilateral commission, he is surprised by Solidarity's decision to escalate the protest action. In Miller's view, by deciding to escalate the strike action, Krzaklewski either was not aware of the contents of talks within the trilateral commission or he wants to pressure the government, which, in turn, makes talks impossible. Over the weekend, strikes were in progress in 18 hard-coal mines and three zinc and lead mines. Mine employees stayed at home, with representatives of strike committees on duty at the mines. Municipal transportation did not work for two hours in the city of Rzeszow on Saturday morning.
