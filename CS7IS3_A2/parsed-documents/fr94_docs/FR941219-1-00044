FR941219-1-00044 FR941219-1-00015 S8.3.2␣The CNG fuel container is positioned so that its longitudinal axis is horizontal. Attach three thermocouples to measure temperature on the container's bottom side along a line parallel to the container longitudinal centerline. Attach one at the midpoint of the container, and one at each end at the point where the dome end intersects the container sidewall. Subject the entire length to flame impingement, except that the flame shall not be allowed to impinge directly on any pressure relief device. Shield the pressure relief device with a metal plate. S8.3.3␣If the test container is 165 cm (65 inches) in length or less, place it in the upright position. Attach three thermocouples to measure temperature on the container's bottom side along a line which intersects the container longitudinal centerline. Attach one at the midpoint of the bottom of the container, and one each at the point where the dome end intersects the container sidewall. Subject the container to total fire engulfment in the vertical. The flame shall not be allowed to impinge directly on any pressure relief device. For containers equipped with a pressure relief device on one end, the container is positioned with the relief device on top. For containers equipped with pressure relief devices on both ends, the bottom pressure relief device shall be shielded with a metal plate. S8.3.4␣The lowest part of the container is suspended at a distance above the fire such that the container bottom surface temperatures specified in S8.3.6 are achieved. * * * * * S8.3.6␣The fire is generated by any fuel that generates a flame temperature between 850 ○ and 900 ○C for the duration of the test, as verified by each of the three thermocouples in S8.3.2 or S8.3.3. S8.3.7␣The fuel specified in S8.3.6 is such that there is sufficient fuel to burn for at least 20 minutes. To ensure that the sides of the fuel container are exposed to the flame, the surface area of the fire on a horizontal plane is such that it exceeds the fuel container projection on a horizontal plane by at least 20 cm (8 inches) but not more than 50 cm (20 inches). * * * * * S8.5␣ Environmental cycling test procedures. S8.5.1␣Adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container before the test. S8.5.2␣After the removal of any protective coating or temporary coating such as oil or grease, a CNG fuel container is cycle tested as follows: S8.5.2.1␣Precondition the container's interior as follows: Fill container 1/2 full with water, pressurize container to 1.0 psi with hydrogen sulfide, increase pressure to 50 psi with carbon dioxide, then increase pressure to 67 percent of the service pressure with automotive grade natural gas. Maintain the pressure at room temperature for 15 days, then increase the room temperature to 60 ○C (140 ○F) and hold for 15 days. Depressurize the container, drain and dry. Add an amount of compressor oil sufficient to coat the interior surfaces of the container. Pressurize to 67 percent of the service pressure using automotive grade natural gas and hold for 15 days at 60 ○C (140 ○F) room temperature. Depressurize the container. S8.5.2.2␣Condition the container for 48 hours at zero pressure, 60 ○C (140 ○F) and 95 percent relative humidity. To obtain the specified temperature and relative humidity, spray with a fine spray or mist of water at 60 ○C (140 ○F) in a chamber held at 60 ○C (140 ○F). S.8.5.2.3␣For 5,000 cycles at 60 ○C (140 ○F) and 95 percent relative humidity, hydrostratically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, to (2) 125 percent of the service pressure. S8.5.2.4␣Stabilize at zero pressure and ambient conditions.
