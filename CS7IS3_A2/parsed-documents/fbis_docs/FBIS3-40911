Rogov criticized the agreement, saying "commentaries claiming the tripartite statement on nuclear arms removes all problems related to nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory are too hasty". In his words, the major drawback of the document is that it is not concrete. It carries no schedule of nuclear arms withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. If there is no withdrawal before the conference on non-proliferation of nuclear arms due to be held in 1995, the international community will face serious problems in discussion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty's future and a possibility of its joining by China, Israel and North Korea, stressed Rogov. Even if Ukraine withdraws 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,500 warheads declared in the statement, it will not be able to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear arms. In the words of Rogov, Ukraine has another 670 nuclear warheads from air-based missiles and gravity bombs.
