Silajdzic's letter is completely unfounded, and it is yet another attempt to turn the attention of the international public away from the true problem, which is the Muslim army's continued aggression against the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims' persistence in continuing the war. This is the gist of the statement. We declare that there are no regular units of the Croatian Army in the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and that the political leadership of Herceg-Bosna has never asked the Croatian Army and leaders to send Croatian Army units to Herceg-Bosna. It is true that the authorities of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna have sent a call-up to all able-bodied citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality -- including members of the Croatian Army born in Bosnia-Herzegovina who volunteered for the Croatian Army at the beginning of the aggression against Croatia -- to join HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units in the defense of their people and their historic areas. Before joining HVO units, all volunteers from the Croatian Army born in Bosnia-Herzegovina were demobilized from the Croatian Army; that is, they left its ranks. The truth is only that HVO units are much better manned due to a good turnout of citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality who stayed in Croatia, the statement says.
