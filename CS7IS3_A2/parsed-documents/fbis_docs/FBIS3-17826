It is necessary to point out that on the eve of the elections some political parties and movements called on the Crimeans to stay away from the Ukrainian parliamentary elections or, to be more exact, not to drop the ballots into the ballot-boxes, but take them away. It is not known yet whether the voters paid their attention to this call or not, but it was already stated that the Crimean parliamentary elections are recognized valid because more than 60 percent of the electorate took part in the elections (the needed number is 50 percent). In accordance with the preliminary data, the "Russia" election bloc, which nominated Yuriy Meshkov for the presidency, and representatives of the Communist Party are in the lead. The opinion poll, which was conducted on the initiative of President Meshkov, known for his pro-Russian sentiments, consisted of three questions: Should the Crimea establish its relations with Ukraine on the basis of agreements, whether the people support the idea of the dual citizenship and whether they agree to attach force of law to some decrees by the Crimean president. The poll's idea caused a negative reaction in Kiev and the Crimean Central Electoral Commission did not participate in its organizing. The poll, which is considered a sociological study, was conducted by the presidential structures of the peninsula. A group of international observers at the Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary elections held a press-conference on Monday. "We did not register any violations of the Crimean election legislation or the international election law," Sergey Stankevich, Russia's State Duma deputy, told journalists.
