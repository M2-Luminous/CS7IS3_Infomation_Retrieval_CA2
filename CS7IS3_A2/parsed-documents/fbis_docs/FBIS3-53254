He stated that he has decided to cooperate with the Sudanese opposition to topple President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime. Clashes have broken out once again in the south between government forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, while the statements made by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference [and leader of the National Islamic Front], about a dialogue being conducted between the authorities and the parties inside and outside the country has provoked violent reactions from the government. At a news conference in London, Ajo said that he had applied for political asylum in Britain. He stated that he left Khartoum for Cairo on 1 December on 30-day leave with his family, them moved on 15 December to London, where he decided to announce his resignation and seek asylum. He declined to say whether he had decided on his resignation and escape from Sudan before or after his visit to London. He stressed that he had agreed to join the government after the successful military coup led by Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir four years ago in the hope of influencing the government's policy "in order to eliminate the tension between north and south and to establish peace in the south. But I was wrong, as this government does not want peace." He added that he had decided to cooperate with the Sudanese opposition in all its tendencies and groups, stressing that "only force is capable of removing the Sudanese regime, which is not concerned about citizens' death." He attacked the regime's unseriousness in solving the south problem and establishing party pluralism. He also spoke about "the regime's scheme to Islamize the south." He cited constitutional decree No. 7 endorsed by the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation on the eve of its dissolution. He went on: "The regime's supporters gather southern children from the refugee camps to which they fled in Khartoum, southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, and southern towns like Juba and Malakal, which are all under government control. They take the children to secret camps, where they force them to join religious schools and military training centers in north Sudan to prepare them to fight against the south." "I believe that a true and lasting peace is possible if the the people of the south are allowed to exercise their right to self-determination through a referendum to determine their political future." Meanwhile, al-Turabi's statements about a dialogue being conducted with the Sudanese parties inside and outside the country have provoked violent reactions from the government. Official sources emphasized to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the government, which dissolved the parties, cannot conduct a reconciliation with them. "But if contacts take place, they will be with figures in isolation from their parties." [passage omitted]
