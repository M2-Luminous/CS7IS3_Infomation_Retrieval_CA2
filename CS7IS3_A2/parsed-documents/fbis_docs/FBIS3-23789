This is the aim of a draft law that Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has submitted for consideration to the Lithuanian Seimas. Thus, in Lithuania, perhaps, for the first time in the legislative practice of former republics of the USSR, it is planned to fundamentally change the system of taxation, which will be the most radical decision in the reformation of the socioeconomic life of the republic. According to the presidential draft, all adult residents of the republic will be obliged to declare property acquired and incomes received in the course of a calendar year by submitting special declarations to state tax inspectorates according to place of residence. It will be necessary to submit them there by 1 March of the next year for the past year. So that each resident of Lithuania, whether he wants to or not, will have to become a domestic bookkeeper who scrupulously gathers all records, forms, checks, tickets, receipts, and other payment account documents that are of use to him in filling out the declaration. If it is filled out incorrectly then, according to the draft law, the tax inspectorate first reports this to the taxpayer and, in the event of insufficient payment of taxes, he is obliged to pay them now with an added fine. Its sum will increase in that progression in which the taxpayer tries to deceive his own state. Moreover, for evading submission of a declaration, and for indicating incorrect data, he can end up in court. Members of the ruling parliamentary faction and the Democratic Labor Party decided to work to support the presidential draft law--they announced their intentions to declare their incomes that they received this year. President A. Brazauskas earlier also declared his readiness to fill out such a declaration and to publish his incomes. The president and his team thereby let it be known that the presidential veto of the law on mandatory declaration of incomes and property by state employees, previously adopted by the Seimas, is explained not by a desire to please corrupt bureaucrats, of which the rightist opposition accused the president, but by an urgent need to defend the constitutional rights of citizens. A. Brazauskas decided: If incomes are to be declared, then this is for all residents, and not for an individual category of workers. This kind of reform of the taxation system will undoubtedly require large resources and a radical breaking of the consciousness of the people. The foundation for a Lithuanian-style tax revolution has been laid. Lithuania has already adopted the law on the declaration of incomes of residents and on expensive property that was acquired or is being acquired. The Seimas will soon consider the draft of a new law about a single income tax, according to which it is proposed to summarize all incomes and to give the state 35 percent of the aggregate. If such a document is adopted, then it will not be necessary to rack one's brain over the compilation of a declaration--in fact, a single tax standard will be in operation. In addition, it is planned to introduce 16 types of taxes in Lithuania: on real estate, land, natural resources, patents, notary services, and so on. It is planned to complete the Lithuanian tax system as early as 1996.
