FR940328-2-00069 FR940328-2-00046 [Docket 70&hyph;36] Environmental Statements; Availability, etc.: Combustion Engineering, Inc. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering the renewal of Special Nuclear Material License SNM&hyph;33 for the continued operation of the Combustion Engineering, Inc. (CE), Hematite Nuclear Fuel Manufacturing Facility, for 10 years. Summary of the Environmental Assessment Identification of the Proposed Action The proposed action is the renewal of License SNM&hyph;33, allowing CE to continue manufacturing low-enriched nuclear fuel for 10 years. The current license authorizes CE to receive, possess, use, and transfer special nuclear material in accordance with 10 CFR part 70 and source material in accordance with 10 CFR part 40. This license also allows CE to delivery radioactive material to a carrier for transportation in accordance with 10 CFR part 71. CE produces low-enriched (>5 percent U&hyph;235) ceramic nuclear fuel for light-water cooled reactors. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed action is needed for CE to continue to produce low-enriched nuclear fuel pellets which will ultimately be used by commercial nuclear power plants to produce electricity. Since CE is one of only a few facilities that manufacture nuclear fuel in this country, there remains a need for the fuel by the nuclear power industry. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Airborne effluents from process areas and process equipment involving uranium in a dispersible form are subject to air filtering, prior to release to the atmosphere. Effluents from the process areas are continuously collected on a particulate filter and are analyzed for gross alpha activity. The monitoring data for 1982 through September 1993 demonstrates that the levels of gross alpha activity released from the site do not exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR part 20, Appendix B, Table II, Column 1. There are no planned releases of radioactive liquid wastes from routine production processes. Liquids with low-uranium content, such as mop water, cleanup water, and grinder coolant water, are collected and then evaporated to recover the uranium. Liquids with higher uranium content are processed to recover the uranium, usually by precipitation and filtration. Process filtrates, including wet recovery system filtrate and spent scrubber solutions, are routed to a calibrated tank, mixed, sampled, and the filtrates are then evaporated, solidified with concrete, and packaged for shipment to a licensed burial site. A potential source of radioactive liquid waste is from the laundry, sink and shower areas, and the chemistry laboratory. The laundry water is filtered and sampled prior to discharge to the sanitary sewer system. The water from change room sinks and showers is also discharged through the sanitary waste system. Effluents from the sanitary waste system enter the site creek immediately below the site pond dam. A grab sample of the water is taken each week and analyzed for gross alpha and beta activities. The chemistry laboratory discharges to the storm drain system. While analytical residues are recycled to recover the uranium and therefore do not contribute to the effluents, when the laboratory glassware is cleaned, small amounts of liquids wash down the sinks and are discharged to the storm drain system. The storm drain system discharges into the site pond which overflows to form the site creek. The overflow is sampled weekly and analyzed for gross alpha and beta.
