Cost-containment pressure in any form that is applied by some payers but not by others would exacerbate the current disparity in relative payment levels across payers. This would put certain hospitals at a financial disadvantage because of their inability to compete for patients with more generous private insurance coverage. Increasingly, a hospital's financial condition would be determined by its payer mix rather than its efficiency. If the gap in relative payment levels is widened because of different cost-containment measures across payers, many hospitals that provide important services to specific segments of the population may curtail their operations. Within this climate of health reform to control expenditures and expand coverage, medical technology continues to evolve. New threats to the public's health (such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and medical advances in areas like biotechnology and diagnostic imaging will lead to the ongoing development of expensive new drugs, equipment, and procedures. Better understanding of disease processes and medical techniques for combating illness will continue. This will add to the momentum to modify the mix of services and site of delivery. Such changes may enhance the hospital's role, if it has control over the continuum of service delivery. To the extent that these changes allow more providers to compete with the hospital or substitute for some of its functions, its role could diminish. It is unclear how health care reform will affect the development and diffusion of new technology and the application of medical advances. Cost control may concentrate on innovations that reduce the cost of care. Reform that incorporates rate setting would be more likely to promote innovations that lower the cost of providing services. Global budget or premium cap reform approaches would focus attention on technologies or procedures that diminish costs over an episode of care. Under any reform scenario, public and private payers will continue their efforts to curb spending associated with new or diffusing technologies and the expanded ability to provide services. The hospital's traditional role as the center of the health care delivery system has changed dramatically and is continuing to evolve. Hospital spending still makes up the largest part of total health expenditures, despite the increasing availability of services outside the inpatient setting and the proliferation of ambulatory care providers. As a result, hospitals will bear much of the pressure to alter the way health care is delivered and paid for in the future. How much of this pressure falls on different hospitals will vary, depending on each hospital's current situation. how each hospital chooses to respond, and how well the hospital can implement its response, will differ as well. What the future holds for each hospital therefore will be determined by a mix of internal and external forces. Facilities thus will be further differentiated in the services they provide and their relationships with other components of the health care financing and delivery system.
