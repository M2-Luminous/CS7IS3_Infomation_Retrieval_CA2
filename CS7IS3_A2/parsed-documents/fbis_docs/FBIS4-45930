Sun made the statement in reply to an inquiry by Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Trong Chai, who demanded that Taiwan step up its defense capability to guard against the possibility of attack by Mainland China. Sun, the former president of National Taiwan University, told the legislative chamber that of the missiles currently available in the world, only the Patriot is capable of intercepting missiles. He said Taiwan would purchase the Patriot model known as the PAC- II, a revised model of the one that functioned effectively against Scud missiles fired by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Sun said negotiations for the arms sale have been under way for some time, and are almost complete. Yet he did not reveal the value of the arms sale. Sun also told the legislature that the first squadron of locally manufactured Ching Kuo jet fighters, better known as "Indigenous Defensive Fighters," will be commissioned before the end of the year. They will be equipped with Tien Chien, or "Sky Sword" air-to- air missiles, he said. The air force is scheduled to acquire 120 of the combat aircraft. Taiwan has also contracted to buy 150 us-made F-16s and 60 French Mirage 2000-5s. The army also has completed the deployment of the first battery of Tien Kung ground-to-air missiles, Sun said. Dubbed "Sky Bows," the missiles were developed by the Chung-shan Institute of Science and Technology.
