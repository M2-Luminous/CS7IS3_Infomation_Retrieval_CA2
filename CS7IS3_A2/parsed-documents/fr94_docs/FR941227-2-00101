FR941227-2-00101 FR941227-2-00071 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,342 Roosevelt, Utah, TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,342A Denver, Colorado] Linmar Petroleum Company; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On November 13, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on November 3, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on November 16, 1994 (59 FR 59253). New findings show that Linmar operated crude oil drilling wells before it sold its operations to Coastal Oil and Gas Corporation. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 13th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31757 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
