Exports grew by 40 percent, even faster than imports, which rose by 36 percent. The trade deficit with the Chinese countries rose during the same period to about 3.5 billion guilders, around 850 million guilders more than in the same period the year before. This was apparent from trade figures for the Chinese countries covering the period January-October 1993. Exports To China Exports to China passed the 1 billion guilder mark in 1993. All F-100's are now included in the figures for Netherlands exports to China. If the Netherlands export figures are corrected to compensate for this incidental item then the increase in exports would be "just" 50 percent. In that case, exports -- corrected for airplanes -- would not exceed 1 billion guilders in 1993. In addition, the growth in exports to China is supported by the semi-finished products sector. This sector multiplied its exports sixfold for a total of 145 million guilders. The main articles involved are iron and steel products (blast furnaces). It is also striking that exports of chemicals to China dropped slightly. Exports to Taiwan and Hong Kong rose virtually across the board. There are no real ups or downs. By far the Netherlands' most important export products to these countries are capital goods. Imports of Machines The growth of imports from the Chinese countries was primarily found in the sector of machines and transportation equipment and other end products. The first category concerns chiefly consumer durables, such as consumer electronics and household white goods, as well as capital goods such as computers and computer parts, in which the growth in electron tubes and transistors is striking. This growth is supported primarily by imports from Taiwan. In the sector of other end products, the growth in imports of clothing, footwear, and toys is striking. This growth is supported by imports from China and Hong Kong. The CBS [Central Office for Statistics] is assuming that annual figures for 1993 will be released before 1 May.
