Minsk Worried at Position of Ethnic Minority in Latvia and Estonia"] [Text] Before UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit, which ended 7 April, Belarus authorities preferred to solve bilaterally the problems of ethnic Belarusians finding themselves outside their own country, and scored certain successes in that. For example, agreements with Lithuania, where the Belarusian community is especially large, are already working: national schools have been opened in Vilnius and in a Belarusian village there. The Belarusian language is now heard on Lithuanian radio, and a Belarusian newspaper appears in Lithuania's capital. The interests of Lithuanians who live in Belarus are being served in a similar way. The problems of Belarusians in Latvia, and especially in Estonia, have a somewhat different nature. The matter is that the Slavic population along Lithuania's southeastern border has been there for centuries and has preserved its culture and language. Lithuanian Belarusians had no problem acquiring citizenship. Latvia and Estonia are a different matter. There, Belarusians encounter the same difficulties as do all non-Latvians and non-Estonians. Until recently, the Belarus side had been trying to resolve the arising difficulties through bilateral talks, in particular during the recent visit to Minsk by Latvian Prime Minister Birkans. All the more unexpected was the news heard from Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko that, during his discussions with Mr. Butrus-Ghali, considerable attention was devoted to the topic of the Belarusian ethnic minority in Baltic countries. The UN leader promised cooperation in solving this problem and voiced the intention to send, at Belarus' request, a special UN human rights mission to the Baltic countries. Local observers think in this connection that such an initiative of Minsk officials is the result of private "consultations" held by Belarus diplomats with their Russian counterparts.
