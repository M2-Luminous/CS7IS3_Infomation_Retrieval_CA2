FR940414-2-00136 FR940414-2-00084 Inasmuch as both the principal and surety have separate petitioning times, a question arises as to whether the late charge will apply to a bond principal who fails to file a petition in the time period afforded to him by regulation, but then files a petition during the time period afforded to surety. Because the principal failed to respond timely during the time period permitted to him, Customs takes the view that his petition will be considered to be late, even if filed during the time period afforded to surety, and mitigation will reflect that late filing. A new Section XI is added to the guidelines to provide cancellation standards involving claims for liquidated damages assessed against Centralized Examination Station (CES) operators for violations of their custodial bond. A Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5596) as Treasury Decision (T.D.) 93&hyph;6, whereby Customs amended the Regulations to provide for a new part 118 (19 CFR part 118) and other amendments delineating the duties and responsibilities of CES operators. They are required, pursuant to new section 19 CFR 118.4(g), to maintain a Customs custodial bond in an amount set by the district director. The terms of the Customs custodial bond are found in ยง113.63 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 113.63). Under the provisions of new section 19 CFR 151.15(b) (also added by T.D. 93&hyph;6), CES operators assume liability for merchandise for which they receipt or for which they transport to the CES under their operator's bond. Many of these violations are similar to those arising from breaches of ยง113.62(f) of the basic importation bond which involve failure to deliver to or hold merchandise at the place of examination (current Section X of the Guidelines). Accordingly, the cancellation standards relating to failure to keep merchandise safe in the CES or failure to deliver merchandise to the CES will be similar. The explanation of changes to Section X will detail these standards. The CES operator is also responsible, under the provisions of 19 CFR 118.4(h), for the maintenance and retention of records connected with the operation of the CES. Failing to maintain those records would involve a violation not involving merchandise and would result in liquidated damages of $1,000 for each day the violation continues. The bond cancellation standards for these cases will mirror the guidelines used for cancellation of claims incurred by bonded warehouse operators for violations not involving merchandise. The background information to the changes to Section VII describes these guidelines. Changes to Section I Section I of the bond cancellation standards includes guidelines for the cancellation of charges for late filing of entry summaries. The Option 1 immediate payment of a preset mitigated amount in lieu of filing a petition for relief is an extremely successful procedure and is being retained in late filing of entry summary cases. For those violators who do not wish to take advantage of the Option 1 mitigated amount, petitioning rights will be protected; however, under new guidelines, a party who chooses to petition for relief in a late filing case will no longer necessarily be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. If the petitioning party fails to show that the violation did not occur or that it occurred as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. Under the current guidelines, when a petition for relief is filed in a late filing case, a distinction is made between when the entry summary is late by less than 30 days and when it is late by more than 30 days. Different criteria apply to the review of those two types of petitions. This distinction has proved to be meaningless. Petitions are generally filed on the basis that the violation did not occur, or that it occurred as a result of contributory Customs error. In general, petitions are submitted without regard to whether the entry summary was more or less than 30 days late. Additionally, the factors delineated in the current guidelines to be considered when the entry summary is more than 30 days late are not consistent with the Option 1 procedure which does not turn on the intent of the violator, the circumstances causing the lateness or the past record of the violator. Accordingly, Customs is eliminating the distinction in the guidelines between cases that are late by more or less than 30 days.
