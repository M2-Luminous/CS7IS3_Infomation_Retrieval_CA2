Ventosa report: "Garcia Vargas Says Society Was Reconciled With Its Armed Forces in 1993"] [Text] Madrid -- Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas stated yesterday in his speech to the king on the occasion of Armed Forces Day that 1993 "was the year of Spanish society's reconciliation with its Armed Forces," thanks to the blue helmets' conduct in Bosnia-Herzegovina, "although all units have also contributed to this." Garcia Vargas spelled out in his speech the measures adopted by the Defense Ministry during the past year in order to make progress in the process of reorganization and modernization of the Spanish Armed Forces, and set out some of the worrying realities of the international situation, which is in a period of change "in which uncertainties abound." Thus, he referred to the "hotbeds of tension caused by intolerant and aggressive nationalist movements," which make "more necessary than ever" UN efforts to help pacify them. Referring to the Spanish military participation under the UN flag in those international conflicts -- particularly that in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- he said that "our troops' self-sacrificing work is alleviating suffering, saving thousands of lives, and gaining distinction which causes us all to owe a debt of gratitude." European Security The defense minister also spoke of the security aspect of the process of European building, announcing Spain's support for the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which will help bring four Central European countries closer to the Atlantic alliance; a matter which will be discussed at the coming NATO summit, to be held in Brussels next week. Nevertheless, and still regarding NATO as a "factor of security throughout the continent," Garcia Vargas said that the political union "should assume greater prominence through the Western European Union [WEU] in its dual manifestation as the European pillar of the alliance and the [European] Union's security structure." On this point, he stated that the Spanish contribution to this new European defense identity will take shape in the coming incorporation of Spanish units into the European Army Corps and in participation in the future air-sea force currently being planned by the WEU. In the domestic sphere, Garcia Vargas emphasized the budgetary problems experienced by the Armed Forces in 1993, which have necessitated revising all their equipment programs. After giving an account of the main arms projects for this year, announcing others which will be approved in 1994 -- the investments program bill and the military service regulations, and emphasizing the importance of the latest to enter into force -- the personnel law and the recruitment regulations, the minister announced that the government will approve "soon" the joint plan for the reorganization of the three services, including, among others, the Army's "Lodestar Plan" ["Plan Norte"]. Garcia Vargas called for "the understanding of territorial bodies throughout Spain" for this important joint plan, which will entail a new stage of winding up units, bases, and military installations, with less geographical dispersal throughout Spain. The final part of his speech was in fact devoted to Spanish society's rapprochement with the Armed Forces, manifested in the offer by many draftee servicemen to take part voluntarily in international peacekeeping missions "and in Spanish military personnel's cooperation in humanitarian tasks with young people in civilian organizations." On this point, the minister took the opportunity to criticize "a section of our young people who maintain an aloof stance toward the Armed Forces." "Their demurring stance," he said, "is aimed at a now superseded stereotype of the Armed Forces which bears little relation to reality." Although the defense minister maintained that "it cannot be expected" that "preconceived ideas and social attitudes will pass away quickly," he showed himself convinced that this current of insubordination existing in Spain "will also be surmounted."
