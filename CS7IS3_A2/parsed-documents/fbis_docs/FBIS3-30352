How are you going to explain to your Western interlocutors that Poland, the most anti-communist of the former Soviet bloc countries, has replaced, after four years, a regime born out of Solidarity with a government formed of two parties with their roots in the former regime? [Pawlak] My generation is fortunate to enter upon the political scene at a time when we ourselves are deciding our fate, while our parents and grandparents were forced to live under the constraints of the Communist regime and look for their spot in the sunshine. Certain people now say that we must do away with Communism in the country. But we cannot do away with Communism in a country which never accepted the Communism in the first place. We were the only Eastern bloc country to have maintained intact its national memory, private agriculture, church and intellectual elite. Within the group which was, apparently, condemned to uniformity, we were different. This aspect is an essential element of the present situation. [Mathil] You do not therefore like the definition of your coalition as "post-Communist"? [Pawlak] No, I find it anachronistic, dating from the former era in fact. Also, the past history of politicians and political parties in Poland, of the people from Solidarity also, is very complicated. My party, the Peasant Party, began well before the Communist era. It has been active in Polish politics for a hundred years. Such a party cannot be described as "post-Communist." [Mathil] And the reasons for your electoral success? An ideological vote? [Pawlak] No, I don't believe so, it was a pragmatic vote. A signal that the economy is more than statistics and abstract accounting, it is above all people. I believe the vote indicated that, for the Poles, the affairs of the present and the future are more important than those of the past, and day-to-day problems eclipsed any ideological debate. The 1991 elections had already signalled that certain consequences of the reforms were hitting the population very hard. But this signal was ignored. As the government did not change course, the 1993 elections showed that the political climate had changed radically. [Mathil] Alternating governments is in fact a quite normal phenomenon in a democracy, but not when it brings to power two parties as burdened by the past as your own. You are accused of rebuilding a model of the past? [Pawlak] That is the view of people who have not noticed the far-reaching changes in the structures and generations in our parties. Also, virtually all those who are involved in the exercise of power have been confirmed in their position by the ballot box. Cohabitation With Lech Walesa [Mathil] Poland is the first country with cohabitation between a government of the left and a president of the right, like in France, but in reverse. What are your relations with Lech Walesa? [Pawlak] Good. I believe that it is in the interests of the country for them to remain as good as possible. We do not deal with symbols, but with specific, concrete questions. On any important and urgent matters, I never have any problem in gaining access to the president. [Mathil] After three months of cohabitation, has there been no major conflict between the president and the prime minister? [Pawlak] Even if there had been, I would not tell you. [Mathil] The fact remains that three key ministries, defense, foreign, and the interior, remain the reserve of the president. Do these ministers remain outside the control of the prime minister? [Pawlak] They are members of the government which I head. Under the Constitution, the government is appointed by the parliament, but the individuals who head these three departments are chosen in consultation with the president. Admittedly, this is a situation with the potential for conflict, but Polish cohabitation makes it possible to arrive at a compromise. [Mathil] The Solidaruty governments, from Mazowiecki to Suchocka, pursued a policy of reforms admired in the West but rejected by the voters. You described it as a "vehicle heading for the abyss." What do you do to stop it? [Pawlak] The sentence is not complete, I was alluding to the abyss of social conflict. An "active economy" is required, in which not only a few monetarist instruments but all the players, and notably the government, must play a role. We must understand that there is a limit to social resilience, beyond which there is the danger of provoking an explosion, destabilization, and the end to reforms. That is why we have begun by looking at the situation of the most underprivileged. [Mathil] Your critics claim that carrying out your election promises will threaten the cause of reforms and trigger rising inflation. [Pawlak] For the moment, inflation is lower than expected and in any event it can only be meaningfully discussed after a certain period of time. [Mathil] You are arriving in Brussels the very day after the entry into force of the association accord with the European Union negotiated by previous governments. Does your government of the left have any reservations regarding this treaty? [Pawlak] It is enough to look at our foreign trade debt, one half of which, or more than one billion dollars in 1993, stems from trade with the EEC. It is not of question of listing preferences on paper, but of achieving real cooperation. [Mathil] Do you mean to say that Poland is discriminated against in terms of access to Western markets? [Pawlak] That is putting it in strong terms. But you could say that the European Union applies solutions to Poland which it would not like to see applied to itself. [Mathil] You have the reputation of being a protectionist. Why? [Pawlak] I don't know. I have simply asked the question: Why has not Poland so far used all available means in order to defend its interests as the countries of the European Union have done? [Mathil] In Brussels, you are going to sign Poland's access to the Partnership for Peace. Is it true that as recently as last Friday you were not sure that you would be able to do it this Wednesday? [Pawlak] The decision to sign was taken at a summit with Mr. Clinton in Prague. But it was a question of having the full backing of the government. This was obtained on Friday. [Mathil] This agreement has been strongly criticized in Poland, notably by your president. Is the partnership considered to be insufficient? [Pawlak] It is a complex matter. Apart from the external dangers which could be posed in the future, there are more immediate aspects of internal order. This is why we formulated the idea of a "Partnership for Development." And Mr. Clinton's statement on the need to enlarge access to Western markets by the countries of Central Europe shows a similar thinking. Security is a very broad concept which goes beyond bilateral relations between Poland and NATO for example. The "Partnership" Creates A Draught Zone [Mathil] Do you agree with Henry Kissinger for whom the "partnership" creates a no man's land between Russia and NATO? [Pawlak] I prefer to say "a draught zone" where you might catch a cold. The situation is characterized by uncertainties which the ambiguities of the "partnership" do not remove. [Mathil] What dangers would you cite to show the fragility of the situation? [Pawlak] I would begin by the elements of internal stability, social and economic. The quicker we achieve this stability, notably through international cooperation, the easier it will be to solve wide, long-term problems. But I do not believe we are under a direct threat in our international environment. [Mathil] So how do you see events in Russia and above all the results of the recent elections? [Pawlak] I see it as further proof that reforms cannot be achieved independently of the social climate. [Mathil] But do you see in this result a danger to Poland? Belarus and Ukraine, two buffer states between Poland and Russia, are being slowly "sucked in" by Moscow. What do you think of the idea of Russia's "legitimate interests" in the "near abroad"? Do you feel this is relevant to or even targeted at Poland? [Pawlak] Our present relations with Russia's president and government are not of a nature to justify such fears. In any event, we take our decisions in complete sovereignty and we have no reason to believe that Russia does not respect this. But of course time will tell. [Mathil] Exactly, you have time. At the age of 34, you are certainly one of the youngest prime ministers in the world. People say you are very ambitious. Is it true that you will be a candidate against Lech Walesa at the next presidential elections? [Pawlak] I have a job now which is very interesting and which I find totally satisfying. I do not know if I am an ambitious man, but I am certainly not a man in a hurry.
