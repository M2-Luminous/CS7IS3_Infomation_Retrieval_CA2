FR940303-2-00085 FR940303-2-00055 [7. [Insert for Loans Involving Construction or Rehabilitation] To our [my] knowledge there are no proposed change(s) of law, ordinance, or governmental regulation (proposed in a formal manner by elected or appointed officials) which, if enacted or promulgated after the commencement of construction/rehabilitation, would require a modification to the Project, and/or prevent the Project from being completed in accordance with the plans and specifications, dated XXXX , and executed by, and referred to in the Construction Contract (the ``Plans and Specifications'').] [8. [Insert if There is no Zoning Endorsement Incorporated into the Title Policy] The attached Zoning Certificate states that the Property appears on the zoning maps of [Property Jurisdiction] as being located in a XXXX zone. According to the zoning ordinance of the Property Jurisdiction, the use of the Property as a XXXX is a permitted use in such zone. ␣␣␣or Based solely on the zoning Certificate, the Property may be used for XXXX as a permitted use.] [9. [Use for New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation in Cases Where HUD Does Not Receive a Certificate Directly from the Professional] Based solely on the Certificate, construction/rehabilitation of the Project in accordance with the Plans and Specifications will comply with all applicable land use and zoning requirements.] 10. Based solely upon (a) our [my] knowledge and (b) the Owner's Opinion Certification, the execution and delivery of the Capital Advance Documents and Collateral Documents (where applicable) will not: (i) cause the Owner to be in violation of, or constitute a default under the provisions of, any agreement to which the Owner is a party or by which the Owner is bound, (ii) conflict with, or result in the breach of, any court judgment, decree or order of any governmental body to which the Owner is subject, and (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge, or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the Owner, except as specifically contemplated by the Capital Advance Documents or Collateral Documents. 11. Based solely upon (a) our [my] knowledge, (b) the Owner's Opinion Certification and (c) the Docket Search; there is no litigation or other claim pending before any court or administrative or other governmental body or threatened in writing against the Owner, or the Property, [except as identified on Exhibit XXXX ]. 12. The Mortgage is in appropriate form for recordation in XXXX [Insert Proper Name of Local Land Records Office] of XXXX [Insert County or City] of the Property Jurisdiction, and is sufficient, as to form, to create the encumbrance and security interest it purports to create in the Property. 13. Filing of the Financing Statements in the Filing Offices will perfect the security interest in the Personalty of the Owner located in the Project Jurisdiction, but only to the extent that, under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the Project Jurisdiction, a security interest in each described item of Personalty can be perfected by filing. The Filing Offices are the only offices in which the Financing Statements are required to be filed in order to perfect the security interest in the Personalty. 14. The Capital Advance does not violate the usury laws or laws regulating the use or forbearance of money of the Property Jurisdiction. 15. The laws of Property Jurisdiction govern the interpretation and the enforcement of the Capital Advance Documents and Collateral Documents (where applicable) notwithstanding that the Owner may be formed in a jurisdiction other than Property Jurisdiction. The Owner can sue and be sued in Property Jurisdiction, including without limitation, a suit on the Note or a foreclosure proceeding arising under the Security Instrument. Venue for any foreclosure proceeding under the Security Instrument may be had in Property Jurisdiction. [16. [Applies to Cases Where the Land is Being Purchased From a Public Body] There is no default under the Public Entity Purchase Agreement, and construction in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and within the time frame specified in the Construction Contract will not lead to a default under the Public Entity Purchase Agreement. [Reliance is Permitted on the Basis of Knowledge and Owner's Certificate] [17. [Applies to Cases Where the Project is in an Urban Renewal Area] There is no default under the Land Disposition Contract between XXXX and XXXX , dated XXXX and the time within which construction must be completed under the Capital Advance Agreement is within the time specified for completion in said Land Disposition Contract.] In addition to the assumptions set forth above, the opinions set forth above are also subject to the following qualifications: (i) The Uniform Commercial Code of the Property Jurisdiction requires the periodic filing of continuation statements with XXXX [and XXXX ] not more than XXXX prior to and not later than the expiration of the XXXX year period from the date of filing of the Financing Statements and the expiration of each subsequent XXXX year period after the original filing, in order to maintain the perfection and priority of security interests and to keep the Financing Statements in effect. (ii) We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the Property Jurisdiction and [and the Organizational Jurisdiction, if it is different,] and the laws of the United States of America. The opinions expressed above concern only the effect of the laws (excluding the principles of conflict of laws) of the Property Jurisdiction [and the Organizational Jurisdiction, if it is different] and the United States of America as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date of this opinion, or if we become aware of any facts that might change the opinions expressed above after the date of this opinion.
