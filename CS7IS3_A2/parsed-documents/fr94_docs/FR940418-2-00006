FR940418-2-00006 FR940418-2-00005 International Trade Administration [C&hyph;475&hyph;812] Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel From Italy AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annika L. O'Hara or David R. Boyland, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4198 and (202) 482&hyph;0588, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: The Department determines that benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Italy of grain-oriented electrical steel. For information on the estimated net subsidy, please see the Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice. Case History Since the publication of the preliminary determination in the Federal Register on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4682), the following events have occurred. We conducted verification of the responses submitted on behalf of the Government of Italy (``GOI''), ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), and the European Community (``EC'') from February 7 through February 21, 1994. On March 22 and March 28, 1994, we received case and rebuttal briefs, respectively, from petitioners and respondents. Neither petitioners nor respondents requested a hearing in this investigation. On March 29, 1994, we returned to petitioners certain factual information submitted in their briefs because it was untimely pursuant to ยง355.31(a)(i) of the Department's regulations. Scope of Investigation This investigation concerns the following class or kind of merchandise: grain-oriented electrical steel (``electrical steel'') from Italy. The product covered by this investigation is grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which is a flat-rolled alloy steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.56 millimeter, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, as currently classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') under item numbers 7225.10.0030, 7226.10.1030, 7226.10.5015, and 7226.10.5065. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Injury Test Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') is required to determine whether imports of electrical steel from Italy materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On October 12, 1993, the ITC preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of the subject merchandise (58 FR 54168, October 20, 1993). Corporate History of Respondent ILVA Prior to 1987, electrical steel in Italy was produced by Terni S.p.A. (``Terni''), a main operating company of Finsider. Finsider was a government-owned holding company which controlled all state-owned steel companies in Italy. In a restructuring of the Italian steel industry in 1982, Terni took over two plants, Lovere and Trieste, from Nuova Italsider, another Finsider-owned steel producer. As part of a subsequent restructuring in 1987, Terni transferred its assets to a new company, Terni Acciai Speciali (``TAS'') which thereafter held all the assets for electrical steel production in Italy. As part of the restructuring, Lovere and Trieste became TAS' two principal subsidiaries.
