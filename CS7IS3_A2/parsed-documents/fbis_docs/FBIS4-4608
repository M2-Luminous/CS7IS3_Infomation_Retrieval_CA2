They continued the protest for more than one hour, shouting "We oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles" and "Yankee go home". Meanwhile, an estimated 2,000 students, at the second congress of deputies to Hanchongnyon held at Pusan National University on April 2 and 3, unanimously resolved to check a "parliamentary ratification" of farm market opening, accusing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of opening the market. They decided to hold a mass rally in Seoul, stage a boycott at all universities and colleges across South Korea and launch into an indefinite hunger sit-down of some 200 Hanchongnyon cadres in front of the puppet National Assembly hall, with the "extraordinary National Assembly session" due in mid-April, to carry their resolve into practice. It was also decided at the congress to hold an all-citizens rally against the farm market opening.
