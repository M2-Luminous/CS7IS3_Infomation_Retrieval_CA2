These 20 characters precisely show the relationship between reform, development, and stability. In recent years economic development in Jiangsu and Shandong have greatly attracted the people's attention. To know how they interpret and handle these relationships, we interviewed Chen Huanyou, deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] as well as governor and party secretary of Jiangsu Province, and Zhao Zhihao, NPC deputy and governor of Shandong Province. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Secretary Chen, would you please tell us your opinion on how to effectively handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability in view of Jiangsu's practical situation? [Chen] Yes, I would be very happy to answer your question. Reform, development, and stability are closely related. They complement and promote one another. They are three important aspects in our overall work, and can be seen as an entirety because they dovetail with one another. Reform is the motive force of development, and development and reform are the foundation of social stability. Maintaining social stability is the prerequisite for promoting development and accelerating reform. Over the past year, Jiangsu developed its economy, made major strides in reform and opening up, enjoyed social stability, improved the people's lives, and coordinated and promoted reform, development, and stability simultaneously. This year is an important year for us to accelerate reform. In light of Jiangsu's practical situation, we must first consider giving reform a special position, seizing current favorable opportunities, and mobilizing the broad masses of cadres and people to enthusiastically participate in and support reform. We should effectively resolve problems arising in the course of economic construction and reform in Jiangsu by deepening reform and accelerating development. Second, we should pay attention to raising the quality and efficiency of economic development and establish the idea in all fields that development is the final word. We should proceed from actual conditions. We cannot place undue emphasis on output value and blindly vie for the growth rate. Third, stability is a major event vital to the overall situation. While we should seize the opportunity of development, we should also thoroughly estimate and promptly discover difficulties and problems during the course of economic advance. We should conduct bold analysis, do a good job, and effectively deal with various contradictions and problems. [Correspondent] Governor Zhao Zhihao, please tell us how Shandong handles the relationship between reform, development, and stability. [Zhao] All right. To correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability, and to strive to make the three promote each other and form a single entity, is the general demand set by the CPC Central Committee for this year's work. If the relationship among the three is handled effectively, they will promote one another and enjoy coordinated development. If the relationship is handled poorly, the three could impede one another and affect the overall situation. Therefore, our provincial party committee and government have decided to give top priority to reform this year. Under a responsibility system with proper division of work, responsible comrades of the provincial party committee and government have led groups of cadres in undertaking investigations and studies at grass-roots units to find new situations and resolve new problems, have popularized the practical experiences of grass-roots units, and have provided guidance for reform. [Correspondent] Governor Zhao, if new contradictions and problems emerge in Shandong's economy, how do you deal with them? [Zhao] If the economy develops too rapidly, many new contradictions will arise and the economic relationship will tend to be tense. For this reason, we generally do not demand administrations at lower levels to reach certain goals or accomplish certain tasks. All we emphasize is reforming the economic structure, carrying out technical transformation, and improving economic efficiency. In this way, we allow lower-level administrations more leeway in avoiding tense economic relationships. When making reform plans, we take the timing and scale of reform into consideration in order to make the plans feasible. Regarding social stability, we stress managing society according to law. At the same time, we undertake publicity and education campaigns among the broad masses of people in various fields to dissolve contradictions and arouse their initiative. We are especially concerned about those enterprises with difficulties in production and those operating at a loss; we would help them. We would also help people in disaster and poverty-stricken areas to improve their production and living standards. [end recording]
