FR940728-2-00056 FR940728-2-00043 Functions for the New Office Tribal representatives to the TOC have suggested that it is critical for the new Office to have flexibility to develop its specific Action Agenda after it is officially established. Therefore, some of the key functions envisioned for the new Office are identified here in general terms. The Agency expects that the new Office will further refine and develop these functions while establishing a more detailed Action Agenda. Following is a list of key functions the Agency believes to be critical for the new Office. Function 1._Implementation of Policies The Agency believes that a main function of the Office should be to ensure that the 1994 Presidential Memorandum addressing Tribal program implementation and the Agency's recently reaffirmed 1984 Indian Policy are fully implemented. These documents both recognize Tribal sovereignty and call for a government-to-government relationship with Tribes. The Office should also ensure that other Agency policies affecting Tribes are being implemented responsibly, and that Tribal operations continue to be a priority Agency wide. The new Office should review and update existing Agency guidance that relates to Tribes, in order to facilitate the full implementation of these policies. Function 2._Develop Environmental Workplans In order for EPA and Tribes to plan for and respond effectively to Tribal environmental problems requiring action, the Agency and the Tribes need to establish a baseline description and evaluation of the types of environmental problems, the seriousness of such problems and Tribal priorities for action. To accomplish this, the Agency is recommending the formulation of individual Tribal workplans or strategies for responding to environmental problems. To facilitate and support these workplans, each EPA Regional Administrator would retain flexibility to determine, in consultation with the Tribes, the most appropriate manner to develop these workplans. Workplans should include the Tribe's plans to manage authorized environmental programs and/or their need for Federal technical assistance and funding, direct Federal implementation and management of specific programs. These Tribal workplans would be the basis for region specific workplans upon, which in turn, a national EPA Tribal operations workplan would be based. A Tribal representative to the TOC asked that funding for needs assessments be made available to Tribes in order to build a foundation of information upon which to base Tribal workplans. The commentor further suggested that EPA and the Tribes jointly develop a model to provide initial guidance for workplan development. The Agency is considering how this might be done. Commentors have also suggested that the Agency must set realistic schedules for completing these workplans. The Agency specifically solicits comments on how long it would take for such Tribal workplans to be completed and ideas on effective approaches for assessing Tribal needs. Finally, the Agency believes it is important to be cognizant of the fact that workplan development is likely to identify needs that cannot be met immediately with available funding and that a Tribal/EPA strategic approach to meeting needs over time will be required. Comments on how these decisions can be developed and managed are specifically solicited. Function 3._Ensuring Consistency The Office should coordinate the Agency's Indian operations to ensure an appropriate level of consistency throughout the programs and regions in the areas of policy, guidance, program implementation and regulatory and legislative initiatives. To assist Tribes and EPA managers, the Office should develop a compendium of Agency policies and statements concerning Indian matters. Further, the Office may develop regulations and legislative initiatives of a multi-media nature relating to Tribes. The Office should work with the Office of General Counsel, other appropriate Agency parties and Federally recognized Tribes to review Federal environmental laws, regulations, policies and guidance to strengthen, coordinate and ensure consistency with EPA's Indian Policy, and the Federal trust responsibility to Tribes. This review should foster improvements to Agency Tribal operations leading to effective program delivery while maintaining sufficient flexibility to meet Tribal needs. Function 4._Budget and Resource Development A function of the Office should be coordination and development of budget proposals to meet the Agency's and Tribal environmental program resource needs. The Office should also work to ensure appropriate management and staff to support Tribal operations. Resource proposals should be sufficient to ensure the success of Tribal environmental programs and to carry out EPA program responsibilities in a manner consistent with Federal law. Function 5._General Assistance Grant Oversight, Grant Flexibility and Streamlining The new Office should oversee the General Assistance Grant Program to assist Tribes in building capacity to manage environmental programs, and should, to the extent allowed under law, use the flexibility in this program as broadly as possible to meet Tribal needs. The new Office may develop recommendations for statutory changes in granting authorities to permit Tribal block grants and to explicitly authorize the use of the General Assistance Grants, where practicable, for a full range of implementation activities. However, growth in the General Assistance Grant Program should not lead to any diminishing of available funds from specific program grants such as Section 106 Water Quality Management grants under the Clean Water Act. Finally, given that most Tribes have a small environmental staff, if any, to manage various program-specific grants, it is important to increase the efficient use of limited resources. The Office should work with other EPA Senior Management to use available discretion to consolidate (to the extent allowed by law), issuance and administration of grants to reduce the burden on Tribes. Function 6._Promote Agency Wide Participation in Tribal Operations The Office should promote Agency-wide participation in the development and implementation of Tribal environmental programs. The new Office should chair the National Indian Workgroup which is made up of EPA Headquarters Program Coordinators and Regional Indian Program Coordinators. The new Office should also coordinate with EPA National Indian Attorneys Workgroup to ensure consistency in legal matters. Function 7._Reporting Systems and Feedback Mechanisms Another key function of the Office would be to expand, establish, where necessary, and oversee internal Agency reporting requirements. Feedback should be provided to EPA management and staff through tracking and reporting systems that monitor progress, yet are not overly demanding on limited Tribal government staff and resources. Principles of partnership should be considered while coordinating joint management of oversight activities. To facilitate the collection of baseline data, and other periodic data concerning Tribal capacity development, program authorization and EPA direct implementation and management activities, the new Office should work with Assistant and Regional Administrators to develop a regular reporting system and schedules for a variety of Indian Program activities and milestones. A Tribal representative has suggested that criteria through which Tribal environmental programs can be judged to be sufficient need to be developed as a benchmark for both Tribes and EPA to measure and evaluate their progress in a consistent manner. Further, the commentor calls for the new Office to conduct periodic workshops and evaluations in the regions with Tribes to provide feedback and to be accessible to the Tribes in the field. Reviewers are specifically asked to comment upon appropriate forms of reporting and methods of evaluation likely to be most effective. The Agency is considering these suggestions.
