Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are likely to go well, Han told reporters in Brussels, where he presided over an annual meeting of Korean envoys serving in Europe. The North's reaction cannot but be limited, particularly since China is urging acceptance of nuclear inspections, he noted. The foreign minister reiterated that Seoul will keep dialogue channels open with Pyongyang to prevent the nuclear issue from entering a critical phase. He added that the inter-Korean envoy exchange was withdrawn as a precondition to further Pyongyang-Washington talks for that very reason. In his opening address at the envoy meeting, Han said Seoul will draw up proper environmental, labor and economic policies to work within the World Trade Organization after the Uruguay Round's conclusion.
