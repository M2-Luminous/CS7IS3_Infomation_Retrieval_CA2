Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner for information and communications, said yesterday that as well as admitting four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, the Union should offer part membership to countries in East Europe. Mr Pinheiro, a former Portuguese foreign minister, was speaking as talks to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden approach a climax this weekend. He said in Brussels that the inevitable opening up of the Union would require far-reaching changes to the Maastricht Treaty. He insisted that as the Union expanded, there would be pressure to remove the power of individual governments to veto a majority of states moving to closer integration. The Commission has in effect fired the first shot in what promises to be a controversial debate about how far, and how fast, the EU should move towards federal-style political union when the Maastricht Treaty is revised in two years' time. "With enlargement about to happen, it is essential that we now begin the debate about institutional change," Mr Pinheiro said. "There are precedents for allowing some countries to move ahead while others stay behind." He added that excluding defence from the Union in the Maastricht Treaty had been "a great mistake, which will probably be rectified in 1996." His remarks will alert those in the British Government who want to ensure that constitutional changes continue to be subject to national veto. But Britain is aware that if it opposes a system under which countries are allowed to opt out of specific new EU commitments, others will point out that this was precisely what John Major won for Britain in respect of social policy at Maastricht. "The attitude to European Union membership appears to have changed recently in some of the EFTA candidate countries because of what may be called the Zhirinovskiy factor" -- the rise of Russian nationalism -- Mr Pinheiro said. "We may soon have no option but to offer countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic membership of at least two of the three pillars of the EU." He said that while the economic problems of the East European countries made complete integration in the EU unlikely in the short term, they should be allowed to take part in decisions affecting foreign, security and eventually defence policy as well as justice, immigration and the interior. Under the Maastricht Treaty these, unlike other issues, are matters for joint decision by member states. At the end of talks in Brussels yesterday, all but a handful of issues dividing the EU and the four EFTA countries had been resolved. Problems remain in agriculture, transit rights for lorries through the Alps and (with Norway) fishing rights. "It is touch and go whether an agreement will be reached in time for the European Parliament to approve enlarging the European Union from 12 to 16 member states this summer," one EU diplomat said yesterday. If final European Parliament ratification of the enlargement agreements is delayed until the autumn, the four new members may not be able to join by the agreed deadline of January 1995. But Austria, Finland and Sweden seem certain to join by July next year, although the outcome of any referendum in Norway is still in doubt. The three Nordic governments will meet in Helsinki on Friday [25 February] to plan tactics for what promises to be a marathon final negotiating session in Brussels this weekend.
