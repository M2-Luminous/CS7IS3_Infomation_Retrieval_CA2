FR940111-0-00052 FR940111-0-00015 Also, the Illinois DOT cites the House Conference Committee Report which accompanied the final version of the Act as evidence that sanctions are to be limited to nonattainment areas [H. Rep. No. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 335&hyph;6; Cong. Rec. H13101, 13197; Oct. 26, 1990; 1990 U.S. Code Cong. & Adm. News 3385, 3867&hyph;8 (Discussing imposition of sanctions ``*␣*␣* in an area that fails to prepare or implement a plan to attain air quality standards. *␣*␣*'')]. Response. To address the concerns of all five commenters, EPA believes that section 110(m) and section 179, although interrelated, do set up two distinct sanctions processes. In general, section 179 provides for mandatory sanctions with respect to failures under part D (in general, the nonattainment area provisions). As provided in the proposed rule, section 179 focuses on nonattainment areas in several respects (see 57 FR 44536&hyph;37). First, the general introductory language of section 179(a) provides that sanctions must be imposed for a failure with respect to ``*␣*␣* any implementation plan or plan revision required under this part. *␣*␣*'' The provision is referring to part D of title I, the portion of the Act dealing with nonattainment area requirements. While some part D requirements may also apply to attainment areas in limited circumstances, the primary focus of part D is nonattainment areas. Second, the highway sanction language expressly limits the application of sanctions under section 179(a) to nonattainment areas. Finally, the offset sanction requires new or modified sources in complying with the requirements of section 173 to increase their offsets to 2:1. Typically, only sources in nonattainment areas need to comply with section 173 and, therefore, in most instances the offset sanction will only affect sources in nonattainment areas. For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 179(a) does not require statewide imposition of sanctions. On the other hand, section 110(m) clearly provides for the imposition of sanctions beyond nonattainment areas. The express language of section 110(m) provides that the Administrator may impose sanctions on ``*␣*␣* any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and appropriate. *␣*␣*'' Beyond that, section 110(m) provides for the discretionary imposition of sanctions for a finding that an area has failed to meet any requirement with respect to any ``plan or plan item'' under the Act. Such requirements could apply to nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified areas. Although section 110(m) refers to the sanctions established in section 179(b), there is no language stating that the geographical limitations in section 179 override section 110(m)'s express authorization for sanctions on any part of the State that EPA determines reasonable and appropriate. Section 110(m) refers only to the sanctions themselves, not the accompanying limitations. For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 110(m) does establish its own geographic scope. The Virginia DOT suggests that EPA should limit application of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment area to circumstances where there is a lack of good faith. While EPA may take good faith into consideration in determining the geographic scope of section 110(m) sanctions, EPA does not agree that it should establish lack of good faith as a prerequisite for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment area.
