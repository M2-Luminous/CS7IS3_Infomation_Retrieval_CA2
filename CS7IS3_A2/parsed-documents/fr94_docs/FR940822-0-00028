Fuel means gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel (including after September 30, 1995, commercial aviation fuel). Gasoline means_ (1) All products (including gasohol) that are commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline and are suitable for use as a motor fuel (other than products that are not sold as gasoline and have an American Society for Testing Materials octane number of less than 75 as determined by the motor method); and (2) Gasoline blend stocks (as defined in §48.4081&hyph;1(j) of this chapter).

(a) Fuels subject to tax. Section 13241(h)(1) of the Act imposes a floor stocks tax on gasoline (including gasohol), diesel fuel, and aviation fuel_ (1) On which tax was imposed under section 4081 or 4091 before October 1, 1993; and (2) That is held at the first moment of October 1, 1993, by any person. (b) Rate of tax. The rate of the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. (c) Person liable for tax. The person liable for tax on any fuel subject to the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of October 1, 1993. Fuel is held by a person if the person has title to the fuel (whether or not delivery to that person has been made) at such time, as determined under applicable local law. §47.3&hyph;4 Exceptions to the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. (a) Exception for fuel held for an exempt use _(1) Gasoline. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to gasoline held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section apply: (i) An exempt use, with respect to gasoline, is any use of gasoline (other than use in producing gasohol) that is described in section 6420, 6421, or 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4081. Thus, for example, exempt use of gasoline includes use on a farm for farming purposes; use in an off-highway business use; use in certain intercity, local, and school buses; exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit educational organization; and use in commercial aircraft. (ii) Gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use only if the person that holds gasoline at the first moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the gasoline in an exempt use. (iii) Gasoline is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the gasoline is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the gasoline in an exempt use). Thus, for example, gasoline held by a gasoline service station for sale to a farmer for use on a farm for farming purposes is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the farmer would be eligible to claim an income tax credit for an amount equal to the tax under sections 34 and 6420.
