Shirinskaya, professor of the Finance Academy of the Russian Federation Government, under the rubric "Commentary by a Specialist": "On Banks' Transition to International Accounting Standards"] [Text] A shortage of skilled banking personnel, an obsolete chart of accounts, and the absence of a clear-cut regulatory base for the accounting and documentation of certain banking operations are problems that banks are encountering in the area of organization of accounting. A similar problem exists in methodological support for analysis of financial reports by banks. Under the new conditions, banking personnel should not only ensure that operations are reflected in accounts correctly, that is, that account-keeping is expert and professional, but also be capable of analyzing the financial reports they compile, thus participating in the management of the bank. The difficult financial conditions under which domestic commercial banks operate at present: the inflationary depreciation of credit resources and equity capital, the stringent, restrictive policy of the Central Bank geared toward the contraction of credit resources and limitations on credit outlays, a tax policy that is not conducive to the development of banking--all these factors are prompting banking personnel to search for new ways to "survive," which in turn call for complex accounting solutions, choices, and substantiations of the patterns for registering operations which are new in principle in balance-sheet accounts. Among them is documentation of direct correspondent accounts which make it possible to solve the problem of not only speeding up client settlements but to a certain degree also those of interbank credit and the optimal centralized resource reservation. As a rule, these operations are combined with trust services to manage funds in clients' settlement and current accounts. It is necessary for banking personnel to grasp the essence and economic advantages of new technologies and management patterns for resources, liquidity, and risk, and their professional registration in balance-sheet reports. Deficiencies in the regulatory base for resolving many technical issues in bank accounting are expressed, in particular, in the failure to develop a mechanism for writing off long-defaulted loans and to determine the timing of such write-offs or for registering the sources of write-offs on the balance sheet (credit risk funds or the account "Profits and losses," as well as the schedule for accrual of interest on long-defaulted loans). It should also be kept in mind that banks are operating in an extremely difficult foreign economic environment with heightened risk. As a result, their credit portfolio is burdened by poor-quality credit. Credit personnel repeatedly prolongate poor-quality loans; they are not documented on the relevant balance-sheet accounts for the registration of defaulted loans. Bank reports documenting credit risks are becoming less and less authentic in this regard; their quality is deteriorating. In a number of banks, accounting personnel abandon the existing favorable tradition to participate in the monitoring of timely repayment of loans, their prolongation, or their assignment to the account of defaulted loans. The accounting of time obligations off the balance sheet, which was previously commonly accepted by banks, largely facilitated the performance of this monitoring function; a number of banks have recently abandoned such accounting without justification. As a result, operations to issue, repay, or prolong loans are concentrated in the hands of a narrow circle of individuals in credit directorates, which does not further the interests of either authentic reporting or bank security. Accounting in commercial banks should be uniform, and should comply with international standards. The Central Bank has been taking clearly inadequate measures to speed up the transition to international accounting standards, to develop a banking infrastructure, and to ensure the security of document circulation. Perceiving tremendous financial losses due to the infiltration of forged advice notes, orders, checks, and so on into the circulation of documents, commercial banks are just beginning to engage in systematic work on comprehensive security, including computer security. In view of inadequate preparations and the absence of the necessary prerequisites for a transition to international accounting standards in commercial banks, two versions of proposals are being introduced: either incentives from the Central Bank for the voluntary assumption by the banks of obligations to switch to worldwide standards, or the use of just some of the standards used in world practice in the operations of domestic commercial banks. It appears that the latter noncomprehensive approach may entail unfavorable consequences. Thus, if reserves are not set aside in line with credit risk, the volume of reserves is understated, and simultaneously, accounting for defaulted loans is abandoned, and the loan obligations are practiced [as published] repeatedly and without substantiation, bank reports will not reflect real credit risks, and the balance will cease to be authentic. The transition to international accounting standards by banks calls for producing, as soon as possible, a regulatory document on the organization of accounting at commercial banks which would be in line with banking legislation in effect. "Accounting and Reporting Rules" approved in 1987 are clearly obsolete and run counter to some of the laws of Russia, in particular, the Basic Civil Legislation, the Law "On Property in the Russian Federation," and the Law "On Banks and Banking." The accounting rules provide the basis for the right of the Central Bank to debit funds from correspondent accounts of commercial banks without acceptance, which runs counter to the laws in question. According to legislation in effect, money can be debited from a correspondent bank account only on instructions from the bank itself or by decision of a people's court or arbitration panel. The right to debit without acceptance is actually assigned by the Central Bank to other organizations. In particular, in 1993 the Cash Union in Moscow enjoyed this right, which caused a strain on liquidity for many banks and ultimately resulted in large losses. As can be seen, implementation of the transition to international accounting standards by banks has begun under difficult conditions for their operations. However, the issue of the need to harmonize accounting also affects banks in conjunction with the appearance of their most successfully operating segment on the world market and the inclusion of Russia in the process of worldwide economic integration. At the end of 1993 commercial banks embarked, on an experimental basis, on drawing up new financial reports and switching to new accounting standards. The task of improving the quality of accounting and the authenticity and dependability of bank reporting should be accomplished simultaneously. Some of the main accounting principles highlighting world standards are outlined below. 1. Continuity of operations. In keeping with this standard, rules for keeping accounting records do not change if a bank plans to continue its operations in the foreseeable future and is not slated for liquidation. In the event of the projected elimination of branches or the sale of an asset, reports should reflect the hidden loss that will occur if the sales value of the assets in question turns out to be less than the residual value. 2. Fiscal year distribution. Implementation of this principle requires that the banks register proceeds and expenditures as they are made, regardless of the time of the actual receipt of funds. Implementation of this principle will necessitate opening and keeping a new balance-sheet account "Accumulated profit plus deferred expenditures." The reporting of the bank should, as of 31 December, indicate and register in the above account the accruing interest proceeds for the entire reporting month or year (rather than for the status as of 20 December, as is the case now). In the process, the client continues to pay accrued interest once a month (for example, on the 20th day of each month). At the same time, the cumulative interest outlay, regardless of the time of payment of interest on deposits, should be reflected in the above account in correspondence with the profit and loss account. 3. Prudence. The principle of prudence requires that the assets and liabilities of banks be appraised realistically, with a sufficient degree of prudence, in order not to carry already existing risk over into subsequent years. This is particularly topical for Russian banks because it induces them to project credit risk and stimulates the generation of reserve funds that are adequate for the risk in terms of volume and timing. In 1994 this principle was accepted by the Central Bank, and its implementation in the practice of commercial banks was recommended. With a view to accounting for credit risk provisions, account No. 945, with the same name, shall be opened on the balance sheets of banks; a reserve is generated out of operating expenditures (it does not influence the size of the base of taxation). The initial experience of reserve fund generation by commercial banks has revealed two problems. These are the striving to understate credit risk and, correspondingly, the size of reserve funds. In turn, this is largely due to the procedure for the generation of the fund established by the Central Bank according to which the volume of taxes paid by banks is not reduced, but the incentive funds and the dividend on shares are diminished. As a result, the entire effort to set aside reserve funds with a view to protecting the banks against the possible late repayment of loans by borrowers may turn out to be ineffective. Meanwhile, in international accounting, accounting entries for reserves of all types are made at the time the corresponding risks emerge, regardless of the availability or sufficiency of profits. According to international standards, profits cannot depend on tax policy, and tax rules should not influence accounting procedures for the operations of the bank. It should be taken into account that banks operate in a difficult economic environment, and that the bulk of the risk is associated precisely with economic instability. Under the circumstances, there are no adequate grounds for the recommendation of the Central Bank concerning the creation of credit risk reserves after determination of the base of taxation. Such reserves should be generated out of expenditures prior to determination of the base of taxation, in an amount in line with the risk. Implementation of other international accounting standards, such as priority of content over form, constancy of accounting methods, openness (transparency), consolidation, and substantiveness will require great and serious effort and a high degree of professionalism on the part of accounting personnel. It is regrettable that the Central Bank refused to implement an international accounting standard proposed by the World Bank which requires that appropriate adjustments in reporting be made for the index of inflationary depreciation in the environment of hyperinflation (when the total rate of inflation in three years exceeds 100 percent). The transition to international accounting standards should be accompanied by drawing up new financial reports. It includes a balance sheet drawn up on the basis of aggregated asset and liability items, an off-balance sheet report, and explanatory memorandums which should outline the bank's analytical effort to classify the credit portfolio and determine reserves and to manage resources, risk, and proceeds. Loans (time and defaulted loans) should be presented in the balance-sheet report as a single, joint total. Procedures for accrual of interest on defaulted loans for a limited period of time (30 days) are established. This gives banks the incentive to write off their balance sheets long-defaulted loans and paper proceeds (account 943 is overloaded with such proceeds at a number of banks) and thus makes it possible to make bank reports healthier and more authentic. In this reference, it is absolutely obvious that commercial banks need to speed up the process of transition to worldwide accounting standards which make it possible to obtain authentic financial reports and, therefore, improve the quality of bank management.
