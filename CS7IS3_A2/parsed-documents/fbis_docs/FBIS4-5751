FBIS4-5751 "dreas071_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tokyo Counters U.S. Claims on Trade Barriers Tokyo Counters U.S. Claims on Trade Barriers OW1304114994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1134 GMT 13 Apr 94 OW1304114994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The Japanese Government has presented to the United States a set of comments to counter the latest U.S. report that found Japan guilty of unfair trade practices in many industrial sectors, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday [13 April]. "The (U.S.) report contains certain assertions which the U.S. has already withdrawn during the framework negotiations, including its claim that Japan's market has low level of penetration by foreign goods and services compared to the Group of Seven average," said the document that lists the comments, which was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The comments were prepared by the Foreign Ministry and submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Tuesday, said the ministry official, who declined to be named. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) released the 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers at the end of March, a hit list that devoted 44 pages of its 281-page report to cite what it views as Tokyo's unfair trade practices, covering 43 areas in seven industrial sectors. The latest Japanese comments are designed to demonstrate that "Tokyo is doing what it should do" in order to further open its markets, another official at the Foreign Ministry said. In the comments, Japan argued that "the reliability" of the statistics used in the USTR report for asserting Japan's market is closed must be examined in thorough discussions, along with "justification of the definition of competitiveness." "Without such justification and appropriateness attached, this kind of U.S. approach in the report is too simplistic and will not be acceptable," the comments said. The comments answered U.S. claims on Japan's 11 industrial sectors, including three priority areas covered under the Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks -- insurance, autos and auto parts, and government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications. In the comments, Japan dismissed Washington's perception of past foreign entry into Japanese markets, saying, "it should be also recognized that the past Japan-U.S. arrangements have met with `tangible results'." Specifically, Tokyo termed as "faulty" statistics used by the U.S. in gauging the Japanese Government's procurement of foreign-made computers. Because of Japan's market-opening efforts, a "steady increase" has been recorded in the share of foreign computers in government procurement, from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991 to 18.9 percent in fiscal 1992, including that of the central government entities, which expanded from 4.7 percent to 11.7 percent, the document said. On government procurement of telecommunications equipment, the document said the U.S. assertion that the Japanese market is closed in terms of the G-7 average is erroneous. Excluding equipment purchases made by the private sector, which was what the USTR counted in the latest report, the foreign share is much higher at 0.6 percent in 1991 in the Japanese market than the 0.07 percent in the U.S., the document said. Measures to improve Japan's government procurement procedures for the telecom sector as called for by Washington in the USTR report are all covered by Tokyo's market-opening package unveiled at the end of March, the document said. The document also blasted the U.S. view of Japan's efforts to open its insurance market. The March market-opening package responded to the majority of the insurance issues raised by Washington, it said. Moreover, the document described insurance regulations in the U.S. as being "by far stricter" than those in Japan. It explained that the U.S. system, regulated on a state-by-state basis, "puts heavy burdens on foreign insurance providers by requiring enormous time and cost for obtaining licenses." In addition, U.S. branches of foreign insurance providers are discriminated against vis-a-vis domestic insurance providers by the imposition of financial requirements in such areas as trusteed assets, the document said. "Such discriminatory treatment does not exist in Japan," it said. This year's USTR report takes on a significant meaning for Japan's trade ties with Washington because issues dealt with in the report could possibly be subjected to retaliatory tariffs under the recently revived U.S. trade provision known as Super 301. Under the provision, Washington will identify foreign trade barriers using the USTR findings. The U.S. would then have until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority countries it says are engaged in unfair trading.
