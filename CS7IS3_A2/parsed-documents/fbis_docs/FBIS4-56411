Ramirez de Estenoz told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba was selected to preside over a special group, including Syria, Tunisia, and a UN official, to negotiate in the name of the UN's decolonization committee at the Bridgetown session. "It has to do with consulations on a very important and delicate topic, dealing with the colonial status of some member-countries of the alliance of small island states," the diplomat said. Of the 41 members of the alliance, known as AOSIS, nearly one-fifth still maintain a colonial status. In the Caribbean, French overseas territories (Martinique and Guadeloupe), Montserrat, Anguila, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos, and the Virgin Islands have not yet gained independence. One of the problems that makes the UN decolonization committee's work difficult is that in most of these territories, under colonial tutelage economic development prospects, future independence is unfavorable in the current international situation. In Anguila and Bermuda, several plebiscites have resulted in majority votes against independence because the population considers survival in these small states unlikely without financial backing.
