The brilliant performance featured dances entitled: Emotions of Parting, Ode to the Snow Lotus, On the Tea Delivery Path, and Footsteps to the Police Camp, and other programs reflecting the highland-based armed police officers and men's sensational fighting spirit in taking a foothold on the borderland and safeguarding Tibet's stability; their heroism in fearlessly taking on dangers when fighting enemies; and harmonious relations between the police and the people. In addition, traditional folk cultural and art programs such as Sausage or Shoe, Lovers Under the Moon, (Arxie), and A True Man of Flesh and Blood, expressing the Tibetan nation's spiritual aspects, natural conditions and social customs, and working life were performed. Revolutionary songs such as Chairman Mao Zedong Sends People Here and popular army songs such as Telling You My Innermost Thoughts and Feelings, Devote My Deep Love to the Great Party, Song of Praise for the Heroes, and The Long Great Wall, added a passionate atmosphere to the performance. These cultural and art programs were put together by the TRPAPC political department's song and dance ensemble after two months of rehearsal which formally began on 21 April. After the show, Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, Guo Jinlong, and other regional leaders walked onto the stage and cordially shook hands with all performers and stage workers, and extended their congratulations.
