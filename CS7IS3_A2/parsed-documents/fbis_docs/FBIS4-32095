On the other hand, the number of conflicts between local self-government structures and the central administration has increased. What is happening here? [Kalina] When I was starting in my post of the Voivodship Office director, the process of decentralization of the existing range of powers and administrative competence was very rapid. Nowadays, these changes have, as it were, been suspended in a vacuum. For example, the pace of work on the pilot reform program has decelerated, as has that on the reform of the country's administrative division system. On the other hand, local self-government bodies had earlier secured a range of powers and competence of which they cannot now take full advantage because the necessary funds for the implementation of these powers have not followed in the wake of the legislation. In addition, the question of a clear and lucid division of competence between the central and local administration is also still unclear in many points. Consequently, it is not surprising that conflicts arise. [Winiarski] Is Szczecin Voivodship particularly prone to frequent occurrences of such conflicts? Are they justified? [Kalina] On the whole, as regards the quality of the central administration's work, we are among the national champions here, but the real criterion for assessing the work of the central administration bodies is provided by the results of conflicts brought before the Supreme Administrative Court [NSA]. In that area, we have no reason for indulging in complexes. For example, last year none of our supervisory administrative decisions against which charges were brought before the NSA by local self-government bodies were actually found questionable by that court. This does not necessarily mean that all of our other decisions were invariably correct. The NSA judged that several of our administrative decisions were incorrect. This was partly the result of the complexity of our legislation and partly the fault of individual officials handling the cases. However, the vast majority of complaints are caused by the poor knowledge of our legislation prevalent among the public and the lack of understanding of the role of central government officials. Another, partial reason is that certain organizations, particularly the trade unions, subscribe to the philosophy that, if the law is unfavorable to their causes, that is just too bad for the law. [Winiarski] You mentioned mistakes made by central administration officials. How do these mistakes arise? [Kalina] First of all, they arise out of the lack of thorough briefing in the disciplines of administrative law and modern administration systems. We still suffer from the lack of a cadre of well-trained experts, who would be apolitical, assured of their job security, protected from outside pressures, and given sufficient financial security in their positions. This is our greatest problem, and it can only be solved by a new parliamentary act on public service officials. At present, we have the opposite situation, with a growing number of instances of outside pressure to bring about certain administrative decisions, and with the financial situation of the public service officials worsening steadily. In this situation, it is hardly surprising that the best experts leave the sector and the most talented graduates of higher education establishments are reluctant to join our ranks. [Winiarski] The list of complaints leveled against the central administration includes the extremely onerous and time-consuming procedure of appeals against the voivodas' decisions. It is true that cases brought before the NSA wait there for a very long time before being investigated. [Kalina] It is indeed true. At present, the nearest extramural NSA center is situated in Poznan and serves five voivodships. Consequently, cases wait for six months or more before coming up for investigation. We want to change this state of affairs and set up an independent extramural NSA center in Szczecin. All the formal criteria for doing so have been met: We have a sufficient number of cases awaiting investigation, an adequate number of experienced and highly qualified judges, and enough academics who specialize in that branch of the law. We have also been successful in "breaking the premises barrier" in Szczecin. At present, the only dilemma we still have to face is the choice of the future seat of the Szczecin extramural NSA center from the two premises offered to us. Consequently, I believe that the first cases will be heard by the center as soon as the first quarter of next year. [Winiarski] But does it guarantee that they will be investigated promptly? [Kalina] Yes, and this should be advantageous not only to those bringing the charges, but also to the central administration bodies themselves, including such special administration centers as, say, customs and excise offices and the treasury police. Nothing improves the quality of work as effectively as the awareness of the existence of rapid monitoring systems capable of checking your results. In addition, the proposed bill postulating a revision of the NSA act contains provisions on the NSA control of local legislation brought in by local administration bodies. This will in effect mark an end to the accusation leveled against us that the law set down by the voivoda is not subject to any judicial controls. [Winiarski] Have such accusations been brought against you? [Kalina] Certain people view relations between central and local administration as a platform for power struggles and fights for domination. But we are doomed to work together, and we must find a way of coexisting. The voivoda does not aspire to the role of a scourge or sword suspended above the doings of local self-government structures. Our proposals and suggestions extended to city and parish councils before they make their decisions in specific cases prove that we wish to avoid the need to waive them after the fact. This type of cooperation has proved successful with many local self-government structures, but we simply cannot avoid a certain area of conflict, especially in the sphere of finance. Unfortunately, the situation is such that the voivoda is unable to finance many projects because he himself has no adequate funds at his disposal. The funds come from the central budget and are strictly limited. [Winiarski] The voivoda also has the power to coordinate the activity of special administration structures. How are relations shaping along this line? [Kalina] They vary. For the past few years, there has been a tendency to encourage massive development of the special administration structures and multiplying the numbers of relevant institutions. Each of them is under the competence of a different institution, and, as a consequence, the voivoda is unable to coordinate the work of that sector of local administration, although he is formally obliged to do so. As a result, the decisionmaking process becomes unduly extended, the bureaucratic apparatus mushrooms, and the entire system becomes more rigid instead of more flexible. This, of course, in turn causes frequent conflicts and misunderstandings. In consequence, all the blame is heaped on us because the voivoda is the most easily accessible representative of the central administration and the government. [Winiarski] But perhaps the whole central administration is not really so very necessary? [Kalina] There is no state in the world capable of functioning well without its own internal administration. However, the secret is in getting the whole administrative machinery to function efficiently and to issue just decisions on the basis of the legislation in force. In turn, that legislation must be clear and lucid and the range of competence clearly set out and distributed, and the people who are involved in operating that system must be adequately qualified and trained.
