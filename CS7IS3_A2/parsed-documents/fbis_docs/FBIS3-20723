Vukosavljevic: "Guardians of Peace"] [Excerpts] The unit commanded by Captain First Class Jovan Adamovic is one of the newly formed units in the Niksic [Montenegro] garrison. Its task is to secure the [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] border with the neighboring republic of Srpska [Bosnia-Herzegovina], which is 150 kilometers long, and to train the soldiers it needs to carry out that assignment. We visited this unit in mid-November 1993 and discussed with its members the tasks they perform, work-related problems, and, of course, training as one of their key activities. Captain Adamovic stressed: "This unit's most important duty is to prevent the spillover and expansion of the whirlwind of war from the former Bosnia- Herzegovina to the territory of Montenegro, i.e. the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We have carried out this task in its entirety. We have safeguarded peace and barred war profiteers, smugglers, and others engaged in murky and dirty businesses." [passage omitted]
