FR940927-0-00054 FR940927-0-00007 (7) Finally, EPA stated that there appear to be no check-and-balance systems between NAMLRD and Navajo EPA, NAMLRD and the Division of Natural Resources, and NAMLRD and OSM. EPA feels systems are needed to ensure inter- and intra-governmental consistency and harmony within the Navajo Nation's various programs. SMCRA does not require coordination between Tribal agencies but does provide for interagency cooperation at section 414. The Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 provides a similar provision at section 414. Therefore, OSM responds that it is up to the Navajo Nation itself to determine how its various departments will interact, coordinate, and establish and maintain relationships that are conducive to meeting the requirements of the Navajo Nation plan. Coordination between the Tribe and OSM already occurs as required by SMCRA and the Federal regulations. OSM also responds that it provides input into these relationships through oversight of the Navajo Nation's AMLR program. Other Agencies By letter dated May 5, 1994, the Utah State Historical Society provided the concurrence of the Utah Preservation Office with the determination that no part of the amendment pertains to cultural resources (administrative record No. NA&hyph;216). The Arizona State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) responded on June 1, 1994, that it assumed OSM had the concurrence of the Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department (NNHPD) as to a determination of no effect on cultural resources under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 with respect to the consultation requirements of 36 CFR Part 800. Therefore, it would defer the determination of no effect on the NNHPD (administrative record No. NA&hyph;218). Based upon the Arizona SHPO response, OSM contacted NNHPD on June 28, 1994. NNHPD stated it had elected not to respond and presumed that OSM would proceed as if a determination of no effect was in place (administrative record No. NA&hyph;221). OSM is not aware of any adverse effects on cultural resources that would result from the proposed amendment and certification of completion of coal reclamation, and on this basis, OSM is proceeding with its decision on the Navajo Nation submission. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment as submitted on April 7 and 22, 1994. As discussed in finding No. 1.a., the Director approves nonsubstantive revisions to the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 at sections 101, 102, 401, 402, 403, 405, 407, 408, 409, 412, and 413. As discussed in finding Nos. 1.b., c., d., and e., the Director approves substantive revisions to the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 at sections 201, 401, 403, 404, 409, 410, 411, and 414. As discussed in finding Nos. 1.b and f., the Director approves substantive revisions to the Navajo Nation Rules at Section II, Parts D, L, M, N, O, and P, and Section III, Part E. The Director approves the proposed revisions of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and Navajo Nation Rules implementing the code with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the code and rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. The Director of OSM, on behalf of the Secretary, also concurs with the Navajo Nation's certification, as submitted by the Nation on May 4, 1994, that all abandoned coal mine related problems have been abated or reclaimed under its AMLR plan in accordance with Title IV of SMCRA.
