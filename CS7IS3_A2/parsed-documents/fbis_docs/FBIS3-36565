Kruglov, prosecutor of Administration for Supervision of Implementation of Laws on Federal Security and Interethnic Relations of Russian General Prosecutor's Office, by Sergey Kaverin; place and date not given: "Mr. Zhirinovskiy Might Be Arrested"] [Text] While V. Zhirinovskiy, Russia's chief liberal, was traveling around Europe making fiery speeches and generous promises, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office was actively drawing up a criminal case against him. V. Kruglov, prosecutor of the Administration for Supervision of Implementation of Laws on Federal Security and Interethnic Relations of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, gives the details on this topic. [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, does it not seem to you that the institution of criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy is a kind of act of vengeance by the pro-government forces which lost to him? [Kruglov] Certainly not. Interestingly, our administration and I personally tackled Zhirinovskiy quite a long time ago, but Vladimir Volfovich committed his main "transgressions" precisely on the eve of the elections. The grounds for instituting criminal proceedings were provided by such points as the arbitration tribunal's well-known 10 December decision and the incident which occurred between Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the night of 12-13 December. The latest episode was the book The Last Dash to the South, published by Zhirinovskiy. All these facts were examined by us as a package, and on their basis criminal proceedings were instituted under Article 71 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "war propaganda." The decision to institute criminal proceedings was adopted at the level of the leadership of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. [Kaverin] What steps will be taken in respect of Zhirinovskiy after his return from abroad? [Kruglov] First of all, the general prosecutor must decide who will investigate the criminal case which has been instituted and appoint the specific investigator and subdepartment. Then this subdepartment will begin directly conducting the investigation, naturally resolving the questions that arise within the framework of the law. The mechanism for conducting such an investigation is known: summonses, interrogations. The investigation will be conducted in full as an investigation into an ordinary criminal case. [Kaverin] As far as I know, this is something new in jurisdiction relating to relations between law-enforcement organs and deputies, is it not? [Kruglov] Yes, it is. In accordance with the new Russian Federation Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation State Duma deputy is no obstacle to the institution and investigation of a criminal case. The Constitution stipulates perfectly unequivocally and clearly that the State Duma's consent is required only for the arrest of a deputy, his search, and (or) his detention. I repeat: arrest, search, and detention. That is, a criminal case in respect of a deputy is instituted and investigated on generally applicable grounds; and with regard to the investigation, if grounds arise for a search, detention, or arrest, the general prosecutor petitions the State Duma for a particular deputy to be stripped of his immunity on the grounds of the investigation results submitted. I will remind you that previously, in accordance with the Constitution in force then, the Supreme Soviet had to ask permission to actually institute criminal proceedings against a deputy. [Kaverin] What threatens Zhirinovskiy in accordance with the new Constitution and the laws if he does not answer the summons? Knowing Vladimir Volfovich, it is not hard to imagine the reality of such a development of events. [Kruglov] At present Zhirinovskiy is formally considered a witness and is obliged by law to appear in order to testify. Juridically he is considered a witness until the moment he is charged. Therefore at first he will be summoned precisely as a witness. If he does not come, the investigator will be forced to react. How? In the event of a failure to appear without valid reason, an ordinary citizen is threatened with arrest [privod], which is carried out by militia organs. But this is an element of coercion and therefore can be qualified essentially as detention -- one of the three points (!) on which a deputy enjoys immunity. [Kaverin] You end up with a vicious circle: In order to arrest a deputy who is at fault, weighty grounds and, consequently, the State Duma's "go-ahead" are needed. In order to secure this "go-ahead," the Duma needs facts which the investigation cannot obtain from the "undisciplined" deputy.... [Kruglov] This is partly true. But take into account the fact that any criminal case is built not only on the testimony alone of the person under investigation. There must also be some other studies, materials, witnesses' testimonies, and data from expert appraisals. In principle, therefore, a sufficient quantity of proof can be gathered against an "evasive deputy" to charge him even without his "participation." I wish to repeat once again that all the aforesaid is of a purely theoretical nature, and specific questions in respect of a specific accused will be decided by the investigator who, according to the law, investigates this case and independently adopts decisions. [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how long, in your opinion, will this investigation last? [Kruglov] I do not know. This is a complex question. It depends on a huge number of circumstances.
