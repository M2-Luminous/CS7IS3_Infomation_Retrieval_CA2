Iliescu laid a wreath in the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes. The fact that the president visited the military barracks in Lipovei Street, where on 17 December 1989 13 young persons were murdered, was simply an act of defiance. During Iliescu's meeting at the County Prefect's Office, the building was "protected" by hundreds of policemen and members of the riot police. From the very beginning, while coming down the stairs of the presidential plane, Iliescu declared that he had a special interest, including a "personal" one (?!), in that town. Romania's president was present for the second time in the martyr city. His visit began with a classical working visit [reference to Ceausescu's working visits in the country], following every rule of such visits, at the first factory that lay in Iliescu's way, namely the FILTY [as published] company. Iliescu also hastily visited the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes, where he laid a wreath in a contemptuous silence. At the military barracks situated in Lipovei Street, belonging to the same unit which in 1989 December opened fire against the demonstrators thus killing 13 young persons, the military had the "honor" of personally meeting Ion Iliescu, the eminent president. The current leader of the country passed without even casting a glance at the heroes' mothers who had lined up in front of the barracks. While Iliescu was chatting amiably with the commanders of the unit, the bereaved mothers were crying at the barrack gates and chanting: "Iliescu, don't forget, Timisoara doesn't want you!" or "Let us put him on trial here, in Banat!" and "Down Iliescu!" The peak of Iliescu's visit was his meeting in the County Prefect's Office building, which was surrounded, as it had never been before, by the police and the riot police. The president was almost one full hour late. Considering the visit as an act of defiance against the dead and the wounded [in the revolution], Traian Orban, who was wounded in the bloody December, laid himself across the tram rails as a sign of protest. Inside the County Prefect's Office, which formerly used to be the headquarters of the PCR [Romanian Communist Party] Timis County branch, the president met with close aides of the former county secretary of PCR, Iliescu [sentence as published]. The atmosphere of the meeting was strained. Realizing how embarrassing the situation was, as the meeting was "populated" by former PCR officials, many people who had been invited to attend started leaving the hall. As Iliescu's memories of the "golden age" are related too much to Timisoara, the president did not have the necessary time (and desire) to meet with that county's revolutionary organizations. The presidential counselors promised them separate talks. Now, in the evening hours, while our correspondent is sending this report, the Prefect's Office building is under siege by thousands of Timisoara citizens who are booing to express their protest with respect to the presidential visit.
