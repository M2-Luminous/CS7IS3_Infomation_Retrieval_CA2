Saburov Has Problems with Crimean Parliament"] [Text] Sevastopol -- On 26 May the Crimean parliament deferred the adoption of a decision on the formation of the republic's government. Yu. Meshkov called this the third government crisis in the Crimea. After submitting to the Crimean Supreme Soviet a report on the program for a solution to the crisis, Vice Premier Ye. Saburov came under the fiercest criticism from the deputies. Deputy V. Balla, chairman of the parliamentary economy commission, called his speech "an economics lecture for first-year students." Doubts were voiced about the report's provisions on the role of the banks in the Crimean economy and its view of privatization. Moreover, he was accused of lacking confidence in local cadres of leaders and specialists, of inactivity, and of not being in charge of the situation. Deputy V. Shevza proposed that he seize the initiative and draft his own program for a way out of the crisis instead of the government. Deputies demanded that a law on the government be submitted to the Supreme Council session first, then its concept and structure, and only after that should personnel appointments be made. Crimean President Yu. Meshkov tried to convince deputies of the need for the earliest possible solution of the question of the government and asked that, in accordance with the results of an opinion poll among inhabitants of the Crimea, he be empowered to issue edicts with the force of law and form a government on the basis of the structure envisaged by an edict already issued. Yu. Meshkov said that the deputies' criticism of Ye. Saburov was unethical and premature because there is no government as such yet. Ye. Saburov himself also considered this criticism wrong because he said that it was biased, uninformed, and expressed from the Ukrainian Government's standpoint. He described how at the meeting in Moscow "the wise Ye. Zvyagilskiy had advised him not to sever ties with his institution once and for all." The deputies, however, with the active participation of the "Russia" bloc, did not support the president and deferred the question on the government. After that, deputy L. Krasnovskaya announced that she was leaving the "Russia" bloc, and Yu. Meshkov, Ye. Saburov, and all the candidates for ministerial posts ostentatiously left the hall. After examining the results of the talks in Kiev on the fate of the constitution, the Crimean Supreme Council elected its part of the general working group, which included five deputies. It also recommended that several specialists be invited to take part in its work. As for the agreed suspension of the law on the restoration of the constitution, the Crimean deputies decided not to do that for the time being but to return to the question later. Here are further details on one event. At 1600 hours on 24 May, the Sevastopol militia discovered two home-made explosive devices made from TNT cartridges weighing in total 5.2 kg, plus six detonators and 36 meters of fuse wire which had been hidden near a bridge across the Fiolentovskoye Highway. Later that night a suspicious individual was detained near the same place as he was attempting to throw an object away into the darkness. A search revealed this object to be a revolver. The detainee was searched and more fuse wire was found, identical to that found together with the concealed explosive device. The detained man was Veniamin Demin, a retired officer who hails from Moscow. He used to be a miner in a special-purpose team in Nikolayev Oblast. Back in December 1993 he was ordered to leave his permanent place of residence in Ochakov and go back to Moscow. Competent organs have confirmed the discovery and the detention. It is believed that the detained man worked for a mafia grouping and that his mission was to commit an act of terrorism, but other motives have not been ruled out. An investigation is in progress.
