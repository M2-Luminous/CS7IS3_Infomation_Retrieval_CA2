Wilkie] [Text] Dissidents who are on the run from the Chinese police say their outlawed labour organisation is getting stronger, even though two of its leaders are in jail and a third has fled the country. Liu Mianchun, who was detained briefly during the visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has so far escaped arrest while travelling in east China, gathering support for his Alliance for the Protection of Labourers Rights -- or the Labour Alliance. The Labour Alliance, which models itself on the Polish union Solidarity, claims to have a core membership in several provinces. "Give us until the end of the year, and we will have a national framework," Liu said. "We need six months to set up an organisation in every provincial capital and in the big cities," said Zhang Lin, another labour organiser who is also travelling around the country. "We are looking for people who have been in prison, who have stood up well under pressure, people with that sort of experience. We can't have weak-willed people who are going to betray their comrades and their friends," he said. The Labour Alliance says it carefully examines the qualifications of potential members and is setting up several levels of membership. The front line will campaign openly, but behind it will be second and third tiers operating covertly and waiting to take the place of the front line should its members be arrested. Faced with such an organisational structure, the Communist Party cannot fail to be aware of the parallels with its own early revolutionary years. It is impossible to gauge the support for such organisations as the Labour Alliance. Activists claim a membership of 300 but an effective police sweep of key figures -- who may total no more than a few dozen people around the country -- could probably cripple the fledgling organisation. Two organisers, Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang, are already in jail, as is Xiao Biguang, a friend of Yuan. Another organiser, Wang Jiaqi, a close colleague of the exiled labour leader Han Dongfang, was also arrested but later escaped and fled the country. Predictions that the Labour Alliance could mount a genuine challenge to the Communist Party are premature. But the Communist Party is clearly worried because it is aware that dissatisfaction among the peasantry and workers is ripe for exploitation by competing political forces. While the Labour Alliance is concentrating on the peasantry and state workers, other activists are trying to establish independent trade unions in joint ventures in China's southern boom towns, where working conditions are sometimes comparable to sweatshops. According to the activists, some smaller, pro-democracy organisations have joined the Labour Alliance. To do this, the organisations agree to give up advocacy of violence and abide by the rules of the Labour Alliance. "Some organisations don't want to give up their advocacy of violence," Zhang said. "Other people think we're too dangerous because this is organised. It is completely different from the individual dissent of the past." Support for the Labour Alliance is also coming from hitherto more conservative groups, according to labour activists. They claim that Christians are increasingly seeing political struggle as the only way ahead. Younger members of the officially-sanctioned democratic parties are increasingly frustrated by these parties' lack of substance, and are also turning to overtly pro-democracy, if illegal, organisations. It is not clear whether this is a widespread trend or just a few isolated cases of interest in the Labour Alliance. It does seem, however, that the Communist Party is eager to crack down on the unofficial church -- aware that it could become a focus for political dissatisfaction, as it did in Eastern Europe. Further evidence that the leadership is nervous as the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre approaches came from Beijing University last week. Last Monday cadres at the university, which was at the heart of the 1989 anti-government demonstrations, held a meeting at which they were told to heighten vigilance in the run-up to June 4. Although students are not known to have formed a pro-democracy organisation at the university, activists are at work, a source said. "Leaflets commemorating those who were killed on June 4, 1989, are appearing in dormitories, slipped under doors in the middle of the night," a former student, with links on the campus, said. However, pro-democracy campaigners say that much as they would like to hold protest activities around that time, security may be too tight. All state work units have been ordered to have three people -- the leader, a secretary and a driver -- on duty 24 hours a day from now until after the danger period is over. They are expected to react immediately if there are protests in the vicinity, and to keep a close eye on their own workers.
