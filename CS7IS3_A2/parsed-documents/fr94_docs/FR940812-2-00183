FR940812-2-00183 FR940812-2-00068 Proposed Generic Communication; ``Voltage-Based Repair Criteria For The Repair Of Westinghouse Steam Generator Tubes Affected By Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking'' AGENCY: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of opportunity for public comment. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to issue a generic letter. A generic letter is an NRC document that: (1) Requests licensees to submit analyses or descriptions of proposed corrective actions, or both, regarding matters of safety, safeguards, or environmental significance, or (2) requests licensees to submit information to the NRC on other technical or administrative matters, or (3) transmits information to licensees regarding approved changes to rules or regulations, the issuance of reports or evaluations of interest to the industry, or changes to NRC administrative procedures. When issued, this generic letter will provide guidance for licensees who may wish to request a license amendment to the plant technical specifications to implement an alternate steam generator tube repair limit applicable specifically to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking at the tube-to-tube support plate intersections in Westinghouse designed steam generators having drilled-hole tube support plates. This generic letter is intended to provide relief while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for licensees having steam generators experiencing this particular degradation mechanism while the NRC pursues a longer term resolution to the issue of steam generator degradation through the development of a steam generator rule. The NRC is seeking comment from interested parties regarding both the technical and regulatory aspects of the proposed generic letter presented under the Supplementary Information heading. Additionally, the NRC is seeking public comments on the following question which pertains to the technical positions described in the proposed generic letter. The voltage-based repair methodology and calculational approach incorporates numerous conservatism throughout the calculation in part to bound uncertainties that currently exist in the methodology. The NRC is soliciting public comment on the propagation of uncertainties through the leakage rate and radiological dose calculations under postulated accident conditions and the appropriateness of the conservatism that have been included in the analyses to account for these uncertainties. Two examples of uncertainties in the voltage-based repair methodology and calculational approach are: (1) Several functional forms (in addition to the log-logistic curve used in the proposed generic letter) can be fit to the available probability of leakage data equally well from the standpoint of a statistical goodness of fit, and (2) there is a paucity of definitive data describing iodine releases into the reactor coolant system following a large depressurization transient such as the postulated main steam line break. During development of the proposed generic letter, three individual NRC staff members expressed technical concerns (including one member filing a differing professional opinion) with the NRC positions described in the generic letter, in response to an internal memorandum requesting such comments. The differing professional opinion is currently being processed in accordance with the established NRC procedures. The NRC policies on differing professional opinions (DPOs) or differing professional views (DPVs) were established to ensure employees have the ability to freely express their DPOs or DPVs and to underscore management's intention to address these concerns in a timely and responsible manner. The NRC has decided to make these technical concerns and the differing professional opinion publicly available as part of the information available in the Public Document Rooms, and to provide the public an opportunity to comment on these concerns as they may relate to the draft generic letter. The NRC held internal technical interactions with the three individuals regarding their technical concerns and gave the concerns careful consideration (the concerns did not necessarily result in revisions to the proposed generic letter nor were they necessarily resolved to the individuals' satisfaction) during development and review of the proposed generic letter. The technical concerns and differing professional opinion are briefly summarized as follows: (1) The first concern is that use of the eddy current voltage repair criteria could result in leakage rates following a postulated main steam line break that could ultimately exceed the make-up capacity of the refueling water storage tank for the emergency core cooling system supply and result in core damage. The concern stems from the belief that there is no direct relation between leakage and measured eddy current voltage. (2) The second concern is that there is no physical basis for choosing a given probability of leakage (POL) function versus other POL functions, when all functions fit the available data from a statistical standpoint. (3) The third concern stems from the application of a voltage-based repair criterion when there is not a unique correlation between voltage amplitude and physical parameters (i.e., length or depth) of a defect that can be directly related to tube structural integrity or leakage. The DPO is similar to technical concern: (1) With additional concerns raised regarding the paucity of iodine spiking data for the calculation of offsite doses for a postulated main steam line break with induced steam generator tube leakage and the effectiveness of reducing reactor coolant system iodine activity for reducing calculated offsite doses. The summaries above are not intended to oversimplify the expressed technical concerns or differing professional opinion. To fully understand the concerns, it is recommended that each concern be read in its entirety. The proposed generic letter and supporting documentation were discussed in the 260th meeting of the Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR). At this meeting, the three individual NRC staff members presented their technical concerns to the CRGR. The relevant information used to support CRGR review of the proposed generic letter will be available in the Public Document Rooms. In addition, the proposed generic letter and supporting documentation were discussed in a meeting of the Materials and Metallurgy Subcommittee of the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) on August 3, 1994, as well as a full ACRS meeting held on August 4, 1994. The NRC will consider comments received from interested parties in the final evaluation of the proposed generic letter. The NRC final evaluation will include a review of the technical position and, when appropriate, an analysis of the value/impact on licensees. Should this generic letter be issued in final form by the NRC, it will become available for public inspection in the Public Document Rooms. DATES: Comment period expires September 12, 1994. Comments submitted after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except for comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555. Written comments may also be delivered to Room T6&hyph;D59, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, 20852 from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, N.W. (Lower Level), Washington, D.C. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Timothy A. Reed, (301) 504&hyph;1465.
