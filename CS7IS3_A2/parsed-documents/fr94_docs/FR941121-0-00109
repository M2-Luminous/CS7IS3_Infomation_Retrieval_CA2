Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice. Note: Notwithstanding the provisions of §22.949(a)(2), mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random selection process, following which the selected application may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice. * * * * * (b) Phase II. Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete. * * * * * (2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general procedures in §22.131. * * * * *
