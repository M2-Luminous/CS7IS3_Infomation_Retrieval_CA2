FR940816-1-00092 FR940816-1-00012 Procedures and Standards That Govern the Approval of Tests Section 668.142␣ Special definitions. The Secretary has proposed to define special terms that are used throughout Subpart J. The proposed definitions are based on definitions commonly used in other Federal regulations or that are commonly used in the psychometric field. Section 668.143␣ Application for test approval. A test publisher that wishes the Secretary to approve its test for use under section 484(d) of the HEA must provide sufficient information to enable the Secretary to determine that the test instrument satisfies standards used by the education testing industry, and that the test results are scientifically valid. In this section, the Secretary proposes requirements to meet those twin goals. Standards used by the testing industry include but are not limited to documentation of test development, evidence of reliability, unambiguous scales, and provisions for test security. Section 668.144␣ Test approval procedures. The Secretary has proposed procedures for approving tests. Under these procedures, the Secretary will use experts in the field of educational testing and assessment to initially evaluate tests and advise the Secretary as to whether the test meets all the requirements for test approval set forth in Subpart J. If the test submitted for approval is in a foreign language, to the extent possible, the Secretary will select at least one expert who is also fluent in the language in which the test is written. If the test does not meet the requirements for test approval, the Secretary will notify the test publisher and provide to that test publisher the reasons why the test was not approved. The test publisher may request the Secretary to re-evaluate that test. The test publisher may accompany that re-evaluation request with documents that address the reasons for the non-approval of the test, or an analysis of why the test met test approval requirements, notwithstanding the Secretary's decision. The Secretary is requesting public comment on the resubmission process used to evaluate test for approval, and on what information could be updated to reflect changes rather than resubmitted in full. If the Secretary approves a test, the Secretary proposes that the approval period generally would be five years. If the test publisher wishes to have that test re-approved after five years without interruption, the Secretary proposes that the test publisher submit the test for re-approval at least six months before its initial approval is scheduled to lapse. These procedures are designed to ensure that the tests are reviewed objectively and that the test publishers would have a fair opportunity to appeal the Secretary's decision if necessary. Section 668.145␣ Criteria for approving tests. To be approved, the Secretary proposes that a test must meet all the conditions for test construction provided in the 1985 edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing prepared by the joint committee of the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association, and the National Council on Measurement in Education. With the exception of tests designed for students in English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, the Secretary proposes that an approved test assess secondary school level basic verbal and quantitative skills, knowledge, and/or general learned verbal and quantitative abilities. Therefore, the content of a test must be able to assess those skills, knowledge, and abilities. The test must sample the major content ``domains'' of secondary school level verbal and quantitative skills with a sufficient number of questions to fully represent each domain. The test questions must also permit meaningful analysis of the performance of students who are representative of the contemporary population who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance and either have or do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent. The proposed standards are generally accepted in the psychometric community. In establishing the level of education to be assessed, the Secretary considered whether to establish that level at a particular grade of secondary schools, such as a tenth grade, eleventh grade, or twelfth grade level. However, because of the tremendous differences in the United States in the grade level at which subjects are taught in secondary schools, the Secretary determined that it would not be possible to establish such a grade level. Thus, as a general guideline, test questions have to be understood and should be answerable by students in the ninth grade through twelfth grade. An approved test would use test items (questions) that are drawn from the general content of secondary school level basic verbal and quantitative skills, and would adequately sample that content. The Secretary does not consider a test to be adequate if it assesses only an individual's personality, general level of intelligence, interest related to vocational preferences, or a single special-aptitude, such as manual dexterity. The Secretary believes that there is a significant difference between ability to benefit from instruction in an education or training program and the demonstrable skills necessary to enter an occupation. The Secretary believes that the ability to process verbal, symbolic, and numerical information is necessary to benefit from instruction from any education or training program. Section 668.146␣ Passing score. The Secretary proposes to require test publishers to determine a passing score for each test submitted for approval. The Secretary proposes that the passing score for each test will be one standard deviation below the mean for students with high school diplomas who have taken the test within three years before the date on which the test is submitted to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary has proposed this passing score to establish a sense of comparability among the three categories of students who are eligible to receive Title IV, HEA program funds. These categories include students who have a high school diploma, students who have the equivalent of that diploma, in most cases a GED, and students who have neither but can pass a test approved by the Secretary.
