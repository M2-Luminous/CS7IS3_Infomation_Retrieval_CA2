Kovac said that the representatives of all the political parties with whom he had negotiated had been in favour of Jozef Moravcik becoming premier. "The entrusting of Jozef Moravcik with the task of composing a new government is valid as of this moment," Kovac said, adding that the letter of appointment would follow. The composition of the new government should be known on Wednesday [16 March], when the president wants to hand over the letter of appointment. At the same time, the premier's vows should be taken. On Wednesday evening, Kovac said, the first session of the new government should take place. The president said he had not wanted to deal with the question of the individual filling of ministerial posts at today's talks. However, he had asked that the political parties acquaint him with their suggestions in time. "I would like to talk to each candidate personally before appointing them," he said. Asked by CTK whether the new government would also mean a signal abroad that the political situation in Slovakia was stabilising, the president replied that he was hoping for a positive appraisal. He added that Moravcik's representation of Slovakia abroad had met with a good response. "His appointment as premier indicates that the continuity of Slovak foreign policy has not been interrupted," Kovac added. On the statements of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar and his calls for Kovac's resignation, the president said he was "sufficiently armoured against him (Meciar) psychologically as to be able to withstand his attacks. "Many of the people who have been demonstrating in squares and calling for my resignation are not sufficiently aware of the country's political situation," Kovac said. "Perhaps among them there are some who will never be aware of it, and will always stand behind Mr. Meciar," he added.
