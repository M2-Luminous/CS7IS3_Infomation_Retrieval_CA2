FR941107-2-00039 FR941107-2-00010 DOC Position: We disagree with respondent's argument that the Department should use monthly or bi-monthly weighted-average FMVs because of the high rate of inflation in Venezuela during the POI. However, it should be noted that the Department has calculated two weighted-average FMVs to accommodate the introduction of VAT in Venezuela during the last two months of the POI. Because Hevensa's U.S. sales were only invoiced during the last two months of the POI, it happens that Hevensa's U.S. sales of the merchandise in question were compared only to a two-month VAT-inclusive weighted-average FMV. We agree with the petitioners that it would be inappropriate to apply only the averaging portion, and not the replacement cost portion, of our hyperinflationary economy methodology. Although information on the record of this investigation would permit the Department to calculate the FMV on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, if we were to find the Venezuelan economy to be hyperinflationary during the POI, our methodology for hyperinflationary economies also requires us to calculate the cost of production on a replacement cost basis. It is not possible for us to calculate Hevensa's replacement costs because Hevensa has insisted, and we have accepted, that the Venezuelan economy during the POI was not hyperinflationary. Accordingly, Hevensa has not supplied the Department with its replacement costs, and we have applied our standard non-hyperinflationary methodology in this final determination. Comment 3 : Hevensa argues that the Department should revise its level-of-trade analysis from the preliminary determination. During the POI, all of Hevensa's U.S. sales were made to Mannesmann, who resold the silicomanganese. Hevensa contends that, in the preliminary determination, it was inappropriate for the Department to compare Hevensa's sales to Mannesmann to Hevensa's home market sales to a home market trader because its home market trader does not perform the same role as Mannesmann. Rather, Hevensa claims that Mannesmann functions as a commission agent, while the home market trader functions as a wholesaler. Petitioners assert that the Department focuses on the customer's function in the distribution chain to classify sales by level of trade and that Mannesmann functions as any trader does, i.e. , it takes title to the material and then resells it. Accordingly, the petitioners argue that both Mannesmann and Hevensa's home market trader ``have the same place in the chain of distribution_to sell to end-users and, therefore, they are at the same level of trade.'' DOC Position : We agree with the petitioners. We view the level of trade of the sales between Hevensa and its home market trader as being functionally equivalent to the level of trade of Hevensa's sales to Mannesmann. Both Mannesmann and the home market trader are wholesalers, and both are taking title to the merchandise prior to reselling it ( see Concurrence Memo for this final determination). Comment 4 : The petitioners argue that the Department should compare Hevensa's U.S. sales of 5 ’ ’ x 2 ’ ’ Grade B lump silicomanganese with home market sales of 5 ’ ’ x 1 ’ ’ Grade B lump silicomanganese to Hevensa's home market trader/wholesaler ( i.e ., at the same level of trade). Hevensa argues that, if the Department decides that its U.S. sales to Mannesmann are at the same level of trade as its home market sales to the trader ( see Comment 3, above), the Department should not take level of trade into account when making comparisons. Hevensa contests comparisons based on level of trade because there was no correlation between its prices and selling expenses on the one hand, and levels of trade on the other. Hevensa asserts both that its average prices for 5 ’ ’ x 1 ’ ’ Grade B lump material were higher to its home market trader than to its home market end users, and that its selling expenses were roughly equivalent for both traders and end users. Moreover, Hevensa asserts that its sales to both categories of customers were made by the same sales department, within the same sales process, and that no additional technical support or additional services were provided to either category of customer. DOC Position : We agree with Hevensa. Level of trade can be an important distinction where respondents charge different prices and incur different selling expenses at the different levels of trade. Here, where the home market trader operates at an intermediate level between Hevensa and the end users, Hevensa's prices to the trader logically would be lower than its prices to end users if there were a relationship between Hevensa's prices and level of trade. Instead, Hevensa has demonstrated that its average prices to the trader were marginally higher than its prices to end users. The Department also verified that direct selling expenses, with the exception of certain differences in the average credit days for the home market trader and some home market end users, were similar. During verification, we did not note any differences between home market and end-user sales processes or sales services. Furthermore, there is no other information on the record that indicates differences existed for indirect selling expenses. Accordingly, the Department has not taken the level of trade into account but, rather, has compared Hevensa's U.S. sales of 5 ’ ’ x 2 ’ ’ Grade B material to Mannesmann to the home market sales of 5 ’ ’ x 1 ’ ’ grade material to both the home market trader and the home market end users. Comment 5 : Hevensa argues that the Department should include the amount that the customer was required to pay for VAT when calculating Hevensa's imputed credit expenses on its home market sales. It contends that when it extends credit to its home market customers, it necessarily agrees to a delay in the payment of the full amount owed by the customer, including the VAT. Therefore, the Department must calculate an imputed cost for the full amount of the delayed payment. The petitioners argue that the Department should not consider VAT in calculating imputed credit. The petitioners assert that Hevensa does not necessarily owe VAT at the time it ships to the purchaser and, in some instances, it may not owe the tax until after it has received payment from the purchaser. The petitioners also state that if the Department were to allow an imputed credit adjustment for the VAT tax, the date of invoice would not be the proper date for calculation. Moreover, the petitioners argue that in cases where the purchaser had paid Hevensa the purchase price, including VAT, prior to the date on which Hevensa owed VAT to the government, the Department would have to calculate a credit revenue for Hevensa.
