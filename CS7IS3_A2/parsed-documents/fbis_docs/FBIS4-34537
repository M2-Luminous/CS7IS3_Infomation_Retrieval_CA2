FBIS4-34537 "drlat119_o_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Colombia _O_ Accord Targets Official Corruption _O_ Accord Targets Official Corruption 94P20901 94P20901 CSO [Editorial Report] On 24 May, the Attorney General's Office and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria) concluded an agreement intended to strengthen the government's hand in detecting and fighting official corruption. The agreement will facilitate the examination of bank records by authorities looking for evidence of money obtained through illegal means. Specifically, the agreement provides for a smoother exchange of banking information between the Office of Special Investigations (OIE) -- the department of the Attorney General's Office responsible for much of the preliminary investigative work in cases of administrative corruption -- and Asobancaria, and will improve the latter's technical support to the OIE. (EL TIEMPO 25 May; EL ESPECTADOR 26 May) President Cesar Gaviria, who attended the signing ceremony at the presidential palace, hailed the agreement as an "extremely important step forward" in coordinating efforts by the state and civil society to fight administrative corruption. He added that the accord is part of a larger strategy to prevent use of the country's financial system "to conceal investments or make use of resources obtained by means of illicit activities." Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta described the agreement as "a veritable revolution" in the struggle to fight illicit enrichment, and said it would "greatly reduce" investigation time. (EL TIEMPO 25 May) Although financial institutions were already required to provide the Attorney General's Office with information upon request, the process whereby OIE investigators collected the data was time-consuming, subject to leaks, and did not always receive the full cooperation of bank officials, according to EL ESPECTADOR (26 May). By greatly streamlining procedures for gathering information and relaying it to the appropriate authorities, the new agreement could reduce OIE investigative work by as much as 75 percent, according to EL TIEMPO (25 May). In a commentary in EL ESPECTADOR (29 May), Arrieta explained that the agreement eliminates the need for investigators to go from bank to bank, including individual branch offices, throughout the country searching for a suspect's accounts as well as those of family members or others which may have been used to conceal the illicit activity. Now, an investigator can simply report a suspect's name to Asobancaria's Center for Financial Sector Information (Cifin), which will be required quickly to provide all relevant information from its data bank of current information on accounts and transactions made at the country's financial institutions. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May; EL TIEMPO 25 May) In addition, the new procedures will help to ensure the confidentiality of investigations. Arrieta notes that, under the previous system, numerous bank officials were involved in responding to an OIE inquiry, increasing the risk that a suspect would be alerted to the investigation. Under the new system, however, each institution will appoint a representative to the Cifin working group who will be responsible for handling all requests for information from that institution. (EL TIEMPO 25 May) Addressing reports that bank officials had sometimes failed to cooperate fully with OIE investigators in the past, Arrieta said that in signing the agreement the financial system has "given its full commitment to the fight against corruption." (EL TIEMPO 25 May) The agreement also calls for Asobancaria to provide investigators with training and ongoing assistance in understanding the more technical details of banking operations. Arrieta noted that such cooperation is especially important because criminals have refined their methods of concealing the illegal origin of their money. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May) Asobancaria and the Prosecutor General's Office are reportedly working out a similar agreement. (EL ESPECTADOR 26 May)
