Separatists are obviously "frightened" of peace. In case of a peaceful settlement, all criminal acts perpetrated by them against mankind will be unveiled -- thousands of people shot without trial, dozens of villages burned to the ground, and the ruined lives of people of many nationalities, Georgians, Abkhazians, Russians, Greeks, and Armenians. If a peace agreement is signed, international observers who are to study the instances of genocide and ethnic cleansing will promptly arrive in Abkhazia. The Georgian leader later stressed the positive of the Geneva talks, despite the disruption. Mr. Shevardnadze mentioned that the Russian side, the United Nations, and the authorities of Great Britain, France, and Germany supported the Georgian side in its aspirations for a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict and that a new escalation of war must not be allowed. The stance taken by these countries must play a positive role in resolving this issue. "It is necessary to find new forms and formulae, and make a definite compromise in order to avoid the outbreak a new catastrophe which could assume an unprecedented scale," the head of the Georgian state declared. The parliament chairman stressed that everything is now up to the security council. The United Nations, with Russian support, must justify the peacekeeping mission entrusted to it; and if Russia plays the role of a guarantor of peace and stability, then it will be a new landmark in world politics and positively affect not only the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict but also those world issues which need to be resolved immediately. When assessing recent Russian events connected with the adoption of the law on amnesty for the August and October putschists, Shevardnadze said that this action could complicate the internal political situation in Russia if the leadership of the country fails to control the situation independently without the influence of external factors. Commenting on his forthcoming visit to the United States, the Georgian leader said that besides a meeting with the U.S. President, consultations with representatives of the World Bank and the IMF and also with the leaders of various U.S. government departments are planned. Eduard Shevardnadze especially singled out one of the essential points at the forthcoming Georgian-U.S. meeting: a more detailed familiarization of the U.S. administration with the Abkhaz conflict.
