Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, who was addressing the nation's elected representatives yesterday, announced the definite measures taken by his government to tackle the devaluation. For the rural people, an increase in the producer price of cotton has been decided. For first-grade cotton, the price is henceforth fixed at 115 CFA francs per kilo for the 1994-95 season, compared with 85 CFA francs previously. For the 1993-94 season, an anticipated rebate of 12.5O CFA francs per kilo is granted cotton seed producers. With regard to income, the government has conceded a 10 percent general increase of indexed wages, military pensions, and civil pensions, effective 1 April. All arrears owed under the social pact will be fully paid over 24 months starting 1 March. The interoccupational minimum wage and the agricultural guaranteed minimum wage have also been increased by 8 percent, effective 1 April. The prices of essential goods have also been fixed as follows: powdered sugar, 325 francs per kilo; rice RM [expansion unknown] 40, 210 francs per kilo; bottled oil, 455 CFA francs per liter; refined oil in drum, 412 per liter; household soap, 100 CFA francs for a 200g cake. For hydrocarbons, premium-grade gas, 423 CFA francs per liter compared with 325 CFA francs previously; regular-grade gas, 390 CFA francs compared with 300 CFA francs; gas oil, 275 CFA francs per liter compared with 210 CFA francs; DDO [expansion unknown] heavy-duty fuel, 199 CFA francs per liter compared with 147 francs; fuel oil, 223 francs per liter compared with 117.38 CFA francs; mixed fuel, 430 CFA francs compared with 340 CFA francs; the price of kerosene remains 200 CFA francs; butane gas, 3,500 CFA francs per 12.5kg bottle compared with 3,000 CFA francs previously. The head of government stated that the increase in the price of fuel was inevitable as a result of the increase from supply sources, and this in spite of the efforts made by importers. This increase remains however below the prevailing price levels in most neighboring countries. The prime minister further stated that the opportunity offered by the change of parity should be seized by our country with a view to improving significantly the competitive edge of the economy and reestablishing swiftly the major macroeconomic balances. According to him, if the devaluation -- which has been accepted by all -- is well handled through consultations, the nation's economy can be boosted and the country developed on a sound and productive base.
