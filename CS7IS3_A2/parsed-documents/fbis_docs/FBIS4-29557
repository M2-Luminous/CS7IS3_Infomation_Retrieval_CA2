FBIS4-29557 "dreas118_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam's Trip to Russia Condemned Kim Yong-sam's Trip to Russia Condemned SK1706112394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1056 GMT 17 Jun 94 SK1706112394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The ugly color of the traitor Kim Yong-sam who stoops to any infamy in harming fellow countrymen was fully revealed during his tour of Russia early this month. During his trip, he was closeted with Yeltsin over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, the problem of timber workers, the sales of parts of weapons and the establishment of a peace arrangement. It was a criminal dealing down to the slightest detail for doing harm to the DPRK. During his trip, he fully revealed his true color as a traitor to the nation and flunkeyist who seeks a permanent division of the country and the nation. His criminal act culminated in entreating Russia to "join" in taking "UN sanctions" against the DPRK over the fictitious "nuclear issue." It is intolerable that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is hastening nuclear arms development, not content with the deployment of huge quantities of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, entreated Russia to "cooperate" in "sanctions," branding the DPRK as a "nuclear criminal." What is ridiculous, however, is that he threw a bait of "economic cooperation" to yeltsin in return for that. The traitor promised Russia to reschedule debt service, taking advantage of its difficult situation under a heavy debt burden and asked Russia to help South Korea in kidnapping and taking away timber workers of the North from the far east region in return for that. This is an intolerable insult and challenge to the North. This is a sinister political intrigue to satisfy his own interests, improve his image under the cloak of "humanitarianism" and drive a wedge between the DPRK and Russia. While massively introducing latest weapons of mass destruction including the Patriot in reward for rice market opening to the United States against the interests of the South Korean farmers and frantically staging nuclear war exercises, Kim Yong-sam asked Russia not to sell parts of weapons to the DPRK. This is an open revelation of the criminal plot to internationally isolate and stifle the DPRK. The traitor also let loose a string of ridiculous remarks, slandering the DPRK's proposal for establishing a peace arrangement and crying for the maintenance of the armistice system, though South Korea is not a signatory to the armistice agreement and has no real power and no say. This clearly shows that the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam is a war servant outdistancing the preceding military dictators and the very one increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula. Facts show that his visit to Russia was a criminal trip to beg Russia to "join" in "sanctions" of the UN against the DPRK over its "nuclear issue" and a never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist treacherous trip to leave the interests and existence of the nation to the gamble of outside forces. It is only too natural that the despicable perfidious acts committed by Kim Yong-sam, the political prostitute, during his Russian trip have encountered strong criticism from the Korean nation and the progressive people of the world.
