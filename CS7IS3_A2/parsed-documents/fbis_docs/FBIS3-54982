The Azerbaijani president expressed his readiness to cooperate in the field of protection of the border between the two countries as well as the frontiers between the Commonwealth and its neighbours. According to him, both issues mentioned are narrowly related to one another and must be dealt with together. The president thinks that this approach is in accordance with the spirit of the treaty on common security of the CIS. Urgent measures in order to implement the Treaty have recently been evaluated out at the Ashgabat summit. In respect to this, Mr. Aliyev has expressed his concern about the situation in Azeri districts bordering Armenia. 170 kms of the frontier between the two countries are under control of Armenian troops. President Aliyev also pointed out that the frontier between Azerbaijan and Armenia has turned into an arena of military operations. The commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier troops is giving priority to the reinforcement of the security of frontiers between the CIS and neighbouring countries. He has pointed out that it was necessary to coordinate measures to be taken in this context. Russia and Azerbaijan have to work out a definite concept of how to cooperate in this field, he said. In his short statement made to the local media, Mr. Andrey Nikolayev said that negotiations would continue, including the issue of mutual cooperation as far as the frontiers protection is concerned. Mr. Nikolayev evaded a question on plans of the possible stationing of Russian frontier troops on the border between Azerbaijan and Iran. Everything depends on the eventual terms agreed upon by both parties, he said.
