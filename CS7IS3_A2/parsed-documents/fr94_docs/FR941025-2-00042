FR941025-2-00042 FR941025-2-00033 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;12&hyph;000] Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Declaratory Order October 19, 1994. Take notice that on October 13, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) filed in Docket No. RP95&hyph;12&hyph;000 a Petition for Declaratory Order pursuant to Rule 207 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Rules of Practice and Procedure. Southern requests that the Commission declare that a certain payment that Southern proposes to make to purchase an annuity for purposes of reducing the payment obligations arising under a restructuring of Southern's gas purchase contract with Jim Walter Resources, Inc. (JWR), pursuant to the Commission's Order No. 636, et al., will qualify as a GSR cost as that term is defined in Section 31.2 of the General Terms and Conditions of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Vol. No. 1. The petition is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Southern's GSR settlement with JWR provides that Southern will make monthly payments of $675,000 to JWR through the year 2001. In order to reduce the total amount of this GSR cost, Southern proposes to make a lump-sum payment to a financial institution to purchase an annuity or other similar financial instrument (Annuity) at a net present discounted value to provide these monthly payments. Southern does not seek as part of this Declaratory Order any determination on the prudence or eligibility of such one-time payment or the prudence and eligibility of the settlement payments to JWR. Nor does Southern seek to revise its Tariff or GSR recovery mechanisms to allow for open-ended recovery of hedging costs or the costs of other financial instruments. Southern seeks in this proceeding the Commission's determination regarding whether the proposed purchase of an Annuity (which would eliminate Southern's need to include in its quarterly GSR filing the $675,000 monthly payments to JWR) would constitute an appropriate incurred cost under Section 31.2(a) of Southern's Tariff, and thereby qualify as a GSR expense that Southern has incurred for which Southern could file to recover in accordance with the GSR recovery mechanisms provided for in Southern's Tariff. Upon receipt of the requested declaratory order and completion of the proposed transaction, Southern would make a compliance filing to remove the charges presently associated with the monthly payments of $675,000 and replace such with the Annuity purchase amount as recovered under the 3-year period provided for in Southern's Tariff. Any person desiring to be heard or make any protest with reference to said petition should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 2, 1994. All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
