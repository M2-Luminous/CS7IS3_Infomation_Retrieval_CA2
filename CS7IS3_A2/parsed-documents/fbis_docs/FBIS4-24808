However, the question it has raised, namely, demanding efficiency from management, is very important and specific. State-owned enterprises must change their management mechanism. But a change of management mechanism cannot replace the strengthening and improvement of management. In order to make profits and avoid losses, management is essential. Enterprises must pay attention to technological transformation. But technological transformation cannot replace the strengthening and improvement of management either. Without corresponding management, modern technology and equipment cannot play their roles very well. Many enterprises always complain that they do not have enough funds and always ask for help from banks to solve their problems. But strengthening and improving management can not only dispense with capital inputs, it can even save large amounts of funds and under these circumstances improve returns and obtain funds. Why do we not make great efforts to use this method? Successful enterprises in the developed countries do not ignore management. Between the late 1980's and the early 1990's, a great change took place in the global automobile market. American cars, which had played a dominant role earlier, were continuously affected and threatened by Japanese cars, not only in Japan, but also in other parts of the world and even in North America. International commentators generally held that as far as overall technological expertise was concerned, Japan still lagged behind the United States, but Japanese management was superior. The United States was not happy with its failure. Americans organized forces to study their competitors. An organization called the "National Automobile Plan" spent five years on investigation and research. It made a scientific exposition and conclusion of the production methods introduced by Japan's Toyota Corporation and called it the "improved production method." They held that if all of the industrialized countries generally adopted this production method, the world would change. They wrote their research results in a book and published as the The Machine Which Changed the World. These facts show that in the world today, enterprises around the world not only compete in markets and through technology, but also compete acutely in management. What is precious about Number One Automobile is that it has already clearly seen this modern wave and has boldly thrown itself into this wave to compete. At present, China's enterprise management does not meet the needs of the market economy or the needs of modern large-scale production. The contradiction is rather noticeable. The Number One Automobile Group's practice offers us a convincing example of demanding efficiency from management. Their leaders, staff, and workers have already experienced the benefits of it. A certain worker jubilantly exclaimed: "There is a gold mine beneath my feet. The tool to mine the gold with is the improved production method!" In fact, there is a mine in many enterprises. Although they do not appear to be able to use the improved production method immediately, they should always proceed from reality, keep high standards, use better management methods, and dig out the gold.
