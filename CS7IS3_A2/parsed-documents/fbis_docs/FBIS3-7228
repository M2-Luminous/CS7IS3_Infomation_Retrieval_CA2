Despite the fact that following the Japan-U.S. textile negotiations in the 1970's, Japan has been in constant friction with the United States, economic relations between the two countries on the private-sector level have been steadily promoted. According to the latest survey of the Japan External Trade Organization, the number of factories operated by Japanese-affiliated companies in the United States has reached 1,700, seven times than in the first survey in 1981. The survey shows that approximately 400,000 persons are hired by Japanese-affiliated companies and that those companies' activities to contribute to local welfare are brisk. The report also says that, as of December last year, 780 joint projects have been confirmed in the area of joint development, technical cooperation, and joint venture. Companies' cooperation with local community through their daily economic activities and mutual understanding between employees and the management through social activities are very important to maintain good relations between Japan and the United States. However, there are other tasks for the private sector to carry out. Underlying the current Japan-U.S. economic friction is Japan's huge trade surplus and closed nature of its markets in various fields. In its demand calling for Japan's market opening and deregulations, the United States has pointed out that there are various obstacles to rectifying trade frictions--such as construction firms' bid-rigging practice and regulations of large retail stores, insurance, and transportation business. It can be said that industrial circles concerned have enjoyed prosperity under an "umbrella" of such regulations. They need to make voluntary efforts to correct the current situation. In promoting purchase of foreign-made automobiles and autoparts, which is one of the immediate issues to be solved, the auto industry has started making voluntary efforts. Major auto dealers affiliated with Nissan Motor are getting ready to deal in Ford-made automobiles while Toyota-affiliated dealers plan to start selling compact cars made by General Motors (GM) from 1996. Each of the major automobile companies is working out its own plan to purchase foreign-made auto parts, including U.S.-made parts. In response to such voluntary efforts of the automobile industry, a top U.S. official in charge of trade recently called on the Japanese Government to guarantee voluntary targets the auto industry will set in its plan. On the other hand, it has been reported that welcoming the private sector's voluntary efforts, the Japanese Government, which is scheduled to announce its market-opening measures late this month, is considering including the automobile industry's voluntary plan in its market-opening measures as the pillar of the measures. However, such reactions by the two governments have resulted in the automobile industry's criticism. We think that such moves by the two governments will put cold water on the private sector's voluntary efforts to rectify trade friction and run counter to the principle of free trade and deregulations. We believe that what the two governments have to do is to create an environment in which other business sectors can take voluntary actions, rather than intervening in the auto industry's voluntary plan. In addition, leaders of the business circle are assigned an important role. Although business leaders from Japan and the United States hold an annual meeting, it has been reported that there is a rapidly growing move among the members for changing the nature of the meeting -- from a place for exchanging opinions to opportunities to take positive actions to remove friction. Some of the Japanese and American members of the meeting are said to have their own personal connections with persons who are concerned with policymaking. In this sense, we hope that business leaders, by taking advantage of a network of their personal contacts, will actively contribute to improving Japan-U.S. economic relations.
