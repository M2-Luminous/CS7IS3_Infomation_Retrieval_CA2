[Uttar Pradesh] for the last month indicates that political polarization is accelerating there. Usually, political polarization in a democratic country is considered a good sign. However, a large number of political parties does not prove to be good for democracy. At present, there are two basic doctrines active in the state. One of these belongs to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the second is espoused by the parties that accuse the BJP of creating religious factionalism in the nation. The representative or the leader of the second doctrine is the present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. The people subscribing to this school of thought do not want the BJP to emerge [from defeat] at any cost. That is why some of the parties that are not happy with Mulayam Singh are forced to support Mulayam Singh's government. The week of 11 April appeared to be the week of competition for joining the Samajwadi Party (SP). Everyday, there were two announcements telling people who was joining the SP. Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh, former state leader and V.P. Singh's right hand, resigned from the Janata Dal and decided to join the SP. For the announcement, he called an "equality conference" on 11 April. Chief Minister Mulayam Singh welcomed them to his party and even called this "returning home." He said that the leaders who had decided to join the SP and fight for the principles it stands for will always be known as holy men. The BJP was accused of spreading religious factionalism and was greatly criticized in this conference. Chief Minister Yadav called the BJP militant for the first time. He said that there was no difference between the Kashmiri militant groups and the BJP that helped tear down the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. Kunwar Rewati Raman's "equality conference" was to begin on Monday, 11th April. Without any prior notice, the chief minister called a press conference at 1000. In this press conference, Ramawadhesh Singh, national president of the Lok Dal, announced his decision to join the SP. Mr. Ramawadesh Singh announced that he will formally merge the Lok Dal into the SP on 6 May in Patna. Yadunath Singh, former state president of the Janata Dal (Ajit), also announced his decision to join the SP. Mr. Yadunath is very influential in the Mirzapur area. The next day, another meeting was arranged in Ravinderalya. The meeting was organized by Mittersen Yadav and Ram Chander Baksh Singh who were leaving the Communist Party of India to join the SP. One special aspect of this meeting was that they both had the blessings of veteran leader Dr. Z.A. Ahmed. The CPI [Communist Party of India] leaders who were joining the SP claimed that this meeting was the state level meeting of their party. They also claimed that the people who were present in that meeting represented 80 percent of the CPI membership. There are three CPI members in the Vidhan Sabha. If one-third of the total members desert, it is not called desertion, but division of the party. Mittersen Yadav took full advantage of this rule as he was one-third of the total! Mr. Uddal, the leader of the party in the Vidhan Sabha, strongly condemned this desertion, however, at the same time, he also said that he and his party will continue to support Mulayam Singh. The same situation is of the Janata Dal. Ten legislators of the total 27 have left it to join the SP. According to political sources, six more legislators are ready to leave. The leaders of this party are very upset at this party hopping. However, they are helpless because of the political atmosphere of the state, will have to support Mulayam Singh's government. The Congress (I) is even in worse condition than this. Its leaders strongly support the idea of backing Mulayam Singh. At the same time, they want to maintain their party's image as an opposition party in the Vidhan Sabha and in the Vidhan Parishad. Perhaps, that is why they showed so much anger as if he [Mulayam Singh] was going to uproot the government in the context of discussions on Mahatma Gandhi and Govind Ballabh Pant. They showed the same level of anger over the firing incident in Meerut and even threatened to resign from all the legislative committees. However, what happened today is what was going to happen. The government still has the Congress (I) support. The truth is that the Congress (I) not only supports the government in the Vidhan Sabha, but also acts as the "shock absorber" for it. No one attacks the BJP as fiercely as does Congress Party leader Pramod Tiwari. Thus, the BJP is alone both within and outside of the legislative assembly, and the other parties are on the other side. This is the first step in the polarization process. We are waiting for the next step. Now the question is: Why this sudden acceleration in this political polarization? If this had happened before the vidhan sabha elections, the political scene in the state would have been different. The political leaders who now consider themselves invincible and very powerful, would not have achieved this status. There is a lot of talk in political circles that Chief Minister Mulayam Singh wants to make himself strong by any means so that he does not have to depend on any other party, and he will Mulayam [mellow] in name only! He will become a powerful Singh [lion] when it comes to obeying his orders and following his principles.
