Figures that have neither been officially confirmed nor refuted show that we have a foreign debt of about $30 billion and that officials believe that this amount is not so great as to spark any concerns, especially when the Central Bank has been so unprecedentedly successful--allegedly--in being able to arrange for the repayment of these loans in installments. And according to officials, all this has been achieved despite the obstructionism of America in its opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As to the interest rate on this debt and to what amount from the national wealth will ultimately be paid in interest is something nobody is ready to comment on. But judging from the nature of credit organizations or of Western companies, one can conclude that these installment payments will not be free of charge. Nevertheless, the most interesting remarks on this came from Dr. Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli [Central Bank governor] who claimed that Iran's debts will be $18 billion by the year 2006. In order to better understand this point, we should first point out that it is now 1994 or, in other words, the last decade of the 20th century and that Mr. 'Adeli is therefore talking about 12 years from now or the first decade of the 21st century. Of course there is no doubt that it is our problem that we do not understand which policies we should adopt in order to solve our debt problem. But, at any rate, policies are not that clear for the man in the street to understand. Thus, instead of considering the Central Bank governor's remarks that our foreign debts will be limited by the year 2006 as a promising sign, we see, on the contrary, that despite the previous promises by the officials who claimed that with the adoption of contraction policies, loans would be quickly repaid, we should not expect our debts to smooth out. If the Central Bank can truly limit the foreign debt to $18 billion as stated by Dr. 'Adeli, then the Iranian nation should be thankful. But what we are worried about is that the volume of debts will increase while our foreign exchange income will not reach a favorable level that will allow us to limit our debts, especially when it is not clear what interest will be added to these debts. Another important point is that our foreign exchange policies are not based on comprehensive planning that covers the other sectors of the economy as well. And based on this, one cannot be very optimistic. Nevertheless, the bad experience that we have concerning foreign debts shows that this is an experience that should not be repeated. Explaining the reasons and answering the question on why we have foreign debts or even telling us that these expenditures were for infrastructure projects that will yield fruit in the future are not enough to convince the people why we should have amassed debts in the first place. Our culture, based on its history, considers borrowing--for whatever reason--a weakness, and it will not easily accept the fact that we have debts to repay. At any rate, we will be lucky if our debts are limited to $18 billion until 2006 as has been stated by Mr. 'Adeli. But what we should be afraid of is that we gullibly sit back and not realize that an important part of our national income is being devoured by debts. Many of the countries that have debts today did not realize when they received the loans that one day they would be unable to repay them. Moreover, is it really wise for us to spend our replaceable national resources which are the backing for our world credibility for areas the returns of which are doubtful? The answers to these questions should be given by those who compile our country's fiscal policies. But, at any rate, these are the questions that exist, and we should not turn a deaf ear to them.
