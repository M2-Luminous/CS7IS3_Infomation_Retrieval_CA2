FBIS4-54376 "dreas103__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 27 May 1994 ANNEX Cambodia Government Said Buying Ammunition From SRV Government Said Buying Ammunition From SRV OW2705095894 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 May 94 Morning Edition p 4 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2705095894 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [By Akihiko Ota] [Text] Phnom Penh, 23 May -- A Cambodian Government military source disclosed on 23 May that government forces had secretly purchased ammunition from Vietnam for use in battles with the Pol Pot faction. The SRV has acted at the request of Cambodia, and thanks to the SRV's supply of ammunition, the Cambodian Government forces have gained the advantage in the war. However, the purchase of ammunition from Vietnam, which once invaded Cambodia, will likely invite strong hostility from the Pol Pot faction at a "roundtable conference" scheduled in Pyongyang in North Korea. According the source, Vietnam started supplying ammunition a few weeks ago, transporting it to Cambodia by an overland route. Most of the ammunition comprises bullets for AK-47 type rifles, and 152mm shells and rocket shells made by the former Soviet Union. "They have been purchased at half the price of the ammunition sold by North Korea," the source said. The source said the Vietnamese military concluded the secret transaction at the request of cadres of the former Phnom Penh Government, which was once allied with the Vietnamese military, and is currently a major force of the Cambodian Government forces. The Vietnamese side then promised to back the Cambodian Government forces, saying: "Vietnam is ready to supply as much ammunition as Cambodia wants." However, the source said that as Cambodia had already spent its defense budget for the current fiscal year, accounting for 30 percent of the national budget, "budgets for the repair of national roads have been used to make the payments." Although in March the government forces brought Anlong Veng and Pailin, the base of the Pol Pot faction, under its control, they were later recaptured by Pol Pot fighters. To deal with the situation, officials as National Defense Minister Tie Banh visited such countries as Russia, China, Laos, and Vietnam and officially asked for the supply of arms and ammunitions. Each nation rejected Cambodia's request on the grounds that "it would lead to intervention in Cambodia's domestic affairs." Among those approached, only North Korea showed a favorable reaction. However, Cambodian officials decided to ask Vietnam because North Korea is a long way away and it costs huge sums and takes a long time to transport ammunition, the source said. The Cambodian Government has asked foreign nations for military cooperation in fighting the Pol Pot faction. In response, such nations as the United States and Australia have shown a positive stand toward the supply of arms. Meanwhile, the Thai Government has announced it will reject the Cambodian Government's request, saying military cooperation would lead a spread of the fighting. In an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN, Vice Information Minister Kyu Knayrit [as published] said: "Although I cannot disclose the names of the countries, we have already received arms and ammunitions from some. We also had them dispatch military instructors a few months ago." His comments amounted to an admission that Cambodia has received arms and military advisory groups from such nations as North Korea and France. Proposed by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian Government and the Pol Pot faction are scheduled to start peace talks at a roundtable meeting due to begin in Pyongyang on 27 May with the issue of the Pol Pot faction's participation in the government as a main topic. The Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1978 and established the former Phnom Penh Government after overthrowing the government led by the Pol Pot faction. For that reason, the Pol Pot faction has since continued warfare backed by the Cambodians' historically deep-rooted anti-Vietnamese feelings and national consciousness. It is seen, therefore, as inevitable that the Pol Pot faction will strongly defy and criticize Cambodia for the purchase by government forces of war supplies from Vietnam.
