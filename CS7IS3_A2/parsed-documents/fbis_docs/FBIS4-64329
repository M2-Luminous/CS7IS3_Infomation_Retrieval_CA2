This is indicated in a secret report dated 29 June 1993 by Working Group Iran of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. According to this report, the attack was prepared by the Iranian intelligence service in Bonn and carried out under the code name "Bozorg Allawi." According to the report, the largest of the three Iranian intelligence services acting in Germany, the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS), has its headquarters for West Europe at the Iranian Embassy in Bonn. The MOIS department has existed since the turn of the year 1986/87, says the report. It is housed on a specially secured floor of the embassy and has a radio room and a staff of at least 20. According to information obtained by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the intelligence service headquarters is also involved in the illegal transfer of military technology and is particularly interested in "NBC [nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons technology." The report also says that products for NBC weapons systems have been exported with the help of intelligence service personnel through Iranian cover firms in Germany and abroad, bypassing all export bans. The attorney of a joint plaintiff has requested that the report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution be now used in the Mykonos trial.
