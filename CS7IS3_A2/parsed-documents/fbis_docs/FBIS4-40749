"The recent parliamentary elections showed that a pathetic political dwarf and scandalous figure can turn into a leader of a parliamentary party due to a few snappy appearances on TV," he said without disclosing the name of the politician he meant. He believes that the danger of nationalism is still threatening the country and that chauvinism and nationalism are evident in many democratic publications. He urged reporters to quote official statements more exactly, providing critical comments on them. "This will help highlight the authors' idiocy," he said.
