The current situation is encouraging, he says, and so far there is the hope that NATO intervention against the Serb batteries may not be necessary. However, he admits that information is still lacking about the withdrawal of their armaments and the handing over of some of them to the blue helmets. [Begin Solana recording] I think that one can say that the situation on the ground remains encouraging. By encouraging we mean that it is our hope that the objectives of the ultimatum that has to be met tomorrow night will be fulfilled without it being necessary to carry out air strikes. But I can also tell you that there is still a certain confusion on the ground as regards the withdrawal of the Serb heavy weapons. [end recording] [Sanz] In spite of Javier Solana's reservations and the need not to celebrate prematurely, if the withdrawal and the control of Sarajevo by the blue helmets comes about, the minister stressed that the solution to the conflict is not military but political and that there are already diplomatic measures, which will become known next week and which will have to involve the United States and Russia. [Begin Solana recording] Some initiatives are on the table; I cannot be more specific at present, but, I believe that next week, depending on how the latest events go up to the weekend, there may be some other initiatives of a negotiating character: initiatives that will undoubtedly involve the European Union and undoubtedly involve -- and we want them to be more involved -- the United States and Russia.
