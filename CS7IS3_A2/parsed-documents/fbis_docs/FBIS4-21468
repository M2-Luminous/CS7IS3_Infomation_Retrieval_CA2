Vyacheslav Kostikov, presidential press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today at the request of the Russian president and prime minister. He said that the agreement, signed in Hungary, envisaged the processing and utilisation of nuclear wastes from atomic power plants built to Soviet blueprints in the Hungarian Republic. ``Russia will avoid concluding such agreements as soon as the terms of the existing international contracts expire,'' Kostikov noted.
