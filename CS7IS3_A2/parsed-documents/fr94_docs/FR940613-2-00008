FR940613-2-00008 FR940613-2-00004 [A&hyph;423&hyph;807] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Steel Wire Rod From Belgium AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Grebasch or Erik Warga, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3773 or (202) 482&hyph;0922. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that imports of steel wire rod from Belgium are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 7, 1994, (59 FR 11773, March 14, 1994), the following events have occurred: On March 31, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case. On April 7, 1994, the Department issued an antidumping duty questionnaire to Forges de Thy-Marcinelle (``Thy-Marcinelle'') for the investigation. The questionnaire had four sections: section A, requesting general information; section B, requesting information on U.S. sales; section C, requesting information on home market sales; and section D, requesting information on cost of production and constructed value. In that same month, the Department presented the antidumping duty questionnaire to Thy-Marcinelle, because it represented at least 60 percent of exports to the United States during the POI. On April 22, 1994, Thy-Marcinelle requested a two-week extension for filing the response to the Department's questionnaire. The Department granted this extension request. In May 1994, Thy-Marcinelle notified the Department that it would not be participating in this investigation. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are hot-rolled carbon steel and alloy steel wire rod, in coils, of approximately round cross section, between 0.20 and 0.75 inches in solid cross-sectional diameter. The following products are excluded from this investigation: •Free-machining steel containing 0.03% or more of lead, 0.05% or more of bismuth, 0.08% or more of sulfur, more than 0.4% of phosphorus, more than 0.05% of selenium, and/or more than 0.01% of tellurium; •Wire rod, which is 5.5 mm or less in diameter, with tensile strength greater than or equal to 1040 Mega-Pascals (MPa), and the following chemical content, by weight: carbon greater than or equal to 0.79 percent, aluminum less than or equal to 0.005 percent, phosphorous plus sulfur less than or equal to 0.040 percent and nitrogen less than or equal to 0.006 percent; •Wire rod, which is 7.9 to 18.0 mm in diameter, containing 0.48 to 0.73 percent carbon by weight and certified as having partial decarburization and seams no more than 0.075 mm in depth; and •Stainless steel rods, tool steel rods, ball bearing steel and deformed concrete reinforcing bars (as defined in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)). The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7213.31.3000, 7213.31.6000, 7213.39.0030, 7213.39.0090, 7213.41.3000, 7213.41.6000, 7213.49.0030, 7213.49.0090, 7213.50.0020, 7213.50.0040, 7213.50.0080, 7227.20.000, 7227.90.6000, and 7227.90.6050 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.
