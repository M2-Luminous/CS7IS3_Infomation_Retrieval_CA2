FR941028-2-00057 FR941028-2-00041 [FRL&hyph;5097&hyph;2] The State of New Jersey; Partial Program Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on Partial Program Application of the State of New Jersey for Partial Program Adequacy Determination, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency has been approving and intends to continue approving adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. The State of New Jersey applied for a partial determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed New Jersey's application and certain amendments and revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all portions of New Jersey's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria, except for Subpart E relating to Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. New Jersey plans to revise the remainder of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full program approval. New Jersey's application for partial program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the DATES section. DATES: All comments on New Jersey's application for a partial adequacy determination must be submitted by the close of business on December 14, 1994. One public hearing will be held at the Public Meeting Room on the first floor of the offices of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), 401 East State Street, Trenton, New Jersey on December 14, 1994. The hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. New Jersey will participate in the public hearing held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: Copies of New Jersey's application for adequacy are available between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. at the following two addresses for inspection and copying: U.S. EPA Region II Library, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 402, New York, New York, 10278, telephone (212) 264&hyph;2881, and NJDEP at the Public Access Room, 401 East State Street, Trenton, New Jersey. Written comments should be sent to Conrad Simon, Director Air and Waste Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorraine Graves, U.S. EPA Region II, Mail Stop 2AWM, Room 1006, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York, 10278, telephone (212) 264&hyph;9638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approvals if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes limited to a narrow part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet these requirements; and (3) provisions not included in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and a separable subset of part 258. These requirements, if promulgated, will address the potential problems posed by the dual State/Tribal and Federal programs that came into effect in October 1993 in those States/Tribes that only have partial approvals of their MSWLF programs. On that date, Federal rules covering any portion of a State/Tribe's program that had not received EPA approval became enforceable. Owners and operators of MSWLFs subject to such dual programs must be able to understand which requirements apply and comply with them. In addition, the pieces of the Federal program that are in effect must mesh well enough with the approved portions of the State/Tribal program to leave no significant gaps in regulatory control of MSWLF's. Partial approval will allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit program that meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take advantage of the Criteria's flexibility for those portions of the program which have been approved.
