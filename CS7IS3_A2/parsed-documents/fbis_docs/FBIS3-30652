President Zhelev said this himself in today's 50-minute interview on the national radio. Rising crime and the possibilities of fighting it were the main topics in the interview broadcast two days after the parliamentary debate on a motion for no-confidence in the government made by the Union of Democratic Forces, which claims that the cabinet is incompetent to enforce law and order and guarantee people's safety. In less than a month, the Bulgarian president pays particular attention to the problems of growing crime for the second time. Only two weeks ago he addressed the nation commenting on the same issue. "In principle, I am a convinced opponent to capital punishment, but in view of soaring crime rates I am inclined to agree to temporary lift the moratorium on it until the issue is resolved commuting the death sentence to one of life imprisonment by law," President Zhelev said in the interview. The president described the accusations made against him by some people that he had granted amnesty to 12,000 criminals as a gross and brazen lie. They were released by former President Petur Mladenov in 1990, Dr. Zhelev pointed out. So far I have pardoned just a few hundreds of people, mainly seriously ill women and old people who can no longer commit any crime, he said. One can draw two basic conclusions from the parliamentary debate and the press publications on crime control: The need of purging the state machine of corruption and of the political forces reaching consensus, the president believes. The crime control effort will not be serious without declaring a merciless war on corruption not only in the Ministry of the Interior but in the governing authorities as a whole and in all state institutions, President Zhelev emphasized. Any attempts to fight organized crime without eliminating corruption at the state institutions are doomed to failure, Dr. Zhelev said categorically. The Presidency has always been uncompromising on the issue of fighting corruption. Dr. Zhelev cited a number of cases when presidential advisers, suspected of servicing the interests of certain financial and industrial groups, had been dismissed. He named Zdravko Popov, his former adviser on foreign affairs, Piere Tabakov, former adviser on defence industry problems, former military adviser General Stoyan Andreev. What has been done to curb crime so far is less than modest, the president said. He blamed mainly the two major political forces for the present condition of the society and for the inefficient crime control saying that they always placed their interests above the national ones. The president believes that they are obliged to reach consensus on the problem of curbing crime. The institutions whose duty is fighting crime cannot be stable without such consensus, the president stressed. According to him, the presidential institution can play the role of an integrating factor concerting the efforts of the institutions directly involved in crime control. It can play this role through the Consultative National Security Council which has the right to ask the separate institutions for cooperation, the president believes. Dr. Zhelev emphasized his view about the need of developing a national programme for crime control. The political forces must unite for the sake of resolving the problem. Without consensus, combating crime is doomed to failure, the president said in conclusion.
