FR940428-0-00039 FR940428-0-00014 III. Results of USEPA Review The USEPA reviewed the Indiana submittal to determine if criteria for approval have been met. The results of USEPA's review are as follows: (1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities Indiana's submittal mandates the requirement of Stage II vapor recovery systems on any gasoline dispensing facility that dispenses a monthly average volume of 10,000 gallons or more, and on ISBMGs who dispense more than 50,000 gallons. The submittal also includes a requirement that affected facilities be identified by calculating the average volume of product dispensed per month for the 2-year period prior to adoption of the rule by the State. Monthly averages are to include only those months when the facility was operating. The USEPA finds this acceptable because if fully addresses the Federal requirement. (2) Establishment of a Time Schedule for Installation of Stage II Control Equipment The Act specifies that the time period for installation and operation of the Stage II equipment shall run from the State adoption date of the Stage II rule. The Act defines adoption to mean the date the State adopts the requirements for installation and operation of the Stage II equipment. For all facilities, these compliance dates, calculated from the time of State adoption of the regulation, are: (1) 6 months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990; (2) 1 year for facilities that dispense greater than 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) 2 years for all other facilities. The Indiana Stage II rule time schedule sets compliance dates of June 1, 1994, December 1, 1994, and December 1, 1995, respectively for the above three deadlines based on the December 1, 1993, publication date of the rule in the Indiana Register. The State has adopted this schedule for all affected facilities, including those owned or operated by ISBMGs. Although Indiana adopted its regulations on July 21, 1993, USEPA believes it is appropriate to interpret the adoption date to be December 1, 1993, under the limited circumstances presented in this submittal. The USEPA is approving the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the Act states that the adoption date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, USEPA defines the adoption date to be the date after which a rule becomes effective in a State. Based on this definition of adoption date USEPA accepts the December 1, 1993, rule publication date as the adoption date from which the compliance schedule is calculated. Second, the compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin within the time schedule specified by the Act. Third, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in the implementation of Stage II in Indiana. Finally, the Indiana rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and USEPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, USEPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible. In the limited circumstances above, USEPA believes that it is not inconsistent to interpret the adoption date to the December 1, 1993. (3) System Certification The adopted rule mandate that all Stage II vapor control systems used be certified by CARB to meet 95 percent emission reduction efficiency. Use of CARB-certified systems is acceptable to USEPA. The USEPA has specified in its guidance documents that it believes that CARB-approved Stage II systems meet the requirement of the Act with no additional efficiency testing required. Therefore, USEPA finds the specified system certification in the Indiana submittal acceptable. (4) Installation of Stage II Vapor Control Systems The Indiana rule mandates that proper tests be performed to verify proper installation and function of the Stage II systems, and requires systems to be retested every five years, or upon major system replacement or modification. The USEPA believes the testing procedures specified help make the rule enforceable and, therefore, are consistent with the requirements of the Act. (5) Recordkeeping and Reporting The Indiana rule requires that the affected facilities submit a registration form of their Stage II equipment to IDEM within forty-five days after the installation of the Stage II equipment. In addition, the rule requires that registration material be kept onsite. It also requires that, at a minimum, the registration information includes: the facility name and address, signature of owner or operator, the CARB Executive Order Number for the Stage II system used, number of nozzles used, the monthly average volume of gasoline dispensed, and the location (including contact person's name, address, and telephone number) of other records and reports required by the rule. Other records and reports required by the rule to be kept on file by the owner or operator and which need to be made available to the POA upon request include: proof that a certified Stage II system has been installed and tested to verify its performance according to its specifications; records that show that proper maintenance has been conducted according to manufacturer specifications; records that show time periods and duration of all malfunctions of the Stage II system; motor vehicle fuel throughput information for each calendar month of the previous year; and proof of employee training certification. The USEPA finds Indiana's recordkeeping and reporting requirements acceptable.
