During his one-day visit to the Greek capital, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) explained to his hosts Switzerland's position regarding European integration. At a press conference, the head of the DFAE underlined the "friendly" atmosphere in which the talks with his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, took place. Mr. Cotti also met with the Greek European Minister Theodoros Pangalos. Regional issues were also raised, namely, the situation in former Yugoslavia, Greek-Turkish relations, and the partition of Cyprus. "Switzerland would be pleased if bilateral negotiations with the EU began during the Greek presidency," which will come to an end in June, according to Mr. Cotti. The head of the DFAE stated that, if those negotiations began "quickly enough," this would "create excellent psychological conditions in Switzerland." The long-term "strategic goal" of Switzerland is indeed a "full and complete" membership in the European Union, the federal counselor added. No Official Guarantee Questioned by ATS, Greek Minister Theodoros Pangalos remained reserved about the opening of bilateral negotiations between Switzerland and the EU during Greece's EU Presidency. Nevertheless, Mr. Pangalos said it was likely that those negotiations would begin before the end of the year. [passage omitted] Mr. Papoulias for his part said that Mr. Cotti's visit, the first by the head of the Swiss diplomatic corps since 1976, testified to the "political will" of both countries to develop and strengthen bilateral relations. He "thanked" Switzerland for its contribution to the financing of the UN peacekeeping forces in Cyprus.
