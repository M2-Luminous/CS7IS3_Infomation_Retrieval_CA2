For Marcos, "when a group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and possible -- a group mind you; I am not talking about millions of people, but people with enough determination or who are mad enough to carry out the struggle -- then big and concrete things can happen in this country." There is skepticism about the elections in what the insurgent leader calls "the basement of our country." Those who live in this underground world, which pervades the country, "do not see an alternative in any of the candidates, or a capability by any of the candidates to lead a transition process to democracy." The subcommander warns that "they conclude that all is prepared for another fraud and what follows, instead of preparing for a peaceful transition, which is to prepare for violent change." He adds that "the historic moment is set and it does not even depend on our own strength." He says the only viable alternative is a grand mobilization of society toward the so-called National Democratic Convention, as the "point of convergence." In this second portion of the interview, the EZLN military leader insists that to speak of an imminent general uprising is "not a threat but a warning." He also states that the EZLN can negotiate "with the government that rises from the 21 August election or the government that arises from the convention." [Ibarra] What can we do about the elections, given the fact that there will be nine candidates and there is supposed to be a different democratic atmosphere? Are the people motivated? [Marcos] The truth is quite the contrary. If it were not, why does an armed option, such as the EZLN, continue to grow under a truce? It is negotiating and will presumably surrender, and there will soon be an election. Why does a military force such as ours continue to gain territory, resources, and strength? That is the logic we now face. Everyone tells us that the people are more interested in the elections or the World Cup Soccer Tournament. If so, we should have been forgotten. I think they just followed the eight column headlines and full page publications, and never took the historic events that were occurring in the country into account. It is not true. In most cases, people are not interested in those events. There are many dissatisfied people betting on a violent option. If that were not so, it would be impossible for an army such as ours to grow, when all the technical and military advantages are on the other side, meaning on the side of the enemy. We are trying to start this mobilization for the election. Many people approach us by many routes. They do not come through full-page publications, news articles, or by way of demonstrations. They clearly say: - None of the political parties offers an option; - None of the candidates offers an option as president of the republic; - There will surely be electoral fraud. They are very skeptical about participating in the election. They do not see any alternative in any of the candidates, or the capability on the part of any of the candidates to lead a transition process to democracy. They conclude that all is prepared for another fraud and what follows, instead of preparing for a peaceful transition, which is to prepare for violent change. Why does this happen in February, March, April, May, and now June, when the Clandestine Committee says no to the government's proposals? It is now when the electoral campaign is supposed to be growing and the EZLN is supposed to be relegated to second, third, fourth, or even fifth priority in the media. The electoral campaign is supposed to be the top story. According to the candidates, the debates are supposed to be a landmark in the country's democratization process. All they are showing us is that the countries problems should be resolved by unconstitutional means. This only produces more skepticism. It produces the same reaction, as the same old show is being staged again. Now, however, there is an option; it has been demonstrated that armed struggle, violent struggle, is possible. Now the people are deciding that armed struggle is necessary. And when a group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and even possible -- a group, mind you; I am not talking about millions of people, but people with enough determination or who are mad enough to carry it out -- then big and concrete things can happen in this country. [Ibarra] Can it be said that they are just a bunch of crazy people? [Marcos] Yes, the difference between this bunch of crazy people in January and the bunch of crazy people in June is that now they are scattered throughout the nation. Now there are several groups of crazy people. If a group of crazy people was able to wreak havoc in January, I ask you: What can several groups of crazy people do in several states of the republic? [Ibarra] It would seem as though we are headed toward a war. [Marcos] We are still hopeful of what civilian society can do. With the effective end to the siege; with the entrance of the caravan of caravans, what in military terms is called a penetration maneuver, a collapsing of the lines; and with a belligerence within civil society that is very significant -- something that is very characteristic of sectors that traditionally cannot tolerate one another -- we believe it is yet possible to raise the banner of unity in a broadly progressive, democratic left-wing sector and permit its mobilization before 21 August to seek a transition. In any event, an attempt should be made to make another opening in which it will be possible to speak of negotiations and to speak of peace talks that will not deceive the country, and that will not use -- let me see if I can remember the word everyone is using -- a padlock, which I believe politicians are using right now. Finally, the dialogue and proposals forwarded to the EZLN were intended to put a padlock on the armed struggle or the EZLN, and this proved to the EZLN that there would be no solution. What was being done was the initiation of a period of passivity to give other forces time to come into play. This can only continue if there is indeed a definitive and clear change in August. [Ibarra] Are you not afraid that the influence of whoever calls for peace will be more important than whoever calls for war or warns of the possibility of war? [Marcos] This is what we have expected since the consultation process, since the dialogue ended in San Cristobal. If the people want peace, why do they recommend that we not give up our weapons? Why do social sectors insist on this so much? I am not only talking about dispossessed sectors. I am talking about the middle class and the business sectors who are sympathetic to our movement and view with concern the possibility that we may surrender. Why does an armed group of people, faceless people, have so much prestige? How can this happen if it is speaking of war, if it is clamoring for war, and if it represents war in this country? The call for peace or to foresee peace in the face of war is contained in the Second Lacandona Jungle Declaration. We say it is necessary to make room for mobilization. Peace cannot be a declaration or the product of negotiations at a table among a group of hooded men who have no names, a commissioner who is not a commissioner and who does not represent anyone, and a mediator who does not represent the church as an institution. The possibility of peace has to be the product of the mobilization of this country, be it through an armed struggle, civil struggle, or civil resistance. What we are doing is issuing a warning, and we want this to be clear. The problem of peace in this country is a problem of liberty, justice, and democracy. Any attempt in any other direction is a masquerade to deceive the country or to deceive ourselves. One way or another, a 1 January will happen again, but next time it will be uncontrollable. We believe this firmly. You know how difficult it is to control a military force that is conducting actions in a specific territory. The federal policemen know it well. They know that during a clash, it is difficult to control troops in terms of what they can do and how they should react. Consider what numerous armed groups would mean for the country. Think of what these military forces, acting without any possibility of being controlled by anyone, would signify. This is hell. This is not the San Miguel checkpoint; this is going to be hell. I think that the military will understand what I am saying if they know what a lack of control or lack of command in the war signifies. They are going to understand that the warning about a civil war is a serious warning to all armies in this case, to both armies, the armies of the federal government and the EZLN. They can wipe us out, or they can appear to have wiped us out. They can close all of the entrances and say: "You no longer exist. We have killed you," even if we are alive. They can exercise military control over all of the valleys, and they can force us take to the mountains. The federal Army has the technical and military capability of doing this, but it will simply be postponing the problem once again. It could put an end to this rebellious group in southeastern Mexico, but other groups will emerge elsewhere. The federal Army cannot be deceived into thinking that the solution to the problem is a military solution. One way or another, history has hit a crossroads. It no longer depends on our forces. It depends on the organization of this divided or disorganized rebellion that is called civilian society. It depends on how it is consolidated and how it is organized. We are offering an alternative -- the convention. The convention would serve as a meeting point for armed groups and civilians to regulate this peaceful transition or to give it a little bit of coherence and, in the best of cases, to avoid an outbreak of a civil war. [Ibarra] Do you think the convention is indeed a suitable path? Can it be? [Marcos] Look, we, as an armed group, do not have many options; we do not have other paths. We are facing a military siege. We cannot send delegates to speak to other forces because they are suspicious about whether these people are really Zapatists. As has happened already, there are other forces who claim to be our forces for no other reason than to get money. In turn, there is a great deal of mistrust in other social sectors if someone comes and says: "I am a Zapatist; let us reach some agreement." Then, the only possibility left is to call upon all sectors to come and speak to us under terms of equality, but not to negotiate a surrender; this is what the San Cristobal dialogue attempt was. Instead, we need to talk and reach agreements on something -- for example, on what we oppose or what immediate steps should be taken in order that what we oppose does not happen. We have no other alternative, but we would welcome other efforts. Nevertheless, we feel there is so much skepticism among the people, but the government and the political parties still do not understand this. We see no alternative. For example, political parties all think the same thing: "People are going to forget about the EZLN, and we are going to retake the key role bestowed upon us by the calendar." The calendar gives them a piece of democracy, a piece of electoral change. The opposite, however, would happen -- and understand me clearly on this -- because in the period leading up to the elections a force that cannot participate in the elections is growing, an armed, clandestine force, a force without a face and which has a numerical disadvantage. This is not logical. Something is happening in this country, and I remind you about what I said in the last interview, when I told you: When everyone in the world had said "no" to armed struggles because of the disappearance of the socialist bloc, because of what happened in Nicaragua, because of the negotiations of El Salvador, and because the beginning of negotiations in Guatemala -- when everyone said "no" to armed struggles, why did we grow in 1992 and 1993? Why does an armed movement generate so much support in January 1994? Moreover, we are again issuing a warning, because in the pre-electoral period this force is growing, and this means that something is wrong. Something is still wrong in this country; there was no change, and no one believes there has been a change. There is a very serious credibility problem in terms of the legitimacy of the electoral process. The only way to legitimize the electoral process is for the government to step aside, for both the government and the government party to step aside. This is the alternative; the alternative was outlined in January, and it cannot be called the EZLN. It must be called something different. But believe me, weapons are going to thunder again if change is not produced. This is a warning, not a threat. Now they are telling us in the newspapers: "They are making threats from a position of force." No. We could surrender the weapons, everyone would be happy, and the situation would explode on 1 January, but all over the place. [sentence as published] Also, there would be no checks and balances, and then they would have regrets and repentance would follow. [Ibarra] But your political vision seems a bit too narrow because how can negotiations resume if you call for the president to resign, and if he resigns, will you put him on trial? [Marcos] No. We are not calling for negotiations with the government. Our "negative" response and the conclusion of the San Cristobal dialogue mean that there is no room or conditions for this to happen. I think the government recognizes this, and it already has made concessions in this regard. I want to state that we are giving up on a dialogue or an attempt at negotiations because we establish, in the document, that it is inappropriate to speak to a government that does not want to change. On the other hand, it is time to speak to the people who want to change it. We are saying we could talk and negotiate with another government -- perhaps with the government elected on 21 August or the government resulting from the convention. [Ibarra] Even if the government elected on 21 August is a PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] government presided over by Zedillo? [Marcos] We could deceive ourselves once more. We could try to speak and talk with such a government, but just look at the statements by Zedillo after we said "no." It is clear this gentleman has placed no hope in negotiations, and certainly he is not the government representative who has become our spokesman. With what determination or confidence can we talk to this gentleman, a gentleman, who following the dialogue, all the procedures, and the cease-fire declared that the negotiations failed, that dialogue is a failure? Evidently, this gentleman would want to negotiate with weapons; that is, he wants to talk to us with bullets. It is clear that he does not want to reach an accord and that he is not open to listening to us. Evidently, a Zedillo administration that may win the August elections would be a very problematic government to talk to, especially in terms of conditions and an agenda for such talks. Also, it would raise a question among all armed and unarmed Mexicans: Did he really win, or is it once again a sham? The sham might be clear -- say, a shameless fraud -- or it might be subtle. Nevertheless, even if he wins technically with so many votes over his closest opponent, he already faces a credibility problem. No one is going to believe this gentleman won the presidential elections after his performance. If it wins the presidential elections, the PRI's problem will not be the EZLN. Instead, its problem will be that of the entire country -- all Indian and peasant groups, workers, students, teachers, housewives, settlers. If it wins the presidential elections, the problem for the PRI will be a civil war; that is what its problem will be. [Ibarra] To be direct, there can be no peace with the PRI. [Marcos] No. This is final. Under these conditions, we have remained silent about what happens in other cases. People are no longer willing to wait for a commitment to behave properly and to make changes because the PRI is founded on a false system at all levels. The PRI has its own name and image, and it must pay its debts to everyone: Indian chiefs in Indian communities, municipal presidents, police chiefs, judicial police commanders, secretaries and engineers from some governmental office, employees, and others. The PRI has a name and a face for the people; the PRI can be blamed for anything that happens to anyone because it appointed an official somewhere whom it cannot remove now. As a political party, the PRI is built on these kinds of situations. It is impossible, as we said in our second declaration, for the government to comply with the San Cristobal agreement because it can do nothing to try to comply with it. I repeat: The PRI is built on such situations. Look how the seemingly most rational and logical agreement -- one that denounces discrimination against Indians and recognizes their dignity -- sparks reactions from the true natives of San Cristobal de las Casas and from the cattle ranchers who maintain that saying Indians are honorable is racism because they ask: So what does that make those who are not Indians? They even oppose this view. This cannot be. I insist the EZLN is not the problem; the whole country is the problem. The people are no longer willing to give the PRI another opportunity. Let us say the 1 January No more slogan has become No more state party by June 1994. I am telling you, we are betting on this in light of our analysis of the situation. [Ibarra] What we are talking about here is the permanence of the state party. [Marcos] Then, it does not make sense. If this system still has an opportunity to perpetuate itself, and if it still has the strength to rule, then why does a force that disadvantageously rebels against this system grow under such conditions? It is growing not only in the dispossessed sectors; its acceptance is growing in middle class sectors and even in business sectors. This force that is demanding change must have something to it. What we are saying is this: There seems to be a consensus among many sectors -- understand me on this -- and even among privileged classes, on the belief that the state party must disappear; there are few other alternatives. [Ibarra] What alternatives are left then? [Marcos] What we are proposing is a transition period for a transition government to make time for the diverse groups to organize themselves and to face whomever there is to face. This includes the majority of the population. This is what we are saying: If there are many forces that agree the state party must disappear, but they are divided on what should replace the party, then let us have a transition government to give these forces time to properly propose alternatives and see what happens. They say: "We lack time, because the elections are so close." This is how we respond: You lack time because the war is already coming. They must understand this. The problem in August is not the elections; it is the war. This is why we are saying the only possibility of resolving this problem is agreeing on appointing someone while the change is being organized. This someone must keep things more or less stable while we determine what forces are going to influence or head what is now being usurped by the state party -- namely, the people's resolve.
