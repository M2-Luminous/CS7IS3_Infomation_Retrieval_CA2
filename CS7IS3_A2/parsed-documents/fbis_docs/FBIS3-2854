The highly venerated vice president of the state revealed some of his "personal history" to fellow deputies: "The National People's Congress [NPC] has been established for 40 years, and I have also served for 40 years as a people's deputy since Premier Zhou Enlai invited me to Beijing to attend the congress for the first time. It is safe to say that I am a witness to New China's socialist democracy and legal construction." Rong Yiren made these emotional remarks when he, with President Jiang Zemin, joined the Shanghai NPC delegation's discussion of the government work report on the afternoon of 11 March. He recalled: "Democracy and the legal system have steadily developed since the founding of New China. The development was interrupted for a while during the 10-year turmoil. However, since the end of the `Cultural Revolution,' our democracy has continued to improve and develop, and our legal system has been steadily enhanced and strengthened. Our democracy is compatible with our national conditions. We must unswervingly adhere to the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." The senior NPC deputy earnestly remarked: "China is still a developing country, and its national strength is still not strong enough. Everyone should work hard to build up the country and improve the people's livelihood. However, some developments merit our attention -- developments such as excessive extravagance and waste, refusal to stress the spirit of plain living and hard struggle in economic construction, and the principle of building the country through thrift and diligence." At the beginning of reform and opening up, Rong Yiren, entrusted by central leading comrades, founded the China International Trust and Investment Corporation. The company, which took the lead in linking China with the international economy, helped acquire a good image for China's opening up and raised large sums of money for its socialist construction. He said yesterday: "China has 1.2 billion people. If everyone saves 10 yuan, there will be 12 billion yuan. The reason that today some countries dare to criticize us and interfere in our internal affairs is, to put it bluntly, we are still not rich and powerful. We must work with one heart and one mind and make arduous efforts to make China strong and prosperous." His forceful words were received with thunderous applause from Jiang Zemin and other deputies from Shanghai. The applause symbolized their respect and approval.
