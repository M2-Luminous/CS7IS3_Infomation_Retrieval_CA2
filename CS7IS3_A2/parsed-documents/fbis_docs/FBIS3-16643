Criminal proceedings against Cherepkov were instituted in February 1994 on charges of bribery. The decision followed the second day of unrest in the city. On Wednesday, armed riot police stormed the mayor's office and told Cherepkov and his closest aides they were dismissed from office. First Deputy Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who put up resistance, was literally carried out from the building by police. This was the second armed invasion of the city administration building. The first one occurred on the night of February 13, and was prompted, according to an official version, by the need to question Cherepkov on receiving a bribe from a certain Volkov. The mayor then remained at power thanks to public support. Supporters of the toppled mayor, including a group of voters who nominated him to the regional council, have announced that Cherepkov's toppling was an act of open arbitrariness and a gross violation of human rights. They said they would hold acts of protest, including hunger strikes at the regional administration headquarters.
