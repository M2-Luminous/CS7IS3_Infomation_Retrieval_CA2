The signing of that protocol was actually thwarted by the Armenian side, which demanded that the status of Nagorno-Karabakh be defined and that, in parallel, troops from the seized Azerbaijani territories be withdrawn. Unfortunately, the Armenian mission in Moscow also confirmed that the talks have ended in nothing. It blamed everything on the Azerbaijani delegation, which allegedly refused to sign the document.
