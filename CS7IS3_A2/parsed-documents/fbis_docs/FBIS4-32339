[Izetbegovic] Definitely not. It will take a long time yet before we can talk in terms of a normalization. I do not yet see any solution to the problems of the city and of Bosnia. And I am afraid that the issues concerning Sarajevo will be resolved last. Let us not forget that it is still a city under siege. [L'ESPRESSO] You do not seem to have much confidence in the negotiations. [Izetbegovic] I am sure that the negotiations, like those in Geneva, are useful. But it is a zigzag process. Ultimately we will reach a solution. Of the only two possible solutions -- peace or war -- only one is feasible. But I do not believe in the short term, because the negotiations are very unpleasant. [L'ESPRESSO] Let us return to Sarajevo. There is a great deal of unrest. First, the problem was survival. Now, it is how to make a living: There is no work... [Izetbegovic] Yes, work is the main problem. We are in the position of someone who is seriously ill; as long as he is ill, he has only one problem -- how to recover. But once he has recovered, he realizes that he has innumerable probes. Now, for instance, the markets are full of goods, but there is not yet the money needed to buy them. The situation will return to normal only when production has been set back in motion. [L'ESPRESSO] But why is an attempt not made to make this process quicker? [Izetbegovic] It is impossible. The most complex problem facing the world now is in fact Bosnia. And the most complicated problem in Bosnia is Sarajevo. Nobody now knows the solution. Look at the map. We are here. Around us there are the Serbs. And we in turn surround the Serbs who surround Sarajevo. Everyone is surrounded. So how is it possible to predict how it will end? There has been talk about a protectorate of Bosnia on the part of the world community: I leave people to talk. But any solution that Europe were to choose would be a non-solution. [L'ESPRESSO] You say that the embargo on Bosnia should be lifted. Will you succeed in this? [Izetbegovic] No, I do not think it is possible. But we have a duty to demand it. We could achieve another result -- that of depriving the Serbs of their heavy weapons. Let us remember that peace will only be possible if there is a balance of forces. This war, like all wars, is the result of an imbalance of armaments. In any case, the international community's response is significant -- when it says that more weapons means more bloodshed. So it should work to take the weapons -- heavy weapons, at least -- away from those who have them. [L'ESPRESSO] Are you not aware that people are very tired of this war? Even the soldiers of the Muslim army? [Izetbegovic] I think that this tiredness exists mainly on the Serbian side. We want peace, but we can continue the war. There is no tiredness among our soldiers, because our morale is different from theirs. We are the victims, and soldiers defending their own land always have a higher level of morale than the aggressors. The Serbs had 100 times more equipment and weapons than us. And still they failed to enter even Mostar or Tuzla. [L'ESPRESSO] Let me ask you to assign some grades. Which countries do you consider Bosnia's best friends? And who is at the bottom of the list? [Izetbegovic] The Muslim countries are in first place, then Germany, Italy, Belgium. At the bottom? France and Britain.
