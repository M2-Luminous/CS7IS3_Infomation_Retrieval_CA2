FR940902-0-00034 FR940902-0-00010 Strengthening monitoring provisions was the concern of a few commenters, who stated that requiring the school's financial aid officer to share financial information on JTPA participants with the SDA is key to following up on the participant's ISS and to coordinating JTPA funds with other sources of funding. The Department carefully considered comments which called for reduced coordination requirements but believes that information sharing agreements are necessary to ensure compliance with this section; however, the separate sharing of students' names may not be necessary since JTPA agreements with training institutions will include the names of participants for whom payments to the school are being made. Therefore, this requirement is removed from the final rule. Several commenters reported that schools are holding JTPA participants personally liable for payments withheld in accordance with the terms of performance-based contracts. Performance-based contracts (or any other agreements with service providers) must prohibit schools from holding the student liable for outstanding charges. Otherwise, the performance-based contract would be undercut because the incentive for the school to perform would be removed. This practice is prohibited by the U.S. Department of Education as described in the Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook, Pell Grant Section. Therefore, JTPA program operators should be aware that the use of certain contracting methods, particularly contracts for classroom-sized projects and fixed unit price, performance-based contracts, affects how educational institutions are permitted to calculate the COA, which determines the amount of the participant's Pell Grant. An institution can include a tuition and fee charge for calculating the federal Pell Grant COA only when contracts or agreements specify the tuition and fees (i.e., individual referrals), when there is a charge recorded to the student (when JTPA or another source pays the tuition and fee charge and the student would be required to pay these charges if they were not paid by JTPA or another source). Two types of JTPA agreements do not allow schools to include tuition and fees in the Pell COA or to make a charge to the student for these costs: (1) Blanket agreements that do not specify an individual amount to be paid by the SDA for tuition and fees but may include a number of students to be trained and an amount of compensation to be paid to the school; and (2) performance-based contracts (to the extent they are still used). Employment Generating, Economic Development, and Other Activities Section 141(q) of the Act prohibits employment generating activities (EGA) with JTPA funds. Included in the prohibition are economic development activities, revolving loan funds, capitalization of businesses, contract bidding resource centers, and similar activities. Section 627.225(b) encourages SDA staff to work with economic development agencies and to participate on economic development boards and commissions to provide information about JTPA. Such participation may assist SDA staff in making informed decisions about community job training needs and the future direction of local JTPA training. In addition, the prohibition of EGA should not be taken to prohibit ordinary employer outreach and job development activities.
