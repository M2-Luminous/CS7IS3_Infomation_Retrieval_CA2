FBIS3-30470 "dreeu023__a94028" FBIS-EEU-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Economy Minister: Miners' Claims `Justified' AU0102151994 Prague CTK in English 2159 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU0102151994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava January 31 (CTK) -- Slovak Minister of the Economy Jan Ducky today said miners' claims were justified and promised leaders of the Miners', Geologists' and Oil Industry Workers' Union that their social demands would be met for the first three months after the Slovak Government's programme of mining reductions began. After the first quarter, Ducky and Finance Minister Julius Toth would push for changes in the state budget with regard to the demands of the miners, Slovak Radio reported today. Ducky said that the problems of the Slovak mining industry were caused by changes in the structure of Slovakia's fuel and energy base, and because market conditions made it possible for bad quality but competitively-priced products to be imported to Slovakia. "We do not want a protection of the coal market which would give the domestic product an unfair advantage, but we have to find ways of limiting the import of substrates which destroy the environment," Ducky said. Union Chairman Marian Mesiarik expressed satisfaction with the results of today's meeting with Ducky, especially with the fact that the minister "did not doubt the social demands of the miners were justified." He said a council would be meeting on February 15 to discuss the problem of the Slovak mining industry. If the proposals of the unionists are approved, the coal industry will survive without state subsidies, he said. He said today's announcement of a sit-in after Ducky failed to arrive on time had now become insignificant.
