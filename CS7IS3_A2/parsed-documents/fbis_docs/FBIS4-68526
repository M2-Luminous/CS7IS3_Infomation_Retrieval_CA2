But, being true to himself and to his unpredictability, the president proposed "Variant 2" for discussion, which none of the deputies, obviously, had ever seen. It was passed out just before the meeting. Informing her colleagues about the process of preparing the Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia, State Duma Deputy Chairman Alevtina Fedulova said that this is not a legal and not an ideological document, but a political one, which "must reflect the consolidating viewpoints of different socio-political forces and representatives of different branches of power on a definite circle of vital questions." She also announced that the agreement, as compared with its first variant, more clearly "defines the rules of behavior of the parties." However, even a passing acquaintance with the document shows that this is far from being so, and that "Variant 2," like the first one, is reminiscent of a one-way street. "The parties promise to take all necessary measures for ensuring calm in the country," states the first section. Wonderful! Who would dare not to agree and to object against "calm in the country"? These "measures" are presented further: "The organizers of meetings, demonstrations and strikes assume not only legal, but also moral-political responsibility for the peaceful character of these actions and their implementation in strict accordance with the effective legislation." But what "obligations" do the president, the government and the power ministers assume? Or do they, as before, reserve the right to surround a peaceful demonstration staged on a state holiday with reinforced militia detachments--mounted and infantry militia troops, dogs, OMON [special purpose militia detachment], internal troops; to close off the streets with trucks which have been prepared ahead of time, and then to use water cannons, tear gas, and billy clubs against the demonstrators, as was the case in last year's May 1 demonstration on Leninskiy Prospect? Or to open fire on them from all types of weapons, including cannons and tanks, as in the days of the October tragedy? The document does not say a single word about the responsibility of the authorities. Or else, it contains postulates which cannot help but make one blush: "The parties proceed from the fact that the entire political process must be implemented within the framework of the constitution;" "The parties believe that the highest officials must maintain an ongoing dialogue with society and public associations, explain the meaning of the implemented reforms and specific decisions"... But why not write that the "parties" must, for example, wash their hands before eating? Yes, of course, as compared with "Variant 1," some "progress" is obvious. The threats of removing "those who do not agree" from the deputy mandate have disappeared, and certain "well-known public leaders and leaders of culture" are now excluded from the list of signatories since, as the deputy from the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], Yuriy Ivanov, noted, for the opposition the appearance of some representative of the mercenary capital beau monde is entirely inadmissable in this conciliatory commission. But, despite certain "cosmetic" corrections, the document submitted for discussion did not bring accord to the deputy corps. Most of the factions believe that they cannot sign such an agreement. Naturally, there were also speeches in support of the document which was being imposed on society--by representatives from the PRES [Party for Russian Unity and Accord], "Women of Russia" and "Russia's Choice." Civil accord in present-day Russia is impossible. That is the conclusion drawn by the governing board of the Russian All-People's Union in its announcement on provision of civil peace in Russia. This document was distributed by Deputy Sergey Baburin in the lobby. It has dotted all the i's: "There can be no accord between those who have gotten rich by plundering their Homeland and those who, after many decades of honest labor, have become poverty stricken; between those who have destroyed a great world power, its economy, army, and spiritual strength, who for the first time in decades have brought the Russian people to the brink of extinction, and those who opposed these processes with all their might. There can be no accord between those who in the Fall of 1993 performed a state overthrow, trampling the law and human lives for the sake of their own egotistical interests, and those who have remained true to the ideals of Law, Justice and Honor, and who stood up in defense of the defamed Constitution..."
