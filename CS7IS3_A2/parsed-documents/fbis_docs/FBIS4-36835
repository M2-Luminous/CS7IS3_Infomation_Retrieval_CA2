FBIS4-36835 "drnes114_o_94010" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper Stresses Peace Stand, Lebanese Resistance Paper Stresses Peace Stand, Lebanese Resistance JN1306085594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 13 Jun 94 JN1306085594 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Falsifying Facts Does Not Serve the Peace Process," AL-BA'TH newspaper editorial says: Although the entire world is now aware that Israel is responsible for halting the peace process, and, consequently for the inability of the bilateral peace talks in Washington to achieve what they were supposed to achieve, the Tel Aviv government still insists on reversing and falsifying facts by claiming that Syria is behind the failure to achieve the supposed breakthrough in the peace talks. The paper says that Israel continues to repeat this because Syria, from the outset of the peace talks, has been rejecting any peace outside the Madrid formula, stressing that peace should be based on the resolutions of international legitimacy. AL-BA'TH adds: This position basically conflicts with the known Israeli plans to drag the Arab parties into signing separate peace deals which would acknowledge everything Israel wants. AL-BA'TH notes that Syria's consistent and positive position on the peace process has been described by the U.S. administration and all world governments as the key to regional peace. The paper adds: The Geneva summit results and President Hafiz al-Asad's statements proved without any doubt that Syria is truly working for a just and comprehensive peace in the region, especially since the president stressed full withdrawal in return for full peace. In this regard, the paper points to the U.S. President's reply that Syria has the right to demand the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace. AL-BA'TH continues: Definitely, this U.S. statement was based on the facts of the regional conflict, and, consequently, on a conviction that it is impossible for partial and separate solutions to bring about regional security, peace, and stability. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Despite all that happened and may happen, the region will remain far from the real peace emphasized by the international community, unless there is full and absolute commitment to implementing all the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace, chief of which is a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. In the "With the Events" column, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The road to peace has clear features and signs. It begins with the implementation of the UN and Security Council resolutions. If this is not achieved, the national resistance in Lebanon will continue and will not retreat or compromise. The Israelis know better than others the resolve and solidity of this resistance. Only justice will triumph.
