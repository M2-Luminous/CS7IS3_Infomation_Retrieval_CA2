The president recognized that there are shortages and inequalities in Chiapas and that benefits and opportunities are not a reality for many, but he insisted that in recent years there have been earnest efforts to reverse the inequality that has prevailed for centuries in this zone of our country. The following is part of the president's message regarding the violent conflicts in Chiapas. [Begin Salinas recording] Let us never forget that we will be able to find points of consensus and solutions to all demands only through a dialogue within a legal framework. Let there be no doubt; no region in Mexico has differences that surpass our ability to settle them in a dialogue, nor is there a gap capable of dividing our essential unity. Violent actions obstruct true solutions to social needs and cast a shadow on the settlement of disputes. Politics and frank communication allow us to get to the bottom of differences, just as joint efforts meet social demands. Solutions are found and provided. Mexico has no place or time for disputes that are not settled within a legal framework. I reassert: We will always strive to defend the law and peaceful dialogue -- particularly for the defense of human rights and all the community's actions -- in Mexico. [end recording] President Carlos Salinas spoke to congressional legislators who visited him on Monday. The legislators met with Salinas for two reasons: to notify him about the conclusion of their period of sessions and to confirm their support for the nation's institutions given the violence that has arisen in the southern part of the country. The president, accompanied by Government Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido -- who, by the way, has remained silent in recent days -- emphasized that an essential unity among Mexicans prevails over pluralism and ideological differences. He said everyone is obligated to sponsor this unity as an expression of his love for the fatherland. The ceremony was held at the Venustiano Carranza Room in Los Pinos. Maria de los Angeles Moreno Uriega, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' commission, outlined the National Congress' position concerning the events in Chiapas. [Begin Moreno recording] The deputies who make up all the legislative factions and fellow senators who participated in the 55th legislative period have asked me to express their concern about the events in Chiapas and to state their strong rejection of the attitude assumed by armed groups that have resorted to violence in an attempt to justify it as a method to solve problems that involve and affect various groups of Mexicans. Likewise, the legislators express their conviction that we will continue to find peaceful solutions -- within the framework of the law and national constitution -- that will allow us to continue toward the achievement of specific social welfare goals, which is our shared goal and in which so much has been achieved in this phase for the sake of the republic. [end recording] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will receive various groups throughout the day. This morning he was visited by his closest aides. Representatives of various groups have also arrived and will continue to arrive for the New Year celebrations.
