There is no support for the idea in the ruling FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party of First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, according to party sources. A well-placed source in the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] that is the political umbrella of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said the party would listen to the proposal, be polite, but completely ignore it. But the coalition government is having trouble administering the country and there is bickering among members of the royalist FUNCINPEC party. In the provinces, the newly appointed provincial governors of FUNCINPEC find themselves blocked by an administration controlled by the CPP. As the governor of one of the country's largest provinces recently pointed out: "I advance one step and then go three backward. Everything I try to do is blocked by my deputy who used to be the CPP's previous governor." In the capital, Phnom Penh, things are not much better. The only ministry that seems to be working in a coordinated fashion is the ministry of finance because FUNCINPEC's Sam Rangsi is related to his CPP deputy, Cham Prasit. The national assembly has been paralysed since the CPP decided to get it to approve the re-admission of Prince Norodom Chakkrapong and Sin Son, a former national security minister, both of whom were involved in the short-lived secession of seven Cambodian provinces immediately after the May 1993 elections. Important legislation for Cambodia's future remains blocked until the impasse over Chakkrapong and Sin Son can be solved. A formula has now been proposed by which the order of the agenda of the assembly's meetings will be changed to allow the passage of at least some legislation. King Sihanouk has been giving recent visitors a very sombre picture of today's Cambodia and has strongly criticised the leaders of the royal government for not looking after the interests of the people. At the same time, he has said that many people have asked him to try to redress the situation. In public, the king says he is too old, in bad health and does not have the team that can take control of the situation and stop Cambodia from "sinking like the Titanic". In fact, the ailing king is said to think otherwise. But he would need an ally in the CPP, which continues to control the country even though FUNCINPEC won, by however small a margin, the United Nations organised elections a year ago. In the light of this political imperative, and in view of the king's cooler relations with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, insiders point to the monarch's recent repeated praise for Chea Sim, the CPP strongman. Chea Sim and his wife visited the king in Peking in March but little is known of their discussions apart from Chea Sim's expression of deep concern over events in Cambodia. Even if Sihanouk were to form an alliance with Chea Sim by which the king is given certain but not full powers, the question would remain as to what to do with the Khmer Rouge insurgency. Would Chea Sim allow the king to give some posts to some Khmer Rouge officials? The other question that concerns many Cambodians is what kind of powers the CPP would grant to the king and how the party administration would react to the new arrangement. The call for new elections made by the king last week has not been taken seriously by any of the parties concerned and the issue appears dead. Sihanouk is now retreating to Peking, from where he will observe events in Cambodia, and perhaps hope that a call will come for him to save the "ship Kampuchea" from sinking, through a new and last royal crusade.
