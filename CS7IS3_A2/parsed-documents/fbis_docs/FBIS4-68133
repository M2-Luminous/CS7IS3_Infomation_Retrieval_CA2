We were informed about this in the press center of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]. "Although," specified V. Gogolashvili, head of the press center, "it is still too early to say that the murderers have been caught and, generally, to make any loud statements." Less than a week has passed since the murder of Gulua and two MVD employees accompanying him. The investigative bodies are refraining from presenting any specific versions. In the immediate days and even hours following the barbaric terrorist act on the Nutsubidze plateau [as published], it became known only that the police had managed to identify the registration number of one of the cars that had blocked the deputy minister's path and from which the first rounds of automatic gun fire came and also to ascertain the type of weapon used in the killing. An easy logical calculation suggests that, once the weapon has been identified from the cartridge case, this means it has been officially registered; however, some petty criminal scum is not so decent as to register his weapon. A brief journalistic survey carried out at the scene of the incident enabled a curious detail to be added to the picture: Literally 15 minutes before the murders took place, unknown persons carrying automatic weapons chased some children into buildings located near a school and kindergarten. What amazing humaneness, particularly given what occurred later. As directly regards the versions of what happened, according to unofficial information gleaned "in the corridors," the investigation is leaning toward the view that Gulua was the victim of mafia structures. He was in charge of the transport police. Highways and railroads in Georgia have already become virtually the principal feeding trough for underground business. It is also nothing new that Georgia is increasingly becoming a transit country for drugs and this activity comes into direct conflict with the work of this transport police (along with specialized structures). However, one cannot of course exclude other versions as well. Gulua, who stood out as a man of principle, was a fairly well-known figure in the Georgian law enforcement bodies. He did not play an insignificant role in the events that took place at the end of 1991 and beginning of 1992 [overthrow of ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia]; he was later taken prisoner by the Zviadists in western Georgia and a serious operation was undertaken by special subunits to secure his release. In Abkhazia, Gulua was also in the command structures.... He could "hinder" many people. A serious investigation is underway. The Procurator's Office, the security services, and the MVD are involved in it. These bodies do not forgive when one of their own is killed and they should not forgive. How often have we written about various terrorist acts and almost on every occasion we have concluded with the words: "One would like to hope that, at least, this time...." Now as well, we would sincerely like to hope that the guilty persons will be found and punished -- as in all previous terrorist acts, a list of which we have compiled from memory below, which are the most notorious cases. We have added brief comments on the progress made in solving these cases. To be honest, these comments do not raise one's spirits particularly. Attempt on the life of D. Ioseliani [former first deputy chairman of State Council, leader of "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary group that has now been incorporated into the Rescue Corps] (13 June 1992); explosion on Chikovani Street [Tbilisi] -- investigation concluded; trial in progress; Explosion in car of D.

Our readers certainly understand why.
