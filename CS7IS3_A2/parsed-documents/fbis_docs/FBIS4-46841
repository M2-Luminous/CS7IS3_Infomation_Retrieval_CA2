The State Duma Acted Correctly, Accepting the Russian Federation's 1994 Federal Budget in Principle and Giving the Government Time To Perfect It"] [Text] Of course, the budget is not designed to accomplish any major national priorities (scientific-technical, social, or whatever) or even to get out of the economic crisis, but only to maintain a more or less stable position in the context of the crisis. But it is exactly what a budget can be that is oriented toward a moderately stern financial policy, taking account of present Russian realities. And I think that any major abrupt changes in the draft could induce social and political destabilization, even the kind of changes that are objectively progressive, for example further decentralizing the budget or reducing the percentage of state spending in the gross domestic product. Nevertheless, the draft budget brings up a number of questions, questions that are so serious that, in my opinion, the government has to answer them. The draft budget states, for example, that planned revenues from privatization in 1994 are estimated in the amount of 148 billion rubles or, at the rate of exchange this year, less than 85 million dollars. Why such a small amount? The first stage of privatization, during which state property was handed out almost free of charge, comes to an end starting 1 July, and sales for money begin. The government will have another half year to obtain a real monetary return to the budget from privatization. Why are revenues from that source planned in amounts several times smaller than last year, taking anticipated inflation into account? There is money in the country, after all, as is indicated by the amounts of capital being taken abroad. What does the government intend to do to attract at least some of the national capital that is flowing out of Russia in the privatization process? I wish it would explain why efforts to activate foreign participation in privatization have been so ineffective that real revenues from privatization in the draft budget are being reduced. Only by getting to the bottom of these questions can we make a decision on this item of the budget. There are also many questions regarding the budget revenue source represented by import duties, total collections of which should come to 500 million dollars in 1994, given taxable imports in the amount of 21.4 billion dollars. Recent decisions in this field indicate that the government has no long-term foreign trade policy and that it is conducting a policy serving the interests of Russia's industrialists at the expense of the interests of Russia's consumers. Moreover, this protectionism embodies neither priorities nor time frames. Especially puzzling is the introduction of duties on imports of modern equipment, without which any structural restructuring and modernization of Russia's industry is unthinkable. At a time when Western countries have dissolved COCOM and are relaxing their bans on deliveries of modern machinery and equipment to Russia, our government is instituting prohibitive duties on imports thereof. This protection of uncompetitive national industrialists dooms the country to technological backwardness. Analyzing the revenue items of the proposed budget, you have to conclude that it underrates the potential of the source represented by transactions with state securities. Of course, it is more difficult to implement such transactions than to take soft 10-percent loans from the Central Bank--in other words, from the printing press. However, actively mobilizing the population's money resources, although it is more complicated, does have an anti-inflationary effect. Before agreeing to the proposed structure of budget revenues, I should like our government to tell us what its approach is to the use of domestic state loans as a source of budget revenues. As for budget expenditures, without changing their overall amounts it is possible and necessary to change the proportion of expenditures on certain items. Spending on fundamental research and scientific-technical progress--4.2 trillion rubles--seems way too low. Yet this is practically the only competitive potential the country has (not counting raw materials)! Not only that, the share of budget expenditures on science and technology is being reduced from 2.5 to 2.3 percent compared with last year. One-quarter of all expenditures are appropriated for the Russian Academy of Sciences and all its branches. It is unclear why this percentage is so low, considering that the Russian Academy of Sciences has always been the principal base of fundamental research in the country. Another source of puzzlement is the sharp increase in the share of spending to support the "civil" state apparatus. Plans call for increasing this amount by 1.5 times--from 1.4 to 2.1 percent. Why such a big increase? To some extent we can justify a reasonable increase in the size of the state administrative apparatus in subjects of the Federation and on the city, rayon, and other local levels, and expenditures to support it. Decentralization is bringing about an increase in the size of the counterpart apparatus in the localities. But not in the Federal apparatus! Yet the size of the apparatus of the Federal ministries and departments increased by 2.4 times in 1991-1993. Meanwhile, the number of workers on the republic, oblast, kray, and other levels of authority declined by 1.2 times--that is, to half the size. Before approving that part of the budget, we need to study the causes of the absolute and relative growth of budget expenditures on state administration in order to reduce them as much as possible, and also to take measures to reduce the growth of the Federal bureaucracy, and if possible, reduce its size. Incidentally, the share of expenditures on the Federal court system and procuracy bodies is to be reduced from 0.7 to 0.6 percent. Is this compatible with the necessity of strengthening judicial and juridical institutions in the framework of building a rule-of-law state? I think there are reserves for reducing military spending, which is 20.3 percent of the budget or 5.1 percent of the gross domestic product (compared to 4.6 percent last year). And this does not count major appropriations on closed administrative-territorial formations of the Defense Ministry, which is a separate item. That high share of military expenditures is something our country can hardly afford. The budget's declining social orientation is also cause for disappointment. In the new budget, the share of expenditures on social needs, including education, health, culture, and so on, is being reduced from 7.8 to 6.2 percent. It is unclear, also, how we are to finance the professional-qualifications retraining of unemployed persons, whose numbers may rise substantially. In this regard, a special Federal program needs to be adopted if we want to avert serious social collisions.
