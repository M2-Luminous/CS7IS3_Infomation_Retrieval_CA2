The clause on the proposed military expenditure was the stumbling block: The State Duma approved it as 37 trillion rubles in the first reading, but the Federation Council brought it up to 55 trillion, thereby increasing it by 18 trillion rubles. "I want to stress that these decisions are not final, but just a process; the parliamentarians are continuing their considerable and tense work," Valentin Kovalev told the ITAR-TASS correspondent who asked him for his comments. "I do not think that the military budget is an issue for conflict, although I would like to remind you that a conciliation procedure exists within the framework of the Federal Assembly between the State Duma and the Federation Council," he said. "We proceed from the premise that the conciliation procedure should be permanent, and we will resolve all contradictory questions within its framework consistently. I am convinced that the chambers will reach agreement," Valentin Kovalev stressed. Asked what the reaction of the deputies in the State Duma might be to the Federation Council's decision, although not yet final, he noted that "predictions are thankless things, especially if one takes into account the fact that we have 10 factions and deputies' groups plus another unregistered group of deputies. That means there are 11 points of view on every question. Proceeding from this, it is difficult to make any prediction, but I am convinced that within the framework of the conciliation procedure which operates not only between the chambers but but also between the factions and deputies' groups, we will reach a mutually acceptable decision which will be to the liking not only of the Federal Assembly and the government, but also of the country as a whole," Valentin Kovalev stressed.
