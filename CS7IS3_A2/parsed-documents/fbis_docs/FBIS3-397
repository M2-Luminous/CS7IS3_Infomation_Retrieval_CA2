The development came only hours after the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] also announced its decision to register. Gen. Viljoen, a former South African Defense Force chief, insisted, however, that his party's decision had still to be confirmed by the front's controlling Volksraad [National Assembly] today. A total of 29 parties have registered for the election. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Caro Kriel] Gen. Constand Viljoen made his surprise entrance at 15 minutes before midnight. He said the registration was provisional, because the Volksfront did not have enough time to discuss the IFP's decision to contest the elections provisionally. [Viljoen] No, I didn't come to register tonight, because the decision from the IFP, a member of our alliance, came this evening, and then our controlling bodies will only be meeting tomorrow, and because of the deadline, and because of the fact that the [Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, Chairman] Judge [Kriegler] has said to us that this is the real deadline, we decided to come and discuss with the officials here tonight whether, if we hand in all our papers and refer the case to the controlling body tomorrow, then we can by phone confirm that it is OK, they can carry on. [Kriel] But IEC officials confirmed the registration and said the party had paid the 70,000 rands deposit. The party, registered under the name Freedom Front, has until 12 noon today to change its name. Earlier the IFP delegation, headed by the party's national chairman, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, arrived to register. This was provisional, pending negotiations on international mediation concerning key constitutional issues. Dr. Mdlalose also denied any split in the Freedom Alliance. [Mdlalose] People have wanted to see a split ever so often. There's no split. We are different parties, and we formed the Freedom Alliance as a negotiating alliance. [Kriel] As midnight drew closer, other parties also registered, among them the African Moslem Party, the African Moderates Congress, and the Federal Party. [Federal Party spokesperson Frances Kendall] It's the poor people, the ordinary people, that get sidelined all the time. Nobody in the end ever reaches their needs. [Kriel] And a maverick party, calling themselves the Soccer Party. [First unidentified Soccer Party member] We've only just finished a game, and, you know, sport comes first. We were playing with the other guys in our neighborhood. [Second unidentified Soccer Party member] We believe we are the only fit party, actually, to represent the voters. We're the only guys fit to govern. Yes, the sporting party. [end recording]
