Li, who arrived here on Tuesday for a five-day visit to Norway, spoke highly of the cooperation between Norway and China after they established diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago. He said that many new changes emerging after the Cold War have created favorable conditions for international cooperation and development. He said, however, regional conflicts are increasing in the world and economic situation in many countries is worsening. Thus, preservation of world peace and promotion of economic development remain the two primary tasks for the international community. Li stressed that China pursues a foreign policy of independence and peace and wishes to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world. He added that all nations, small or big, weak or strong, poor or rich, have the right to equally participate in international affairs. Li said that Western Europe plays an important role in international politics and economy, and China shares common views with it on many important international issues. He said China would like to develop cooperation with the west including Norway on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference with each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. Godal said that East Asia, which has been experiencing a fast economic growth, is playing a more and more important role in international affairs and China is an active stable factor there. He said Sino-Norwegian relations have developed rapidly in recent years and his government wishes China more successes in its reforms. He added that China's reform will benefit the world economy and the trade and economic cooperation between Norway and China.
