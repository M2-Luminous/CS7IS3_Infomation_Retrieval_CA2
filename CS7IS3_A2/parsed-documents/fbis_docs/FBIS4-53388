In his speech at an official dinner in the honor of Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers on Tuesday, 5 April, President Suharto again stressed the united position of Indonesia, Nonaligned Movement countries, and other developing countries. "I stressed that basic human rights and liberties, as embodied and spelled out in the charter and various other declarations and documents of the United Nations, do indeed include things that are universal in nature. Basic human rights should be protected and promoted by all nations. This needs to be done through international cooperation on the basis of equality," the president emphasized. Attention needs to be given to the very close connection between basic human rights and other rights, such as civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, the president continued. The balance between individual rights and the rights of society and the nation also needs to be guarded. The United Nations itself, the president said, acknowledges that the authority and responsibility for implementing those rights nationally lies with each government and fully notes the differences among countries with regard to culture, religion, customs, and levels of economic growth. No Signs Earlier, the president said that there are as yet no signs that the international economic disparity can be resolved. Growing economic globalization has drastically changed production, trade, and monetary patterns and has had the impact of producing large economic groupings among industrialized countries in ways that tend toward protectionism, discrimination, and a climate of unhealthy competition. "In this situation, Indonesia is convinced of the need to bridge the economic disparity between the North and the South through international cooperation, consultation, and consultative dialogue," the president said. The president also said that he has never seen the fortunes and interests of the North and the South as closely connected as they are now. Therefore, the president said, it is natural and logical for both sides to expand cooperation on the basis of true mutual dependence, mutual interests, and mutual benefit. The president said that countries now face uncertainty in various aspects of life. The end of the cold war and East-West enmity has opened opportunities for building a new era for international relations. Growing mutual dependence and economic globalization have provided hopeful opportunities. Nevertheless, the hopeful world situation is not without obstacles and challenges. "Several new problems and dilemmas have emerged on the political and economic scene. In some areas, there have arisen new tensions and conflicts, aggression and foreign interference, conflicts rooted in ethnic and religious controversies, new forms of racism, and the resurrection of narrow nationalism," the chief of state said. In a world situation full of uncertainty, Indonesia and other developing countries are conducting their respective national development in order to catch up. "We fully realize that the responsibility for the development of a nation is entirely on the shoulders of that nation itself. On the other hand, we also realize that success will remain difficult to achieve if international and regional spheres are not supportive. That is the reason why the Indonesian people always take part in encouraging the creation of a world economic order based on partnership, equality, and fairness," the president said. The president said that, remembering their very long ties of history, relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands have significance for both countries. Nevertheless, the president said, we can now give new meaning and objectives to the ties of the past. "We establish these ties as countries on the same level who respect each other, avoid interfering in each other's internal affairs, and provide benefit to each other," the president stated. Opportunities In their talk on Tuesday afternoon, President Suharto told Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers that there are opportunities for Dutch businessmen to take part in developing various aspects of the economic infrastructure, such as the construction of electric power plants, telecommunications facilities, and a container port under the BOT (build, operate, transfer) system. "President Suharto also opened opportunities for Dutch businessmen to invest their capital here. Their products can be marketed not only in the European Community, but in the Asia Pacific area, too," Murdiono said as he described to reporters the results of the talks between President Suharto and Prime Minister Lubbers at Freedom Palace on Tuesday, 5 April. According to Murdiono, the opportunity to develop the various aspects of the economic infrastructure was offered to Dutch businessmen because of the state's limited financial ability to develop that infrastructure. In response to the president's offer, Prime Minister Lubbers said the Netherlands is ready to expand cooperation in the economic sector because Dutch businessmen have considerable investment capability. Naval Cooperation According to Murdiono, Prime Minister Lubbers specifically offered cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia in the naval sector for acquisition of ships, use of Dutch technology (which is considered to be quite high), and, possibly, joint exercises. The minister of state and state secretary [MENSESNEG] said the president responded that those matters can be discussed at the senior official level. Nevertheless, Murdiono said, the president also stressed that the Indonesian people are determined to give priority to economic development. "This does not mean that Indonesia has accepted the proposal from the Dutch Government," he added. Murdiono explained that defense and security development does in fact have priority, although the priority is not as high as that of economic development. "Therefore, we must see first what it is they are offering and what we need, and before they offer we must see whether we are able to pay for it," the MENSESNEG said. The president also took the opportunity to explain the thinking behind strategic development in both PJP [Long-Term Development] I and PJP II, in addition to explaining matters related to the Nonaligned Movement and APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]. On his part, Prime Minister Lubbers explained various developments in Europe. The president also urged the Netherlands to participate in cooperation within the three-way South-South concept. The problem, said Murdiono, is that South-South cooperation is often difficult to carry out because the funds of Southern countries are limited. In this situation, it is hoped that a third party, in this case industrialized countries, will participate.
