Fred Chijuka, [words indistinct]. Chijuka [words indistinct] while chatting with newsmen explained that the government had, however, decided that no additional troops would be deployed to Liberia. He further explained that the plan and feeling among the military authorities was that the country should start reducing its troops in Liberia, as soon as other African countries expected to contribute troops had done so. The withdrawal of the troops, Brig.-Gen. Chijuka said, would effectively commence when troops from the expected countries had taken over some of the areas currently manned by Nigerian troops. The defence spokesman noted that the situation in Liberia was gradually improving as no faction was currently fighting with the peace keeping force. He, however, said that heavy equipment requiring maintenance after use in the ECOMOG operations was being returned to Nigeria. It will be recalled that Nigerian troops had been serving in the peace keeping force since 1990 when the operation commenced.
