"We don't have any confirmation at the moment either with AWACS (radar planes) or visually by Deny Flight pilots. Right now we have nothing to substantiate or to confirm that such attacks took place," a spokesman at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe said. According to military sources here, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo who implicated Croat planes in the attacks on Vitez and Novni Travnik based his statements on reports from the Bosnian Government military. NATO officials had been trying to confirm the bombings with UN observers on the ground or from NATO planes monitoring the situation, but had only been able to trace the source of the story back to the Moslem-majority government, the military sources said. UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said Friday that planes and helicopters launched rocket attacks Thursday on areas controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian Army in central Bosnia. Aikman implicitly pointed the finger at the Bosnian Croat HVO forces who are fighting Moslem forces in the area. Some 160 NATO planes are stationed in Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic as part of "Operation Deny Flight" over Bosnia-Herzegovina.
