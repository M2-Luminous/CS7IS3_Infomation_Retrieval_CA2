FR940328-1-00037 FR940328-1-00018 48 CFR Parts 45 and 52 [FAR Case 91&hyph;93] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Special Tooling Under Fixed Price Contracts AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to amend the Government's policy on managing and controlling special tooling, for which the Government has the right to title. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;93 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jack O'Neill at (202) 501&hyph;3856 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;93. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The CAAC and the DARC published a final rule on FAR 52.245&hyph;17, Special Tooling, in Federal Acquisition Circular 84&hyph;53, in the Federal Register at 54 FR 48978, November 28, 1989. The purpose of this change was to clarify that the special tooling clause is used in fixed-price contracts when the Government will furnish special tooling to the contractor, or the contractor will acquire or fabricate special tooling, and the Government intends to maintain rights to the special tooling until it takes full title or has no further interests in the tooling. The change listed the type of information the contractors must keep in their property control system and defined the reporting requirements for the special tooling. As a result of concern expressed by some contractors over the increased recordkeeping requirements required by the clause, revisions were made to that clause and are contained in this proposed rule. Specifically, we reverted to managing right-to-title special tooling under an improved special tooling clause, 52.245&hyph;17, and to managing existing Government-owned special tooling under the clause at 52.245&hyph;2, Government Property (Fixed Price Contracts), as we did prior to FAC 84&hyph;53. The revised clause at 52.245&hyph;17 requires contractors to maintain minimal records for right-to-title special tooling, and we have removed data requirements such as contracts under which the special tooling was originally acquired, complete hierarchy of part numbers, tool part number, and some retention codes. We did add the following data to the lists of special tooling required under the contract: (1) The part number of the item on which used and the next higher assembly, as well as the retention code; (2) storage method code; (3) weight and dimensions; and (4) excess code. These additions are necessary to permit the Government to make informed retention or disposal decisions. We also added a paragraph at FAR 45.306&hyph;1 to state that Government-owned special tooling shall be subject to the Government property clause, and we moved a paragraph from FAR 45.306&hyph;5 addressing the method of acquisition to a more appropriate location at FAR 45.306&hyph;4. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the rule applies to special tooling on Government contracts which, in most cases, is furnished to large businesses for large dollar production contracts. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart and will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;93), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq . However, it does reduce the amount of information required from contractors. A revised clearance for FAR Part 45 concerning Special Tooling Under Fixed Price Contracts and reducing the burden hours by a total of 585,600 is being submitted to OMB for approval. Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a Federal Register notice. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 45 and 52 Government procurement. Albert A.
