Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: National Training Survey Form Number(s): NTS&hyph;1. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 2,033 hours. Number of Respondents: 6,400 will receive an introductory letter. 3,000 of those will be contacted for an interview. Avg Hours Per Response: 35 minutes including the letter. Needs and Uses: The Bureau of the Census plans to conduct the National Training Survey (NTS) for the Center for Educational Quality of the Workforce (EQW), a group of social scientists funded by the National Center for Education Statistics to study the workplace in America. The NTS will provide unique information on employer&hyph;provided training by identifying relationships between the training and economic characteristics of the establishment. The EQW will incorporate the results of this survey into a larger five&hyph;year examination of the American workplace and will coordinate its efforts with similar studies and groups in other countries and with the World Bank. This examination will provide planners and policy&hyph;makers in government and the private sector with information on how our workforce compares and competes with other countries in South America and the Far East. The Census Bureau will also study ways of incorporating establishment data gathered in the NTS into our Longitudinal Research Database. Affected Public: Businesses or other for&hyph;profit organizations. Frequency: One&hyph;time only. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.
