FR941205-2-00088 FR941205-2-00049 As a result of the proposed changes to Rules 1066 and 1033, corresponding changes to OFPA F&hyph;4 will be required. OFPA F&hyph;4 (Orders Executed as Spreads, Straddles, or Combinations) would be amended to reflect the definitional changes to Rule 1066. Accordingly, the title would be changed to ``Orders Executed as Spread, Straddle, Combination or Synthetic Orders,'' and the text would reflect the new term, synthetic orders. OFPA F&hyph;4 would additionally require the marking of order tickets executed in reliance upon the spread priority rules with a ``syn'' for synthetic orders in addition to the existing requirement that spreads, straddles, and combinations also be marked with the identifier ``sp,'' ``st,'' or ``comb.'' Also, the Phlx will disseminate the appropriate Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') prefix as an indicator that each option leg was executed as part of a hedge transaction. 11 A new Advice enumerating the procedure for executing hedge orders is also proposed for both equity option and foreign currency option (``FCO'') floors. OFPA F&hyph;14 (Executing Hedge Orders) restates the definitions in Rule 1066(f) and the priority procedures in Rule 1033(d) and (e) for easy reference by floor persons in the floor procedure advice handbook. Finally, Advice D&hyph;2, Instances of Non-Liability for Floor Brokers or Specialists, would be amended to include synthetic orders. 11 See Amendment No. 1. Certain changes proposed by the Phlx to Rules 1066 and 1033 are applicable solely to the trading of FCOs. The Phlx believes these changes will allow Phlx market participants to utilize foreign currency options contracts more effectively as risk hedging instruments. The Exchange notes that the FCO markets tend to attract and be utilized by sophisticated institutional and corporate investors. This is in part due to the nature of the instruments and the tremendous size of the underlying currency markets. Sophisticated institutional and corporate investors frequently effect ratio and multi-part transitions, rather than relying on one-to-one spreads and other orders. First, because Rule 1033 deals with priority for different types of spreads, existing Commentary .02 of Rule 1066 is proposed to be moved to Rule 1033(f). Because Rule 1066 generally contains definitional provisions, a new Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 would be adopted containing a definition of multi-spread transactions in FCOs. 12 12 The Phlx amended Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 to require that all legs of a multi-spread transaction be for the same account. See Amendment No. 2. Second, Rule 1033(g) is proposed to be added to state that for options on foreign currency, a spread order may consist of a different number of contracts so long as the number of contracts differ by a permissible ratio. As a result, ratio spreads would become eligible for spread priority pursuant to Rule 1033(d). For purposes of this rule, a permissible ratio would be defined as one-to-one, on-to-two, one-to-three, and two-to-three. Third, proposed Rule 1033(h) is a new paragraph governing multi-spread priority for an FCO participant holding two spread type orders for the same amount. Eligible multi-spread transactions in FCOs, as defined in new Commentary .02 of Rule 1066, could be executed as a single transaction as long as at least one of the individual legs of each individual spread (up to a maximum of six legs for the total transaction, or two spreads) is executed at a better price than the established bid or offer for that option, and that no option leg is executed at a price outside of the established bid or offer for that option contract. The language of Rule 1033(h) parallels existing language in Rule 1033(f), relating to three-way transactions. 13 13 Proposed amended rule 1033(f) defines three-way transactions as spread, straddle, and combination orders of three individual series in the same FCOs where (i) the order size for each of the three individual series are equal to each other, or (ii) the combined order size of any two series on the same side of the market is either equal to the order size of the third series or differs from the order size of the third series by a permissible ratio. A permissible ratio is any one of the following: one-to-one, one-to-two, one-to-three, and two-to-three. Finally, OFPA F&hyph;16 (Two-Way, Three-Way and Multi-Spread Transactions) is proposed by the Phlx for adoption. This Advice restates the aforementioned definitions and procedures regarding FCO spread priority for easy reference by floor persons in the floor procedure advice handbook. II. Discussion
