FBIS4-5508 "dreas070_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 North Korea Anniversary of 10-Point Reunification Plan Marked Anniversary of 10-Point Reunification Plan Marked Joint Meeting Held SK1104114294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1124 GMT 11 Apr 94 SK1104114294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- A joint meeting of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, political parties and public organisations for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by thoroughly implementing "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song took place at the People's Palace of Culture on Monday. Attending the meeting were Kang Song-san, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the Administration Council, Kim Pyong-sik, vice-president of the DPRK and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, and other representatives of political parties and public organisations and officials concerned. Yang Hyong-sop, alternate Politburo member of the WPK Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, delivered a report at the meeting. The reporter said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation which was authored by the great leader and adopted as a joint action programme of the nation for peaceful reunification, for the unshakable independent and patriotic stand and fair and aboveboard stand running through all its points, serves as the most reasonable and feasible grand political programme of national unity and a grand charter of national reunification, which is acceptable to all who truly love the country and the nation and want the reunification of the country. All Koreans should, above all, get united as one nation, irrespective of differences in ideology, idea and social system and occupation, in order to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, the reporter said. Stressing the need to arrange an arena of nationwide dialogue where the will and demand of the 70 million fellow countrymen could be brought together to closely unite all the Korean nationals in the North, the South and overseas in hearty response to the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, the reporter said: All the Koreans, conscious of their heavy national responsibility and obligation to shape the destiny of the nation by themselves, must confirm through open-hearted dialogue that they are fellow countrymen who cannot live separated from each other and seek a detailed way of achieving national unity, transcending the ideology and system as the same nation. Out of this desire, we courteously propose to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and individual figures and overseas compatriots to have a national conference for seeking a way for great unity of the whole nation in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15 this year, a year before the 50th anniversary of national liberation. It may be a round-table conference to be participated in by the authorities and representatives of political parties and social organizations and individuals of the North and the South and representatives of overseas compatriots on an equal footing. The participants may have an open-hearted discussion of practical measures for achieving a great unity of the whole nation, common tasks of the nation arising as prerequisites to realising national reunification in the '90s and other matters of concern for the whole nation. I consider it necessary for the successful convocation of the national conference to form a preparatory committee of the national conference with five representatives each from the North, South and overseas. We think that it is desirable to have the first meeting of the preparatory committee in Pyongyang or Seoul in mid- May. We, availing ourselves of this opportunity, hold that the South Korean authorities must discontinue the nuclear war exercises and stop seeking an "international cooperation system" for the great unity of the whole nation, proceeding from the independent stand of the nation, to create a climate favourable to the convocation of the national conference. Speeches were made at the joint meeting by Director Chong Mun-san of the Secretariat of the Administration Council; Vice-Chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Social Democratic Party Kim Yong-ho; Director of the Secretariat of the C.C., the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland Yu Ho-chun; and Chairman of the C.C., the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae. They urged the South Korean authorities to give up their foolish intention to solve something by relying on outside forces and respond to the proposal for the convocation of the historical national conference, accepting the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation. A letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and individual figures and compatriots overseas was adopted at the meeting.
