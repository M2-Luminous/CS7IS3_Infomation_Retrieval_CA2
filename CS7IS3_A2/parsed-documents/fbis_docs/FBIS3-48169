"The main purpose of the Rev. Graham's visit is to discuss problems related to the construction of a church in the Najin-Sonbong area, designated by North Korea as a free economic zone, and how to channel Christian funds for it," the source said. Graham, who visited North Korea in 1992, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Jan. 22 and leave the Chinese capital the next day aboard a North Korean airliner for Pyongyang, the source said. "As he did in 1992, Graham hopes to meet North Korean President Kim Il-song and hold a service at Bongsu Church in Pyongyang," the source added. Graham conveyed a message from then U.S. President George Bush to Kim Il-song and delivered a lecture at Kim Il-song University when he visited North Korea between March 31 and April 4, 1992, at the invitation of the Council of North Korean Christian Churches. Pyongyang has taken a series of positive measures to induce church funds into North Korea as part of its efforts to prop up its sagging economy. In this connection, there is a fundraising campaign among ethnic Koreans in northeastern China to help build a church in the Najin-Sonbong zone.
