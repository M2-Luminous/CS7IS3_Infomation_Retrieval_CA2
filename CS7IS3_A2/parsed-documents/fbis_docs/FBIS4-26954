Coming from all corners of the country, they sat together for the purpose of discussing the question of reporting on rural areas, but the discussions easily moved to what they saw and heard on their news-gathering trips and their own responses and feelings. Carried here are excerpts from their talks. Though their feelings about the rural areas now were mixed excitement and worry, they reached a consensus on the following: The Situation: Development and Changes Are Predominant Gong Junchun [7895 0193 4783] (LIAONING RIBAO): Changes in Liaoning in the past few years are really encouraging. In the past, when people from the northeast traveled southward, they purchased rice, meat, and eggs to take home. They were known throughout the country for this. Now agriculture is much more developed in Liaoning. For the fourth successive year, grain output in the province exceeded 15 billion kilograms. Not only is this enough for local consumption but there is also some for export. At the beginning of this year, for the first time in history, 500 million kgs of husked and unhusked rice were sold to Japan, and more than 600,000 live pigs and several hundred million kgs of vegetables were sold to neighboring provinces. Township and town enterprises have also experienced a speedy development. Their total output value last year was 146 billion yuan, an increase of 50 billion yuan over the previous year. This is the result of the province adhering to the idea of urban and rural areas serving each other and complementing each other with their strong points. Chen Taixiang [7115 3141 4382] (JILIN RIBAO): There used to be more worries than joys in the situation in Jilin's rural areas but lately there have been both worries and joys. This year there has been a new turning point in which the joys have outstripped the worries. The acreage of crops, investment in agriculture, and the input of capital goods have all experienced an increase this year over the same period last year. Peasants are satisfied with the stability of the land contract policy, readjustments of grain prices by the state, immediate payment in cash by the state rather than IOUs for purchasing grain from peasants, and measures to reduce financial burdens on peasants. Han Zhi [7281 2535] and Xu Dongyang [1776 2639 3152] (NEIMENGGU RIBAO): In the past, there was a drought in Inner Mongolia nine out of 10 years. Sandstorms were almost continuous disasters. Since the introduction of reform and opening up, especially in the last few years, production conditions have undergone tremendous changes. Bumper harvests have been registered for several successive years in agriculture and animal husbandry. Last year saw the highest grain output and number of livestock, and the end of a 20-odd-year-long history of importing grain from other provinces. peasants and herdsmen are very enthusiastic in production. Last year alone, peasants invested 280 million yuan in water conservation projects, and herdsmen have also put 190 million yuan into the building of natural-disaster-proof bases. The money they have invested amounts to 70 percent of total investment. Li Yanhui [2621 5333 6540] (TIANJIN RIBAO): Agriculture in Tianjin is concentrated in suburban areas and its guiding idea is to serve the city and enrich the peasants. Township and town enterprises which were rather scattered and underdeveloped in the past now have made overall progress. In some areas, presentable industrial parks have taken shape and urbanization has basically been realized in some other places. Zeng Xianghui [2582 4382 1920] (HUBEI RIBAO): I have just returned from a news-gathering trip to the rural areas. The increase in the output of summer grain and oil-bearing crops this year is expected to be the biggest in the province in recent years. Since last year, much solid work has been done to reduce peasant financial burdens, pay cash for grain purchased by the state, and increase incomes. The increase in grain prices at the end of last year has contributed to the increase in the acreage of grain and oil-bearing crops this year. Recently, there are signs of some kind of increase in peasant burdens. In some parts, there is a shortage of cash to pay for summer grain. Naturally, peasants have some worries. They are afraid that there will be a deliberate downgrading of the grain they sell and that they will re-experience difficulties in selling grain. Pang Dianxun [7894 3013 8113] (XINHUA RIBAO): The comprehensive economic strength of Jiangsu's rural areas has increased. The total output value of township and town enterprises has exceeded 300 billion yuan, overtaking the output value of urban industry for the first time. Engagement in diversified undertakings has seen strong development. In 1993, the average per capita income among peasants throughout the province was more than 1,200 yuan. In the past two years, Jiangsu was also troubled by the problem of shortages in rice and cotton produced locally. The main reason was the low comparative effectiveness and peasants felt that it did not pay to grow grain and cotton. According to investigations, the number of peasants who want to increase their income by increasing acreage are less and less. In fact, 59 percent of peasants want to cultivate farmland only to produce enough for their own consumption. Xu Shouli [1776 1343 4409] (DAZHONG RIBAO): Agriculture and the rural economy are doing well in Shandong Province. By last year, Shandong for the third year led the country in summer grain production. It was also among the largest producers of apples, peanuts, meat, eggs, dairy products, and aquatic products. The province is also faced with difficulties. Peasants, for example, find it difficult to deal with the market. When making production plans and deciding projects, they always do what others are doing and the result is that within a given region, people are doing the same trade and producing the same thing, causing great rises and falls in the yield of certain products. Wang Liya [3769 0448 0068] (HUNAN RIBAO): There are many problems in rural areas, but if we look at the principal aspect and the major trend, we must admit that the situation is good. An important indication is that peasants are much more conscious of commodities and the market and "hundreds respond to a single call" in the market. Last year, there was virtually no piling up of meat, poultry, eggs, aquatic products, and other farm and sideline products. Zhao Ruiquan [6392 3843 3123] (HEBEI RIBAO): I was also very much impressed when I went to the rural areas. Peasants may not understand the term "restructuring," but they are well-versed in cultivating vegetables in plastic sheds and tending fruit trees. If one household in a village takes the lead, the entire village will quickly follow. Why is this? Because the economic results are highly attractive. It is progress when peasants proceed from this point in making production plans and considering matters. It is also where the hope of rural economic development lies. Impressive progress has taken place in the rural areas. Achievements, however, do not mean there are no problems and no potential crises. Participants feel that the most urgent and important thing is: Solid Attention Should Be Paid to Agriculture Zhou Sixian [0719 1835 6343] (JIANGXI RIBAO): Agriculture makes up an important proportion of the economy of Jiangxi. In the last few decades, more than 50 billion kgs of grain has been exported out of the province, which was a major contribution to the country. The situation is pretty good now. In the past year and more, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have discussed the issue of agriculture with provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal leaders on numerous occasions. As a result, over a dozen documents concerning agriculture have been issued, indicating the finalization of major principles and policies on agriculture and rural work. This, however, cannot solve all the problems. Some departments openly profess that agriculture should be strengthened, but they are more enthusiastic in building guesthouses and buying sedans. Many favorable policies by the central authorities on supporting major grain and cotton producing regions have not really been carried out. To really strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, it is important to readjust policies so that industry will be supportive of agriculture. Wei Zhangguan [7614 4545 1351] (FUJIAN RIBAO): Breakthroughs in the comprehensive development of hilly areas have been made in Fujian in the past two years. Peasants cultivate crops to solve the problem of food and clothing but make use of the mountains to become well-off. There are also cases of empty talk in developing agriculture. Some grass-roots local cadres feel the cultivation of grain brings in very little income, and that it is hard to produce real achievements in their official careers. Opening up factories along the road, they believe, is a much better alternative. The question is not just to arouse the enthusiasm of peasants to grow grain but also to arouse the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to grasp agriculture and the enthusiasm of agriculture-related departments in supporting agriculture. Chen Taixiang: The spirit of many policies from the central government are not really carried out. In some areas, grass-roots local organizations are very loose. Coverage by wired broadcast systems has declined from 97 to 45 percent in rural areas. Places for propagating spiritual civilization have been reduced. At the same time, not enough work has been done to preserve the enthusiasm of rural cadres. There are also the tendencies of giving little publicity to what are reasonable financial burdens for peasants. Du Shiguo [2629 2514 0948] (HENAN RIBAO): Henan is a large agricultural province and the general situation is pretty good. Some areas work hard at building up agricultural production bases to lead peasants to produce more. Rural areas face some common problems and, in particular, people should be on special guard against the rise of boasting and exaggeration and formalism. There are areas that report bloated production figures to get more favorable treatment. Xu Shouli: One thing we should not neglect is that within the same province, uneven economic development between different regions is becoming more obvious. The annual income level between peasants from the more developed areas in east Shandong is about 1,000 yuan higher than that in underdeveloped west Shandong. In fact, the annual income for 14 percent of the peasants is under 500 yuan. Li Dan [2621 0030] and Huang Shu [7806 3219] (HAINAN RIBAO): In Hainan, the gap between the advanced and backward, the rich and the poor is also very great. Though tremendous changes have taken place in Hainan after the establishment of the province and the special economic region, the job of helping poor peasants is still a heavy one in this province, which is the smallest in land area, the largest in sea area, and has an 80 percent peasant population. Many peasants still live in thatched houses, and their living standard is below the poverty line. Much of the land on the island still lies idle. Actually, the province is most advantageously located in developing marine products and out-of-season melons. The key is that governments at all levels in the province should build up crisscrossing "flyovers" between the peasants and the market. In April this year, more than 30,000 tonnes of watermelon from Wenchang County were sold to the north, Hong Kong, and Macao, bringing in an income of over 50 million yuan. This alone raised the income of the peasants and the county's revenue by 60 percent and 30 percent respectively over the same period last year. Wang Yuhuai [3769 3768 2037] (SHANXI RIBAO): Peasants still run into many difficulties in entering the market with their produce. Carrying goods to sell over a long distance, for instance, is often based on verbal agreements instead of formal written contracts. If changes occur in the market, they suffer losses and find they would have been better off to sell the produce right at their home, rather than transporting them a long way to the market. Gong Junchun: It is certainly not easy to solve the many problems in rural areas. The greatest difficulty is not that there are too many problems, nor does it lie in the obscurity of central policies. It lies in the thinking, concepts, and working style of some leaders. They "remember agriculture when they are hungry but forget it they are full." They admit the importance of developing agriculture in their speeches, but attach little importance to it in their actions. Empty talk will never really push agriculture to a higher level. How do the scattered and individual farming families enter the market? What should be done to ensure a smooth transfer to a socialist market economy? Different areas have different solutions. However, participants in the symposium felt the basic way out is: The Means Must Be Found Among Peasants Xu Shouli: In a large country like China, it is always difficult to have leaders at any level come up with a universal solution that can embrace and solve all problems. If leaders go to the rural areas and go among the peasants, they will, however, find solutions to some of the seemingly very difficult problems. It may be very practical for leaders to learn from the peasants. Of course, respecting peasant creativity does not mean leaving them alone without any care. The responsibility of leaders is to create favorable conditions for peasants to explore and practice, and to be good at discovering and helping peasants sum up and improve their experiences to guide and push forward the overall situation. Du Shiguo: Practice in Henan suggests that bringing industry, agriculture, and trade together, and making production, processing, and sales into one system are the most effective measures to solve the contradictions between small-scale farming and a large market. There are a number of ways to do this, such as peasant households plus companies, or factories plus peasant households, or processing enterprises plus peasant households, or service organizations plus peasant households, or specialized associations plus peasant households. All these forms have one thing in common, i.e., they are joined together by a production and sales contracts, a production based system, and a service system. Wherever industry, farming, and trade are integrated, people rarely rush for goods or find it difficult to sell what they produce. The income of peasants in such places has certainly increased. Luo Xiaogang [5012 2556 1511] (SICHUAN RIBAO): In taking their products to the market, peasants have been highly creative. Those in Yuanba District, Guangyuan City, for example, have established village-level companies that link production with sales. Peasants in Nanbin District, Shizhu County, have set up market information centers away from home to open up markets for their home products. Sichuan is a large agricultural province, with a farming population of 90 million. If work is done well in agriculture, the whole province will be doing well, and if peasants are well off, the entire province will be rich. Therefore, how to increase the earnings of peasants is a major issue. Restructuring agriculture is the key to this issue. It means that, while guaranteeing a stable grain yield, we should grasp well diversified undertakings and animal husbandry. Raising live pigs is a pillar industry in increasing peasant income, and there is great room for developing high-quality farm produce. There are, indeed, conditions for building Sichuan into China's largest meat and vegetable producer. Restructuring agriculture also means great efforts should be made to develop township and town enterprises. The provincial government has decided to experiment with township and town enterprises in 100 small cities and towns to pave the way for the industrialization of rural areas and the integration of urban and rural areas. Chen Zhinong [7115 1807 6593] (ZHEJIANG RIBAO): In many parts of Zhejiang, peasants have spontaneously decided to go in for large-scale farming. Along with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, many peasants want to leave farmwork and subcontract their land to others. On the other hand, some very experienced peasants wish to contract more land. For the same patch of 20 mu of rice paddies, the per capita income of one family cultivating it will obviously be several times higher than 10 families. In Wenzhou, where large-scale farming was done first, over 300,000 mu of land, or 15 percent of total farmland, has been cultivated with large-scale farming methods. More than 200,000 households, 14 percent, have subcontracted their land. The number of experienced farming families who wish to develop more land is on the rise, and the scale of their farming is also increasing. Besides, to define the property rights, invigorate small enterprises, and change the losing situation in others, township and town enterprises have carried out mergers, auctions, or annexation. Half of the enterprises have adopted the share-holding system. Pang Dianxun: In southern Jiangsu, 80 percent of peasants have moved into the secondary and tertiary industries. As a result, farms run by families and farms operated on the share-holding system have become the trend. Successes in this respect have been seen in Wuxi, Changshu, and Wuxian. In northern Jiangsu, diversified undertakings have fattened peasant purses. In 1993, diversified undertakings alone added 150 yuan per capita in Yancheng. Zeng Xianghui: Diversified undertakings have also been money earners for peasants in Hubei. Last year, peasants in Hubei for the first time caught up with the national average income level. Much of the money came from diversified undertakings. Wei Zhangguan: In more developed areas along the coast of Fujian, land is becoming more concentrated under the operation of experienced peasants. And a group of peasants operating on a large scale, known as "mini-Hintons" (like farming families in the United States represented by William Hinton), have emerged. In the comprehensive land system reform experiment in eastern Fujian, industrial parks with all kinds of township and town enterprises operated by the state, overseas Chinese, and local people have appeared. Luo Xiaogang: Large numbers of laborers from Sichuan are working in other provinces. Last year, more than 5 million Sichuan laborers worked away from their home province. From a long-term point of view, this movement of laborers has brought gigantic changes to the employment structure and the entire economic situation. The drift of laborers has become a transcentury movement. It needs a certain period of time to become more regular and should not be criticized all the time. Much more should be done to guide the flow of laborers. The provincial government views it as something of strategic importance in revitalizing the rural economy in Sichuan and proceeds from this understanding in tackling the issue.
