Hayami said the government should break the deadlock on economic "framework" talks between Japan and the United States by setting a ratio to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in reducing its trade surplus. Hayami said such a goal should be included in a plan that the government will announce to open up Japan's markets. He made the remark at a press conference in reference to the recent failed trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton over setting "objective criteria" in bilateral trade. The association has repeatedly urged the government to try to correct the price gap between goods sold in and outside Japan. He also said the dollar's value should be around 110 yen, noting there are few Japanese firms that can survive if the dollar remains below 110 yen.
