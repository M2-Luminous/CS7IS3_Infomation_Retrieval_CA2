In a curious coincidence, Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, also made a speech at a ceremony held in Hong Kong on the morning of the same day, at which letters of appointment were conferred on regional affairs advisers. The next day, many newspapers in Hong Kong gave wide coverage to the content of Lu's speech. The media also made favorable comments and some people even described it as Lu's "most pleasant" speech since taking office. As for Zhou's speech, which was delivered along the "diplomatic line," other major newspapers, with the exception of some leftist papers, mentioned it only briefly. It is extremely rare for the two senior Chinese leaders in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs to fight a "war of words" on the same day. Viewed from the angle of reporting and the media, it is clear that Lu Ping has won this round. Most Hong Kong media, however, seem to treat Lu's speech in Shenzhen as a propaganda stunt aimed at reassuring Hong Kong people, but readers who are truly familiar with CPC internal operations should be able to see that Lu made the speech with something in mind and that it has profound significance. First, in his speech Lu did not criticize or struggle against the British and Chris Patten with a "clear-cut stand" as Zhou Nan did. Instead of touching on the current Sino-British tensions and fierce argument, he talked glibly about the prospects and expectations entertained by the Chinese side and himself for Hong Kong's bright future, stressing that Hong Kong would continue to preserve its role as a bridge of capitalism beyond 1997. The moderate tone is clearly different from the tough approach taken by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, but tallies with the government work report delivered by Li Peng at the National People's Congress session. Obviously, Lu Ping's speech is more in keeping with the latest spirit of the Chinese leadership on the Hong Kong issue than Zhou Nan's. Lu Ping Boldly Criticizes Chinese Officials Second, in Shenzhen, Lu Ping again raised the slogan of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of self-government." Raised in 1982, when the Chinese side worked out their initial plan for recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong and regarded as a basic principle Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems," the slogan has not been mentioned for a long time. After the 4 June Incident, the Chinese side talked only about "recovering sovereignty," but not of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of self-government." However, when enunciating the specific embodiments of this policy in Shenzhen, Lu quoted many policies and principles that the Chinese side repeatedly stressed in those years and in the drafting of which he had a personal hand. Of all in-service cadres in the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and even in the entire Chinese Government system, Lu Ping was the longest-serving official involved in Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Although there are others more senior than he, they have "joined the ranks halfway," and although some have worked longer than he, they have either retired or have been transferred to other posts. In 1981, when China decided to study the issue of recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong, Lu was selected by Liao Chengzhi, then director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and appointed head of a three-man research group, and so began to get involved in Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Since then, he has established an indissoluble bond with the Hong Kong and Macao region. The 13-character principle on recovering Hong Kong's sovereignty which was studied and worked out by the group later became China's basic policy in handling the Hong Kong issue and was incorporated into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. However, most cadres now taking charge of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs, including Zhou Nan, do not quite understand the process in which these basic policies were deliberated and formulated. Nor do they know the careful consideration of the Chinese policemakers of the older generation. Perhaps for this reason, in his capacity as one experienced in this respect, Lu Ping boldly criticized some Chinese officials, "including some senior cadres," saying they do not quite understand the Basic Law and that "their statements do not tally with the Basic Law." It has been learned that a substantial number of people in the Chinese hierarchy have always taken exception to the tough policy adopted by the authorities toward Hong Kong, holding that many of the current practices run counter to the policy when China originally planned to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong. On many occasions they called on the top leadership to "set things to rights and make a thorough overhaul," but these views have never been accepted and even have been suppressed. The fact that Lu wittingly reaffirmed previous principles and policies in Shenzhen seems to show that the "non-mainstream" views have been accepted by the top leadership. Two Major Leftist Papers in Hong Kong Delete Lu Ping's Statement What is strange, however, is that the two major leftist newspapers in Hong Kong dealt with the speeches of Lu Ping and Zhou Nan in a way that gives people much food for thought. Although WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO carried the full text of their speeches the following day, both put Zhou's speech on the front page, as if by prior agreement. Lu's speech, however, was placed in an non- prominent position on page four. WEN WEI PO even handled Lu's speech as an ordinary contribution by placing it after the opinion page. What is more, the two newspapers deleted some of the content of Lu's speech. When saying that some statements by Chinese officials did not tally with the Basic Law, Lu explicitly said that some Chinese officials, "including some senior officials, do not quite understand the Basic Law, either." However, this remark was deleted by the two papers. Moreover, toward the end of his speech Lu Ping left the text of his speech to air his view on the post-1997 Hong Kong airport issue and the future political structure. Being quite liberal, this passage was quite acceptable to Hong Kong people, but it was deleted by the two papers altogether. What is the reason behind this alteration? This writer dares not make a presumptuous judgment, but ordinarily the leftist papers must seek instructions from the propaganda department of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY before dealing with such important manuscripts.
