[Al-Bid] According to Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who prepared for this war, that is true. As for us, we refused to think about or prepare for war. We exerted every effort to spare the Yemeni people war, the most recent example being the Pledge and Accord Document, which the other side rejected completely. Then it pushed Yemen into this war, which has destroyed everything: most recently oil, economic, and service installations, especially in the capital, Aden, despite the Security Council resolution. We are defending, not attacking. We are defending our right to live, our honor, our rights, our homes, and our land against the barbarous military invasion and occupation. [Taheri] Do you see the current conflict as a civil or international war? [Al-Bid] Both cases apply to the current situation in Yemen. On the one hand we set up a unified state peacefully, and this state needed efforts to complete its structures. It needed to be looked after and safeguarded. But the "Shaykh and the general" did not comprehend that and remained prisoners of the mentality of annexation, looking at the south as a branch that had joined the roots and as a field for tax collection, usurpation, and obtaining a livelihood. On the other hand, being two completely equal parties, regimes, countries, and so on, we are entitled to present our case as an international case, as the party represented in the Yemen Arab Republic is waging a war. Because the building of the new entity still has not been completed, and the reality has made it difficult to achieve that, and Sanaa has rejected all that Aden is offering or has offered. In fact the situation has reached the point of declaring a war to eliminate an entire people. So it is a dual matter, as you can see. [Taheri] Are you willing to accept a temporary return to the situation that existed before the fighting broke out as a condition for a cease-fire, provided it is followed by negotiations between the two parties? [Al-Bid] Gen. 'Ali Salih unilaterally declared a state of emergency, abolished enforcement of the Constitution, and waged a war. What is required is to halt the fighting and create normal conditions first and then hold negotiations between the two parties that have equal rights and duties. [Taheri] You demanded Arab and international intervention to end the war. What is the nature of the intervention you are thinking of? Is it supposed to involve peacekeeping forces? [Al-Bid] We support any Arab and international efforts to end and halt the war at this point, whether through negotiations, by sending observers to withdraw the forces, or, if necessary, by sending peacekeeping forces. Because the continuation of the war would lead to its escalation and to the intervention of parties that do not want stability for the region. [Taheri] How would you assess the course of the war so far? [Al-Bid] The course of the war is clear. As far as he ['Ali Salih] is concerned, the aim has been defined since he launched the war, namely to destroy our military and civilian institutions, to occupy the south, and to impose a military regime on the two parts of Yemen, especially after the collapse of the regime's military "myth" about the existence of a "democratic" atmosphere after the achievement of unity and scope for the press and free expression. As for our aim, it has always been to defend ourselves peacefully under artillery bombardment. We take up the arms available to repel the aggressor. [Taheri] Among the proposals mentioned in Western diplomatic sources there is one calling for a cease-fire first and a general referendum in Yemen on unity within about a year. Do you believe that such a formula could form a part of the endeavors being made to end the fighting? [Al-Bid] The unity was achieved with a political decision, and it was also ended by them with the decision to wage a war on us. It is an all-out war in which they have used every dreadful and barbarous thing, most recently the fatwa announced the day before yesterday on Sanaa radio and issued by someone claiming to be a Muslim. He stated that it is lawful to seize southern areas. And indeed their forces are doing that and plundering everything, raping women and embarking on actions that conflict with Islam, ethics, and manhood. It is happening not only in the areas they have occupied, but also in northern areas, specifically al-Bayda', Ta'izz, Ibb, and Ma'rib. It is unrealistic to talk about a referendum while military rule and the military option exist. However, we are willing to accept it [a referendum] in the southern areas when normal conditions are secured under UN supervision. I confirm to you our agreement beforehand to what the people in these areas want.
