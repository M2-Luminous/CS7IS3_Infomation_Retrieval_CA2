In addition to other calamities, the UN peace-keeping operation has brought Croatia an AIDS epidemic. This was confirmed by research done by pathologists belonging to the American Mobile Army Surgical Hospital after the death of several members of UNPROFOR's Kenyan battalion and a statement by the peace-keeping forces' spokeswoman, Shannon Boyd, that symptoms of this disease have been discovered in the blood of several UNPROFOR soldiers from East Europe, Separovic said. Thirty-six persons have died from this terminal disease in Croatia so far and some 60 have been infected, but the real figures are certainly much higher.
