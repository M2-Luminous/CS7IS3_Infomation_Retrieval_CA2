FBIS3-45774 "drchi016_l_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 Science & Technology Great Wall Corporation Signs Satellite Agreement `Asia-Pacific Sat-2' To Be Launched OW1801135694 Beijing XINHUA in English 1338 GMT 18 Jan 94 OW1801135694 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China will provide the service of launching the Asia-Pacific Satellite No. 2 toward the end of this year, according to a contract signed here today between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) and the Asia-Pacific Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd. The Asia-Pacific Sat-2 is a large-capacity HS601 telecommunications satellite made by the United States' Hughes Company. It will be launched by using the Long March 2E booster carrier rocket between October and December in China's Xichang satellite launch center, according to the contract. Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, said at today's signing ceremony that since 1985, when the Chinese Government announced that it was bidding for international satellite launches with Chinese-made Long March carrier rockets, China has successfully launched a number of overseas satellites and contracts that are being performed involved the launching of Intelsat 7A, Asia-Pacific Sat-1, Asiasat 2, a number of iridium satellites, echo satellite and a resources satellite of Brazil. Zhang said that in the past few years the CGWIC has used multi- model Long March carrier rockets in the international commercial launching service, and the result of market development has promoted rocket research. At present the Long March series can meet the demand of various launches in the international market, including the launching of small, medium-size and large satellites to low, middle and high orbits. He said the international satellite launching service by CGWIC is a good supplement to the international launching market and it also provides new opportunities for satellite owners. The U.S. Government has lately lifted the ban on three satellites that will be launched by China, a move which deserves welcome; but it was regrettable that the U.S. Government has not removed its sanctions on the CGWIC. Zhang added that the U.S. Government should readjust its present space policies, remove sanctions on the CGWIC and give licences to other related satellites, which would not only benefit satellite owners, but also protect the interests of U.S. satellite producers. Sources said the memorandum on the agreement of international trade problems for commercial launching service signed in 1989 by the Chinese and U.S. Governments will expire by the end of this year.
