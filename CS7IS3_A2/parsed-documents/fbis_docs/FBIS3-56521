Beginning his report, the commentator says another round in the Latvian-Russian talks has ended in Riga. The talks were held against the background of the recent provocation against two Russian generals. The commentator then switches to a report by Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation at the talks. Zotov begins by saying: "I think we have witnessed the starting point of a new policy by the president, of a new Russian policy. The whole package of measures that were adopted, first and foremost in the military and foreign policy sphere, shows clearly that from now on our concern for our compatriots, for human rights, no longer stop at declarations, though these are also important. Now, this concern and these slogans about defending human rights and our people are underpinned by a real mechanism for defending them. But in this case, we are talking about the protection of servicemen, direct symbols of the state. That is why I think it is very significant that throughout these events, we demonstrated our political will and made it clear what a repeat of such events would entail." Zotov continues: "In the short term, these dramatic events have definitely had a negative effect on the talks, on bilateral relations. At the same time, they appear to have lanced the boil that has been swelling: It is no secret that, for a long time, Latvia has been pursuing the line that the withdrawal of Russian troops is to take place without any prior treaty. These events have yet again forced many in this country to realize that there will be no Lithuanian variant in this case, that for the Latvian people, for the Latvian politicians who want to keep their posts, it is important that the withdrawal of our troops takes place on the basis of a treaty and, accordingly, that all issues connected with this be agreed. From this point of view, it could be said that these events [the recent arrest of two Russian generals] have, to some extent, been a stimulus prompting Latvian politicians to adopt a more realistic stand. "This was reflected in the discussion of an agreement between the two states on the legal status of the radar station Skrunda. We have always insisted that for Russia, this strategic installation is seen as having a military purpose. The Latvian side said it should be civilian. These events have again shown that ours was the correct line. This formula was established -- Skrunda will now be a military installation. "The second point is the coming together of the two sides on the issue of when this installation will function." The commentator ends the report by saying that Zotov said agreements on all issues, including Skrunda, are to be finalized at a meeting of the sides in two weeks.
