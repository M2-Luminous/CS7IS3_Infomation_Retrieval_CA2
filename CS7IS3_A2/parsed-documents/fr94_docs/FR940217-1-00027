FR940217-1-00027 FR940217-1-00005 H. Proposed Implementation The Commission proposes that the transaction reporting requirements contained in paragraph (e) of the reproposed rule become effective 18 months after adoption of the final rule. The Commission believes that this time frame would provide sufficient time for the securities information processors and broker-dealers to plan, design, and implement all of the various enhancements to existing transaction reporting systems required by the reproposed rule. During this implementation period, the Commission would conduct periodic tests of the trade reporting system and work closely with broker-dealers, SIAC, and the ISG to develop all of the technical data processing software required by the reproposed rule. The Commission believes that this implementation objective would facilitate the cost-effective development of the transaction reporting systems required by the reproposed rule. The Commission specifically solicits comments on whether the proposed 18 month period would be feasible. I. Statutory Authority Section 13(h)(5) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when exercising its rulemaking authority for large trader reporting, to consider: (1) Existing reporting systems; (2) the costs associated with keeping and reporting large trader information; and (3) the relationship between United States and international securities markets. The Commission considered these requirements when formulating the proposed rule and firmly believed that, notwithstanding certain elements of the proposed rule that may cause market participants to incur additional costs, the proposed system minimized costs in virtually every respect. The additional costs acknowledged by the Commission, included: (1) Preparation, filing, and updating Form 13H; (2) maintenance and reporting of large trader transaction information; (3) maintenance and reporting of LTIDs and execution times; and (4) development and implementation of supervisory systems and procedures. The reproposed rule reflects the Commission's commitment to work with market participants to incorporate all existing industry systems that would minimize the costs associated with the reproposed system. The reproposed rule also reflects the Commission's conscious decision to shift substantial portions of the burdens imposed by the proposed rule from market participants to the Commission. Further, the foreign application of the reproposed rule has been carefully considered in light of its impact on the relationship between foreign and domestic securities markets, intermediaries, and investors. The Commission believes that the comments on the proposed rule highlight the complexity of designing a simple and efficient large trader system that accommodates many different types of large traders as well as business practices and procedures. Faced with these conflicting needs and practices, the Commission is reproposing rules that it believes would minimize the costs and burdens imposed on the greatest number of affected market participants. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule narrows and clarifies the definition of a large trader, and thus reduces the costs and burdens of the system. The revisions to the identification requirements, through the various definitions and rules for aggregation, have significantly reduced the number of persons who would be subject to the identification requirements of the reproposed rule. The inactive filing status, and the other filing or disclosure requirements, have been revised to incorporate other existing information and eliminate unnecessary information. The Commission believes that the information captured and disclosed under the reproposed identification requirements would be the minimum necessary for creating an effective large trader reconstruction tool. Moreover, the Commission believes that such information would be collected or disclosed in a fashion that approximates existing systems, practices, and procedures commonly used by all forms of large traders. 79 79 The Commission reiterates its belief that the reproposed rule is consistent with the intent of the Market Reform Act and only requires identification or disclosure of large traders whose transactions are effected through omnibus accounts, and not ``small beneficial owners'' whose trades are effected through such accounts. See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42553, at n. 41 (citing the Senate Report); and House Report, supra n. 4, at 25. The modifications and additions to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the reproposed rule would significantly clarify their application and reduce technical burdens. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule's additional elements of transaction information, combined with the new reporting requirements for multiple LTIDs and system or manual order execution times, incorporate existing recordkeeping and reporting practices, procedures, and systems for customer trade information. As a result, the Commission believes that the reproposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements would provide the least burdensome method of collecting large trader transaction information. The supervisory provisions of the reproposed rule would clarify the duty to supervise. The supervisory obligations also would assure the credibility of the reproposed system and a level playing field between broker-dealers and other omnibus large traders to the greatest extent permitted by the Market Reform Act. The Commission believes that the new safe harbor provision provides meaningful detail and objectivity that would considerably reduce the burden of the supervisory duties. The Commission also believes that the reduced burdens of the identification requirements may foster greater compliance with the reproposed rule and indirectly reduce the supervisory burden of broker-dealers and omnibus large traders. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule's application to foreign entities and persons would accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act by maintaining uniformity between domestic and foreign markets, exchanges, intermediaries, and investors. Finally, the Commission believes that the proposed plan for implementing the transaction reporting system would facilitate its cost-effective development. IV. Conclusion The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h&hyph;1 and Form 13H, which would establish an activity-based identification, recordkeeping, and reporting system for large trader accounts and transactions. This system would enable the Commission to gather large trader information in a timely manner and in the form necessary to reconstruct trading activity in periods of market stress and for surveillance, enforcement, and other regulatory purposes. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule achieves the objectives of the Market Reform Act and would establish an effective market reconstruction tool that minimizes costs.
