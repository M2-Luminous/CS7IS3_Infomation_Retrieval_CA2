You said: Freedom should not give rise to chaos. At the same time, it should not result in repression or exclusion. My question is the following: More than 10 days have passed since private radio and television stations were banned from airing political news. Since then, a cabinet session was held. However, a new media bill has not been endorsed, as was previously announced. Your Eminence, why do you think that this situation is not tantamount to repression and exclusion, a development that shows a violation of the law? [Shams-al-Din] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. As you have said, I addressed this issue in my Friday sermon yesterday. My support for the decisions made by the Council of Ministers last week was couched in general terms. I did not specifically address the decision made regarding the media. Last week, we supported the government's decisions. We said that we could understand the decision that was made with regard to private media, and that we would wait until the following week to see what the government would do with regard to the media bill. The deadline announced for examining the media bill has elapsed without any discussion of this bill. That is why I raised the issue yesterday. I said I saw the delay as an unfavorable development. I added that efforts to endorse the bill must be expedited so that the current suspension of the private media may be remedied. It is also necessary to correct the previous status of the private media, namely, their illegal operation. Also, outside the context of this sermon, I have informed officials that they must expedite efforts to endorse the media bill so that the suspension does not become permanent and effectively turn into a law. We do not want the suspension to be prolonged. Last week, we said frankly that we do not at all agree to a monopoly of media activities by the official media, underscoring the fact that citizens have the right to listen to various viewpoints with regard to what is taking place. Hence, I do not agree with the view that the current situation is one of repression. Nonetheless, I do not at all advise that the current status be prolonged. We are closely following the situation to expedite the referral of the media bill to the Chamber of Deputies. We are also urging the Chamber of Deputies to quickly endorse this bill, God willing. [Tarabayh] Your Eminence the Shaykh, have you received any assurances from officials regarding a desire to speed up the promulgation of a media law? [Shams-al-Din] I have had no direct assurances. However, I know that the government wants to get it over with. [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, I want to shift to another topic. In his Easter address, His Beatitude Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr said the state has not treated all people equally, nor has it made the Christians feel that it is embracing them like other citizens. Do you subscribe to the idea that there is some defect in the way the state has been treating a part of the sons of the homeland? [Shams-al-Din] I deeply regret, an I am saddened by, what has happened. I do not agree with the ideas presented by His Beatitude Patriarch Sfayr in his sermon yesterday. I do not approve of the content. We spoke last week with his beatitude about the form as well. First of all, to say that the state does not embrace Christians is not justified, as far as I am concerned. As for the justifications advanced by his beatitude the patriarch, he knows more about these. We will get in touch with him to discuss this view the way it was presented in yesterday's sermon. We think that the state looks after citizens equally. If some individuals or groups do not feel they are being looked after properly, maybe they themselves are responsible for this and not the state. I am not implying that the state is infallible and cannot make mistakes. Doubtless, there are mistakes committed by the state as a whole or by its institutions. However, these mistakes do not reach the degree espoused by his beatitude the patriarch. Therefore, I hope -- and I have repeatedly said this publicly and secretly -- that disputable issues will be presented in a way that contributes to unifying positions and helping the state assume its responsibilities and avoid making mistakes. [Shams-al-Din] We respect his beatitude the patriarch. His voice is one of the pure and sincere voices. However, only God is infallible. We wanted to hear from him what I appealed for him to give -- a speech of hope and confidence. As everybody knows, I am personally concerned about the Christian citizens, who are also my fellow men. We have a responsibility toward all citizens. I am not responsible for the Muslim citizens more than the Christian citizens. I am responsible for the Muslim citizens in terms of religion more than the Christians. On the political level and in terms of citizens' rights, I reiterate that I am also responsible for the Christians. I hope that all Lebanese in high positions feel the same. His beatitude the patriarch should also be responsible for the Muslim citizens as he is responsible for the Christian citizens. [Tarabayh] Your eminence, my last question is the following: Is it possible to see your voices -- as leaders of the spiritual communities in Lebanon -- united and unifying the ranks through a religious summit, for example? [Shams-al-Din] This is my objective. I believe that the existing situation requires the convening of such a spiritual summit. This issue has been my main concern for the past two days. I will make some moves in this direction in this week, because the present situation requires such a meeting even though relations with the other brothers are continuous. We always exchange opinions and we are in continuous contact. I spoke with the patriarch two days ago. I am thinking seriously about convening a spiritual summit. [Tarabayh] Your Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, thank you. [Shams-al-Din] May God preserve you all.
