The cease-fire, which began midnight Sunday [30 December], is to be backed by the disarming of the rival forces and the effective return of people to their permanent areas of residence. In a two-day meeting which started Friday, parliamentarians agreed to set up a peacekeeping force as recommended by the Inter- Regional Committee for Peace, created for the purpose. The committee has ordered road blocks removed off the streets and also that rail traffic be resumed between Brazzaville and Loutete, some 40 kilometres to the south. It has asked government to make the public media available to political parties. It ordered the closure of private jails and the release of all individuals illegally detained. It also said schools, universities and all administration offices in the Pool region and in the southern districts of Brazzaville (Bacongo, Makelekele and Mfilou) must open immediately.
