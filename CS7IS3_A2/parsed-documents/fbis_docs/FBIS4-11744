'Abd-al-Majid briefed al-Bishari on the outcome of his meeting today with the British and French ambassadors and the U.S. charge d'affairs in Cairo. After the meeting, al-Bishari said 'Abd-al-Majid has a clear concept of Libya's crisis with the West. This concept is based on two points--safeguarding Libya's sovereignty and upholding international law. Al-Bishari said the Arab League supports the stand of Libya, which does not seek to escalate the crisis so that its effects will not adversely affect the whole region. Al-Bishari described the international blockade of his country as tantamount to "the illegal detention of a people inside a small country with limited capabilities and resources." He noted that it is in Libya's interest to solve the problem and not to enter into a showdown with three major states.
