"We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral, regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article published in THE WASHINGTON POST today. "Our economic interests are also converging," he said, "China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American exporters and investors." "We are determined to expand American participation in the Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in open and profitable access to the American market," he added. Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and "this balance shapes our approach toward China." He said that the purpose of his recent trip to Beijing was to inform China's leaders of the need to make further progress on human rights and to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China constructively on the many issues where the interests of the two countries coincide.
