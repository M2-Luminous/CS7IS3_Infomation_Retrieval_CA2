He believes that their presence is no longer justified. Paris does not agree. Minister Alain Lamassoure explained this during the traditional question time at the National Assembly: [Begin Lamassoure recording] After this withdrawal, an agreement, a treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed by Chad and Libya, and we also welcomed this. The French troops currently in Chad -- what is called the Epervier operation, consisting of 800 men -- are there as a result of an agreement made with the Chad Government. That government has not asked France to modify its operation. Given that fact and given the precariousness of the situation in the country and in the region, there are no plans either to modify and certainly not to reduce this operation for the moment. [end recording] The French minister for European affairs was answering questions this afternoon in place of the foreign minister who is currently in Germany. [passage omitted]
