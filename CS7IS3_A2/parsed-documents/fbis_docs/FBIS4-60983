The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today over the telephone by informed sources in Tajikistan's Government circles that because of conflicting reports from Khorog it is impossible to confirm or refute the definition of the incident as a "seizure" of the cargo delivered by the AN-26 aircraft from Uzbekistan to Khorog pending completion of the commission's work. Meanwhile, as was reported earlier, Uzbekistan's Defense Ministry confirmed yesterday that the cargo described as "humanitarian aid" had indeed been prepared for delivery to Gorno-Badakhshan. But for unknown reasons the relevant bodies in Tajikistan were not informed beforehand about the time when the state border would be crossed. The aircraft landed at 1500 local time at the Khorog airport. After the landing the runway and the approaches to the airport were cordoned off by fighters from a detachment of "Tajik Self-Defense Forces." The cargo on board was taken away. In view of this, military sources in Dushanbe do not rule out the possibility that contacts have been established between certain forces in Uzbekistan and fighters in the Pamir mountains, and that these contacts have some bearing on the situation in the region.
