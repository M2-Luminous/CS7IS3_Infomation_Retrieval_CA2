"Nearly 100,000 foreign workers are suffering from long working hours and low wages, but most of them are here illegally so their basic human rights are not properly protected by the law," a CCEJ spokesman said. Almost 100 CCEJ members joined a march to demand protection for the human rights of foreign workers.
