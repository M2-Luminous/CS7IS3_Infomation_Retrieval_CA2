Thereby, it is no accident that the monetary merger treaty between Belarus and Russia has attracted such attention. The ink on the paper had not yet dried -- as they simply put it -- when this document became the focal point of many political disputes. Various borderline opinions and statements -- varying from complete approval to absolute rejection -- appeared. Therefore, I consider it necessary to explain why the Belarusian Government took this step, what is the essence of the document concerning the single ruble zone, what does this agreement provide our economy, people, and the Republic as a whole. From the Previous History of the Agreement We all know that after the fall of the USSR, two tendencies prevailed in the development of newly independent states: The first one was a disintegration theory, supporters of which advocated complete disintegration and the second one -- the idea of integration. The government of our Republic always favored the process of integration. I already foresee a question: How can I explain my signing of the Belaya Vezha agreement? Why did I undertake this step? Only because it was necessary to set up a civilized procedure for that process of disintegration, which was widely spreading across a big state. Viskuli initiators cannot be blamed for the fall of the USSR: The key reason for this was Gorbachev's illogical policy, which brought the Union to a state of utter chaos. Because by December 1991 -- when the Baltic republics and Ukraine declared that they were leaving the USSR and the Russian Supreme Soviet declared the supremacy of its laws over the USSR Constitution -- the Soviet Union as a state ceased to exist. Interethnic conflicts were erupting. Let us now recall the gist of the Belaya Vezha agreement. They advocated the need to set up a joint economic zone, thereby building economic relations "on the basis of the existing tender -- the ruble" -- pursuing an agreed-upon policy in the budget sector; coordinating activities among customs services; providing for the free flow of transit shipments. Therefore, it is easy to see -- if we compare the Viskuli agreement with the monetary merger pact -- that the second document reflects the agreement that had specified the setting up and functioning of the CIS. We have never opposed and do not oppose the CIS. However, what happened within the CIS over the past two and a half years cannot be called anything other than the stalling of development. Given this situation, the expediency of setting a close economic union between Belarus and Russia, based on a single monetary system, cannot raise any doubts. By the way, we are not inventing anything. The joint monetary system --as an expression of the highest degree of integration between states -- existed within the framework of the former USSR, and our aim is to restore its advantages to our Republic. Let us discuss the key aspect of this issue -- the economy. Indexes of specific proportions of resources imported to Belarus and of exported Belarusian products show the importance of cooperation with Russia for our Republic. For example, in 1993 (which was not the best year for our economy), of all the oil used in Belarus, we had to import 86 percent; natural gas -- 100 percent; rolled steel -- 42 percent. At the same time, of all exports of Belarusian-made goods, Russia bought 51 percent of all trucks, 44.4 percent of all tractors, 42.8 percent of all refrigerators and deep-freezers, and 42.8 percent of all silk. In other words, our economy, first and foremost, our industry is closely connected with the Russian market for raw materials and products. When these relations broke down due to Russia's increased prices -- up to world levels -- for energy resources and raw materials exported to Belarus, our Republic immediately suffered "a breakdown." I can provide you with some figures. Over the first quarter of this year alone, the volume of net national income in Belarus fell by 38 percent in comparison with the same period last year. Due to the failure to sell products because of high prices, on both domestic and foreign markets, warehouses and trading facilities have amassed Belarusian-made industrial products worth some 4.7 trillion rubles. Tens of thousands of large industrial enterprises are faced with the threat of shutting down. The specter of unemployment has begun to haunt thousands of people. This is the answer to the question: What has happened? On the Gist of the Agreement The agreement includes the treaty itself and seven [as published] bilateral documents, which represent its indispensable constituent parts. The process of unifying the monetary systems will be carried out in two stages. During the first stage, which will begin on 1 May of this year, all tariff and tax restrictions, as well as customs duties on trade will be lifted. It is natural that this applies only to goods produced on the territory of Belarus and Russia. At the same time, customs duties will be imposed on products produced in other countries (currently, a single mechanism regarding their functioning is being drafted). Nontariff barriers -- quoting and licensing which rule out dual taxation -- will be retained until the monetary merger is completed, because these quotas --proceeding from the volumes of mutual deliveries between enterprises -- have already been set. The most acute issue in the package of monetary merger documents is the Belarusian National Bank issue. You know that Belarusian National Bank Chairman S. S. Bahdankevich signed this agreement with reservations regarding its clause No. 5, which contradicts some of the paragraphs of the Belarusian Constitution. I can understand him. The documents, which concern every citizen of Belarus, were drafted while one constitution was in force and they were ready and signed after another had gone into effect. I hope that a solution will be found. A formula, enabling us to consider all mutually beneficial interests and on this basis strengthening Belarusian statehood as an equal and esteemed member of the world community, will be found. I am not a naive man and I understand perfectly well that it is not very ethical and correct to modify the Constitution, which has just been adopted. Therefore, we, having signed the agreement, had set up a basis for future talks. When Supreme Soviet Chairman M. I. Hryb and I were present at the recent CIS summit, we met with Russian President B. N. Yeltsin and found an understanding on his part that it is necessary to formulate clause No. 5 in such a way that could unable us to painlessly resolve the constitution issue. Many people ask: If separate clauses of the agreement contradicted the new Constitution, why had I signed it? Everything is extremely simple: I signed this agreement for the sake of the remaining nine documents that will come into force on 1 May. For how long can we hold our economy in this crisis? My signature meant that all customs duties will be removed on the fixed date, meaning a reduction of the total cost of products by 30-40 percent. As a result, production costs will be reduced, Belarusian producers will receive access to traditional Russian markets. Eventually, it will cause a reduction in retail prices and an improvement in the life of our people. These are the motives, the only ones (and not political competitiveness) which dictated my actions. As for the exchange rate of Belarusian "hares" for Russian cash, which is of especial interest for our citizens, the exchange will be carried out at a 1:1 rate to a maximum of 200,000 Belarusian rubles per individual. Therefore, if, for example, a family consists of five members, then it will be able to exchange "hares" for the sum of 1 million rubles [R]. In addition, individuals who have bank accounts and deposits will be able to exchange their money at the same exchange rate, however, the total will be limited to R1 million. However, together with the increase in retail prices in Russia, the aforementioned maximum sums of money that are subject to exchange at a 1:1 rate will also be increased. The issue with the exchange rate of savings, which exceed the aforementioned sums, and the revaluation of balances of accounts, inventories, assets and liabilities of enterprises, organizations, and all legal entities is more complicated. It will be set and drawn up on the basis of the parity of Russian and Belarusian currencies' buying capacity and their market rate against the dollar at the moment of the monetary merger (the current rate is some 1:5). Who Is Against the Agreement? I do not want to waste time on debates with those who consider each decision of the government in both states to be "evil," "incorrect," or even "criminal." There are only a few of them; however, they are rowdy and make much noise. Well, I have to admit that there are serious politicians and economists with their own vision of the issue among the adversaries of this agreement. Well, each person can have his own opinion and we have to respect his right. I am ready to argue with such people and defend my viewpoint. I could conditionally divide such serious opponents into three categories in line with their positions. The first group: The so-called "westerners." Their key argument is as follows: We should have concluded agreements not with Russia but with West European states. They have culture, they are civilized, they eat "bread and butter" while our Eastern neighbor has its own problems. It seems beautiful and convincing for many people. However, we should also consider historic traditions, the difference in economic development, the degree of integration of our economies, and the living standard. Besides, reality shows that the only real and prospective source of mineral resources (eventually, this is the key factor of our economy) for Belarus can only be Russia. We could come to Europe as equal partners only with Russia. The second group is represented by "isolationists." If "westerners" criticize us for the allegedly flawed way of development, these people do not admit the Belarusian-Russian negotiations at all. Hence, their cries about the encroachment on our sovereignty, undermining of the statehood, betrayal of the national interests. Sometimes, the representatives of this trend speak about economic integration, political unions (let us recall the notorious Black-Baltic Seas union), however, they boil over everything. It seems to me that there is no neighbor left to whom they had not issued territorial claims. This is the first issue. Second, how can politicians speak about political integration if they already agreed that "national interests are superior to the interests of a person?" Mankind has already gone down this path and stained it with seas of blood. The supporters of the so-called "tough" sovereignty, who foresee not only a breakdown of economic relations with Russia but a confrontation with it by issuing demands for leasing payments for the dislocation of Russian troops on Belarusian territory. What can I say regarding this? 1. It is a well-known fact that Ukrainian attempts to divide the Black Sea Fleet with Russia have not brought about either economic advantages, or political stability. 2. Russian military units stationed on the Belarusian territory, in particular, the antiaircraft protection troops, ensure the security both for Russia and Belarus. 3. Belarus profits directly from this situation because it can reduce its own Armed Forces without harming its national security. There is one more group of adversaries of the agreement. They are filthy dealers in the currency black market on both sides of our eastern border. They are less noisy and eye-catching but not less dangerous. They use the underdevelopment of our financial infrastructure; they play on the difference in exchange rates and prices for essential foodstuff and consumer goods and to generate substantial income. Who will voluntarily refuse such huge profits? Therefore, these people can go to extremes and hamper efforts to put our house in order, to raise the economy, to introduce civilized economic methods. An attempt to torpedo and drown the idea of an economic union of two fraternal states will hardly win. Finally, the Belarusian-Russian agreement responds to the core interests of our peoples, and this is the key issue. By the way, according to polls, conducted by a range of sociological agencies in our Republic, including independent ones, more than 65 percent of the Belarusian population support the monetary merger of our two states. Currently, all, who support the government's policy aimed at setting up a strong, long-term union with Russia, live through hard times. We are experiencing tough pressure from various sides. Nevertheless, we have made our choice. I am ready to bring this issue to an end because I am deeply convinced that only in the union with Russia will we find our salvation, the salvation of our young sovereign state in which, and I am sure of that, our children and grandchildren and all the generations to come will live happily. Therefore, I am addressing Belarusian citizens: You will be judges in this historic process. Only the people's opinion can be a criterion for the truth.
