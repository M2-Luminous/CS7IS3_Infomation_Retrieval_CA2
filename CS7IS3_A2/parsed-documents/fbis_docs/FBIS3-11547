The new government (interior) minister [El nuevo ministro de gobernacion interior] is Danilo Parinello, a former Constituent Assembly deputy, who said he accepted the post (considered to be the most difficult in the cabinet) because of his friendship with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. He added that even though he has no experience in the area of security he will carry out the best possible actions. He announced the creation of an immediate reaction group to take care of emergencies that may appear. Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida was appointed the new deputy government minister. He has experience in military intelligence. Former Justice of the Peace Salvador Figueroa was appointed police director. The high crime rate is one of the leading problems confronting the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Some sectors have pointed out that unemployment and extreme poverty suffered by the majority of the population are some of the reasons for the high crime rate.
