But what about Algiers, once known as "Algiers the White"? This historic city, a city with a rich legacy, a city of beautiful byways lined with enchanting buildings. What has become of all those historical treasures? From end to end, in every nook and corner, from top to bottom, Algiers is unrecognizable; it is no longer the same, the air is no longer pure, it smells foul. At a time when emphasis is being placed, all over the world, on hygienic problems because of the multitude of epidemics raging alike in other countries and in our own, particularly in our capital city, an unconscious or deliberately indifferent populace may not appreciate the risks to which it is exposed--how otherwise can we explain the deplorable state into which the city has fallen? Streets are strewn with detritus of every sort, with half-open trash bags where well-fed rats multiply at an alarming rate. Rarely is a passerby late in the day courageous enough to venture on sidewalks alive with this undesirable and very menacing "population." Just going from place to place in the capital has become a painful ordeal. We have become accustomed to seeing rats the size of rabbits and cats as big as dogs. Have our citizens so far lost their civic spirit that they use their own doorsteps as refuse dumps instead of cleaning up after themselves? The worst part is, everyone blames someone else. The citizens themselves, of course, must bear part of the responsibility for deteriorating conditions. But some of the blame falls too on the authorities concerned and on the trash collection services, which let refuse accumulate all up and down the streets and sidewalks where they constitute "healthy" sites for vermin to breed and multiply. "What a difference there is," one old man tells us, "between the population of yesteryear, when Algiers was truly `the White' and deserved that name because of the efforts and good citizenship of the people, and today's inhabitants, who have turned the capital city into Algiers `the Gray,' a place where the air is almost unbreathable!" It is well-known that unhygienic conditions are the source of many diseases. So why aren't people concerned enough to try to avoid its propagation? The reappearance of diphtheria in Algeria is entirely the result of this negligence. People do not need expensive equipment to make a difference--just the will to take a mop and a pail of water to clean up their own doorstep and determination not to dump waste in the middle of the street. In the domain of health, the inadequacy of our country's sanitation infrastructure is well-known. So is the shortage of medications, and the high price that must be paid for them. But why do we have to spend our precious few resources on things that could have been avoided?! Health is critically dependent on hygiene. Other factors also enter in, aggravating conditions in certain slum areas including well-known quarters such as Bab-el-Oued, Place des Martyrs, and Place First of May. Even if the street sweepers came by several times a day, our streets would not be clean, for the peanut and cigarette vendors continue shamelessly to scatter papers and butts in the street instead of automatically throwing them in trash bags. As one woman told us, "cleanliness and responsibility come with education. How can you expect a child not to throw waste in the street when his mother tosses refuse out the window all day long? "The problem goes very deep. You have to attack the problem at its roots." There is another problem befouling Algiers: the reeking sewage outlets. There is also the invasion of tramps and beggars into our capital. Under the arcades, in certain parts of Algiers, these homeless have ensconced themselves atop ventilation ducts in search of warmth. Passersby must not only avoid all the laundry dripping from the balconies but also take wide steps to avoid all the urine. These sights are all in plain view in our capital. It is a sad spectacle that continues unabated year after year, right under the noses of certain culpable authorities, exacerbated by the inexcusable behavior of many citizens. Are these people out of touch?
