A group of CP MPs made it clear during a caucus meeting yesterday that they believed the party should go to the polls. One source said they had effectively "thrown down the gauntlet". They argued that if the right wing could get support for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] council -- provided for in the Interim Constitution this week -- it could force a new government to seriously consider allowing for the creation of such a homeland. Developments in Durban during the meeting between ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi were increasing the pressure on the party leadership. Some members of the caucus said bluntly that if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and Bophuthatswana did provisionally register for the election, the CP would be making a fatal error not to do the same. Yesterday afternoon a CP MP said the party had taken no decision on whether to follow Buthelezi's lead. The party leadership had been trying to establish contact with Buthelezi for clarity on his plans. There were attempts to call a meeting of the Freedom Alliance as soon as possible, and CP leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg had held extensive discussions with Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] (AVF) leader General Constant Viljoen since he arrived in Cape Town late on Tuesday. A prominent CP member said some rightwingers had considered forming a breakaway organisation to contest the election. Those in favour of this move were waiting to see whether the CP as a whole, or the AVF, would decide to take part, he said. He believed a major consideration was finding a "face" -- a well-known leader who could draw support -- to lead a breakaway party. It it understood that younger MPs like brothers Pieter and Corne Mulder were among the prime movers in the participation lobby. Respected MP for Parys Dr Piet Gous is also thought to be in favour of contesting the election. A senior CP source said a major factor behind the cracks in the party was the fact that some younger MPs saw their careers going down the drain. There also appears to be disillusionment with Hartzenberg's leadership. Another party member said the divisions were not about what the party should be striving for, but how to achieve it.
