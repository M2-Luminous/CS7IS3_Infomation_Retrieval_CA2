According to the sources, very heavy pressure has been applied to the president and top Bulgarian diplomats. To some of them, it was allegedly even hinted that if Sofia gives way, its problems in connection with debt negotiations with the Paris and Frankfurt Clubs will be solved. U.S. Congress representatives and Turkish Parliament deputies have reportedly called upon the government and head of state to decide to grant a corridor for the Turkish peacekeepers. According to their thesis, these troops would not be under the Turkish flag but serving in UN units; therefore Bulgaria has no grounds not to allow them in. According to the Constitution, only parliament can permit the passage of foreign troops through Bulgarian territory. William Cook, press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, yesterday categorically denied that U.S. official authorities were launching an attack on our institutions to pressure them to allow the passage of Turkish peacekeeping units.
