All in all, a total victory for the ANC. [Jordan] No, one cannot say that. One might say, at most, that the negotiating tactics of the ANC have paid off. But it was expensive: Much blood was shed, the economy has been damaged, and the country has been brought to the brink of the abyss. Buthelezi's Inkatha Party could already have had everything it now has last year. [PROFIL] According to the Constitution, there will be a coalition government at first. The public sector and the economy will remain largely in white hands. Can the ANC rule in this way at all? [Jordan] Power is not just located at the stock exchange, in the boards of governors, in the public sector, or in the army. Power is distributed among various centers. It is now important to shift it. For instance, in 1976, the white management was still able to tell the black workers: If you want more money, look where you get it from. In 1984, they were no longer able to say that, they were confronted with well-organized trade unions. If we now get a democratic government, the entrepreneurs will be even more careful. In this way power is shifted -- not dramatically, but effectively. [PROFIL] Your opponent so far, the National Party (NP), will become your coalition partner. Clashes are preprogrammed in this case. [Jordan] Quite so. Our first battle in the cabinet will be about the redistribution program. The NP always says: That is too expensive. We cannot count on their cooperation. [PROFIL] Will you raise taxes? [Jordan] At the moment, taxes are as high on milk as on champagne, as high on pig's bones as on Westphalian ham. We think this is unjust. We say: Put taxes on champagne and leave milk alone! [PROFIL] But with that you will frighten the whites. [Jordan] Of course. [PROFIL] And then they will not invest. [Jordan] We will see. [PROFIL] Will the public sector sabotage the new government? [Jordan] We must expect that. We are dealing with people who do not like us. We also do not expect voluntary cooperation by banks, by the mining industry, and by the rich white farmers. Whether they will really proceed against us actively is another question. [PROFIL] What has the ANC learned from the failures of other African regimes? [Jordan] We have also been able to learn from the bad example here. South Africa as the most autocratic country on the continent and far more corrupt than any other state in Africa. The population was treated like a conquered people, not like citizens. We did not have any rights, any claims, nothing. Blacks, who constitute 75 percent of the population, earn about 10 percent of the entire income. As regards inequality, South Africa tops any other African country. [PROFIL] While everywhere in the world the red flags are hauled down, they are hoisted on the Cape. Is the alliance of the ANC with the communists not an anachronism? [Jordan] The fact that communists are so successful here is a result of history. They have honestly earned their role by participating in the struggle for liberation. Paradoxically, they were supported by the white minority regime: Anyone who was against apartheid was branded as a communist. In the eyes of the blacks, communism, therefore, had to be something good. [PROFIL] And the Stalinists in the party could not establish a new dictatorship? [Jordan] Most black South Africans know that the communists are not strong enough to dominate politics. The fact that many South Africans have this fear is mostly only an alibi: They pretend to be against the communists, but, in reality, they are against democracy. [PROFIL] With the elections, the ANC has achieved its first goal: national liberation. What will come then? Is the ANC, the collection pond of political movements, now threatened with being split? [Jordan] National liberation has not yet been achieved. What we will get now is democracy. But national transformation has not yet been achieved by that. The issue of the land, for instance, remains an enormous problem. The new government must struggle for power. The struggle continues.
