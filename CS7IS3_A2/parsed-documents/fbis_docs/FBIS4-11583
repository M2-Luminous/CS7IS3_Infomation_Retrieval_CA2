The president also denied that the reforms could undermine the Guatemalan population. According to the president, extraordinary taxes will only affect approximately 3,000 persons and legal entities that earn more than 500,000 quetzals in income. Likewise, he indicated that "it is completely false that the reforms proposed last week will tax the majority of the population since the VAT [Value-Added Tax] remains at 7 percent and the only thing that is being sought is to widen the base rate. He pointed out that if Congress does not pass the reforms proposed by the Executive Branch, tax evasion could total 250 million quetzals during the year. De Leon Carpio also said that the government is under pressure to cut its liability and increase its revenues in order to be able to invest more in basic services that will benefit the population. "Hospitals and schools alone owe more than 1.2 billion quetzals to their creditors," he stipulated.
