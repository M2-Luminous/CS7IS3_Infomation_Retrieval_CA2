The DEA only supplied information as part of a cooperation protocol signed with Nicaragua. Nicaragua maintains a constant battle against drug trafficking. The last operation that took place in Rivas, where 275 kg of cocaine were seized, is a demonstration of this effort. Since 1991, Nicaragua maintains relations and exchanges information with the DEA. Information exchanges are also maintained with narcotic information centers in Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica. The Popoyo Beach operation was basically carried out by Nicaraguan authorities. Here is what Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said: [Begin Cesar recording] We spoke with the DEA information center about the Popoyo operation because it had information on aircraft overflights too. The information they gave us contributed to the success of this operation. Nevertheless, I want to point out the operation was carried out exclusively by Nicaraguans. More than 50 National Police agents were involved, although a couple of DEA agents, who we had given prior approval to, did participate. They have some technical facilities that allow operations such as these to be a success. [end recording] In another turn of events, Cesar said the airplane that made an emergency landing at Puerto Cabezas was because it ran out of fuel. Two Peruvians were traveling in this aircraft. The police searched the aircraft but no drugs were found. [Begin Cesar recording] It is a matter of concern when an airplane runs out of fuel and makes an emergency landing. We have photocopies of their passports and the names of the people who were aboard the aircraft. We have all the necessary information; however, nothing was found. [end recording] [passage omitted]
