The meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and National Defense Minister Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, was on security and the Armed Forces' attitude during the current crisis in Burundi. Marie-Josee Niyonzima reports: [Niyonzima] These are the points on which the interim president of the Republic's message focused on during the meeting with Bujumbura garrison officers: a neutral army, a loyal army, an army which guarantees citizens' freedom, the creation of an army and a national gendarmerie which reassures all the communities in the society. It was his first contact since the death of President Cyprien Ntaryamira over a month ago. [passage omitted] Regarding the disarming of armed groups in the country, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya once again issued directives. [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] Regarding the armed groups who are an obstacle to security in the country, the government cannot accept the emergence of secret armed groups inside the country. The government urges the national Armed Forces to combat them and asks them to adhere to discipline and loyalty towards the government's decision on disarmament. We, however, remind the Armed Forces that in this operation they must scrupulously respect the directives of the commander in chief of the Armed Forces which are as follows: First, the disarmament operation must be carefully prepared to prevent any problems. It must be conducted in close cooperation with the local administrative authorities to avoid any human or material damage. [passage indistinct] Fourth and last, we must keep in mind that disarmament is not an end in itself, but rather a precondition for peace and security to be undertaken through a plan as yet undefined and a study of how to tackle the following essential issue (?often used) as alibis for certain actions: opening up and extending the armed forces to all the ethnic components of our country.
