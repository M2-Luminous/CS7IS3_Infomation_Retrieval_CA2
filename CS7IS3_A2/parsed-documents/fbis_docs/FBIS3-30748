Czaczkowska: "Day After Day Toward the Crisis"] [Text] Conflicts within the governing coalition started even before the government was formed; with varied intensity, they persisted through the 100 days of governing. However, none of them shook the coalition as hard as the last one. Overheard Near the Door As a consequence of the seriousness of the conflict and the gravity of the accusations leveled at one another by the politicians of both coalition parties, the last session of the Chief Council [RN] of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] was held behind closed doors; journalists were not admitted. However, fragments of statements that could be made out in the corridor suggested that the participants were expressing severe criticism of the peasant [Polish Peasant Party (PSL)] partner. Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted that the main shortcoming of the prime minister is the fact that he is not acting in line with the coalition agreements and that he is unable to communicate with the mass media. The cadre policy that the PSL is carrying out was termed by him as a "buddies" policy. As he later repeated officially, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has so far proposed eight candidates for the posts of voivodes and deputy voivodes; among them, only one person was a member of the party's leadership; the others were experts. The 22 appointments that were made at the motion of the PSL concerned people chosen from among the PSL party apparatus. Kwasniewski argued that the conflicts must not be left as they are, so both partners and the public will not be led to the conclusion that there is no problem at all; a similar situation might repeat itself in several weeks or more. Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski said that economic policy entails a look into the future; it also requires a clear statement of what kind of policy the government wants to pursue. However, on this there are differences between the coalition parties. According to Borowski, the PSL fulfills the role of a brake in the government by demanding the time to think things over. Now the problem is that there is no time because the atmosphere in the West is once again favorable to Poland, and new possibilities for obtaining foreign capital are opening up. One cannot be suspicious, the deputy prime minister said; one cannot review every single law every three months and correct provisions that are world standards. It is also intolerable that the coalition's deputies introduce and vote on amendments that distort bills submitted by the government. Emphasizing that PSL policy is currently, to a considerable degree, catering to the needs of its own electorate, Borowski gave a few examples of decisions favoring the inhabitants of rural areas, such as great subsidies for the Agency for Agricultural Marketing [ARR], amendments to the Law on ARR, the Law on Compensatory Fees, and raises in old age pensions, which will primarily benefit farmers. Out of the 5 trillion zlotys [Z] earmarked for this year's raises, Z4 trillion will be received by them. Even though he admitted that indeed the situation should not be aggravated, Borowski said that submitting conditions is different from offending a partner. He believes that the best solution would be if the PSL accepted the five conditions submitted by himself and the SLD, if it adopted the budget without tampering with its provisions; the peasants should also unblock the National Investment Funds so mass privatization could finally begin. Only then could the details be discussed. The statements of both politicians were extensively commented on in the corridor. Some people in the corridor pointed out that the present conflict was brought on by excessive submission toward the PSL, which, they said, was the fault of Kwasniewski. "If we let the peasants fill the post of the voivode in Wloclawek, it is clear that anything can be done to us," they said. Members of the SdRP leadership did not conceal the fact that the proposal that all decisions be made by the government's Presidium was prompted by the need to watch the prime minister's hands. SLD politicians said the same during the coalition talks. The signing of agreements and appendixes was a consequence of the fact that, even in the previous Sejm, the PSL and its leader were well known for violating their agreements. The coalition also wants to keep a tighter rein on Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], by holding consultations concerning the filling of the positions of voivodes and deputy voivodes. As one politician conceded, the appetites of the URM head are enormous; however, one should rather not think about it in terms of one's own party or even in terms of the coalition but in much broader terms. Conflicts, Disputes, and Understatements Frictions that posed serious threats to the coalitions began as early as the day that was supposed to end the talks on the final shape of the Pawlak Cabinet. When, after over a month of coalition talks, everyone, both politicians and journalists, sighed with relief that we already had a government, it turned out that it was too early. The list with the names of the ministers that the prime minister brought to the Belweder was contrary to the earlier agreements. The SLD politicians threatened to break the coalition; Pawlak had to yield. The "bone of contention" was the Finance Ministry, which, along with the portfolio of the deputy minister, was given to Marek Borowski, as well as the Ownership Transformations Ministry, which was taken over by Wieslaw Kaczmarek. These two politicians with "liberal" views on the economy were not welcomed by the PSL. The crisis ended when both sides signed an appendix to the coalition agreement. This appendix was not observed, which caused the latest conflict. What Will Happen Next With the Coalition? Before the government was sworn in, the coalition was quite considerably rocked by the election of the chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee. It is not known whether this conflict was caused by the disloyalty of coalition partners or by the fact that the agreement was not very clear. PSL leaders officially did not pay great attention to this, but the deputies began to express strong doubts about the intentions of the SLD; they started to ask: "What will happen next with the coalition?" The same question was asked unofficially in the Sejm when the SLD Deputies' Club did not take part in discussions on the "New Year's" speech by the prime minister. The speech was not favorably received by the SLD; its deputies wondered why it had been delivered at all at that time. They argued that, among other things, the condition of the economy was depicted rather subjectively in the speech. The coalition was also not really unanimous in the ballots on the acceptance of accounts of the Oszewski and the Suchocka governments. According to Kwasniewski, the discussion and the ballots were exclusively political, not substantive acts. Assistant or Spokesman The government's information policy caused a serious misunderstanding as well. The appointment of Ewa Wachowicz to the post of press secretary did not bring about an enthusiastic response from the SLD, which wanted the prime minister to have a press spokesperson. Negative opinions of politicians and journalists on the information policy of the government forced the SdRP Presidium to forward a letter to the prime minister and ask that a concept of information policy be adopted. Dispute Over Voivodes For a long time, it seemed that, if the issue of the filling of voivode posts might cause a split in the coalition, it would be not because of its appetites for the same voivodships but because of the attitude toward the need to replace voivodes in general. When, before the government was sworn in, Michal Strak spoke about the need to adjust the political map of voivodships to the election results, SLD politicians either tried to calm the situation or did not say anything. Finally, in early December, Kwasniewski admitted that the concept proposed by the PSL was very much to the SLD's liking. Despite the fact that both parties agreed that the post of the voivode in a given voivodship would be offered to the party that won the elections in that voivodship, conflicts were not avoided. A heated dispute arose when the Wloclawek voivode was being replaced. In the Wloclawek voivodship, the SLD won the elections (it gained five seats, the PSL only one); however, it was a PSL member who was appointed as voivode. He received definite support from the regional self-government sejm. This issue is said to have been discussed at the meeting of the "directorate"; Ryszard Jarzembowski, who is in charge of coordinating the replacement of voivodes on behalf of the SLD, was forced to say that URM should have an SLD representative--in the rank of an under secretary of state--who would also exert influence on decisions concerning voivodes. Between the Coalition and the Belweder For quite a long time now, we have been witnessing a dispute over the posts of deputy ministers in the presidential ministries. As a result of the stance taken by the prime minister, who was afraid of a conflict with the Belweder, this controversy turned into a conflict between the Sejm National Defense Ministry, chaired by SdRP Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski, and the prime minister. Since December, the committee has been waiting for the prime minister to provide an answer to the question of merging posts by Jerzy Milewski. In the beginning, both PSL and SLD deputies demanded that the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries be filled by their own people. When the prime minister did not really abandon this idea but definitely put off its implementation, the PSL stopped insisting on this. A few days ago, however, Leszek Bugaj (PSL) confirmed that the coalition would "not let it go at that," and, in a few weeks, it would have its own deputy minister in the National Defense Ministry. This demand emerged once again during the latest talks between Kwasniewski and Pawlak. Principles of the Work of the Coalition 1. In line with the coalition agreement, responsibility for the right work of the coalition lies with the chairmen of the coalition groupings and chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of these groupings, who act jointly. 2. The drafts of strategic political, economic, and cadre decisions of the government are submitted to the chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings before final decisions on them are made. 3. Decisions concerning the members of the leadership of all of the ministries, appointed by the coalition groupings, are made by the prime minister after consultations with the relevant deputy ministers and the chairmen of the coalition groupings whose representative does not head the given ministry. 4. Decisions concerning personnel issues in the voivodship state administration are preceded by consultations with the chairmen of the Deputies' Clubs of the coalition groupings. [Box, p 2 Principles of the Work of the Coalition The above-mentioned provisions were included in the appendix to the coalition agreement that was signed before the final composition of the Council of Ministers was forwarded to the Belweder.
