The demand for the purchase plans as part of "objective criteria" for improving foreign access to the Japanese market was made in subcabinet-level framework talks on auto trade held Friday and Saturday in Tokyo, the sources said. U.S. officials also demanded as part of the criteria that Japanese-owned auto assembly plants in the U.S. increase the local content ratio in their production, the sources said. The Japanese side did not directly respond to the U.S. demands and asked that further discussions be held at the working-level talks starting Monday, they said. Japan told the U.S. at the beginning of the resumed talks that it would not accept any numerical targets as objective criteria for improving market access in Japan. At the talks, both Japan and the U.S. presented their own versions of a draft agreement on auto trade, the sources said. U.S. officials also asked that a bilateral agreement incorporate plans for purchases of U.S.-made auto parts that five Japanese automakers recently announced, the sources said. An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that serious differences remain on key issues of auto trade in the talks.
