Villagers have fled the region in Sierra Leone in panic after rebels from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) attacked eight towns in the past three weeks. Eyewitnesses told AFP here that some of the rebels boys aged 10 to 17 but were heavily armed and had no hesitation in torturing victims. Government forces a year ago re-captured the eight villages, located 170 kilometres (105 miles) east of the capital Freetown, and have maintained overall their control in the area despite the recent attacks, the military sources reported.
