A meeting of experts planned for the end of December in Moscow has been postponed (Russian sources indicate that it should take place end January) and the initialing of the final agreement could, say well-informed sources, take place toward the end of March. This development does not correspond to the optimistic scenario described by politicians on both sides at the signing of the political statement when not only the president in office of the European Council, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but also the president of the Commission, Jacques Delors, had announced that an agreement would be signed in the next few days. Relaunching negotiations was the central topic of talks that the Russian Ambassador to the EC, Mr. Silaew, had on Monday [17 January] and Tuesday with the vice-president of the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen, with Sir Leon Brittan and also with Mr. Benavides of the DG-I [Directorate General I -- external relations]. EUROPE believes that the reasons for the present break are both technical and political, given that: (a) Fundamental divergence persists, notably in the nuclear field (in particular concerning the rules and provisions to govern the trade of uranium between the EC and Russia), maritime transport and access to the banking market (where Russia calls for a transition period). As regards the nuclear question (by far the most tricky question), France insists for trade questions to be governed by a separate accord between the EC and Russia, in this case the EURATOM agreement (negotiated 18 months ago with Russia but never completed) which would give the EC more possibilities for acting in connection with over-large import flows or dumping practices in the trade of enriched uranium. The 11 other member states, the Commission and Russian authorities hope to include this chapter in the cooperation agreement. It seems that the Commission recently submitted a compromise solution to Russian authorities. It is now awaiting Moscow's reply; (b) After the parliamentary elections in Russia in December and given the political and staffing changes that have taken place within the Russian Government, the EC expects the situation will become more stable and that its interlocutors in negotiations will be clearly identified; (c) Further to the real "forcing" by negotiators before and during Mr. Yeltsin's stay in Brussels (mainly in order to make it possible to sign the statement), the Twelve needed time for reflection in order to examine results obtained in detail.
