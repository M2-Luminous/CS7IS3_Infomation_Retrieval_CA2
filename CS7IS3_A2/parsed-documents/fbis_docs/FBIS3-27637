Establishing a socialist market economic system is a great cause without precedent in history, and there is no ready-made experience which we can make use of. We will inevitably encounter some difficulties and problems which we have never experienced in the past. It is particularly imperative for us to aim high and have lofty ambitions. We must be bold in making explorations and blazing new trails. Without lofty ambitions and great ideals, without pioneering spirit, without the spirit of "taking a risk," and without a burst of energy and vigor, we cannot break a good, new path and accomplish something new. At present, the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people are further emancipating their minds, seizing the good opportunity, deepening reform, and struggling hard to establish a socialist market economic system and develop a socialist market economy. The situation is encouraging and presses us to march forward courageously. Some comrades, however, are lacking great ideals and ambition. They lack both a vigorous spirit and an energetic drive. Some comrades like to compare our province, Hunan, with some provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, which are experiencing fairly rapid economic development. They always complain that we are backward in this respect or no good in that regard. In fact, they are mistakenly belittling themselves. There gaps truly do exist between us, Hunan, and those coastal provinces and regions. For example, if we compare ourselves with Jiangsu, we lag behind in township and town enterprises. If we compare ourselves with Zhejiang, we lag behind in individual and private economy. If we compare ourselves with Guangdong, we lag behind in foreign-funded enterprises. If we compare ourselves with the entire coastal area, we lag behind in the emancipation of the mind. However, we must on no account unduly underestimate our own capabilities, despite these gaps. We should realize that Hunan's economic development is not slow. Last year, our township and town enterprises got on the "expressway." Our foreign-funded enterprises, tertiary industry, and individual and private economy have been developing fairly rapidly. Our GNP has been increasing at the highest speed since reform and opening up. We do not object to comparing ourselves with economically advanced coastal provinces and regions. The purpose of this comparison, however, is not only to discover the gaps; it is undertaken in order to make an analysis of the reasons contributing to the gaps and study measures for narrowing and eliminating them. Material dialectics have told us that all things develop and change under certain conditions. As long as we take a correct path and go all out in our efforts, the gaps can be narrowed. The backward can definitely become the advanced. We must aim high, have lofty ambitions, and learn to use the views of material dialectics to exhibit judgment. While looking at the gaps which have objectively existed, we must not lose sight of our achievements in work. While understanding the subjective reasons contributing to the gaps, we must realize the constraints of the objective conditions. While seeing those unfavorable conditions, we must not lose sight of those favorable conditions to enhance our confidence and pluck up our courage. Let bygones be bygones. The latecomers can surpass the old-timers. It is no use feeling sorry about losing the previous good opportunities. What is important is that we must seize on new opportunities, give play to our strong points, take truly practical measures, rouse ourselves for vigorous efforts to make our province prosperous, and try hard to catch up. Some comrades have the mentality of "not attempting to earn praise, but only working to avoid mistakes." They simply muddle along and refuse to make progress. This shows that they are devoid of lofty ambitions and great ideals. Communist party members are vanguard fighters of the working class, who have a communist consciousness. They must serve the people wholeheartedly. They must be the first to bear hardship, and the last to enjoy comforts. They must work selflessly for the common good of the people and make more contributions. In particular, our party cadres must diligently perform administrative work for the people, must set a good example, must struggle hard to do pioneering work, must explore the way forward to blaze new trails, and must truly make achievements. How can they "not attempt to earn praise, but only work to avoid mistakes?" Refusing to do administrative work diligently is also a type of corruption, albeit an invisible type of corruption. If a party member or party cadre fails to work hard to make contributions to the party, state and people, he is not a qualified party member or party cadre. He will harm the cause of the party and the people. It is precisely in this sense that we say: "Failing to earn praise means committing mistakes." Besides, some comrades have the mentality of "being content with having enough clothes to wear and sufficient food to eat" and "being satisfied with small-scale prosperity." This has also shown that they are devoid of lofty ambitions and great ideals. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have made great achievements in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, which have become the focus of world's attention. The living standards of our people have been significantly improved. On no account, however, can we be content with the existing achievements. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has set two goals. With regard to the goal of reform, we must initially establish a socialist market economic system by the end of this century. With regard to the goal of development, by the end of this century we will realize small-scale prosperity. In the middle of the next century, we will reach the level of the middle strata of developed nations. These two goals are great, glorious, and strenuous. We cannot attain them without lofty ambitions, great ideals, and persistent hard work. If we are content with the existing achievements of reform and development, this will really be too paltry. Even though we have succeeded in establishing the socialist market economic system, realizing small-scale prosperity, and reaching the level of the middle strata of the developed countries, we must not be content with them. We must never stop progressing. Fighting forever is our quality as communist party members as well as a duty we must fulfill in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To aim high and have lofty ambitions, we must study hard Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must persist in using the viewpoints of dialectical materialism to observe and analyze problems to enhance our dedication to our cause as well as our sense of responsibility. This is the source of our strength for making explorations courageously and advancing incessantly. It is also the source of strength for building the socialist market economic system and pushing the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics to victory.
