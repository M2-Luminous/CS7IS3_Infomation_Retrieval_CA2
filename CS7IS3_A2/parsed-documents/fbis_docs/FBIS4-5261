Since I took office last August, I have expressed my feelings about problems related to Japan's wartime past, and worked on such major tasks as political reform, the Uruguay Round, several packages of measures to stimulate the economy, the relaxation of regulations, and Japan-U.S. framework talks. I have put into effect several reforms the government of the Liberal Democratic Party was unable to carry out. For Japan's future, I worked out plans for the reform of the current tax system, the reform of the current pension system, decentralization, and the freedom of information within 1993, and some of them were successful, thereby paving the way for carrying out reforms. I feel very grateful and I would like to express my gratitude to the people for their understanding and cooperation. To my regret, I was not able to fully work on the bold reform of the current education system and the reform of the current administration system in order for Japan to prepare itself for a new era. Japan was unable to play an aggressive part in disarmament. For example, Japan was unable to play an aggressive part for promoting the UN registry system for conventional weapons. There is also the Minamata diseases trial which remains a symbolic environmental problem. I had intended to work on them but it is regrettable that I will now be unable to do so. Over the past eight months, I have driven myself to work on tasks at home and abroad, day and night, without taking a rest. As I said at the outset of this news conference, I have expressed my resolve to quit as prime minister. In this news conference I would like to explain why I resolved to step down as prime minister. The deliberation of the 1994 budget that directly affects the people's livelihood has remained stalled, and this situation is truly worrisome. My personal problem -- it does not matter whether it is being used as a tool in a political strife -- has become an obstacle to promoting Diet debates. I have to honestly reveal all the facts unearthed so far to the people. First, I would like to refer to the problem about my loan from the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group. As I explained in documents I submitted to the Diet, I got the loan of 100 million yen from the group, and I certainly repaid it. But the report I received from my office last night revealed that under an agreement reached between my office and the group, the interest on the loan was treated as political donations from companies belonging to the group. The report said these political donations were properly handled in accordance with the Political Funds Control Law, and those which exceeded the limit set by the law were reported in a statement of income and expenses. Regarding the problem concerning the purchase of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone] stocks, as I have repeatedly said, my father-in-law bought them on his own and my former secretary Miyama was involved in the investment. I heard that revenues from the sale of the stocks were sent to my father-in-law through my office account. But I think this is not basically a problem. I personally made efforts to help unearth facts about these problems in a bid to dispel suspicion on me. But, in the process of investigating them, it has become clear that there is another problem. There is the problem that for several years since 1981 my office entrusted my personal funds to a person for investment, thereby deriving profits. That person is my old friend. He reportedly asked my office to entrust my personal funds to him for a sound investment. I have learned that such investment activities might have dubious legality. I cannot say more about this matter at the present because the whole affair is still under investigation. Although the affair took place many years ago, and my office was responsible, I have concluded that I should take moral responsibility as a top political leader who always has to be straight himself. To assume political responsibility for the facts which have come to light, and for the stalled Diet business, I have decided to resign as prime minister. I deeply apologize for resigning at a time when further political stalemate should be avoided so the government can pass the budget bill as early as possible, and tackle many domestic and foreign issues. I earnestly hope my resignation will somehow contribute to restoring the people's trust in politics. I have decided to resign for the reasons I have just explained. The reforms are only half complete. Although I will be serving in a different capacity, I am determined to continue upholding the torch of reform. I again apologize to the people who have supported reform efforts for my having to resign in such a way. I sincerely ask you to understand my decision.
