They are not revealing the details of the current operation, its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state. Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear electric power stations to meet these trains. According to information at the disposal of the editorial office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10 months of this year. In return Ukraine will receive by way of compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for its nuclear power industry. It is no coincidence that these March days have been selected to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had something to report in Washington. The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations they have assumed.
