This was the last news he received before leaving for the United States. [Begin Pardo recording] The release of Dr. Upegui was the result of a very persistent effort, especially by the Army. Fortunately, he is safe and sound and will be able to join his family very soon. [end recording] Despite the successful operation--which dealt a heavy blow against the guerrillas--Pardo said the number of kidnappings have increased for one specific reason: the unconstitutionality of certain decrees of the Antikidnapping Law. [Beginning Pardo recording] We have said this could pave the way for those who want to commit kidnappings, that they would face fewer obstacles and restrictions; unfortunately, we see that kidnappers have increased their actions. [end recording] Rafael Pardo went to Houston to undergo a medical checkup, which will allow him to continue with his recuperation. He hopes to be back in Colombia in February to resume his job as defense minister.
