He was one of the few politicians present during the 22 March demonstration in which more than 50,000 people, mainly women, marched through the streets of the capital to present a rejection front to the violence of the Islamic fundamentalists. He has never minced his words in talking about the violent collapse of the regime formed immediately after independence, of which fundamentalism is just a by-product. He condemns the government's relentless pursuit of the same policy despite all the evidence, namely advocating dialogue with the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders while repressing acts of terrorism. Condemned by the armed Islamic groups, Said Sadi continues to live in Algeria. Forced to constantly move house and cover his tracks, he makes numerous speeches and attends numerous meetings throughout the country to rally around a single republican platform all those who are not yet resigned to the worst. Born in a poor family in Aghriba near Tizi Ouzou -- his father was a road mender -- Said Sadi has always been an oppositionist. As a high school student he had a brush with prison. As a student, he was frequently in trouble with the authorities because he took part in cultural groups which escaped the control of the single party. Said Sadi became a doctor and is the driving force of Berber Spring. In 1980, he organized the first general strike in Kabylia against the dictatorship and appeared before the State Security Court. Barely had he been released when he reoffended. In 1982 Said Sadi headed a semiclandestine publication. Between 1983 and 1985, he worked on the creation of the Human Rights League. Brought before the courts once again, he was condemned to three years' imprisonment and remained in the Lambese prison. Pardoned in 1987, he did not give up. He was behind a new strike and called for the holding of a national assembly of the Amazigh cultural movement, which resulted in the creation of the RCD which, in the June 1990 municipal elections, won 87 communes whereas the fundamentalists won 900 city councils. When Mohammed Boudiaf became president of the HCE (Higher State Committee), Said Sadi regained hope, but the head of state was assassinated six months after his return to Algeria in June 1992. Disaster. Panic. The political class did nothing or emigrated. Said Sadi has not given up. He knows that his country is already at war. He chose his camp a long time ago -- that of resistance. He is organizing it. [LE FIGARO] You have just launched an appeal for resistance. Do you think that Algeria is at war? [Sadi] A civil war is being imposed on society and we must face it. One section of the nation is organizing the genocide of the other. I will mention just two examples: Outside a high school in the suburbs of Algiers, a 13-year old boy had his throat cut simply because his father is a policeman. A young woman who refused to wear the veil was shot in the head. Hitherto, the majority of Algerians felt that the defense of individuals and goods should be entrusted to the state. It must be admitted that this state is defective. We can no longer spend our time burying our dead. [LE FIGARO] Does the 22 March demonstration in Algiers, which brought together 50,000 people, the majority of them women, mark a turning-point in the struggle against the FIS? [Sadi] It is a turning-point for two reasons. First, this demonstration was organized by citizens' movements and associations of women who are among those most seriously threatened by radical Islamic fundamentalism. They are now taking up the fight. Second, this demonstration took place under the banner of resistance. The slogans clearly proclaimed the rejection of a fundamentalism which is the product of the existing system. Society has understood that it must assume responsibility itself, even for security issues. [LE FIGARO] Are you planning armed resistance? [Sadi] Without waiting for my appeal, armed groups have been formed, self-defense cells are emerging to resist fundamentalism. It was therefore necessary to react before control was lost. Just because you are a democrat, it does not mean that you are incapable of using a gun, but war is not the only way of bringing down this regime. [LE FIGARO] What kind of action are you envisaging? [Sadi] Demonstrations, especially in Kabylia on 20 April, repeated strikes throughout the country, a boycott of the schools which have become terrorist factories... The situation is deadlocked, but it will not continue to be for long. The word resistance has spread like a trail of gunpowder. [LE FIGARO] Who will wage this struggle with you? [Sadi] The priority is to channel all those who reject the Islamic fundamentalist plan. The trade unions, the associations, the political parties understand that they are all equally threatened. The issue goes beyond government-opposition splits. I know senior officials, officers, and diplomats who fully support our approach. Civilian society cannot accept being the hostage of the government and the Islamic fundamentalists. The match will be a three-sided one. [LE FIGARO] Do you want to open up a "third path" between the FIS and the FLN [National Liberation Front]? [Sadi] I reject the idea that the FIS and FLN represent two antagonistic options. The FIS is the FLN painted green. Most of its political cadres come from the FLN's inner circle. Islamic fundamentalism is a natural but radical variant of the FLN. [LE FIGARO] Who is the main enemy? [Sadi] We must first deal with the government, force it to step down and free the state from the clans. What does the FIS trade on other than the government's negligence and corruption? I am convinced that the Islamic fundamentalists would lose their credibility if the existing regime fell. [LE FIGARO] How can it be forced to step down? [Sadi] It is a struggle: These things cannot be requested, they must be seized. [LE FIGARO] Surely you also have to be able to organize the resistance? [Sadi] That is the whole problem. The majority of the population are disorientated, crushed by the weight of social problems. But thinking and active Algeria totally supports our idea for resistance and change. [LE FIGARO] Is that Algeria not tempted by exile? [Sadi] A race against time has started, between safeguarding the country and despair. I refuse to cast any stones at those leaving. [LE FIGARO] Will you not help the FIS by first targeting the existing government? [Sadi] It is a risk. The Islamic movement's ability to cause trouble is strong enough to take advantage of a power vacuum. The FIS is at war, it is trying to win it. The transfer of power must not be chaotic. [LE FIGARO] Otherwise? [Sadi] There are three possible scenarios. First, the collapse of the state. Algiers will not be Tehran but Kabul: We do not have the 2,000 ayatollahs or the 4,000 mullahs who could replace the state with a theocracy. Second, the country's collapse, because Algerian national consciousness is fairly recent. Third hypothesis on which we need to work: All the nation's vital forces say: "That is enough! This suicidal course of tolerating corruption in the heart of the government must be stopped!" [LE FIGARO] President Zeroual has decided to open the dialogue to all political parties, including the FIS. What do you have to say to him? [Sadi] I have four questions to put to him: First, do you believe it is possible to dissociate terrorism and fundamentalism? Second, how can you hope that the country will mobilize when you are haggling over the state in the visiting rooms of Blida prison with the Islamic fundamentalist leaders? Third, what form of Islam do you plan to uphold? Four, do you accept that a definitive lesson should be learned from the failure of the system to which you belong? [LE FIGARO] Are you resolutely opposed to dialogue with the Islamic fundamentalists? [Sadi] I am not opposed to it on principle but what kind of dialogue can you have through Kalashnikovs? For the time being, the dialogue is merely a relentless pursuit of the same policy despite the evidence. If it is to enable the clans to survive by plunder, we already know where that has led us. Dialogue is a means, not an end. [LE FIGARO] Is there room for a moderate Islamic movement? [Sadi] I have never believed in the idea of a moderate Islamic movement in Algeria. What we have is an Islamic movement born of frustration, it can only express itself through extremes. Ali Belhadj (one of the FIS leaders) is the real representative of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria: He always represents outrage, extremes, and violence. He is the result of a social failure which could have led to the extreme Left it had been mature in 1970. [LE FIGARO] So it is secular society against Islamic fundamentalism? [Sadi] I do not think there is any alternative. Religion and politics must be separated. The regime claims to have found a middle way which does not exist. Even the established Islamic fundamentalists who tried to play that game have been disqualified by the armed groups. [LE FIGARO] Does the FIS really enjoy popular support? [Sadi] If that were the case, Algeria would already have toppled. It is perfectly possible to win back the FIS' social base. Many young people who demonstrated with us last week were in the streets with the FIS in 1991. It has constantly been said that the small traders form the Islamic fundamentalists' social base, but they closed their stores on 22 March. [LE FIGARO] Why is Algeria deadlocked 30 years after independence? [Sadi] The regime's clan-based and mafia-based organization prevented competition from emerging, efficiency has always been regarded as a luxury we could do without. A kind of mediocrity has been established at all levels. Algeria was rich. Some $12 billion in aid was showered on us and we managed to gain a debt of $26 billion. [LE FIGARO] Is the problem entirely political? [Sadi] There is also a sociological division. More than 70 percent of the Algerian population is less than 30 years old. I am 46: I have met with the seven or eight main political parties in the country; I was the youngest. Young people are going to extremes because they cannot identify with leaders who are constantly looking to the past. [LE FIGARO] What is your generation doing to counter that? [Sadi] What little has been achieved is thanks to my generation. But we are merely technical cooperation agents. Those who administer have never had power and those who have power have never administered. [LE FIGARO] Do you expect any specific aid from France and Europe? [Sadi] What is happening in Algeria does not just concern the Algerians. The aim is to uphold peace in the Mediterranean basin. If our allies, who share the values of democracy, do not support us, everybody will suffer. Tehran or Riyadh take their alliances for granted. France and Europe are swinging between compassion and rejection. They ought to stop their credit to the existing government: They are transfusing a corpse, turning the wheel of misfortune. It is a question of political ecology. [LE FIGARO] Are you afraid of having to go into exile or underground? [Sadi] Nothing can be ruled out. But the democracy of exile is not my style. I have to move house frequently, keep my schedule secret... I have already been forced underground to some extent.
