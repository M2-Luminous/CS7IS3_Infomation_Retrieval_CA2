The alliance opposed to President Borhanoddin Rabbani used Scud and Organ [as received] missiles to shell government positions. [passage omitted] Afghan diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia have told AL-HAYAH that Rabbani's condition for agreeing to a truce is for Hekmatyar to completely sever his links with the militias and the communists and hand over all the heavy weapons in his possession to the Defense Ministry. He also demanded strong guarantees from high-level circles that the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] will not try to violate the cease-fire again or participate in any "future conspiracy to seize power" in the country. The sources also emphasized that the Afghan presidency is not prepared at all to hold talks with Dostam and his allies. They quoted Rabbani's sources as saying that Rabbani is willing to hold general elections under international supervision, as stated in the Mecca declaration, provided that the elections be held six months after the end of the head of state's term.
