The planes were attacking northern positions from Little Aden, just west of the main city, to Lahij to the north, "continuously bombarding the whole front," he said. "This is a violation of the ceasefire," announced by the Sanaa authorities late Monday, al-Iryani said. The ceasefire took effect midnight Monday (2100 GMT) but collapsed six hours later. Al-Iryani said the Sanaa government would inform UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali about the southern air raids "immediately." Asked whether the northern forces were firing back, al-Iryani said "I presume so." A correspondent in Aden said northern artillery was pounding the airport and surrounding area for the third straight day in an attempt to prevent it being used as a base for the warplanes.
