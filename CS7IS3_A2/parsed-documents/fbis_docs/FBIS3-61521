To this end, the character of changes in the Kiev reservoir surface vegetation under the effect of acute radionuclide contamination and accumulation levels of the principal radionuclides in the vegetation mass were investigated. In so doing, overgrown areas were assessed by the aerovisual method, and the structure of the most important vegetation systems was studied by the transect method using data obtained by large-scale aerial photography survey of the Kiev reservoir vegetation in 1983, i.e., three years before the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, as a frame of reference. The study reveals considerable changes which have occurred since the accident and which cannot be attributed to multiyear vegetation successions or the characteristics of the hydrological conditions during this period. In particular, the ecological areal of plants of the Potamogeton genus has shrunken considerably, probably due to its low radiation resistance and high [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr accumulation ability. The conclusion is drawn that large tracts of aeroaquatic vegetation play an unequal role with respect to the ingress of radionuclides into the bottom sediments and water depth, depending on their structural characteristics. By mowing vegetation and changing the level conditions one can alter the correlations between different types of aquatic plants and thus develop an optimum method by which the vegetation systems affect the radiation environment in a certain reservoir section as a function of the contamination character.
