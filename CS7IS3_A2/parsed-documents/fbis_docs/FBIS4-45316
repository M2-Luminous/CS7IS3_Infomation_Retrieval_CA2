In the carefully planned raid, the police seized large quantities of drugs" and "arrested a resident of Netanya known to be one of the largest drug dealers in Israel." A report by Raine Marcus on page 12 of Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST on 17 May notes that Tel Aviv narcotics squad detectives "seized liquefied cocaine disguised as Colombian coffee liqueur, worth around $700,000, allegedly smuggled here from Colombia by international drug traffickers." Detectives arrested 30-year-old suspected courier Moti Spiegel at Ben-Gurion Airport. Spiegel's partner, 23-year-old Tamir Peretz, and Miguel Octavio, a 32-year-old Colombian who has been in Israel three months, were arrested in the Tel Aviv area and remanded in custody for 11 days. Writing on page 3 of Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST on 25 May, Raine Marcus reports that in their second raid in five months of the Abu-Sayf clan's Yafo orange groves, "police arrested four family members early yesterday morning, after an undercover agent taped drug transactions." Marcus adds that in an operation dubbed "Black Night," detectives also arrested two members of Yafo's Daka clan, and four other alleged dealers. Nearly 20,000 shekels in cash, "which police believe to be profits from drug trading, was found in their possession. Traces of white powder and scales were found in one apartment." The report goes on to say that the 47-year-old undercover agent, a Yafo drug addict "with several charges pending against him, agreed to work for police in return for the closing of the cases and payment." Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 26 May, in a page 15 report by David Zohar, reports that "the Israeli drug trade totals $2.5 billion a year. The annual damage accruing to the market by the use of drugs--according to Beni Arad, chairman of the Anti-Drug Authority--amounts to 33 billion shekels." According to Arad some 200,000 Israelis, including 27,000 high school students, use drugs. Some 33,000 of the users are addicted to heroin. Arad says that the annual consumption of heroin in Israel amounts to between 3-4 tons; 4 tons hashish, and half a ton cocaine. A report by Yosi Levi on the same page of MA'ARIV states that "the Jerusalem police have uncovered a sophisticated ring of drug smugglers from the United States. The ring was headed by Asher Abutbul, 31, who has resided in Manhattan for the last 15 years." The report adds that the Jerusalem police have seized 11 shipments of cocaine addressed to various people in Jerusalem and Ramat Gan. Altogether 125 grams of cocaine valued at approximately $15,000 were seized.
