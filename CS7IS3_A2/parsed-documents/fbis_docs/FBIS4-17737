Process of Signing Document on Public Accord Begins in Kremlin Tomorrow"] [Text] Kursk Oblast Administration Head Vasiliy Shuteyev: Let me say straightaway that as head of the administration of a Federation component I will certainly sign the draft "peace" agreement proposed by the president. Needless to say, the text needs some adjustments and we will obviously do that during the discussion. But this is purely a question of editing: Some provisions that do not duplicate the constitution can be expanded, while some can be shortened; however, it is not the details that should be primarily worrying us today but the essence, objectives, and positive qualities of the document. And the essence of the document is that the signatories are making the appropriate commitments, aware that Russia has no future without the agreement. Khabarovsk Kray Administration Head Viktor Ishayev: Everyone has gotten well and truly sick of the constant wrangling in our society and I think that the Federation components will favor consolidation in any form. The agreement on civil accord is essential. And we have already said that it must be signed. We, the people of the Far East, are most concerned about the economic basis for consolidation. Local administration heads believe that the unequal economic conditions both between the territories themselves and in relations with the government that exist for instance for krays, oblasts, and republics within Russia may become an unpopular political factor. Khabarovsk Kray, which borders on Yakutia for instance, is cannot help seeing that the latter receives privileges from the center. Yet we have exactly the same problems. And we too are an equal Federation component. So let us create equal conditions for all. Bryansk Oblast Administration Head Vladimir Karpov: Along with the other administration heads, I signed an appeal to political parties and movements following the meeting with the president. Accord is vitally necessary in Russia today. I am convinced that the country has no future unless reforms are continued, the norms of a civil society are established, and economic and political stability are ensured. The tasks facing society are too complex to waste effort on political confrontation and continue the protracted political games. A compromise is possible and necessary. Everyone merely has to be able to get over their arrogance in order to rescue the country and cast aside their political passions and ambitions. Novosibirsk Mayor Viktor Tolokonskiy: I think that most people of Novosibirsk fully understand the need for the civil accord that the Russian president has proposed. But at the same time many people are worried that the conclusion of this agreement might prolong the state of apathy and inactivity in the parliament and government. And I think that the proposed form of civil peace and accord should also be a pledge for all its signatories at once to get down in earnest to effective work to extricate the country from crisis.
