Its structure consists of bonding a double layer FPC (flexible printed circuit board) to a copper board which has good heat dissipation characteristics without using glue. The leads are formed by etching copper foil. A prototype has been developed in the form of an LCC (leadless chip carrier) with leads bending inward, to eliminate concern over mounting on printed circuit boards. Printek, an associated printed wiring board manufacturing company headquartered in Atsugi, Kanagawa, has set up trial production of 20,000-30,000 pieces per month, and has begun to ship samples. Since internal wiring can be easily performed, applications are also expected to be found in MCM (multichip module) applications. Beginning in FY94, production could shift upward to 200,000 or more pieces per month. The prototype package is 10mm square, and the width of conductive leads which have been copper-plate etched, is 75&mgr;m. Spacing between leads is 100&mgr;m. Although the [acta] lead pitch is 0.2mm, Mitsui Toatsu plans to reduce this to 50/50&mgr;m, 0.1mm pitch in the future, which will be optimum for mounting ASICs (application specific ICs). ASICs and CPUs require packages having high pin counts, and the amount of power consumed is large, so dissipating the heat generated by the chip has been a problem. Until now, there has been no low-cost, highly functional package material available. The MQP developed by Mitsui Toatsu uses a design in which an adhesive polyimide layer is situated between copper foil and copper plate; the leads are identical to TAB (tape automated bonding), and copper foil is etched. it can be shaped like an LCC in which the chip is bent, so ordinary mounting processes can be used. The package can even accommodate 2-3W high power chips. Like the FPC, internal wiring can be performed, and multiple layers (up to four) can be achieved. For these reasons, the package is also expected to find a large future market for MCM applications. At present Mitsui Toatsu has set up experimental facilities at an associated company called Printek, and is producing 20,000-30,000 pieces per month. Samples are already being shipped. At the mass production stage, there is likely to be a significant reduction in cost compared to the ceramic-type LCC, and the company would like to begin commercial production as early as FY94, at 200,000-300,000 pieces per month.
