Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the Central Bank of China, suggested Monday [20 June] that the government consider abolishing or lowering the bond-transaction tax in a new attempt to revitalize the domestic capital market. Trading of corporate bonds and treasury bills is currently subject to the imposition of a 0.1 percent transaction tax, while transactions on government bonds are not subject to a tax. The lowering or lifting of the bond-transaction tax would help induce more foreign funds to pour into the Taiwan bond market and thus boost overall financial activities, Liang noted. The governor made the statement at a seminar on the economy sponsored by Academia Sinica, the highest academic body in Taiwan. Stressing that the Central Bank welcomes investment from abroad, he said four other conditions were necessary for Taiwan to open up its capital markets: Making government debts publicly known; narrowing differences in financial conditions -- such as the difference in interest rates -- between Taiwan and foreign countries; introducing measures to help insure export-oriented manufacturers against risks; and overhauling of the domestic stock market. Bond-market traders reacted positively toward Liang's suggestion on the bond tax, [words indistinct] the proposed measure would greatly push up the circulation of corporate bonds and treasury bills, transactions of which have nearly come to a standstill as of late. Trade volume on the bond market, though reaching trillions of new Taiwan dollars, comes mainly from transactions of government bonds, while most corporate bonds and treasury bills are kept by banks and insurance companies as reserves, the traders explained. Meanwhile, Liang said he has great confidence that Taipei can gradually be turned into an Asia-Pacific financial hub, with the first step being to become a regional funding center. In its ambition to become a financial center, Taipei aims to play a complementary role rather than replace other hubs in this part of the world, he elaborated. To fit into the government's financial-internationalization strategy, he said, the central bank will also place a top priority on enlarging the presence of foreign banks in Taiwan, a move expected to bring in more and better financial services.
