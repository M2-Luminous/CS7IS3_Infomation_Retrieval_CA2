Reliable sources have informed EXPRESO that the transfers occurred at the end of January, and that it included a high-ranking Dincote colonel and other PNP unit chiefs. It must be noted that EXPRESO was the first to report, at the beginning of February, that the PNP had implemented a 30 percent reduction in Dincote personnel. This reduction is part of the announced "streamlining" of police force personnel, which was disclosed not so long ago by PNP General Director Victor Alva Plasencia. According to the same source, Dincote has already submitted to the PNP General Staff the names of the 300 Dincote agents who will be fired. The officer added that it is still unknown whether all of these agents will be transferred to the SIN or to other police units, and that this situation is causing uncertainty among Dincote personnel.
