Juppe toured the Gaza Strip under a very hot sun today. He visited Palestinian camps where living conditions shocked him. [Begin Juppe recording] When one walks through these camps, such as the Shati camp, when one sees this school, one realises how much should be done. The living conditions in these camps are not as required by human dignity. We should change them if we want the population to believe in the peace process now under way. There is some kind of race against time at the moment. France has for so many years been present and helping in the occupied territories. We have decided in 1994 to intensify this aid. However, the mobilization of the entire international community is needed. I hope that what was announced in Washington a few months ago will be implemented in the field. I have repeatedly stated France's message regarding the right of the Palestinians to their land and self-determination, as well as dialogue. We should help all those who are involved in this peace process and believe in it. From my talks here I have gathered that things will of course be difficult, but there is no other way. This [peace process] is irreversible and we have to go forward. [end recording]
