Only Ecological Crisis Is More Acute Than Economic Crisis"] [Text] "The economic crisis cannot distract society from resolving the highly acute problems of environmental protection," Prof. Mikhail Lemeshev, chairman of the Committee for Ecology, said at a 16 March news conference in the State Duma. As far as the general situation in the country is concerned these issues are not so much the concern of future generations as a matter of life and death for the current generation. In his opinion, the solution to the crisis is to ecologize the economy. Some 18 draft laws will be submitted to the Duma for consideration in the near future, these laws' task being to put the national economy back on the rails of stable development. Prof. Lemeshev described five of them as priorities. Among them the Law "On Production and Consumption Waste Products," which is to safeguard the country against highly toxic imported waste among other things. This question is causing public concern owing to the furor in connection with the 18 freightcars of toxins from France, the Netherlands, and Israel that have unexpectedly shown up in Orenburg Oblast and pose a real threat to the population's health. Nikolay Astafyev, chairman of the Committee for Natural Resources and the Use of Nature, spoke of the need for urgent addenda to the Russian Federation Law "On Mineral Resources" since many kinds of minerals will be totally depleted over the next year if their plunderous extraction is not stopped. The same can be said of biological resources: wild animals, whole populations of which are being wiped out for their valuable antlers or pelts. Prof. Lemeshev is hoping for constructive cooperation with the government since, according to him, the Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources and the Duma's nature conservation committees espouse similar positions on key issues.
