"It's timely to advance into the inland now," said Xu, speaking to Japanese business executives at a KYODO NEWS SERVICE-sponsored lecture session at a Tokyo hotel. He said China's vast southwestern areas have rich natural resources and a low-cost labor force. "The inland areas have weak points in transportation and infrastructure...but Japan is good at these fields and thus has a lot it can do there," Xu said. He said the Chinese Government has also increased its infrastructure investment in inland areas. Xu also said China will continue efforts to bring a "peaceful and amicable" solution to problems related to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development, saying such efforts so far have helped. However, he asked international society not to expect too much of Beijing, adding China is not among the parties directly concerned with the matter.
