FR941104-0-00002 FR941104-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;26; Amendment 39&hyph;9062; AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;12] Airworthiness Directives; Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F Series Propellers AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal spline (BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo BIS assemblies. This amendment increases the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. This amendment is prompted by the availability of improved hardware that restricts quill motion and enhances the lubrication of the BIS and significantly reduces BIS wear. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent inability to control the propeller blade angle due to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS assembly. DATES: Effective December 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Hamilton Standard, One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096&hyph;1010. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Walsh, Aerospace Engineer, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7158, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;8659 (58 FR 44441, August 23, 1993), which is applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, was published in the Federal Register on May 27, 1994 (59 FR 27510). That action proposed to increase the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. Seven commenters concur with the rule as proposed. One commenter concurs with the proposal to extend the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours TIS, but also states that paragraph (a)(5) of the NPRM requires inspection at 1,500 hours TIS if a damper is installed, but previously ``new'' PCU's were not required to be inspected until 1,800 hours TIS since new. The commenter further states that this interval is not consistent since it is a decrease of 300 hours with the improved hardware, and recommends the interval to be extended to 1,800 hours TIS for new PCU's. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter also recommends the following changes to Appendix 1 of the NPRM: The commenter states that the date of the damper installation should not be required since those receiving a ``new'' PCU or one from a repair station where the damper was installed may not have access to the actual installation date. What should be required is an answer to the question, ``Damper installed?'' (answer either ``Yes'' or ``No''), and if ``Yes'', and the indication of whether it was installed ``at this inspection'' or ``previously.'' The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter states that the requirement to list the aircraft model is not required provided the PCU part number is complete with the dash or ``A'' number. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter states that blanks are not needed for the items ``Estimated Time on PCU'' and ``Actual Time on PCU.'' What is needed is an indication as to which one of those statements applies to the following: ``Time Since New (hours)'' and ``Time Since Last Ballscrew Inspection/Repair (hours).'' The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter states that there is no requirement to indicate (a reminder to complete) completion of the ``pull check'' of the PCU quill after it is reinstalled. The FAA concurs and has added this item to Appendix 1 of this final rule.
