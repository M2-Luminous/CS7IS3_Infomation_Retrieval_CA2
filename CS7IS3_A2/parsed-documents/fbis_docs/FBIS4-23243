The agreement, signed in Algiers between the Malian Government and the Tuareg Azaouad movement, called for the dismantling of rebel military bases and allowed for the integration of former Tuareg rebels into the Malian Army and civil service. But the armed attacks, often blamed on bandits, have continued, and now President Alpha Konare has ordered a security crackdown as Mustapha Sana reports in this telex from Bamako: Speaking to representatives of political parties, trade unions, and associations at a meeting at the presidential palace, the head of state said he gave orders to restrict the entry and circulation of weapons in the country. President Konare said that measures will be taken with the cooperation of neighboring countries to stem the traffic in arms across the borders of Mali. The president also spoke of the northern movement, (Ganda Koi), which opposes the agreement with the Tuaregs, and which recently made an appeal to Malians to fight the Tuaregs. He said he understood the exasperation of the sedentary northern population from which (Ganda Koi) draws its support but he stressed that he refused any management of the peace accord on an ethnic basis. Speaking of insecurity in the north, President Konare said it was a difficult situation but not a desperate one. He said he would not tolerate the continuation of that state of affairs because it prevented the presence of the civil service in northern Mali and has also impeded development activities.
