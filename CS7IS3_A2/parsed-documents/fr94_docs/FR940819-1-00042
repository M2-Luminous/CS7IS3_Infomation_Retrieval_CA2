Form FRA F 6180.55_``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'': Limited Changes The ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) is used by the industry to summarize a railroad's accidents/incidents for a given month. This report must be filed with FRA even when no accidents/incidents occurred during the reporting month. 49 CFR 225.21(b). FRA proposes to make limited changes to this form. The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55 is set forth in Appendix 7 to this NPRM. Appendix 8, the currently used ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary,'' is provided for comparison purposes. a. Classifications of persons. The FRA Guide currently classifies persons as: (i) ``Employees on Duty'' (Class A), (ii) ``Employees Not on Duty'' (Class B), (iii) ``Passengers on Trains'' (Class C), (iv) ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D), (v) ``Trespassers'' (Class E), and (vi) ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). These ``person'' classifications are used by the reporting railroad for completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) and the ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55(a)). FRA proposes the addition of ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G) and ``Volunteer'' (Class H) to the classes of persons and to replace the terms ``Employee on Duty'' and ``Employee Not on Duty'' with ``Worker on Duty'' and ``Worker Not on Duty,'' respectively. Additionally, the definition of a ``Worker on Duty'' would be expanded to include individuals (including certain contractor employees and volunteers) who perform either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive activity for the reporting railroad. 1. New classification: ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G) Persons, other than railroad employees, passengers, trespassers or contractor employees, who are injured while on or adjacent to railroad property are currently coded as ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D) on Form FRA F 6180.55a. For reporting purposes, FRA would like to distinguish between Non-Trespassers injured while on railroad property and Non-Trespassers injured while off railroad property. FRA thus proposes to add a new classification of person to cover those individuals (non-trespassers) who are injured while off railroad property. It should be noted that an injury ``off railroad property'' would include an injury resulting from an event, such as a derailment or collision, that begins on railroad property but ends on public or private non-railroad property, so long as the injury is incurred while the person is physically located off railroad property. Similarly, if a derailment results in a release of hazardous materials onto public or private non-railroad property and the hazardous material injures a ``Non-Trespasser'' located on public or private non-railroad property, the injury should be reported as an injury to a ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G). ``Non-Trespasser/On Railroad Property'' (Class D) would be used to report injuries and illnesses sustained by such non-trespassers while on railroad property.
