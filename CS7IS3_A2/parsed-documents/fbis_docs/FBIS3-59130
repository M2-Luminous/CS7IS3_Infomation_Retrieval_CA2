The Weser-Ems District Council in Oldenburg confirmed that two packets had been clearly identified. The contents of three other packets still had to be tested. Authorities estimate that around 130,000 packets of Apron Plus had been collected on the Dutch coast by yesterday evening. About 70,000 more packets are drifting eastward off the Dutch North Sea islands. They come from the French freighter the Sherbro. It lost 88 containers last December.
