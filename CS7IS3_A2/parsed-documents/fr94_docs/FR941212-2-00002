SUMMARY: The CBOT has submitted two proposed new rules and one proposed new regulation 1 pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'').

Acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Division of Trading and Markets has determined to publish the CBOT's proposal for public comment. The Division believes that publication of the CBOT's proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons.

Description of Proposed Rules By letter dated August 8, 1994 (together with submitted materials: the ``Submission'' or ``Proposal''), the CBOT submitted proposed new Rules 424.00 and 480.14 and new Regulation 424.01 pursuant to Commission Regulation 1.41(c). The Division advised the CBOT that it will consider the Submission under Regulation 1.41(b) and the CBOT did not object thereto. The proposed new provisions were revised and resubmitted October 12, 1994. The CBOT represents that the objective of the Proposal is ``to make possible a regulatory framework in which active solicitation of retail business by Member Firms can be made practicable_thereby fostered_by ensuring adequate customer protection while also clarifying Member Firms' compliance obligations.'' The CBOT represents that the proposed rules and regulation have been designed specifically to permit Member Firms to offer certain managed accounts without securities registration under the Securities Act of 1933. 2 2 The CBOT represents that these accounts would meet all the conditions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission for investment vehicles to avoid the offeror being deemed to be engaged in the issuance of securities.
