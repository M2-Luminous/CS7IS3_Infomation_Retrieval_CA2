Matanzas consumes more than 2,000 megawatts per day. Sector officials report that the conservation program will reduce electrical output by about nine megawatts 1000-1100 GMT, 18 megawatts 1200-2100 GMT, and 45 megawatts 2200-0300 GMT. The report indicates that 1,458 megawatts -- 47 percent of the total generated amount possible -- is available from the nationwide electrical system. Currently in Cuba, six units are being repaired, eight remain broken down, and three are having water and fuel problems. This amounts to a deficit of 500 megawatts during the period of maximum demand.
