"I will be back (to work) on Monday and will not spare anyone," Prof. Berov said. He is planning to address parliament next week. The prime minister is still in hospital recovering after a quadruple bypass surgery in March and an infectious disease alarm on April 13. During his stay at the hospital the prime minister held consultations on an upcoming cabinet overhaul. Asked whether he expects a consensus on the cabinet changes, Prof. Berov said: "When a man has a goal, he will attain it." In the meantime it became known that Prof. Berov during consultations had told the New Union for the Democracy (NSD, set up by expellees or defectors of the Union of the Democratic Forces) he will approach parliament insisting that ministries of forestry and foreign economic relations be set up, the latter to be in charge of tourism as well; the Power Engineering Committee and the Committee of Geology and Mineral Resources be merged; and the Posts and Telecommunications Committee be transformed into an association. The prime minister also reportedly pledged to come up with a short- term plan of action on behalf of the cabinet. He further told the MP's of the NSD he will send a letter to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to ask for an April 27 parliamentary hearing on his ideas for cabinet changes. The former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) gave Prime Minister Berov a May 15 deadline to submit a new cabinet programme and a proposal for cabinet changes. The ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, too, declared themselves "pro" cabinet changes. They were the party on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet was formed in late 1992. Socialist floor leader Nora Ananieva on Tuesday told journalists the BSP was unhappy with a number of cabinet decisions taken during Prime Minister Berov' absence. "The Council of Ministers has not given up its normal work despite the difficult circumstances," Prof. Berov told the radio interviewer today. While speaking of cabinet changes, all political forces showed unambiguously they are preparing for early elections. The Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) openly calls for the cabinet's resignation and early elections this autumn. Bulgaria's two major labour organizations -- the Podkrepa Labour Confederation and the Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) -- also back the idea of early elections and level severe attacks against the cabinet. Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev on a number of occasions said the cabinet has completely exhausted its capacity and is most likely to fall by the end of May. A week ago the KNSB called a rally under anti-cabinet slogans in Sofia. It scheduled a token strike for May 4 and a nationwide strike for mid- May. KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov said he will go to the negotiating table with the cabinet only if Prime Minister Berov personally guarantees that KNSB's demands, mostly social ones, will be met. According to KNSB Deputy Chairman Ivan Neykov, however, "it is not a matter of changing the cabinet but the approaches and methods applied by the executive."
