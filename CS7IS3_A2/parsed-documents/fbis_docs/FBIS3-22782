Technical and economic aspects of this unusual method of conversion of military facilities to civilian uses were discussed by representatives of the territorial administration, the Pacific Fleet and scientific circles at a conference here on Tuesday. Experts believe that the quality of Russian technologies with a guaranteed maintenance system will ensure complete radiational and ecological safety for the population. The use of the energy potential of one submarine can meet the needs in heating and electricity of no less than 50 houses with many apartments.
