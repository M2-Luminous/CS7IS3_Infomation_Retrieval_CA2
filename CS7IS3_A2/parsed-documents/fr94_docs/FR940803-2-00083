FR940803-2-00083 FR940803-2-00065 Integrity of the Civil Penalty Process. Though the $5,000 civil penalty assessed is not insignificant, especially when imposed on an individual respondent, in this case there was no basis in the record to do other than affirm the law judge's decision. Procedural rules must be enforced in a non-arbitrary manner to ensure the integrity of the civil penalty process, even where this results in severe consequences. In the Matter of Ezekuiel G. Perez Order No. 94&hyph;23 (6/27/94) Appeal Brief Construed. Letter Respondent sent to the administrative law judge after dismissal of Respondent's case for failure to file an answer, was construed by the Administrator as a timely notice of appeal and an appeal brief. In his letter, which was timely filed, Respondent alleged that he had filed an answer but had only sent it to agency counsel. Complainant was given 35 days to file a reply brief. In the Matter of Todd M. Page Order No. 94&hyph;24 (6/29/94) Appeal Dismissed. Respondent failed to perfect his appeal by filing an appeal brief, and has failed to show good cause for this failure. Respondent's appeal is dismissed. Commercial Reporting Services of the Administrator's Civil Penalty Decisions and Orders In June 1991, as a public service, the FAA began releasing to commercial publishers the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases. The goal was to make these decisions and orders more accessible to the public. The Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are now available in the following commercial publications. AvLex, published by Aviation Daily, 1156 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 822&hyph;4669; Civil Penalty Cases Digest Service, published by Hawkins Publishing Company, Inc., P.O.

Finally, the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are available on the following computer databases: Compuserve; Fedix; and GENIE. The FAA has stated previously that publication of the subject-matter index and the digests may be discontinued once a commercial reporting service publishes similar information in a timely accurate manner. No decision has been made yet on this matter, and for the time being, the FAA will continue to prepare and publish the subject-matter index and digests.
