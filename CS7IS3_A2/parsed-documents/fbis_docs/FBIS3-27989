Laos and Thailand have maintained close and brotherly relations since ancient times. The peoples of the two countries have maintained close contact and have constantly exchanged cultural and artistic visits. Particularly in linguistic and cultural exchanges, the peoples of the two countries are able to speak to each other in their own languages and with a profound understanding. Far from being weak, our relations are always strengthening -- especially in the economic field, where a great deal of trade has been conducted between our two countries. The Lao-Thai Mekong Friendship Bridge will officially open in the near future, greatly facilitating mutual contacts and visits between the brotherly Lao and Thai peoples. I firmly believe that once the Friendship Bridge opens, our two peoples will gradually increase their trade contacts and visits with each other. I hope I will have the opportunity to use this bridge to lead another Thai parliamentary delegation to Laos. The purpose of our current visit to Laos is to bring the Thai people's best wishes to our Lao brothers and further strengthen relations between our two countries' legislative institutions. On this occasion, I would like to invite Your Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket to lead a Lao National Assembly delegation on an official visit to Thailand at your convenience as guests of the Thai Parliament, so that we can exchange further views and develop mutual understanding. In addition, I would like to stress that if Your Excellency and the distinguished members of the Lao National Assembly require any cooperation from our delegation or from the Thai Parliament for the sake of mutual benefit and close relations between our two peoples, feel free to inform our delegation of your request. I assure your that my party and I will do our best to fulfill your wishes. At this time, I would like to invite Your Excellencies to toast the health of His Excellency Lao President Nouhak Phoumsavan, His Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket, and everyone at this banquet. May the good relations between our two countries last forever. [applause]
