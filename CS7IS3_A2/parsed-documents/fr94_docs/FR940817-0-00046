ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements changes to Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) procedures that relate to carrying firearms, expanding the arrest and service of process authority of immigration officers beyond matters involving violations of the immigration laws, and requiring that every alien fourteen years of age or older, against whom deportation proceedings are commenced, shall be fingerprinted and photographed and that such fingerprints and photographs shall be made available to other law enforcement agencies upon request. This rule also codifies existing policy guidelines regarding the authority of immigration officers under the direction and control of the Attorney General to arrest persons, carry firearms, serve process, and perform other related enforcement functions. The final rule affairs both existing and newly-developed policies and ensures the consistent application of these policies by all immigration officers involved in the enforcement of the immigration laws.

Sheehan, Special Assistant, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Room 7246, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;3032. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 14, 1992, at 57 FR 47011&hyph;47020, the Attorney General published a proposed rule to implement section 503 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law No. 101&hyph;649 (8 U.S.C. 1357), and requested comments from interested parties by November 30, 1992. Section 503(a) of IMMACT amended section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act). Section 503(a) authorizes immigration officers, when performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws and when authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to arrest without a warrant any person likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained, for any offense against the United States committed in the officer's presence or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony. Section 503(a) of IMMACT also authorizes immigration officers, under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to carry firearms and to execute and serve any orders, warrants, subpoenas, summonses, or other process issued under the authority of the United States. Section 503(b) of IMMACT requires fingerprinting and photographing of any alien fourteen years of age or older against whom deportation proceedings have been commenced under section 242 of the Act, and dictates that such fingerprints be made available to law enforcement agencies upon request. Finally, section 503(a) of IMMACT requires, as a condition of immigration officers' authority to make warrantless arrests under amended section 287(a)(5)(B) for felonies, the Attorney General to publish final regulations that define the categories of immigration officers who may use force, including deadly force, and the circumstances under which such force may be used; establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the Service; require that no immigration officer be authorized to make arrests under section 287(a)(5)(B) of the Act unless that officer has been certified as having completed a training program covering such arrests and standards and establish an expedited internal review process for violations of such standards.
