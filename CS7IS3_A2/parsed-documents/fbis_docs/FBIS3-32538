The meeting has become important after the failure of the fifth round of negotiations between the two countries, which ended at dawn on 5 February in Washington. It will be the last chance to prevent a new clash with the United States on a subject that has been affecting relations between the two countries for a decade and that made the Americans impose trade sanctions against Brazil in 1988. Like the first time, the latest action was spurred by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which claims it is losing millions of dollars from the illegal copying of their formulas by Brazilian laboratories. Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, who returned to Brazil last week to attend the marriage of his son Joao Pedro, will arrive in Brasilia today to hold separate meetings with the ministers involved in the subject and he also will attend the meeting they will all hold together, scheduled in principle for 9 February. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will personally tell Washington the final Brazilian answer after Carnival. The road to a negotiated solution is narrow but not closed, according to U.S. sources familiar with the negotiations. There are nearly two dozen points on which the two parties maintain different positions. Four of them are considered critical for Washington. Of these, "two must be resolved if the Brazilian Government wants to avoid retaliation," a source said. Two of the points refer to the clauses about "local exploitation" of patents and "parallel importation" of patented products described in Articles 27 and 28, respectively, of the text on protection of intellectual property (Tripps) [preceding word in English; expansion unknown] approved by the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, which Brazil signed last December in Geneva. The Americans allege that the draft bill of the new Industrial Property Code, which already has been approved by the Chamber of Deputies and has been standing idle for months in the Senate, contradicts Tripps [preceding word in English] on those two points. The Brazilian draft bill requires that the patent be exploited in Brazil in order to be valid in the country. Beside that, it authorizes the importation of products patented by third parties and that manufacture them under license of the patent's owner. Washington estimated that once the Uruguay Round concluded, the Brazilian executive branch would immediately act to adapt Brazilian law to the international treaty it signed in the Uruguay Round. "Brazil never failed to observe through its laws the obligations it assumed in international treaties," states an American source. But Itamaraty, which commands the negotiations, argued that Articles 27 and 28 of Tripps [preceding word in English] "are ambiguous" and has decided there is no incompatibility between the articles and the draft bill in Congress. There clearly is concern over the industrial policy in President Franco's position, which is shared by the Ministries of Science and Technology and Industry and Commerce but not by the Finance Ministry. "The demand to locally exploit patents is important to create jobs in the country," a diplomat who participates in the negotiations told O ESTADO. "Brazil is totally isolated in its interpretation of Tripps," American sources say. "If the Brazilian Government does not comply with what it signed in the GATT, there will be sanctions."
