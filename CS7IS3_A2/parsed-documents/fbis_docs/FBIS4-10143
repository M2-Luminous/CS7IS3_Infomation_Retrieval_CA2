Here is journalist Diosdado Maso with further details on the 1 May celebrations: [Begin Maso recording] Ross explained that the reason the marches of the militant Cuban people are not being held in both the capital and municipalities is the economic situation the country is going through. How can we hold ceremonies when there are workplaces and sugar mills that need the labor force and the resources we might use in holding such ceremonies? Ross gave the construction of the two grandstands at the national ceremony held every year in Revolution Square as an example. He said just one of these grandstands uses up more than seven cubic meters of wood, without counting the nails, the fuel, the fabric -- in short, great expense. Concerning the political justification for not holding the march of the militant Cuban people here in the capital, Ross said that holding the special session of the National Assembly, where the suggestions made by the workers during the Parliaments in the Workplace were discussed, is the best acknowledgement of the Cuban trade-union movement by its government and its people.
