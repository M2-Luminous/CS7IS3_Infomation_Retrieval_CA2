At a meeting in Riga Thursday the Latvian Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting decided to notify Ostankino that if by April 4 the debt for the 1st quarter is not repaid to Latvia, it will immediately consider cutting off the transmission of Ostankino TV programs on its territory. So far, Ostankino has paid to the Latvian Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting only one third of the agreed amount. Chairman of the Council Zigmunds Skujins said at the meeting that it is impossible to meet the demand of the second major faction of the Latvian parliament, the Movement for National Independence of Latvia, that the transmission of some Ostankino programs be stopped for political reasons.
