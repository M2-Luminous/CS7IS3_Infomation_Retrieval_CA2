The Israeli version says that an Israeli settler opened fire on a group of worshipers at the Tomb of the Prophet Abraham, killing 13 and wounding many others. [passage omitted] The PLO gives a different casualty toll for the massacre. PLO Information Head Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has told our radio that more than one settler carried out the attack. [passage omitted] [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The crime that took place at dawn today, and which was carried out by groups of settlers against the sons of the Palestinian people and the worshipers in the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque, martyred more than 30 Palestinians and wounded 150 others. The crime took place under the eyes, ears, and supervision of the Israeli occupation army. The Rabin government and the occupation army are completely responsible for this crime. No peace can be achieved on Palestinian land as long as a single settler remains on it. These are criminal gangs, and they are one of the tools of occupation, and they must leave Palestinian land with the end of the occupation. The PLO views this crime as a very grave turning point. Complete protection for our people should be guaranteed. Such protection can never be provided by this occupation, and by the army of occupation -- one of the tools of killings as we have seen over the past two days in Abu-Dis and al-Ram. Therefore, to have an international presence to guarantee protection for our people is inevitable. The command will adopt several measures in the next few hours to ensure real security in light of these crimes and the serious threats our people experience.[end recording]
