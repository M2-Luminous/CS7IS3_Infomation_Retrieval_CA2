"He (Mr Zhu) feels very confident that what he's done, and some of the measures he's put in, are beginning to show signs of moving the overall economy in the right direction," said Mr Paul Cheng, who led a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce delegation to Beijing last week. Mr Cheng, the chamber's former chairman, said that, in a 90- minute meeting with Mr Zhu, the Chinese vice-premier revealed some key numbers which "provided some confidence to our delegation that things are basically under control". Mr Zhu said: -- The amount of money issued, which doubled a year ago, was down to 20 percent year-on-year. -- The rate of heavy construction investment was down to 30 percent from 70 percent a year ago. -- The yuan had been maintained at a stable level of 8.7 to the US dollar over the last few months. -- The profitability of the state sector increased 40 percent in the first four months, although growth rose only five per cent. -- Foreign reserves were up to US$30 billion, from $21.1 billion in January. Mr Cheng said Mr Zhu was optimistic that he could bring both the country's annual economic growth and inflation to 10 percent, although the former chamber leader forecast higher inflation. "(Mr Zhu) He maintains that inflation and gross national product growth will both be 10 percent. He thinks he can still do it, although my own view is that inflation will probably be higher," he said. Asked if he detected a hard-sell approach by Mr Zhu, Mr Cheng said: "I didn't detect any overselling on his part. He was just stating the facts to us." China's economy expanded by 13.4 per cent last year, while inflation reached 14.7 percent on a national level and 19.6 percent in the major cities. Such unsustainable rates have prompted calls by foreign economists to rein in the runaway economy before serious structural and social problems set in. Last month, for example, World Bank managing director Ernest Stern urged Beijing to manage the overheating economy and inflation if it wanted economic growth to continue. In slowing economic growth to nine percent and inflation to 10 percent, China has, among other things, clamped down on new fixed-asset investments -- except for state-approved projects -- issued bonds to finance the budget deficit and tightened lending to state enterprises. Mr Zhu suggested that through the media, foreigners had overstated the seriousness of China's economic overheating. Mr Cheng said: "He was not denying that the economy was overheated to some degree, but he said you need to understand why the economy arrived at that stage." Mr Zhu produced figures which Mr Cheng said he had never seen put together before. The vice-premier said one reason for the overheating was colossal infrastructure investment, and that no country in the world had devoted the sort of attention to capital construction that China did last year. He said that last year alone, the country installed almost 2,000 miles of railways and highways, 15 million telephone lines and 15 million kilowatts of power generation capacity. "No country ever in its history has pumped all these activities in one year. Naturally, you could create a sort of ballooning effect," Mr Cheng quoted the Chinese leader as saying. Mr Zhu said another cause of inflation had been the increase in farm produce prices to shore up the agriculture sector in an effort to check the shift of the farming population to coastal areas in search of better jobs. Mr Cheng said: "They have to raise farm produce prices to keep the incentive for farmers to stay and continue to shore up that side of the economy. And, by raising the prices, you're bound to fuel inflation." The vice-premier said he would wait for reforms in place to filter through before considering additional measures to preen the economy. In spite of the inevitable provincial resistance to the tax reforms implemented in January, 22 percent extra had been collected in tax revenue in the first four months of the year, compared with the same period last year. Mr Zhu added that the state sector's share of the economy had fallen to 48 percent, and that half of those losing money were small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Cheng said: "What he's trying to say is that the major organisations are doing okay, but a lot of the small and medium ones are not doing so well. "And when he puts in his reform measures, naturally, the impact will be heavier on the small and medium enterprises.
