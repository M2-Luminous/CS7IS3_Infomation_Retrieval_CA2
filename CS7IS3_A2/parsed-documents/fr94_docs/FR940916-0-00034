FR940916-0-00034 FR940916-0-00014 EPA Evaluation and Action In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). Rule 442 controls emissions from a source category for which EPA has not developed a CTG. This rule was evaluated against the general RACT requirements of the CAA (section 110 and Part D, 40 CFR Part 51), ``Issues relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations_Clarifications to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register '' May 25, 1988 (EPA's Blue Book), and other EPA policies including the EPA Region IX/CARB document entitled: ``Guidance Document for Correcting VOC Rule Deficiencies'', April 1991. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. The CTG applicable to Rule 443 is entitled ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing Equipment'', EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;83&hyph;006; the CTGs applicable to Rule 446 are entitled ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Storage of Petroleum Liquids in Fixed-Roof Tanks'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;036 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Petroleum Liquid Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;047; the CTGs applicable to Rule 447 are entitled ``Control of Hydrocarbons from Tank Truck Gasoline Loading Terminals'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;026 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;035; and the CTG applicable to Rule 452 is entitled ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Stationary Sources_Volume II: Surface Coating of Cans, Coils, Paper, Fabrics, Automobiles, and Light-Duty Trucks'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;008. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
