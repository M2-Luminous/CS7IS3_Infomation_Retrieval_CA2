Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA] ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup attempt. [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so, I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] that South Africa will not recognize any other government in Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was democratically elected in April 1993. [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing coup? [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will receive no support whatsoever from the outside world. [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who in the army might have been behind yesterday's events? [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane Barracks. [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two factions, pro and anti-government? [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me, as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the RLDF at the moment. [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of clashes as happened earlier in the year? [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism. [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal? [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult to describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went, more or less, on with his daily life.
