It was truly the speech of a people's president, reflecting his concern first and foremost for the ordinary people of this land. In particular it will be greeted with enormous enthusiasm by working people. The speech placed the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] firmly on the agenda as the cornerstone of government policy over the next five years. COSATU pledges its wholehearted support and undivided energy in ensuring the success of this programme, and believes that the overwhelming majority of South Africans want it to succeed. Indeed it was extremely encouraging to hear that the entire cabinet of national unity have come out in support of the RDP. COSATU was also encouraged by the president's undertaking to immediately put in place certain short-term measures which will within the year begin to make an impact on the lives of working people. These include the implementation of public works programmes, the building of houses and infrastructure, health programmes, training and education, and reorganisation of the public service. The emphasis on job creation, together with the fight against inflation and consumer protection will be welcomed by working people who have been economically battered for so many years. COSATU welcomes the undertaking to bring South Africa in line with international standards, particularly in relation to reforming and harmonising our labour legislation. The president's speech also encouraged the development of strong organisations of civil society, both at trade union and community level. His comments on the economy and financing the RDP were imbued with a vision of economic development which serves people. It is clear that the government of national unity aims to reorient priorities, and allocation of resources, to primarily address the need to attack poverty, and ensure sustainable economic development. We are hopeful that President Mandela's comments on unleashing the economic potential of all our countries people will help to lay the basis for a new relationship between employers and workers. The spirit of his comments are that democratisation of the economy are as important as political democratisation. This approach can only help to reinforce the need for more effective worker participation in decisions on issues affecting their daily lives.
