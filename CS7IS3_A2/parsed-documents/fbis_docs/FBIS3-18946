That is what Saxony Interior Minister Eggert, Christian Democratic Union, said in Dresden on Tuesday [8 March] when he presented the Office for the Protection of the Constitution report for 1993. According to the report, functionaries and members of the National Offensive and German Alternative in the meantime have become members of the DVU and the NPD. The former functionaries of extreme right-wing parties also have established links with new circles. An employee of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution reported on a meeting in Dresden attended by NPD members and neo-Nazis after which Republikaner leaflets were distributed. The number of criminal offenses of an extremist right-wing nature fell by 60 percent compared to 1992, said Eggert. A total of 84 crimes of violence and 389 other offenses, mainly the painting of swastikas, were registered. They were usually "spontaneous actions," mainly involving skinheads who were not members of extremist right-wing organizations. As Eggert said, there are 3,400 right-wing extremists in Saxony, of whom 900 are considered militant. Approximately 300 people belong to neo-Nazi organizations. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution noted that among the Republikaner, who have 700 members in Saxony, there are "indications of efforts directed against the basic liberal democratic order." Leaflets show "that the political ideas of the party in Saxony are based not on a democratic but on a nationalist ideology." The DVU is reported to have 1,500 members in Saxony, but is "still not very active" as far as public events are concerned. The NPD has approximately 250 members. The organizational development of these parties has still not been completed, but one can expect them to participate in this year's elections, said Eggert. Last year, 57 crimes of violence were committed by left-wing extremists. The militant left-wing extremist "scene" in Saxony consists of about 500 people. Compared to extremist left-wing circles in western Germany, the "scene" has developed ideas of its own. There is little support for "internationalism" or imprisoned members of the Red Army Faction. Extremist positions are held on such issues as unemployment, "west German colonization of the east," and coming to terms with the Stasi past. The DKP [German Communist Party] and the KPD [Communist Party of Germany] have not been able to develop any organizations in Saxony so far. On the other hand, the extremist left-wing Communist Platform (KPF) is trying to increase its influence within the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Eggert does not believe that the activities of the KPF faction within the PDS justify having the entire party monitored by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
