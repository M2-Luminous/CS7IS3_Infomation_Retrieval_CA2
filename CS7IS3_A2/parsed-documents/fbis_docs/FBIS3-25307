Trainees reportedly lack even basic discipline, and have been repeatedly drunk. They do not obey commands of superior officers, which in any real military or police force would constitute a serious offence. Instructors have even been assaulted. Hundreds of trainees have been observed toyi-toying [protest dancing] around the camp, chanting "one settler, one bullet." Intimidation of some trainees by others has been such that other trainees, in fear of their lives, have been sleeping out in the bush. According to one report in a Sunday newspaper members of the supposed peacekeeping force demanded one dead SAP [South African Police] member and one dead SADF [South African Defense Force] member by sunrise. Large numbers of trainees attached to the police forces of the homelands as well as the SAP have simply felt in disgust. If reports are true, then those trainees who are seemingly incapable of behaving like real soldiers are members of MK [Spear of the Nation; African National Congress military wing]. The purported reason for the National Peacekeeping Force is that the SAP is incapable of impartially policing black townships. A new, more credible force is needed, so they say. This is not true. But what is quite obvious though is that a large number of the NPKF trainees should never be allowed anywhere near a uniform or a weapon. If members of MK at the camp are unable to prevent themselves from intimidating and threatening their fellow trainees, is it not likely that they will do much worse to members of the public in the townships? That goes without saying. The whole idea that MK can impartially maintain law and order in the townships, whether part of a national peacekeeping force or not, is absurd. This is particularly so given that the NPKF is supposedly intended as a kind of "fire brigade" which could be deployed quickly to stabilize volatile areas of political conflict in which the ANC is usually a role player. In fact the debacle outside Bloemfontein tends to contradict claims by the ANC, that MK and its associated "self-defence units" are involved in impartial protection of township residents. That is, quite frankly, nonsense. What is most disturbing about the behaviour of the riff-raff in training for the peacekeeping force is that these are supposed to be the best MK could offer. They are supposed to be the elite. No wonder the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche laughs when Nelson Mandela threatens violence against the rightwing. Terreblanche's pot-bellied commandos were previously considered something of a military joke. It is now clear however that in a match against MK it would be an unfair fight. Let us strip away some myths about the liberation struggle. If the propaganda is to be believed then MK was supposed to be fighting for freedom against the apartheid regime. But how many enemy soldiers did MK kill? Very few. More important for MK was murdering black people who happened to belong to organisations outside of the ANC camp. This is what MK and the SDU's [Self-Defense Units] continue to do. In September last year the Minister of Law and Order stated that an incredible 3,258 MK members had been arrested for crimes of violence during the last 12 month period for which statistics were available. ANC leaders, who incidentally were never soldiers, like to now appear before crowds in crisp, brand new camouflage uniforms imported from Cuba. MK is presented as a glorious army, and no doubt this generates much support in certain quarters. But it is in fact wrong to compare MK to any conventional military force. More accurate in fact to compare MK to an organisation like the government's sinister CCB, the Civil Cooperation Bureau. But, by all accounts, the Government's death squads were more disciplined. Like the Government's former death squads, MK's style is shooting a man in his home. Or throwing a hand grenade at unarmed people waiting at a bus stop. The vast majority of victims could never be described as enemy combatants, not in any kind of military conflict. Because of this, in spite of being militarily ineffective MK nevertheless managed to kill a large number of people. If MK had been a real military force there would be fewer objections to its integration into reconstructed security forces. What is clear now, more than ever before, is not only that MK members lack the discipline a security force requires. They are also clearly incapable of peacekeeping without prejudice.
