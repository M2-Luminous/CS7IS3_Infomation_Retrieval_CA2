The state of internal disturbance was decreed at that time because the arraignment deadline for suspected criminals was about to expire. Different political sectors welcomed the exceptional measure, which was expected to last only 10 days, although they asked for reforms in the judicial codes so the government would not have to resort to this mechanism to prevent the release of accused criminals. Although it lifted the state of internal disturbance, the government extended for another 90 days the judicial emergency decreed under the exceptional measure for the purpose of extending the deadline to allow prosecutors to gather evidence against the defendants or to arraign them. The lawyers for the 840 defendants affected by the measure criticized the government, noting that if the Prosecutor General's Office was unable to prove the guilt of their clients in the time allotted, their continued detention was a "violation of their human rights." The extension of the processing deadline only affects those charged with terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping -- offenses that fall within the jurisdiction of "faceless" judges. The proceedings for individuals charged with other kinds of offenses are continuing along their normal course. The state of internal disturbance is included in the 1991 Constitution, and, so far, it has been enforced three times -- twice to prevent massive prison releases and once to cope with a violent terrorist offensive by communist guerrilla groups and drug trafficking mafias.
