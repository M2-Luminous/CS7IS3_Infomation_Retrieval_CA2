"I look forward to visiting Taiwan to see for myself the general situation there, but so far I have not received any invitation from Taiwan," Vo said after attending the opening session of the 27th annual meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC). Many Taiwan officials and business leaders, including Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Chairman Ting Shan-li of the Kuomintang-owned Central Trade and Investment Co., have met with Vo in Vietnam during the past year. A number of Vietnamese officials, including the head of its Prime Minister's Office, have also visited Taiwan in recent years. Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive relations between Taiwan and Vietnam have grown steadily since the late 1980s. Taiwan is now Vietnam's largest source of foreign capital, with an aggregate direct investment of about U.S.$1.6 billion. Vo said he hopes Taipei-Hanoi economic cooperation can be further strengthened. Vo arrived in Kuala Lumpur Sunday to attend the opening ceremony of the May 21-25 annual meeting of the PBEC, a non-governmental forum for bankers and business leaders from Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge cooperative ties.
