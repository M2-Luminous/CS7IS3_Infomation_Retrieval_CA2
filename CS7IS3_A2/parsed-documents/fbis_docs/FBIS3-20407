A CSCE statement published here urged Belgrade to permit it to carry out "long-term" missions, banned by rump Yugoslavia last year. The CSCE mentioned arbitrary arrests and detentions, police brutality and attempts to create ethnically cleansed zones in the rump federation of Serbia and Montenegro. In July, Belgrade banned long-term CSCE missions to Sandzak, the majority Albanian province Kosovo and the province of Vojvodina, where there is a substantial population of ethnic Hungarians. The missions' aim was to check minority rights were being respected and help prevent an extension of the war in ex-Yugoslavia.
