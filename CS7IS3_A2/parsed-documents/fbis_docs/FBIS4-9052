The daily REPUBLIKA reported today that Premier Meciar had decided to withdraw from the customs union agreement right at the time he was recalled by parliament. Ducky, who was also chairman of the Slovak Customs Office, said in the CTK interview that his recalculation of last year's custom's payments according to GATT regulations revealed that "Slovakia lost roughly 400 million crowns (about 12 million USD)" through the customs union. But while Ducky does not think the loss of such a sum merits the cancellation of the customs union, he still sees the disadvantages of the current agreement outweighing its positive aspects. "Raw materials and semi-manufactured products flow from Slovakia to Bohemia, which everywhere in the world are subject to lower customs duties than are finished products, which come to Slovakia from the Czech Republic," said Ducky. Ducky also said that he had been a supporter of the customs act at the time of its inception, but that he had thought it would be adjusted eventually to satisfy both sides. "The time has come to think economically. If the customs union is not changed in basic ways, business circles will force its termination," emphasied the ex-minister. Ducky pointed to several instances when the "balance" of the agreement has been disturbed by the Czech Government's application of value added taxes.
