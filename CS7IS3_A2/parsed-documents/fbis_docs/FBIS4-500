Would you like to work in a "new South African" organisation with a non-racial, non-sexist recruitment policy, updated management systems, formal labour relations practices and specialist training which concentrates on developing human resources to the utmost? If so, you should join "one of the oldest professions in the world". In case you have the wrong idea, this is intelligence- gathering, according to a recruitment brochure of the National Intelligence Service [NIS]. Under the heading "It's time for the true facts about the National Intelligence Service," the glossy handout explains that the NIS regularly distributes "products" to 150 "clients", including the state president, state departments and interdepartmental committees. It says that because of the secrecy that surrounds it, the intelligence profession is beset by "the most misperceptions and ignorance." In fact it renders a service that cannot be obtained elsewhere, while its "systematic way of processing intelligence" ensures that "the NIS does not spread unconfirmed rumours". To reassure the tender of conscience, the NIS insists it is not above the law and that "extensive legislation dictates its activities", that it is "under no circumstances an instrument in the hands of a political party", that it has no executive powers, and that secrecy "does not imply a violation of human rights; it is however necessary to safeguard sensitive information". It insists that it does not use "poisoned umbrella tips", but adds that advanced technology is an "important aspect of the current intelligence world". According to the brochure, the NIS has a defensive counter- intelligence function which includes safeguarding information, VIPs, installations and equipment, "as well as neutralising foreign intelligence operations." It says brightly: "Although South Africa now has more friends than earlier, we are not so naive to believe that we only have friends." Most information is obtainable from the media or is collected openly, the brochure says. But it concedes "we do snoop...", explaining: "It is important to also obtain essential information in a clandestine manner, employing covert agents and technological capabilities." If you are interested you will need, in addition to the sterling qualities listed above, a tertiary education for most posts. You will also be subject to security clearances and psychometric tests. The brochure provides no address for applications.
