The Mambi reveille once again stirred the heart. It summoned the independence movement of 125 years ago today. It is a symbol of the unity of all Cubans around their Revolution and Fidel. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], stressed during the political and cultural ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of the Constitution, the heroism of those who in the midst of the struggle selflessly fashioned a republic with altruism, for a just fatherland and equality among men. [Begin Alarcon recording] When on May Day, the ANPP special session meets to examine the nation's main problems, it will be rendering homage to our heroic and devoted workers, but it will also be a tribute to those who founded the fatherland and held its first meeting here. The ANPP session, like the one in Guaimaro, will achieve a consensus of ideas for the struggle, and in the midst of the struggle; from it, we will emerge as in Guaimaro, with a renewed fighting spirit, with strengthened unity, with a will bolstered to wage today's battle with the energy, dedication, and dignity of the men of 1868.
