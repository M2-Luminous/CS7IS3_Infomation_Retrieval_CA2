FR940513-2-00085 FR940513-2-00039 AoA plans to fund approximately five (5) model volunteer service credit projects at a federal share of approximately $50,000 per year for a period of approximately 17 months. Projects should be designed as models for testing the effectiveness of innovative approaches to volunteerism through utilization of the service credit concept. Successful applicants must provide a detailed plan for the management and operation of the service credit demonstration, including documentation of approaches to be used in attracting public and/or private sector support for making the project self-sufficient after federal funding has ended. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994. 5.4‚ê£AoA Dissemination Projects Each year, AoA invests substantial Older Americans Act Title IV resources in grant and cooperative agreement projects to conduct research, demonstrations, and training to improve the quality and availability of services and programs that are vital to the well-being of at-risk older persons. Dissemination is a basic component of each of these projects. Every Title IV project is required to conduct appropriate dissemination of project results as part of its work plan. For the many projects which are essentially knowledge transfer activities (e.g., technical assistance, public/professional education), dissemination is the key component. Enhanced dissemination is still needed, however, to maximize the utility of Title IV projects. The urgency to improve the effectiveness and availability of services is especially pronounced as both fiscal constraints and the number of older Americans increase. The ultimate goal of this priority area is to maximize the utilization of Title IV project products and results that can directly benefit older Americans in need of services. Dissemination projects are expected to be especially energetic in their marketing of products and results. Projects are expected to utilize appropriate promotional, public relations, and media campaigns in order to insure that their outcomes receive the widest possible attention. Such campaigns should seek to educate consumers, providers (including the Aging Network), the private sector, and policy sector about their results and to promote use of their products. These efforts will be considered a key indicator of the scope of the impact of the proposed project. The AoA Dissemination Projects funded under this priority area are also expected to foster greater awareness of the challenges of an aging society and of the contributions, real and potential, that aging programs make in responding to those challenges. These awareness-building efforts may take several forms, including the development and dissemination of materials keyed to decision-making points on a particular aging issue and the use of appropriate communication mechanisms. Two types of project applications may be submitted for review and funding consideration under this priority area: A. Enhanced Dissemination of Product(s) of Significant Value A major purpose of this priority area is to support more extensive dissemination of Title IV products of significant value. In the course of performing their work, grantees sometimes develop especially valuable products which warrant dissemination beyond that originally contemplated or for which dissemination opportunities are found which were not envisioned earlier. Grantees who are convinced that such products are needed, and of demonstrated value to the aging network and/or others involved in improving the availability, effectiveness, and quality of aging services, may apply under this section for funding. (This opportunity applies to both current and former grantees whose projects were completed within two years of the publication of this announcement). Applicants may address the dissemination of either a single product or more than one product from a single project. In this context, the term ``product'' may include the ``Final Report'' as well as other project products such as manuals, handbooks, curricula, brochures, technical assistance materials, reports, audio-visual materials, etc. Applicants applying for enhanced dissemination projects must submit a copy of the product(s) to be disseminated along with each copy of their application. (For audio visual products, only a single copy of the product need to be submitted). This attachment is in addition to the page limit which applies to all applications; however, the application narrative itself may not exceed the limits described below in Part III. B. Syntheses of ``Cluster'' Projects Results and Products A second purpose of this priority area is to support the development and dissemination of syntheses of project products/results from earlier Title IV project ``clusters'' (e.g., projects funded under the same priority area of a previous AoA Discretionary Funds Program announcement). Projects in a cluster may vary widely in terms of approach, outcomes, and products, but all deal with the same subject matter or problem area. A synthesis of needed and useful products/results of these projects may well have synergistic value, and a multiplier effect, in generating knowledge and substantiating best practices which can be applied to the benefit of older Americans.
