As MOLDOVA PRES reports, Mr. Vasev reaffirmed President Yeltsin's position, who, as mediator, pronounces himself for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and for solving differences solely by political means. In turn, President Snegur assessed that the parliamentary elections and the sociological opinion poll `Consulting the People,' within the framework of which the majority of the population voted for the independence of the Republic of Moldova, constitute two essential preconditions for the recovery of the situation in the east of the Republic by granting that area a legal status implying a high degree of local administration. In this context, it was stressed that laws in the Republic of Moldova are in keeping with the norms of a genuine democracy, which envisage, first and foremost, the observance of human rights, regardless of nationality. During the dialogue, which was of a constructive nature, the two sides also noted that relations between the Republic of Moldova and Russia are developing fruitfully on the basis of good understanding, MOLDOVA PRES reports. The group of experts on behalf of the Republic of Moldova, who participated in the preparation of the documents for the meeting of the CIS state leaders, which is scheduled to be held on 18 April, will conclude its activity today. In an interview granted to the Moscow-based correspondent of Chisinau radio, Mr. Iacob Mogoreanu, permanent representative of the Republic of Moldova to the statutory bodies of the community, emphasized that the accord on free trade in the CIS economic area and the one on encouraging multinational production corporations, associations, joint ventures, and financial-credit organizations and institutions have been prepared for signing. The CIS experts have also concluded the initial stage of drafting a repayment system between the economic units in CIS member countries. Mr. Mogoreanu also specified that the proceedings on setting up an interstate economic committee have begun; this is a body that coordinates the economic activity, he said, without which it is impossible for a community to exist.
