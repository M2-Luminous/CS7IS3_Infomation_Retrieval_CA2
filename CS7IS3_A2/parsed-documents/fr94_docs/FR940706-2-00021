FR940706-2-00021 FR940706-2-00015 [CFDA No: 84.265] State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training; Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 Purpose of Program This program is designed to support projects for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel in program areas essential to the effective management of the unit's program of vocational rehabilitation services or in skill areas that will enable personnel to improve their ability to provide vocational rehabilitation services leading to employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training program responds to needs identified in the comprehensive system of personnel development in section 101(a)(7) of the Act. The program may include training designed (a) to address recruitment and retention of qualified rehabilitation professionals; (b) to provide for succession planning; (c) to provide for leadership development and capacity building; and (d) for fiscal year 1994, to provide training on the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. Eligible Applicants: Only State agencies designated under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services under section 101(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, are eligible to receive an award under this program. Deadline for Transmittal of Applications: August 8, 1994 Deadline for Intergovernmental Review: September 7, 1994 Applications Available: July 7, 1994 Available Funds: $5,944,350, of which $4,755,480 is available for allocation to designated agencies for basic awards and $1,188,870 is available for allocation to high quality applications. (Specific information regarding funds available to be allocated to designated State agencies for basic awards appears in the chart in this notice.) Estimated Range of Awards: $19,795_$300,680. Estimated Average Size of Awards: $73,387. Estimated Number of Awards: 81. Note: The Department is not bound by any estimate in this notice. Project Period: Up to 36 months. Applicable Regulations: (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, and 85; and (b) The regulations for this program in 34 CFR Part 388; and (c) §§385.4 and 385.40 through 385.46 of 34 CFR Part 385. Priorities Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) and proposed §385.22(a) the Secretary reserves funds to support some or all of the proposals that have been awarded a rating of 80 points or more under the criteria described in proposed §388.20. In making a final selection of proposals to support under this program, the Secretary considers the extent to which proposals have exceeded a rating of 80 points and address one or more of the following absolute priorities: (1) Development and Dissemination of Model In-Service Training Materials and Practices The proposed project demonstrates an effective plan to develop and disseminate information on its State Vocational Rehabilitation In-Service Training program, including the identification of training approaches and successful practices, in order to permit the replication of these programs by other State vocational rehabilitation units. (2) Distance Education The proposed project demonstrates innovative strategies for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel through distance education methods, such as interactive audio, video, computer technologies, or existing telecommunications networks. (3) Enhanced Employment Outcomes for Specific Populations The proposed project supports specialized training in the provision of vocational rehabilitation or related services to individuals with disabilities to increase the rehabilitation rate into competitive employment for all individuals or specified target groups. It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations. However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published in the Federal Register on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 24000), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30, 1994. The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking ended June 8, 1994. Sixteen parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is a summary of the changes that are expected to be made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, based on the public comment. Five commenters suggested deleting §388.21(a)(4), which provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters believe agencies in the territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should receive the same minimum share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal year as provided in §388.21(a)(3) to small agencies. The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds to be allocated based on the quality of the application as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department using the selection criteria in §388.20 and the priorities in §388.22. The Secretary expects to revise §388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that all grant recipients receive the same minimum share of the sums made available for the fiscal year. A revision of §388.30, deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, is also expected to be made in the final regulations. Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in §388.1. The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these terms, and the Secretary prefers not to define them, thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Three commenters addressed the requirement in §388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. The Secretary agrees that a comprehensive assessment is not needed annually. A revision of §388.20(a)(2)(iii), deleting the word ``annual,'' is expected to be made in the final regulations.
