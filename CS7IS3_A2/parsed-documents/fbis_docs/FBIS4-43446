It is a so-called blast plate that has been installed incorrectly. The task of the blast plate is to explode if the pressure in the reactor becomes too high. Because the plate was incorrectly installed, it would not have been of any use if there had been an accident. According to Alf Lindfors, head of the Forsmark station, it is a serious matter that the fault was not discovered earlier.
