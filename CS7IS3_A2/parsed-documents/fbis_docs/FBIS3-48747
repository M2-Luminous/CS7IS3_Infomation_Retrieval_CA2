The representative informed us of the Phnom Penh side's stance regarding his majesty the king's five-point initiative and the organization of a technical group. After learning of the telephone call's substance, on 23 January 1994 H.E. Khieu Samphan instructed the PDK representative in Phnom Penh to inform Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh -- through the latter's representative -- of his views as follows: 1. On behalf of the PDK, H.E. Khieu Samphan expresses his pleasure with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, who has -- on behalf of FUNCINPEC -- fully accepted His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point initiative and agreed that all points should be implemented simultaneously. There is also agreement on organizing a technical group, which does not need to have a name to hold discussions on the king's five-point initiative. This move represents a significant step. It will make the king's five-point initiative a success in accordance with his majesty's lofty desires and the deepest and most sacred aspirations of our entire people. 2. The PDK sincerely (?hopes) that H.E. Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] will (?join) FUNCINPEC and the PDK in supporting his majesty the king's five-point initiative and will accept the initiative as the groundwork for the technical group's talks, which will be held among Cambodians to achieve national reconciliation and unify all national forces without discarding any of the national forces. This will allow all national forces to unite around the king and the throne to resolve the serious national problems and the (?war) we are facing. It is worth emphasizing that the PDK neither demands nor rejects any person or party. The PDK wants to see all national forces -- FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP], the CPP, the PDK, and other national fores -- join hands to achieve genuine national reconciliation, unity, and peace. This is in line with the concrete situation, the king's sublime desire, and the deepest aspirations of our nation and people. The PDK firmly believes that our nation and people demand nothing more than this. They want the opportunity to resolve the economic problems and living conditions of their families and take part in rehabilitating and rebuilding the country [words indistinct]. 3. It is also worth noting that the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen have repeated only three points. Since 7 January 1994, H.E. Hun Sen's CPP has demanded that the PDK accept and implement these three points before discussing other issues. This constitutes an encroachment upon the PDK [words indistinct] the spirit of national reconciliation and national unification. (?It is hoped) that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will review this issue, accept the five-point political initiative, and send their representatives to participate in the technical group in keeping with the spirit jointly agreed upon by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Khieu Samphan. This will enhance the achievement of the king's five-point initiative. 4. Along with this, H.E. Khieu Samphan proposes that the technical group proceed immediately, composed only of FUNCINPEC and PDK representatives. When H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly state that they accept the five-point initiative, then CPP representatives can be included. It is worth mentioning that the BLDP has also declared its support for the king's five-point initiative.
