FR940627-2-00095 FR940627-2-00044 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Lodging a Consent Decree Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act In accordance with Departmental Policy and 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on June 21, 1994, a proposed consent decree in United States v. Roy L. Merritt, et al., Civil Action No. 94CV026, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. The first amended complaint filed by the United States seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties pursuant to Sections 1414(b) and 1431 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;3(b), and 300i, against Roy L. and Frances G. Merritt, George Harold Parker, Jr., Linda K. Parker, and the trustee for debtor Roy L. Merritt for repeated and continuing violations of national primary drinking water regulations, 40 CFR Part 141. The complaint alleges that drinking water supplied to residents through the public drinking water system owned by Merritt's Mobile Manor exceeds maximum contamination limitations for nitrate and E. Coli, that sampling and reporting of the system was not conducted in accordance with applicable sections of 40 CFR part 141, that neither the public or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was informed by the system operators of exceedances of maximum contaminate limitations, and that the owners and operators of the public water system at Merritt's Mobile Manor continued to operate the system in violation of administrative and emergency administrative orders issued by EPA. The complaint seeks injunctive relief to compel defendants to operate the public water system in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations and civil penalties for violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative orders issued by EPA. Under this consent decree, four of the five named defendants agree to abide by the injunctive relief ordered by the Court, provide safe alternative drinking water to residents of Merritt's Mobile Manor until municipal water and sewer hookups can be installed, maintain septic systems in a manner so as to preclude further contamination to the aquifer from sewage disposed by Merritt's Mobile Manor, and make payments in satisfaction of civil penalties for violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative orders issued by EPA. The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O.
