In his interview with INTERFAX he underlined that "it is necessary to raise this question as soon as possible." "I would like to see a strong Georgia which would be able to defend itself and a step towards the ruble zone is a chance for Georgia's real rescue," he emphasized. Goguadze also declared that he positively assesses proposals of several political functionaries to introduce Russian forces into Georgia in order to bring order in the republic. At the same time, he noted that "this should be done minding genuine necessity." Goguadze stated that cooperation with other countries "which would not restrict Georgia's sovereignty is always acceptable." The speaker stressed the necessity to render assistance to Georgia's law enforcement bodies. "A policeman without money is a potential criminal and that is why we need help so we can bring order in the country," announced Goguadze.
