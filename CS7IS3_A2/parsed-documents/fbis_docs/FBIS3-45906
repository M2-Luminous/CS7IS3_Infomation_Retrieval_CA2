Full text follows: The Hong Kong British authorities, regardless of the opposition by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong Kong-British Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last week for allocating 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars for the new airport project before any agreement has reached between China and Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport and went on to decide to apply with the Legco for another appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars. According to the present financial arrangement for the airport project by the British side, the debt to be left over to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run up to well over 45 billion Hong Kong dollars, which will be nine times the total debt limit set in the memorandum of understanding signed by the heads of government of China and Britain. By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole financial arrangement by the British side have already violated the memorandum of understanding, the Hong Kong authorities are in fact creating further obstacles to the talks on the Hong Kong new airport project. The Chinese side hereby declares: Before any agreement on the financial arrangement for the new airport project has been reached by the two sides: 1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will not be liable for any expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport; 2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be leased through the discussion of the Sino-British Land Committee according to the provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British joint declaration; 3. All the contracts associated with the new airport project that cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 approved by the Hong Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese side will be invalid after July 1, 1997; 4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport project adopted by the Hong Kong British Legislative Council will become invalid after July 1, 1997; The Chinese Government has always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong. In order to separate political issues from economic ones, it has approved the project of making land from the sea at Wanchai, central, and the project of sea-bed tunnel at the western harbor. The Chinese side regrets for the British side's repeated breach of the agreement reached between the two governments. But the Chinese side still hope that the British side would earnestly deliberate the positive proposals raised by the Chinese side on reducing costs and debts and strengthening management and supervision and produce a financial arrangement which tallies with the spirit of the memorandum of understanding so as to facilitate the restoration of the talks on the new airport issue.
