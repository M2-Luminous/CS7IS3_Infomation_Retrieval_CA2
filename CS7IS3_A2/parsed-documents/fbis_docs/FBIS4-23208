On the way to (Munya), after crossing a bridge destroyed by government troops in an attempt to halt the advance of the RPF, one finds that many people are returning to their homes. Along the way, the bodies of government troops can be seen on the tarmac. On the way to Nyanza, people say [words indistinct]. They also say that they are happy that RPF troops are in the area. People say they have (?seen) the discarded military uniforms of government soldiers. One such found was for a [name indistinct] Gaspard, No. 31173, who hails from Kidaho commune, in the (Gisare) sector, Ruhengeri Prefecture. He threw away his star, his shirt, trousers shoes, socks, and fled. The people say that that is what the government troops are doing. In our efforts to rescue Rwandans, RPF troops have freed 800 prisoners, soldiers and civilians, who were jailed in Nyanza. Up through last night, RPF soldiers have been attempting to rescue people who had taken refuge in attics, where they are still hiding. Operations are under way in Nyanza, whether in (Mugangamure) or (Mugunzi). There are many injured people in the hospitals.
