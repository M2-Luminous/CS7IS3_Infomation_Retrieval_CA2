Morillon's successor, is increasingly bitter and is quite open about it. The Belgian general said that the activities of the UN force in Bosnia were completely paralyzed by the lack of personnel and political will. This inefficiency undermined the credibility of future UN operations. Interviewed in his office in the UN peacekeepers' barracks near Sarajevo hospital, Gen. Briquemont wondered whether the leaders of the three warring parties cared at all about the fates of their compatriots. They talk only about their war aims and objectives, he said, adding: I think that they like power above all else. The United Nations, however, is also guilty in the general's eyes. It has voted resolution after resolution without giving itself the means to implement them effectively. There is a yawning gulf, he said, between all the UN resolutions and the means made available to implement them on the ground. The general estimated that he needed at least a further 10,000 men in order to carry out his mission in Bosnia. Instead of that, he said, France and Great Britain speak of withdrawing their contingents in the spring if there is no sign of solution to the conflict.
