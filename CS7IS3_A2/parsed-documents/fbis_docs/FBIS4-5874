The so-called Brady bonds will be listed in Europe and most of the banks are expected to sell them immediately, the officials said. The officials said the bonds are expected to be sold for a total of 350 billion yen. This will leave the banks with losses of 300 billion yen which they expect to liquidate in closing their midterm books at the end of September. The plan is part of the Brady initiative launched in 1989 by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Under the initiative, creditor banks, after discounting credit, swap loans to Latin American countries for bonds issued by the debtor nations. Banks have previously liquidated bad loans to Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina using a similar method. The Brazilian scheme wraps up the initiative, the officials said.
