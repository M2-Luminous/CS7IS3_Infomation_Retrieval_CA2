After Leonid Kravchuk had viewed the exhibits he answered journalists' questions. Speaking about the new parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed out that it is too early to draw a conclusion that the parliament has become politicized, because its formation is still under way. Assessing a possibility that the parliament will consider the law on the delimitation of functions between the president and the government, Leonid Kravchuk declared that the result of the work done by the initiative group is not yet the opinion of the parliament and the commissions. "Changing the Constitution is a problem, which should be coordinated with the executive bodies and the president. The situation with Crimea can serve as an example. In 1990 it was granted autonomy. However, there are no documents whatsoever that would regulate relations between Ukraine and the autonomy. Only in two years' has a document on the delimitation of their plenary powers been approved. Over this time Crimea has approved so many various decisions that now they must be brought in line with the Constitution of Crimea and the Constitution of Ukraine. We found ourselves in a difficult situation, failing to adopt in 1990 the documents on mutual relations between Ukraine and its autonomous part. If now, before the election of the president, we again have no documents determining relations between the center and the territories, the president and the executive structures, we will again find ourselves in a difficult situation. It is necessary to introduce amendments and additions to the Constitution immediately, and not to hold elections for the sake of elections. As far as the plenary powers of the president are concerned, the executive power should be in one pair of hands: If it is in the hands of the president, no premier is needed, then this is a presidential state and this will lead to changes in the Constitution and laws. If the plenary powers are vested in the Cabinet of Ministers, it is necessary to determine its status and the status of the president. There is no perpetual scheme in this situation and one should proceed from historic peculiarities. Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent on his attitude to the stance taken by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's acting prime minister, toward the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange, and on whether the ban on circulation of freely convertible currency in Ukraine's monetary market would lead to collapse, Leonid Kravchuk, noted: "This issue should be studied. Only one currency is in circulation in other countries of the world and there is no collapse. As regards misgivings concerning a lack of cash, calculations will be made with Ukraine's National Bank. In the world, "when a state is a state," it has one currency, and it has banks and bureaux de change, which can convert any currency "at a fair exchange rate" into the national one. When five or six currencies are in circulation in the country, you will not bring order to the currency system. One should not approach the issue of the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange in a simplistic way; one should take account of the current situation, all of the "pros" and "cons." I am convinced that if we introduce the hryvna in accordance with all the rules, all market and financial structures will be made to correspond to it, including the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange. To a question about what to do to make Ukrainian goods appear in the shops, which have become known in the world market, Leonid Kravchuk noted in particular: "There are two problems: to earn money and to pay people for labor in accordance with the existing norms. The problem is not a lack of money, but the lack of a mechanism to restrain the money earned. There are people who receive unearned money and who buy products such as foreign-made cars, but those who work cannot receive money. We cannot increase pensions and wages on the basis of goods produced. We should enliven production, make profits and then increase social payments."
