FBIS4-58241 "drnes085_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 ISRAEL Report on Peres' Speech on PLO Accord, Talks With Syria Report on Peres' Speech on PLO Accord, Talks With Syria TA0205183594 TA0205183594 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 3 Network in Hebrew at 1355 GMT on 2 May begins a live relay of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' address to the Knesset plenum in response to three no-confidence motions by the opposition on the upcoming agreement with the PLO and the ongoing negotiations with Syria. Peres' 47-minute speech is punctuated by frequent heckling and the correspondent's voice-over summarizing the remarks from the floor, which precludes full texting of the speech. The foreign minister's remarks in English are given within slantlines. What follows are the monitorable parts of Peres' address: "On Wednesday, at 1100 in Cairo, we will indeed sign an agreement with the Palestinians about the establishment of autonomy in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. This is a big day for Israel. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than to be rid of its responsibility for 800,000 Palestinians living in a small strip of land. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than this agreement. Nothing else can free us of the huge historical myth that Gaza belongs to us. We never owned it, and it has been a burden to us." "Nothing will unite the people more than our departure from the Gaza Strip. If you want to speak about polls, let me tell you that 84 percent of the people support a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Nothing will legitimize the Zionist Movement more (?than this move). From the United States to Russia, from India to China; in Oman, Qatar, Morocco, Tunisia -- the State of Israel is being recognized for the first time. This is something you never dreamed of or experienced." Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "You invented autonomy; you recognized the PLO. You favored autonomy in all the territories, not just in Gaza and in Jericho; you sat with 'Abd-al-Shafi in Madrid and you made an agreement with the PLO in 1982 concerning Lebanon." Peres asserts that a government in which the late Menahem Begin was a member "proposed to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights in time of peace," and cites the Israeli Government resolution of 19 June 1967 that Israel should strive for a peace treaty with Syria "based on the international border and Israel's security needs." Peres adds: "When the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria were granted Jordanian passports we all welcomed it. How is a Jordanian passport with the right to vote in elections to the Jordanian Parliament better than a laissez-passer -- also known as a passport -- to 800,000 inhabitants of Gaza? Do you want to bar 800,000 people the right to move? Do you want to grant them Israeli passports? Is that what you want?" "As far as passports are concerned, there are three possibilities: either grant them Israeli passports, give them Gazan passports, or leave them without passports. Will it please you to leave them without passports? Do you want to annex the Gaza Strip and make its inhabitants Israeli citizens? Is that what you want?" "An agreement will be reached in Cairo to set up an autonomy in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. Israel will remain in charge of external security, all the settlements will remain in their place, and we will be responsible for their safety. Autonomy will be enforced in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, contrary to the Camp David proposal to implement the autonomy all at once in Judaea and Samaria for all its inhabitants. I suppose the decision to apply autonomy to the Palestinian inhabitants referred to Palestinians who either belonged to the PLO or to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. There are no other Palestinians." "We will establish the most logical possible autonomy. I would like to say that we want this autonomy to work. Just as one may buy a ticket to get on a bus, one may travel abroad with a passport; there is no difference. If somebody wants to write a letter, there are more stamps in the world than countries. The stamps and the passports will bear either of the following inscriptions: /The Palestinian Authority/ or /The Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority/. This will explicitly differentiate them from a state." "The terms full autonomy and strong police force were coined by the Likud. /Self-government authority/ denotes full autonomy, not a state. If you want to call it a state, be my guests. The head of this /authority/ will not be called the president of a Palestinian state, as he is being called, but head of the /Palestinian Authority/. Autonomy means self-rule and it can be interpreted in various ways. The autonomy applies to everything except two issues; it gives the Palestinians full self-government except for two issues: security and external relations." "We are carrying out a policy, without which the Jewish people would have faced a catastrophe and 20 years of procrastination." This latter remark triggers a commotion in the Likud's ranks, especially on the part of Yitzhaq Shamir, to whom Peres retorts: "You met with 'Abd-al-Shafi, the deputy founder of the PLO. You were the first one who spoke publicly with the PLO; you agreed to an international conference." "It was us, not you, who excluded Jerusalem from the autonomy. Shamir was prepared to wait another 20 years, which would have resulted in more hatred, more poverty, more victims, more acrimony, more knives. These were your prospects." Peres goes on to say that "most Israelis favor this move. Most people believe this is a courageous, genuine, and correct step. The fact that you ran out of gas and have no plan is your problem, not the people's." "We are the only ones who pulled the country out of a deep freeze. People are delighted to see an Israeli delegation headed by the director general of the Defense Ministry in Qatar, Oman, Algeria, or Cairo, and to see us headed along a path of peace with the Palestinians." Asked by an unidentified Knesset member whether he can give his commitment that there will be no Palestinian state, the foreign minister says: "I can commit myself to the fact that we are opposed to a Palestinian state and favor full autonomy, as we promised. Through the establishment of autonomy we prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state, because the alternative to autonomy is a Palestinian state." "It is an illusion to believe that the problem is only one of borders. The problem is of borders, but also of relations. It is an illusion to think that terror can be cracked with jails and military operations. Terror must be uprooted through political means as well. Had relations in Hebron been different, the existence of a Jewish settlement there would have been no problem." "The Revisionist Movement and the Labor Movement had both hoped for a totally different relationship between Jews and Arabs." "How can there be a relationship with 100,000 people having spent time in Israeli jails, 20,000 people having been injured, and 1,000 killed? Is that what you want? Is this the only way?" Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "Where are your ideology and your values? Where are your efforts to improve relations with the Palestinians and the Arabs, not because we fear them but on the basis of our own Jewish values?" "The Jewish state is a state of values. We will allow the Palestinians to travel as human beings with their own passports, to send letters to Arab countries with which we have no relations. They have the right to write letters, not in an environment of hatred and a feeling of superiority. If somebody in Gaza writes a letter, say to a relative in Iraq, does that mean that he founded a state?" "We will not be deterred. We are flying a moral flag, not just a political one. We do not want to rule over another people, oppress it, or put it in jail. With murderers we will settle scores, while we will let ordinary people live with dignity. Therefore, the Knesset elections, public opinion polls, and even the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange show that we are on the right track." "The leader of the Likud shamelessly appeared in a news conference and said: What we told you, that the prime minister had presented maps, is true. I hereby announce: The prime minister did not present even one map or any geographical lines to Christopher. I demand that the leader of the Likud come to this podium and apologize for spreading such lies." "The Labor party, the current coalition, the Israeli Government, and the prime minister publicly announced that we were in favor of a territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. We did not deny it, and we adhere to it. We did not give any maps. We will conduct negotiations because we want to attain peace with Syria, because we do not want to face a coalition with a totally different kind of weapons, because we must think about the future and not just about the past, because the future does not only herald knives but also missiles, because the future also holds nonconventional weapons, and because we must build a different future." Again to the opposition, he says: "You will not frighten us even one little bit with your screams and threats. We are treading the only correct historical, political, strategic, and moral path. You know this deep down in your heart, and many of you support it." "What we proposed to the Syrians is to conduct negotiations based on Israel's acceptance of the principle of territorial compromise and its wish to discuss one package encompassing withdrawal, peace, and security -- because these are three inseparable issues -- while cautiously weighing our pronouncements and our presentation of the issue. I hereby announce from this podium: This government will do what it promised and will strive to attain genuine peace with the Syrians, which will include an element of withdrawal. We will not present any maps before we know what the other components are and before we see that a spirit of reconciliation and willingness to arrive at a compromise exist on the Syrian side. They are not doing us a favor, and we are not doing them one. But, just as with the Palestinians, there are rules, and where security was concerned, we insisted on our position throughout the negotiations. On other issues, we tried to enable the Palestinians to live dignified lives as human beings; with passports, the right to write letters, self-government, and a police force." Peres goes on to quote Israeli Army reservists: "For 27 years we were sitting ducks in the Gaza Strip, and now we are getting out of it. Shalom to Gaza and Shalom to Israel, and let us turn over a new leaf." "The words traitor, liar, and others were uttered even at the time of the Camp David accords. There were stones, and flags, and demonstrations. The man who brought about the Camp David accords, Begin, deserves all the historical praise. He was not deterred by people calling him a traitor or the shouting of Knesset Member Tzahi Hanegbi." Peres ends his speech by saying: "A historic decision entails pains, opposition, and screams. The decision has been made. We are about to embark on the only correct road and I propose to strike all the no-confidence motions from the Knesset's agenda." Replying to an interjection by the Likud's Binyamin Begin citing press reports that the autonomy agreement is based on an agreement made by Denmark with some islands near Greenland, Peres says: "Any comparison with the autonomy that had been proposed by the Likud or any other autonomy in the world is totally unfounded, because in Greenland or elsewhere it was stipulated that the autonomy would be a permanent form of relations, whereas the Camp David accords stipulated that the autonomy would be a temporary form of relations, which would move on to a permanent arrangement within five years. Therefore, there is a huge difference and no comparison should be made to anything. Hence, all reports on the matter are totally worthless. "Secondly, it is true that Gaza is not Greenland. So, what to do? Hold onto 800,000 people with jail wardens, soldiers, policemen, stones, and knives? For God's sake, what is your solution? Stop confusing the people! You offer no solution, other than using force, violence, and confrontation." He concludes by saying: "Knives can always be matched with knives, but the desire of one people to run its own life must be met by political and moral means -- and we are providing both."
