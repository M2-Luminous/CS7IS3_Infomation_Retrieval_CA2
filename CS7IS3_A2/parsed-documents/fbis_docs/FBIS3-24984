In view of the government's silence, which is certainly due to the fact that the prime minister was away on an official visit in France, and in order to show its good faith and readiness to negotiate, the CSTC executive council renews and reiterates its proposal to negotiate with the government and employers on the major issues outlined in the ultimatum. This should take place within a period of 10 days, starting from 7 February, that is, from 7 February up to and including 16 February. Once that deadline has expired, a strike notice will be issued to embark on an indefinite nationwide strike. [Signed] Louis Gandou, CSTC secretary general.
