In his report Deputy Kang Song-san, premier of the Administration Council, recalled that the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee of the WPK held in December last year reviewed the fulfillment of the third seven-year plan and set a three-year period of adjustment, putting forward a economic strategy, on the basis of a scientific analysis of the current situation and the present condition of socialist economic construction in the country. The tasks of socialist economic construction in the adjustment period, the reporter said, is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies, give definite precedence to the coal and power industries and railway transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, and continue to develop the metal industry. The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of adjustment in socialist economic construction carries the unshakable determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to radically improve the people's living standard in the next few years and develop the national economy to an economy strong in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining unshaken under any circumstances, he said. Turning to the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment, the reporter said: The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields should be raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than 10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future. Textile output will be boosted 20 percent or more and chemical fibre and synthetic resin more than 10 percent in the period of adjustment. We should expand the production bases of export commodities, broaden economic ties with countries which have good relations with our country and further develop trade and economic dealings with Southeast Asian countries which are within easy reach geographically. Coal and power output and railway freight turnover should be increased over 30 percent respectively in the adjustment period.
