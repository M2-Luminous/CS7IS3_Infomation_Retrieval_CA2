"There were no such talks at a G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in late April... [ellipses as received] or after that," Fujii told a regular press meeting. He was referring to a report by a major Japanese daily quoting U.S. monetary officials as saying Japan, Germany and the United States agreed on concerted moves on interest rates in line with the recent joint G-7 intervention to stem volatility in currency rates. But, Fujii reiterated that G-7 nations will continue taking "appropriate, timely" action in the currency markets. The Bank of Japan continued to take a loose stance in the money market to send the key overnight unsecured call rate down to record low levels Wednesday. Meanwhile, the German Bundesbank is expected to cut its discount rate overnight and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is widely speculated to raise the discount rate next week. The Japanese and German credit easing helps the U.S. dollar rise, while the U.S. is tightening its credit to prevent inflation. Pressed by reporters on whether his concern over the yen's rise has eased somewhat, Fujii acknowledged that the yen's rise in fact has a "deflationary impact on exporters." But he omitted using the word "concern" as he has in the past. Fujii said he is "not pessimistic" about the economy as a whole and noted that currency rates are one of the factors.
