The Irish government's willingness to do so underlined the absurdity of the Prime Minister's refusal, he claimed. Mr Adams asked: "Why can John Major not follow Albert Reynolds' lead on this issue? This would allow Sinn Fein to conclude our process of consultation and consideration of the document. Without such necessary clarification, it is extremely difficult for us. Demands that we do so in the absence of such clarity are unreasonable and a cause of suspicion in an already difficult climate." Mr Major and Mr Reynolds are due to have talks in London next week, a week before Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin which will be dominated by a debate on the declaration. Mr Adams hinted tonight that there will be no announcement on a decision whether to accept the December 15 agreement. It would be counter-productive to set deadlines because of what he claimed was Britain's "obstructionist attitude." The Sinn Fein president said a confidential letter from Mr Reynolds, outlining the Republic's interpretation of the declaration, would allow a more informed evaluation of the document and how it could be developed in an overall peace process. The role and influence of the Dublin government was central to the peace process, but a lasting peace could not be achieved without British cooperation. He added: "The British government should provide clarification. The lines of communication are still there to be used. It is Mr Major who is refusing to move forward." Mr Adams is to be invited to return to America to head a St Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco, it was disclosed today. The United Irish Societies, an umbrella group of Irish American clubs and organisations, has also invited SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Fein said. And three IRA men who escaped from Ulster's Maze Prison would act as honorary Grand Marshalls for the March 17 parade.
