The survey refers to figures obtained during the first week in March and recalls that last January, Perez de Cuellar and Fujimori were tied with 43.1 percent each. The survey was conducted after the sale of Telefonica Peruana and Entel Peru [National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru] to Telefonica de Espana for a total of $2.002 billion, which was considered an economic success for Fujimori's government. It must be noted that Perez de Cuellar has been reluctant to accept his possible candidacy for the presidency despite Imasen results showing that he has more than 45 percent support. The same survey shows that if Fujimori runs against Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont he would obtain 49.6 percent of the votes against 31.3 percent for Belmont, who obtained 1.3 percent more than in a previous survey. Legislators Fernando Olivera and Enrique Chirinos have said that if Fujimori runs for reelection, as authorized by the 1993 Constitution, he must resign his post six months before, according to Olivera, and four months before, according to Chirinos.
