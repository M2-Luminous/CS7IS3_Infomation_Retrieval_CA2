Some consumers have not fully understood the implementation of tax reforms, and fear the new tax system will further add to inflation. Sales in major shopping malls in Beijing and Wuhan have been rising with consumers' favourite commodities including grain, oil, electric appliances and gold. Sales of television sets, video cassette recorders, refrigerators and washing machines went up by 100 to 200 percent. However, the demand for less than nine percent of the commodities outstripped supply, and it is not difficult to stabilise the market. Consumers also only look for a small range of commodities and the impact of price fluctuations on the market has not proved particularly serious. But market fluctuations show that consumers are still expecting inflation will continue in the near future. They want to buy goods because they believe that devaluation of money is faster than that of commodities. They fear the introduction of tax reforms and further liberalisation of price controls this year will lead to a surge in prices. Although consumers are flocking to stores, they are not buying whatever commodities can be found on the market. They are proving to be selective, and only want to buy goods with brand names and of good quality. This might put additional pressure on inflation as demand for imported products will go up.
