The meeting, which began at 1100 and was attended by the delegates representing both countries, was presided over by Francisco Gil Diaz, Mexican undersecretary of finance and public credit, and Estuardo Mendez Herbruger, Guatemalan public finance vice minister. The delegations agreed that the suspension would enter into effect while the search would continue for a definite solution that is favorable to both countries. On 24 January, the Mexican finance authorities implemented measures directly affecting Guatemalan and Central American migrants travelling from the United States and crossing Mexico carrying goods and other commodities. Both delegations agreed on a study to harmonize timetables along the common border in order to prevent bottlenecks in those areas, as well as technical cooperation between customs authorities with the objective of solving any problems that may rise. Mendez Herbruger stated that both delegations plan to search for convenient procedures whereby those who need to cross Mexican territory will be able to do so without any delays caused by Mexican custom regulations. He indicated that Guatemala is evaluating a Mexican proposal because the Mexicans reacted to comments forwarded by the Guatemalan authorities, who in turn received feedback from the migrants. Therefore, they are all working to benefit Central American citizens. On the other hand, Mexican Ambassador Pedro Vasquez Colmenares expressed satisfaction with the dialogue that had been held and announced that the Mexican authorities had met and exchanged opinions with the Salvadoran, Nicaraguan, and Costa Rican customs directors at the Central American Integration Secretariat.
