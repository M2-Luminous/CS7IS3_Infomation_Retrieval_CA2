"Russia'a presence in the Balkans is a historical fact, and her current involvement within the context of the development of events in the former Yugoslavia is realistic... Any constribution, including that by Russia, and aimed at establishing peace should be welcomed," Serreci said. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Ukrainian friction over the Black Sea Fleet: "Following last year's October events, the correlation of forces among the political and military elites of Russia has long become evident. "Judging by the latest developments, the Ukrainian generals also consolidate their positions. Do the accords reached suit the military and can they hinder their enactment? This is a rhetorical question after a series of events concerning Russia and ex-Soviet republics". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on the Black Sea Fleet: "The striving of the Ukrainian side individually to divide the Black Sea Fleet and thereby write it off as a strategic operational force protecting the southern flanks of both Russia and Ukraine, has long become an evil tradition. "Agreements which were signed by the leaders of the two countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo and Massandra and which were intended to relieve the accumulated tension, damped the ardour of the Ukrainian military only for a short while, for they conceived an intention to have a fleet of their own, even if a small one, resultant of withdrawal of property from Russia. "That the Black Sea Fleet together with its entire infrastructure is really Russian is evidenced not only by the Massandra protocol but also by the exclusively Russian financing of it since September last year". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Azerbaijani relations: "Everything seems to indicate that that the backstage talks between Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev and Russian officials did not lead to progress in discussing the possibiity of a Russian military presence in Azerbaijan. "Moscow still failed to persuade Aliyev into allowing to deploy if only one Russian military base in Azerbaijan". NOVAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Tajik opposition leader Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda, who is currently in Moscow. He said: "Solving the Tajik issue is the key to a settlement of the conflict situation in Central Asia. This means thousands upon thousands of human lives. "We recognise the great role of Russia in resolving the issue and are confident that her geopolitical interests are aimed at restoring peace and stability in the region. The opposition, and I must say that this means a large proportion of the population of Tajikistan, wishes to have good-neighbourly relations with Russia". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the opposition's regaining its strength: "Following last year's October defeat, the opposition slowly but steadily regains its former strength. According to information available to the newspaper, the second phase of the 1st congress of the Union of Officers took place in Moscow on April 16 in an atmosphere of semi-secrecy. The congress was attended by 184 delegates, representing nine republics and 21 regions of Russia. "It seems that the death of 10 members of the Officers' Union during the defence of the parliament building in Moscow during the October events, a brief ban imposed on the Officers' Union, and the five-month stay of its leader Stanislav Terekhov (who was re-elected the chairman of the Officers' Union now), in the Lefortovo investigative isolation ward, have only added popularity to this officers' patriotic organisation which has now become one of the main centres of the unification of opposition forces". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, who pointed out: "Our principled line is to consolidate the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and maintain its vitality. A certain adjustment of its obsolete provisions is necessary for that... "Already now we need an utter clarity in order to choose an optimum configuration of Russia's defence potential and to prepare an appropriate infrastructure for the accommodation of troops. Depending on that are both the course of military reform, the pace of withdrawal of Russian troops to national territory, and other major aspects of the activities and development of the Russian Armed Forces." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Aleksandr Livshits, leader of a group of presidential experts. Livshits is of the opinion that "Russia is now the only CIS state in which the population's incomes grew quicker than prices in the first quarter of 1994. "Judging by absolute living standards, the position of people in Russia is on the whole better. In February 1994, by using the average monthly wage in Moscow, one could buy twice as much meat in Moscow as in Minsk and 32 times more than in Yerevan". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI raises the question as to whether Armenia is threatened with a social outburst. "The state of affairs in the social sphere can be described without any exaggeration as disastrous, not just hard. Following the latest indexation, the average monthly pay of Yerevan resident is 300 drams. One kilogramme of butter costs 550 drams, one kg of cooked sausage -- 550 drams, sugar -- 150 drams, one litre of vegetable oil -- 280 drams. And this is so at a time when the main source of permanent income for 80 percent of the population is wage or pension". PRAVDA carries an interview with Arkadiy Gukasyan, minister of foreign affairs of Nagorno-Karababkh, who pointed out: "There are several factors which explain the Karabakh phenomenon. The main thing is that we know what we fight for. We have nowhere to retreat. We have no other land. Every resident of Nagorno-Karabakh is aware that if he shows cowardice, the next day there would be neither his house nor family. "We are confronted with Azerbaijanis who are forcibly brought to the frontline from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They personally do not need Karabakh at all. They wait for an opportune moment to desert from the army. So, our successes should not be accounted for by Armenia's support". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia. He said "the main thing is to stop attempts to tackle the most complex problems of the countryside by administrative methods so that some high-placed official would not sing in the heat of the moment an ill-considered directive... There are apprehensions on that score". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA carries an interview with Aman Tuleyev, member of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament. "Frankly speaking, the Yeltsin-Gaydar reforms have thrown us back in time to the days of feudal subsistence economy, not just 20-30 years backwards. "Wages are paid to people in our country in kind by giving everything from pressing irons, shoes, fabrics, tobacco products and even meat to medicines and spare parts for motor vehicles."
