FBIS4-51647 "dreas084_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 Thailand U.S. Envoy's Concern Over New Alien Law Eased U.S. Envoy's Concern Over New Alien Law Eased BK3004093294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 30 Apr 94 p 26 BK3004093294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] US Ambassador David Lambertson told Thai Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon yesterday that Washington fears proposed amendments to the Alien Business Law will harm operations of US businessmen already in Thailand. The 1966 Treaty of Amity between the US and Thailand allows Americans the same rights as Thais to engage in many occupations normally prohibited to foreigners. The law is being amended because the new General Agreement on Trade in Services, due to come into force next year, will prohibit signatories from discriminating among foreigners of different nationalities in professional and other services. The European Community, Japan, Australia and a number of other developed countries have repeatedly complained that their nationals are deprived of the rights granted in Thailand to Americans. The United States is worried that by rewriting the law and ending discrimination, Thailand will withdraw rights now held by Americans rather than extending them to other nationals. Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson feared the amendments would retard investment by Americans in Thailand. "I informed to him that the law just approved the recommendations of the committee set up to amend the law, but it still needs future review and submission to the Cabinet again before being read in the Parliament," Mr Uthai said. "So it is still not certain that the amended law will be passed as proposed." A source said the proposed amendments did not specify that business operations that have already been established or may be established in the future under the Treaty of Amity would be exempted. The old Alien Business Law made this distinction. Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson also insisted that Universal Insurance Co, a Thai firm 99.84 percent owned by American shareholders, should receive the same right as Thai firms in setting up its 11 branches under the Treaty of Amity. But he told the US envoy that the ministry is seeking a legal interpretation from the Juridical Committee on whether Universal Insurance will be treated as a Thai or an American firm. The Cabinet will have the final say in the matter, Mr Uthai said. Mr Lambertson characterized his one-hour talk with Mr Uthai as a good discussion and expressed hope that a satisfactory solution could be reached in the Universal case. Mr Uthai also said that Mr Lambertson confirmed that Thailand would remain on Washington's so-called Priority Watch List, under which the US will monitor the protection of the intellectual property rights. At the same time, Washington recognized the progress Thailand was making in enforcing patents and copyrights, he said.
