"Protect us, or let us defend ourselves!" This is the message the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government is trying to convey to the international community. The message is urgent and what makes it even more urgent is the recent massacre in Sarajevo. Everyone knows the locations of the heavy artillery killing the innocent in Sarajevo. These posts can be seen with ordinary binoculars from the center of the Bosnian capital. There exist the deadly guns seen on television screens by hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Despite all this, we are told that the United Nation has launched an investigation to determine the source of the shell which killed 55 people while they were buying their daily food. The investigation will be similar to scores of investigations conducted before. That is, it will produce no results, or it might produce a result but the international community will then hasten to put it quietly away on the top shelf. Everyone knows who is in control of these deadly guns. The peoples of the world watch the murderers giving interviews on television screen every evening. UN diplomats embrace the same murderers in cocktail parties and in diplomatic corridors. Despite all this, we are told that the United Nations is planning to conduct an investigation to identify the perpetrator. [passage omitted] The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina has become one of the questions that are of historic significance. That is, the questions which expose the true positions by stripping the world order of its claims to civilization and proving that it is based on respect for force, and force alone. In Bosnia-Herzegovina we see the real Europe. And in it the present world order, which is supposed to be based on respect for international law, has been exposed. So rescuing Bosnia-Herzegovina is not merely rescuing a war-torn state from suffering and possible extinction: The question raised now is rescuing the international organizations, especially the United Nations, and rescuing the future of international relations throughout the globe.
