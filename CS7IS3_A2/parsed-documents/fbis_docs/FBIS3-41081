He added that it was this fight that prompted guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to kill 11 Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. The Ecuadoran official announced that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent a note to Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen lamenting the death of the 11 uniformed men during a FARC ambush. The 11 men were involved in a narcotics operation in the area of the Putumayo River, at the Colombian border, in December 1993. The U.S. Government "realizes these personnel were killed while courageously confronting and combating the threat of international drug trafficking, and it values the sacrifices made by the national government in this struggle," Christopher stated. The note from the United States also "guarantees that its government will do everything it can to help Ecuador in this effort," Paredes pointed out. The foreign minister added that Ecuador will not budge in its struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism through the application of the law without having second thoughts, and by respecting human rights and the country's institutional system.
