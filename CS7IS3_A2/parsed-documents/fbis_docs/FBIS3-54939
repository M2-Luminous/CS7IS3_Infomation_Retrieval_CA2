I put this question to First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar on the eve of the holiday. Now I can see that his answers will not please everybody. Therefore you will have to decide yourselves for what to blame Gaydar. First all of, I would like to know which course the reforms may take: "onward" or "backward"? And which actions by the authorities can indicate to us, the philistines, a landmark.... I was asking Yegor Timurovich about his forecasts for the future in the sphere of economics but, to be sure, in responding to them, he could not do without politics. [Gaydar] It is an unrewarding business to make predictions. Especially since the situation in economics and in politics this new year will depend not so much on the auspiciousness of the stars as on the conclusions drawn from the events of the outgoing year. I can say one thing with certainty, though: The Russians will be scolding the authorities. [Vishnevskaya] This is what authority is for -- to criticize it. This is so natural! In any country, let alone ours, with so many outstanding problems.... [Gaydar] The whole point is for what they are blamed. If for the fact that although there are goods in the shops, the shop windows and shelves are still a far cry not only from those in Brussels but even in Warsaw.... And prices keep growing, although at a slower pace than just recently. But they keep growing anyway! And the fact that production has to be restructured and that it has become difficult to market goods owing to competition and even to reduce personnel, which is especially painful and hard, and that those dismissed cannot find a job in their speciality -- if this is what they blame it for, let them. This is like a sobering cold shower -- not to slacken. But if it is blamed for the fact that some goods are not available at any price while those that do appear on the shelves are so expensive that they are beyond reach, that money again is losing value, that the ruble is depreciating with every passing day, that savings can be kept only in hard currency, but this is impossible because its cash circulation has been banned, that the producers and the consumers are deeply in debt to each other.... well, then, here things are bound to go beyond mere grumbling. [Vishnevskaya] The latter scenario is too familiar: It is reminiscent of 1992. Again the same old story? Is this possible? [Gaydar] Alas, if we get frightened once again and, instead of continuing a tough policy but the only feasible economic one, begin to pump the country with money, then inflation will accelerate in spring, leading to nonpayments, a budget crisis, and then an economic crisis. And whereas last year the fluctuations in economic policy were if not justified then at least explicable, this year they are fraught with catastrophe and are definitely not inevitable. [Vishnevskaya] But possible? There are prerequisites for that. The present parliament differs little from the previous one. It seems that two months ago you said that you were haunted by a terrible dream: You enter the State Duma and what you see is the Supreme Soviet.... Has the nightmare become a reality? [Gaydar] Well, the situation surely cannot be called satin smooth [barkhatnaya]. Yet I have never worked in a satin smooth situation.... As for today's situation, it is radically different from that in September. At that time there was a severe conflict between the parliament and the government, with the president's edicts being immediately countermanded and with a complete power vacuum in the regions while decisions made at the center by one power branch were blocked at the local level by another branch; there was no budget for the fourth quarter. Things were heading toward a political crisis. [Vishnevskaya] And did come to it. [Gaydar] But now the situation is different! There is the main thing -- the constitution, and within its framework, separation of powers. There is a strong presidency. And the parliament, too, is different. We have the largest faction in it, which, including the presidential power of veto, can block most irresponsible decisions. [Vishnevskaya] And what if it cannot? The faction is large, all right, but Russia's Choice is not a parliamentary majority. The government, too, after the elections, has acquired a coalition character, which is obvious to all. Is normal work possible in such conditions without infighting and confrontation? [Gaydar] Our disagreements are largely exaggerated. Of course, they are there but they relate to "superficial" matters and, moreover, are easily removed. For instance, the Yabloko bloc believes that the main shortcoming in government performance is its weak antimonopoly policy. Who would disagree with that?! Are there any ideas on strengthening it? Are there people to translate these ideas into life? You are most welcome into the government to implement them! Naturally, we shall not be demanding that anyone either recognize the flawlessness of our policy or publicly renounce their own views. [Vishnevskaya] Does this mean that the road into the executive branch is open to all regardless of political persuasions? [Gaydar] To all who can and want to work in it, implementing its program. I am categorically against people opposed to the program joining it -- no, not the program of Russia's Choice but of the government. Their place is in parliament where they can argue, promote their ideas, and in the end exercise control. [Vishnevskaya] And what if such "promoters" are in the majority within the government? [Gaydar] This would mean a change of course. Then the Russia's Choice faction will have to decide on the expediency of some of its members working in it. But I do not think that things will come to that. In any event, we are not making any ultimatums or conditions. [Vishnevskaya] But the policy of the present government is also far from ideal. For instance, you are being criticized for artificially maintaining the ruble rate against the dollar. [Gaydar] This is from the "what they blame us for" series of questions. So far the ruble is not overrated: In its purchasing power the ruble approximates 30 cents. This is how it should be in an economy at our level of development. Questions arise for a different reason. In 1992, when the rate was strongly devalued, it appeared profitable to take any raw materials out of the country at any price, an opportunity used by many. We were criticized for that (and quite justly, too!). Today it is not beneficial to "dump" Russian raw materials on the world market at throwaway prices, and we are being admonished for that. And it is good that we are! There is no such task as to take the resources out of the country: You can trade in what yields a profit. [Vishnevskaya] This means that the ruble rate is downgraded, although it is realistic. At what level are you going to maintain it? [Gaydar] We shall try to make sure that its growth proceeds at half the rate of inflation. [Vishnevskaya] Incidentally, inflation in December is expected at a level of 12 percent. This, however, does not include the last week of the year, which can change the entire picture. Is this a result of government policy? [Gaydar] It certainly is. Please note that in December there were payments to pensioners, and the "Vorkuta" problem was resolved. Overall, during the year the inflation growth rate has more than halved. If we go on like this -- and we set the target of bringing it down to 5 percent by the end of 1994 -- the main thing will be accomplished: It will become profitable to invest in production. Combined with tax breaks for producers, this constitutes a foundation for industrial revival in 1995. [Vishnevskaya] A rosy prospect, although a very remote one. And what kind of "new life" will begin at the start of the new year? Prices will jump, of course.... [Gaydar] Only to the extent to which we shall not be able to restrain inflation. As for imports, the new year is no threshold here. New import duties have been postponed until March. Moreover, they will not bring about any revolution in prices. [Vishnevskaya] What will they be like? There are various rumors to that effect. [Gaydar] They will be various, exactly. High for luxury goods and low for staples. The basic principle is that import duties should bring revenues to the state treasury and protect domestic producers. That they must be introduced, all government members are sure. [Vishnevskaya] Why then not as of 1 January? [Gaydar] The level of duties is a matter of dispute, mainly for agricultural produce. Our agro-industrial departments represented in the government by Aleksandr Zaveryukha are insisting on a "prohibitive" level of duties to discourage the import of foodstuffs. Others maintain that they should be made normal, not protecting Russian producers from competition but stimulating it. [Vishnevskaya] And how will this dispute affect prices in the shops? [Gaydar] High import duties mean a jump in prices not only for foreign goods, which may not be so terrible after all. But also increases in domestic prices: Moscow sausages will be competing not with Dutch sausages but with Orel sausages, whose prime cost is no lower. [Vishnevskaya] But Muscovites are buying for the most part on another market: It is enough to go to the Kievskiy or the Belorusskiy railway terminal. [Gaydar] Duties have nothing to do with this! Incidentally, there are no duties on the output by the main agricultural exporters to Russia -- the majority of our former Union republics. While we were being criticized for lacking a position on relations with the CIS states, we concluded free trade agreements with them. Therefore prohibitive tariffs on food imports from there have been blocked by a system of interstate agreements. [Vishnevskaya] And one final question: With what feeling did First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar see out the year 1993, which has been so rich in events? [Gaydar] I have found myself is a rather funny situation. I worked in the government in 1993 for slightly more than a quarter of a year, since 20 September, and by the moment the election campaign got under way, it appeared that the "Gaydar team" was responsible for everything. Those who were there for the whole year got away with impunity, as it were. We became the only ones who did not reject criticisms and complaints. As a result, we had the unpleasant duty of responding without the pleasant comfort of making decisions, administering, and being in control. I have drawn a lesson from this situation: One must never create the illusion of responsibility for decisions made as part of a political line which is pursued not by you and not in the way you think is reasonable.
