In His Opinion, `Further Reforms Are Only Possible From Below' in Russia"] [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy gives Russia another three to four years to make the final choice: Either it is a civil society working for its own benefit in an economy suited for it, or it is a "super-monopolized economy serving only a mafia-like government." Today, the leader of the "Yabloko" Duma faction stated at a meeting with students and teachers of Moscow State University, "The threat of the second option is great." Mr. Yavlinskiy sees the reasons for that in our "most unique system formed over the recent 80 years" -- it has manifested a "staggering capacity for reproduction." The uniqueness of this system, according to Yavlinskiy, lies in that it was conceived as a super-monopoly and "was supposed to work without money, whereby it placed itself outside the law and therefore was sustained by connections, injunctions, and intimidation." "We have made the main error," the author of the "500-Days" concept went on to analyze the reform effort, "by freeing this essentially mafia-like system, whereas it was society that had to be freed from it." The possibilities of "reforms from the top," Mr. Yavlinskiy pledged, have become limited to "a feeble liberalization of prices and decentralization of their control." In unison with the voucher privatization liked "only by those who got their checks for free," these measures have helped the old system take on a new form. Now it "is seeking to strike its own internal balance," in order to preserve unaltered the new situation, "unique in world experience," which provides a material and technical base for the mafia's final accession to power. "I did not realize this at once," admitted Mr. Yavlinskiy, "but if neither the president nor the government do not think it necessary to talk about a program of further reforms, only one conclusion suggests itself: No programs are needed, all reforms have already been carried through." Further reforms, in the view of "Yabloko's" creator, are possible only "from below." To enable them, Russia would need, for the next five to seven years, "a professional, competent, not self-centered government which, having sensed the needs of society, would stop interfering in its work." The financial support for the new stage of reforms, Mr. Yavlinskiy thinks, can only be the dollars that Russian businessmen have transferred abroad: "Conditions should be created so that businessmen would start bringing back their accumulations with no fear or misgiving." Grigoriy Yavlinskiy spoke against early presidential elections and vouched that he would run for the presidency only if there are going to be "lawful elections rather than mafia-like shoot-outs."
