We were successful long ago in propounding this line--in Western capitals--and we have made it clearly understood to Warsaw and Prague and Budapest that they should not look for full membership in the near future. Only satisfaction may be felt, it would seem: We stuck to our guns, we are still reckoned with, and our opinion is taken into consideration. This is undoubtedly a foreign policy victory brilliantly organized by Russia's Foreign Ministry. But perhaps we should not be in any hurry to put it down to our credit? First, we have somehow come by this success too easily. There were in NATO, after all, few who felt any particular enthusiasm at the prospect of finding themselves dragged into possible showdowns on the territory of the former socialist camp. But there were no in any way serious moral-political or strategic grounds for declining this role, seemingly. Now there are: Moscow's position has to be considered, Russia's isolation is impermissible, and all this affords more than serious arguments for restraint in the eastern direction. So the opposition emanating from us is in fact only to the benefit of many people in the West, for it provides a perfectly convincing excuse for calmly, without losing face, postponing sine die the adoption of difficult decisions. Second, the political costs of such a deliberate or unwitting ingratiation of the Western partners fall wholly on Russia--as far as relations with the former allies are concerned, in any event. Had the North Atlantic alliance rejected them on its own initiative, it is toward it that their negative emotions would have been directed. Now, however, it transpires that it is Moscow that has prevented an introduction to the "select club" for those who wanted this, so all possible rebukes should be addressed to the former. We have essentially been tripped up, having agreed to pay someone else's bill. And we should not console ourselves with the fact that it is not about to be presented or that it is not that large. Third, there is something ethically unseemly in this whole situation. A well-bred individual would hardly permit himself to unceremoniously point out to the owner of the house to which he wishes to come: Either invite the whole crew together with me or invite no one without me. This way of framing the question has grated on no one in the West, it seems. But even in high politics, granted all its differences from everyday life, the atrophy of elementary standards of decency is fraught with the danger of a loss of self-esteem. And the latter consists also, specifically, of not going into hysterics if for some reason or other you have not been given an invitation. And, finally, one further point of considerable importance. Claims that the former socialist countries should obtain Moscow's blessing for a foreign policy choice they have made are already being classed as characteristics of Russian policy in the international arena. The USSR once possessed in full measure this droit de regard in respect to the Warsaw Pact countries and even intended to preserve it after the disintegration of the latter. What, are we once again attempting to reproduce the old model of interstate relations in East Europe? The issue of ethics in foreign policy cannot be brushed aside just like that since it by no means boils down to a simple choice between the pompous trivialities of primitive idealism ("let's live amicably") and rational, and sometimes cynical, calculation ("might is right"). But it would make sense to reflect on certain problems connected with our active attempts to prevent the expansion of NATO even from a purely pragmatic viewpoint also. Of course, from the viewpoint of Russian influence it would be splendid were our former allies to link a strengthening of stability in the region not only with NATO but with Moscow also. But the initiative should, for all that, come from them. The Americans are not overly foisting themselves on West Europe, which only makes their positions there stronger. The set of problems today has proven very suitable for "adopting a position" and graphically demonstrating both to critics within the country and to foreign contracting parties that Russia has its own, particular interests in the international arena and is fully resolved to defend them. The signal is, perhaps, timely, just as long as all the steam has not gone into the whistle. The question in itself is by no means a super-priority for Russia. Whether, for example, the Czech Republic joins or does not join NATO would have no significance either for our relations with Ukraine or for the prospects of normalization in the Transcaucasus or for the development of events in Central Asia or for the continued evolution of the CIS as a whole. That is, for the search for answers to all the foreign policy challenges that truly demand Moscow's paramount attention, but of which the problem of military-political confrontation with the North Atlantic alliance is not one. Russia is, of course, interested in an all-European architecture that does not erect new barriers between us and the West. Aleksey Arbatov is perfectly right to stress that the "filching" of states in this intermediate zone in terms of spheres of influence could result in the restoration of frontal confrontation (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 1 October 1993). But could this be avoided were frontal resistance to the expansion of NATO to be organized? And would such resistance not be phase one of a future confrontation? After all, many people in the West recognize the possible negative consequences of an expansion of the North Atlantic alliance and are displaying caution. True, illusory, and, I would say, localistic sentiments prevail in political circles of our former allies. Perhaps it would be better to renounce the prohibitory fervor, which tactically is of benefit clearly not to us and which could strategically drive us into an impasse? It is not, of course, a question of sitting with our arms folded and waiting for something to turn up. Russia could, say, have very serious reasons for considering the CSCE a more attracting structure than NATO. So we should concentrate attention on increasing the efficiency of the corresponding mechanisms in the first case, not on throwing wrenches into the works in the second. Especially since these works are spinning their wheels as it is. There is no doubt that we need to seek to ensure that other participants in international life reckon with our foreign policy interests, our concerns on questions of the country's security, and our ideas concerning real and potential external threats to Russia. The question is how to define these interests and how to ensure that they are respected without reviving stereotypes of the past or losing our own dignity. And, what is of considerable importance, without causing repercussions that could sooner or later boomerang against Russia itself.
