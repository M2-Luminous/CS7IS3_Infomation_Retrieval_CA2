FBIS4-19695 "drweu077_q_94011" FBIS-WEU-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 TURKEY Golhan Interviewed on `Defense Concept' Golhan Interviewed on `Defense Concept' NC2004124594 Istanbul NOKTA in Turkish 10-16 Apr 94 pp 12, 13 NC2004124594 Istanbul NOKTA Turkish BFN ["Exclusive" interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan by NOKTA correspondent Nedret Ersanel; place and date not given -- punctuation as published] [Excerpts] [Ersanel] As far as your ministry is concerned, the question of military conscription is the subject that has most attracted the attention of the media. In fact, the argument on the situation of the students who attend the public education institutions continues. Have you begun to draft those students? They claim that, compared with the students who attend the other universities, they have been unjustly treated. [Golhan] The laws have allowed a certain degree of freedom to us. A provision to postpone the conscription of the students who attend the public education institutions does not exist. Those who are not full-time students do not have the right to postpone their conscription. However, the Ministry of National Defense, considering the fact that a need for additional troops did not exist during the initial years of the AOF, allowed them to benefit from the rights of the students in the other universities. Actually, that was the right thing to do. However, the number of troops decreased in time. The number of those who avoided conscription and the number of absentees totaled 250,000 men. The argument that was made in the media on the matter in November 1993 provided for the conscription of 30,000 men. We needed just under 210,000 men in February 1994. We do not wish to draft the young men who attend the public education institutions when those who have avoided conscription continue to apply for military service. However, we have carried out some research that has revealed that 82,000 of the students who attend the public education institution failed to pass their classes in two years. That cannot be allowed. We have refrained from drafting them during the present call-up period. However, we may do so in August and November, starting with those who have repeatedly failed. The university colleges do not attach importance to the failure of their students because they have a budget to consider. We have not drafted those students at the present time, that is, except for those who have applied for military service. [passage omitted] [Ersanel] Has there been a change in Turkey's "defense concept?" [Golhan] Turkey's neighbors are arming themselves. Furthermore, they are trying to find and acquire nuclear arms. In view of that, we have to maintain the Turkish Armed Forces' strength at a certain level. Negative developments are taking place on each side of Turkey. We maintain the same priorities in our defense concept. I do not wish to mention the names of the countries that are trying to acquire nuclear arms. Turkey's southern neighbors are making an effort in that direction, however. None of them has acquired a nuclear weapon so far. However, there are those who have long-range missiles that can reach Ankara. So, we have to take measures against that state of affairs. [Ersanel] Can you explain your viewpoint? [Golhan] We cannot lag behind them. That is all I want to say. Those who covet our territory will adopt an aggressive policy if they realize that we do not have the necessary arms to deter an aggression. Let me say the following: Turkey is the strongest country in the region from the military point of view. What I have said does not apply to the question of missiles. We do not behave contrary to UN resolutions. [Ersanel] Germany has again adopted a strong approach on the use of the arms it supplied to Turkey in southeastern Anatolia... Can you comment on that matter? [Golhan] The problem is as follows: We have acquired arms and military equipment from Russia. They are very similar to those we have acquired from Germany. That has confused the foreign journalists who visited that region. They created an uproar by saying that the arms and military equipment they saw were supplied to Turkey by Germany. We received a letter from the German minister of defense today (Friday) [15 April]. He only thanked us and said nothing else. We will acquire arms from Germany within the framework of the agreement on cooperation in the defense industry domain. He informed us that he will support Turkey. We also received a similar message from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Nevertheless, he has made several statements accusing Turkey of using the arms it has acquired from Germany. His statements have been prompted by the large number of Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] sympathizers in Germany, PKK's friendly relations with the press organs in that country, and other possible material gains. Of course, we also have to consider the elections that will be held in Germany in the near future. The German officials accused us in the past of using the arms we acquire from Germany against the Kurdish people. They have now demanded that we must not "use those arms" against the PKK either. Alright, let us not do so... We have others that we can use. We can use the arms we have acquired from the United States and Russia. [Ersanel] The United States has recently mentioned the concept of a "political solution" to the Kurdish problem in various meetings, particularly in those which have been held in Turkey... You have attended those meetings. In fact, you held talks with the U.S. officials on the matter last Thursday. Can you explain what the United States and the Western countries mean by their reference to a "political solution?" [Golhan] We heard the former People's Labor Party deputies call for a "political and democratic solution" two years ago. They then joined the Democratic Party. What do they mean by that solution? They mean to say that the "military forces cannot impose a solution." Then they should explain the solution they call for.... Unfortunately, such a solution does not exist.... The meaning behind the call for a political solution, in other words, the meaning behind the solution called for by our colleagues, is the establishment of either a separate and independent Kurdish state or the establishment of a federation in Turkey. In fact, that is also the meaning behind the "hints" that have been made by various officials. Yes, the meaning can be stretched right up to that point. However, how can that be justified when free elections are held in Turkey and people are free to trade, do business, and settle and work in any part of the country they like? Has anyone gotten in trouble for speaking Kurdish? [Ersanel] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman also mentioned the concept of a political solution in the past.... That means that what the U.S. officials have in mind is no different from what you have explained. [Golhan] Yes, what they mean is no different from what I have outlined. I met U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman on Thursday. He said: "The PKK is definitely a terrorist organization. Europe will eventually realize that." [Ersanel] Has he explained what a political solution means? [Golhan] No. The objective behind the concept of a political solution is the establishment of a federation.... That is my sincere viewpoint.
