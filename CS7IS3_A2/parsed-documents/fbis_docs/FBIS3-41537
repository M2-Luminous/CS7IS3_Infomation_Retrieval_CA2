Gu Yongbo, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environment Protection, said that now Shanghai has about 400 enterprises and institutions engaged in the research, development, design and production of environment protection facilities with more than 7,000 senior engineers and professors. The scientific development and production of the equipment involve nearly all spheres that can be subjected to pollution control. By the end of 1992, Shanghai had developed more than 300 products for pollution control and the total output value of the products was about 500 million yuan. Some of the products were exported to developed countries include Japan and the United States. Meanwhile, to provide technological data for the government to enhance pollution control and promote the development of the environment protection industry, the Shanghai Society of Environment Sciences has fulfilled a number of scientific consultancy programs such as ``the water diverting project on the upper reaches of the Huangpu river,'' ``plan for comprehensive control of air pollution in Shanghai,'' and ``forecast on Shanghai's environment in the year 2000.''
