FR940207-2-00170 FR940207-2-00078 For Further Information Contact: Courtney S. Thornton, Senior Attorney, at (202) 272&hyph;5287, or C. David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 272&hyph;3018 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). Supplementary Information: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Trust is a series company, and currently offers shares of thirteen separate series for sale to investors. 2. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company (``New York Life''), acts as administrator, principal underwriter, and distributor to all series of the Trust. 3. The Trust offers shares in nine of its existing series subject to a CDSC. The CDSC is imposed in reliance upon the Prior Orders, which exempt applicants from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder. Currently, a CDSC of up to 5% is imposed on shares of these series at the time of any redemption by a shareholder that reduces the value of the shareholder's account in the series to an amount that is lower than the amount of all payments by the shareholder for the purchase of shares during the preceding six years. Each of these series has adopted a distribution plan pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. 4. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Orders to permit the Funds to sell shares subject to a CDSC that may vary from the rate and schedule contained in the Prior Orders. No increase in the CDSC amount or extension of the applicable period will apply to shares sold prior to the issuance of an amended order. 5. The CDSC schedule may vary from Fund to Fund. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a maximum number of years prior to the exemptions, as indicated in the relevant CDSC schedule (the ``CDSC Period''), or on shares derived from reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC Period. As a result, the amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net value of the shares at the time of redemption. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, next of shares representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time.
