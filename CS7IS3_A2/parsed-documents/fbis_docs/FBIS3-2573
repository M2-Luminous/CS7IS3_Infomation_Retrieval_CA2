He said: Our province's CPPCC work mounted a new plane in 1993. The provincial party committee and the people of the whole province are satisfied with that. The tasks in 1994 for all work in the province are honorable as well as arduous, and this requires us to concentrate forces from all sides, including the CPPCC at various levels as well as broad CPPCC members, and give play to all positive factors to shape a mighty combined force to grasp reform, development, and stability. Comrade Wang Maolin indicated: The central leadership has on several occasions stressed that CPPCC work during the new historical stage must not be weakened but augmented, completed, and perfected. The CPPCC comprises representative figures from various social circles: representatives from various democratic parties are just part of them. This being the case, we should not believe that without democratic parties, the CPPCC organization would be dispensable. Comrade Wang Maolin stressed that party committees at various levels strengthening leadership in a down-to-earth way and all-out support from governments at various levels are the crux of giving full play to the CPPCC's role. To achieve this, party committees at all levels are required to include the improvement and strengthening work of the CPPCC on the agenda. They should make arrangements to hear reports on the work of the CPPCC twice a year; at the same time, they should present topics for research and assign tasks to the CPPCC. Party committees and governments at all levels should solicit opinions from CPPCC organizations before important decisions are presented. This should be shaped into the institution. In addition, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed that to give full play to the CPPCC's role, CPPCC organizations at all levels must work hard to improve their own work, especially augmenting the work of various ad hoc committees through reform and giving play to the function of CPPCC members in its entirety. In particular, he mentioned that CPPCC members who still take responsible office in party and government departments should take an active part in CPPCC activities which participate in government and discuss state affairs while doing a good job of their own work. They should not be absent from these activities arbitrarily and be members of the CPPCC in name alone.
