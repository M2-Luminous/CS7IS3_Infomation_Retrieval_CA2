This is our plain duty. We are responsible for holding elections in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. The Joint Declaration lays down that the legislature of Hong Kong in July 1997 "shall be constituted by elections". Elections have to be fair and open if the territory is to have a credible Legislative Council, capable of safeguarding Hong Kong's way of life as set out in the Joint Declaration, and the rule of law on which it depends. We wished to hold these elections on a basis agreed with the Chinese Government, with the aim of ensuring continuity. Despite a real and sustained effort on our part, over 8 months and 17 rounds of negotiation, agreement has not proved possible. By the end of 1993 it was necessary, because of the legislative timetable, to proceed with legislation in Hong Kong on the more urgent and less complex issues. Therefore, in December 1993 the Hong Kong Government introduced draft legislation on the voting age and voting method for geographical elections, and on the abolition of appointed seats in District Boards and Municipal Councils. At the same time, we made clear to the Chinese side our readiness, in the time made available by introducing legislation on the more urgent issues, to intensify discussion on the remaining, more complex issues. But our offer has not yet been taken up by the Chinese side. We must now start the legislative process on the remaining issues related to the 1995 Legislative Council elections. This White Paper is intended to inform debate -- in Parliament, in the Legislative Council and more widely -- on what is at stake. It gives a full account of what our talks with China have been about, why agreement has not been possible, and how we intend to proceed. Arrangements for the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong under British sovereignty cannot be considered in isolation. They form part of a long process of gradual development in Hong Kong's system of representative government. The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, which will come into force on 1 July 1997, between them set the pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no argument about that. They also establish that Hong Kong will retain its own, capitalist way of life after 1997, under the principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people". The wishes of the people of Hong Kong are crucial. There has been a steadily growing demand for Hong Kong people to have more say in the running of their own affairs. The first part of this White Paper summarises these developments. It also addresses a question I am often asked: why did Britain not introduce democracy to Hong Kong much earlier? The short answer is that for many years the community had other priorities. There was a deep-seated concern that the introduction of politics could lead to open clashes between Nationalists and Communists, and that this could lead China to invoke its claim to sovereignty over Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government, and through them the Governor, were of course accountable to Parliament for the administration of the territory throughout this period. A gradual development of democracy has however been under way since 1984. 18 members were for the first time directly elected to the Legislative Council in 1991. The question which confronted the new Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, on his arrival in mid-1992 was how to reconcile the clear wish in the community for further movement towards democracy with the equally strong interest in legislative arrangements which were capable of enduring beyond 1997, thus providing an important element of continuity. The Hong Kong Government's proposals of October 1992 -- made with our full support -- answered this question. They provided for a modest development of democracy. These proposals were fully compatible with the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and any relevant agreements between Britain and China. The proposals put forward by the Hong Kong Government were well received in Hong Kong. Despite the hostile Chinese reaction, we persevered with efforts to get talks underway and eventually agreed a basis for talks, which opened in April 1993. The second part of this White Paper gives a full account of these talks. It shows that we were prepared to make significant moves on two important aspects of our proposals, the Functional Constituencies and the Election Committee, provided that the overall package met our essential requirements. But there was a point beyond which we could not go if we were to achieve our objective of fair and open elections. The third part of the White Paper analyses in more detail the specific proposals advanced by both sides against that objective. The balance sheet is clear. Our proposals, even after substantial revisions in an effort to meet Chinese concerns, would produce electoral arrangements which were fair, open and, in our judgement, acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese side's proposals as they emerged in the talks would not. They proposed electoral arrangements which would have restricted choice and left the elections open to manipulation. Despite the evidence that tiny franchises can lead to corruption and vote-rigging, they proposed freezing all development in the 21 existing functional constituencies, and proposed that nine new functional constituencies should be formed in the same way. They proposed a restrictive and cumbersome system for the Election Committee to return 10 members of the Legislative Council. They proposed a voting method for the geographical constituencies which would have the effect of ensuring that the less popular parties won seats. We went as far as we could to bridge the gap. As part of that, we explored fully the possibility of an interim understanding which would allow legislation to be introduced on the most urgent issues. But the Chinese side refused to accept two elements which in our judgement were essential to fair and open elections. First, they opposed the abolition of appointed seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils in 1994/95, and indicated that the only circumstances in which they might be able to agree to this would be on the understanding that at least some of them would have to be reinstated in 1997. Second, they could not accept the single seat-single vote method for the Legislative Council geographical elections, even though they had accepted this method for the District Board and Municipal Council elections. The Legislative Council voted clearly in July 1992 that this method should apply to the Legislative Council elections, and the leaders of the two main parties confirmed their support for it in November 1993. It would have served no purpose to have tabled draft legislation that omitted this point, since members of the Council would be likely to have amended it to reflect their known views. As indicated above, the Chinese side were also unable to agree with our proposals to abolish appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils. Given the pressure of time, the Hong Kong Government introduced a Bill on these more urgent issues in December 1993. This has now been passed by the Legislative Council . Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese government. It will remain so. But we can wait no longer before legislating on the remaining electoral issues. The Governor is introducing a Bill reflecting his October 1992 proposals. These have been widely discussed in Hong Kong for over 16 months, and throughout the period have commanded wide support within most sections of the community. They have been the subject of three motion debates in the Legislative Council, and were endorsed by the Council on each occasion. It is now for the Legislative Council to pass legislation, taking full account of the views of the community, and against the background set out in this White Paper. This is a heavy responsibility, which I am confident the Legislative Council will discharge in the best interest of Hong Kong. We and the Governor have consistently said that we cannot go further, nor can we go less far, than the people of Hong Kong wish us to go. We are committed to cooperation with China on Hong Kong and to fulfilling our obligations under the Joint Declaration. It is common sense that this is the best way to promote the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and to secure a smooth transition. We look to the Chinese side to work with us to achieve this. In particular we look forward to early agreement on financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's ninth container terminal. There is also a long agenda of issues in the Joint Liaison Group which need to be dealt with if continuity in legal and technical areas is to be achieved. We shall continue to work for cooperation with China to achieve full implementation of the Joint Declaration. That is in the best interests of a successful Hong Kong after 1997. Douglas Hurd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs PART I: The Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong (a) Developments to 1984 1. The unique circumstances of Hong Kong have determined the development of its representative institutions. The policy of Her Majesty's Government in the case of most other Dependent Territories has been to promote the development of democracy in preparation for eventual independence. But independence was never a realistic option for Hong Kong. Attitudes in the community reflected this reality. When relatively modest proposals to develop democracy were made by the then Governor in the period following the Second World War, they met with virtually no public support in Hong Kong. The territory's population had increased sharply, from about 600,000 in 1945 to 2.2 million by mid-1950. Most of these were migrants from China, whose priorities were to make a decent living for themselves and their families. In these early post-war years there was widespread concern that political activity would have led to the civil war in China between the Nationalists and the Communists spilling over into Hong Kong. 2. Some constitutional development was again considered in the mid-1960s. But the Cultural Revolution in China caused disruption and uncertainty in Hong Kong. Many in the community feared that elections would lead to open rivalry between the Communists and Nationalists which would have put at risk the stability of Hong Kong (there had been Nationalist-inspired riots in Hong Kong in 1956, and Communist-inspired riots in the 1960s). Local attitudes were also influenced by the knowledge that China was opposed to the introduction into Hong Kong of party politics and elections on western lines. There was no wish to provoke China into challenging the status quo in pursuit of her standing claim to sovereignty over Hong Kong. 3. The Hong Kong Government therefore sought to develop greater popular participation in public affairs through a network of consultation boards and committees, which provided advice on all areas of government activity. Elected representation at local level was enhanced in 1973 when the Urban Council was reconstituted with a mix of elected and appointed members and granted financial autonomy. In 1982 the District Boards were established as statutory bodies on a territory-wide basis. The development of the local administrative structure was completed in 1986, with the establishment of the Regional Council with functions in the New Territories comparable to those of the Urban Council. Elections to a proportion of the seats on these bodies were on a geographical constituency basis, with all eligible residents of 21 years and over having the vote. (b) 1984-1991 4. Two issues in particular stimulated demand for a faster pace of democratisation. First, the Sino-British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong, which culminated in the Joint Declaration signed in 1984. Second, the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989. 5. The Joint Declaration set the broad framework for Hong Kong's democratic development. It laid down that the Legislature--still fully appointed in 1984--would be "constituted by elections" in 1997. With that framework in place, the Hong Kong Government issued a Green Paper as a basis for public consultation on the next stage of development of representative government. The subsequent White Paper announced that membership of the 1985 Legislative Council would be increased from 47 to 56; that official membership would be reduced from 18 to 10 and appointed membership from 29 to 22; and that 24 members should be elected indirectly 12 by an Electoral College and 12 by functional constituencies. The White Paper also noted that the consultation exercise had revealed "strong public support for the idea of direct elections but little support for such elections in the immediate future". The question of whether direct elections should be introduced at the Legislative Council elections due in 1988 was explicitly left open for consideration in a further review in 1987. 6. After 1984, there was increasing public debate on the question of elections in Hong Kong. The 1985 Legislative Council was more active than its predecessors, and debated this and other important issues openly, rather than in closed session. 7. During this period China's Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), which will enter into force on the transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997, was being developed by the Basic Law Drafting Committee, appointed by the Chinese National People's Congress in 1985. A Basic Law Consultative Committee was formed in Hong Kong to reflect the views of Hong Kong people to the Drafting Committee. A first draft of the Basic Law came out in 1988, and the Basic Law was finally promulgated in April 1990. It spells out more fully the constitutional arrangements for post-1997 Hong Kong as promised in the Joint Declaration. A "Decision of the National People's Congress", annexed to the Basic Law, set out in some detail the method for forming the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR in July 1997, including its composition. The Decision also set out the basis on which members of the Legislative Council elected in 1995 could serve through 1997 to 1999 (the so-called through train concept). The text of this Decision is at Annex 2. The provisions of the Basic Law and the associated Decision of the National People's Congress therefore have important implications for the electoral arrangements to be put in place by the Hong Kong Government before 1997, given the objective of continuity and a smooth transition of government institutions. 8. The review of developments in representative government took place in 1987. It generated considerable public interest. The Hong Kong Government published a further Green Paper. After extensive public debate, the resulting 1988 White Paper concluded that although there was wide support in the community for the principle of some directly-elected members in the Legislative Council, opinion was sharply divided as to the timing of their introduction. The Hong Kong Government decided to postpone the introduction of directly-elected members to the Council until 1991, in order to allow the changes introduced in 1985 to settle down further. The White Paper recommended an increase in the number of functional constituency seats in 1988 and the introduction of 10 directly-elected seats in 1991. 9. The events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 had a profound effect on Hong Kong opinion, strengthening support in Hong Kong for a faster pace of democracy than that laid down in the 1988 White Paper. In July 1989 the unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO) [acronym as published] recommended that one third of the Legislative Council should be directly-elected in 1991 (ie 20 seats) and not less than 50% in 1995 (ie 30 seats). This became known as the OMELCO consensus. Senior members of OMELCO came to London to press Her Majesty's Government to implement it. 10. This posed in acute form the problem of how to reconcile the clear wishes of the community for a faster pace of democratisation with the equally strong interest in continuity of the political system in Hong Kong before and after 1997. The draft of the Basic Law at that time provided for only 15 directly-elected seats in 1997. Her Majesty's Government took up this matter in a series of tough discussions with the Chinese Government in late 1989 and early 1990. The British side stressed the importance of responding to the clear desire in Hong Kong for a faster pace of democratic development by increasing the number of directly-elected members of the Legislative Council beyond that envisaged in the draft Basic Law. 11. The Chinese side eventually agreed to increase to 20 the number of directly-elected seats prescribed in the Basic Law for the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR. This was reflected in the final version of the Basic Law published in April 1990. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary confirmed to the House in February 1990 that the Legislative Council would have 18 directly-elected seats in 1991 and at least 20 in 1995. He also said that Her Majesty's Government would continue to press the case for a faster pace of democratisation. 12. The first direct elections, for these 18 seats in the Legislative Council, were held in September 1991. All 18 seats were contested. The turn-out rate was 39% of the registered electorate of 1.9 million, higher than for any previous elections in Hong Kong. The United Democrats of Hong Kong and others who had campaigned hard for more democracy won 16 of the 18 seats and over 58% of the vote, a clear expression of the community's interest in greater democracy. (c) The Governor's proposals, October 1992 13. The presence of 18 directly-elected members in the 1991 Legislative Council marked a further important step in the democratic development of Hong Kong. When Mr Patten arrived as Governor of Hong Kong in July 1992, there was a widespread view in the community that this process should be taken further in the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong under British sovereignty: those for the District Boards due in September 1994, for the Municipal Councils in March 1995 and for the Legislative Council in September 1995. There was intense speculation about the new Governor's policy on this. The pressure of public expectations, as well as the practical need to set in place in good time the necessary arrangements for these elections, meant that the Governor had to take action soon after his arrival. 14. The Governor therefore set out his proposals for political development in the years up to 1997 in his inaugural address to the Legislative Council in October 1992 (the main points are summarised at Annex 1). They were the result of wide ranging discussions in the community and had the full support of Her Majesty's Government. The simplest way to respond to the wish of the community in Hong Kong for greater democracy would have been for the Chinese Government to agree to amend the Basic Law in order to provide for a faster rate of increase in the number of directly-elected seats. Her Majesty's Government pressed the Chinese Government on several occasions to take this step. But the Chinese side maintained that the Basic Law could not be changed before it came into effect in 1997. The Governor therefore decided, with the support of Her Majesty's Government, to look for other ways of extending democratic participation, in conformity with the terms of the Basic Law. Two weeks in advance of the Governor's address, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the Chinese Foreign Minister of the substance of the proposals. The Governor subsequently wrote to a senior Chinese official, outlining these proposals and indicating his intention to explain and discuss the proposals more fully. Shortly before the Governor was due to address the Legislative Council, the Chinese side asked that the announcement of the proposals be delayed until agreement had been reached through consultations with the Chinese side. 15. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor, however, considered that it would not have been acceptable to embark on negotiations with China without the Governor having set out his approach to the Hong Kong community. The Governor emphasised to the Legislative Council that he was setting out proposals, not firm decisions, and that he wished to discuss them with Chinese representatives. The proposals were well received in Hong Kong and by international opinion. In three debates, held in October 1992, November 1992 and January 1993, the Legislative Council voted by a substantial majority in favour of the Governor's approach. In spite of the hostile reaction from China, opinion polls in Hong Kong since October 1992 have shown continuing support for the Governor's objectives. 16. The Governor went to Peking as soon after his speech to the Legislative Council as the Chinese side were able to receive him: on 20 October 1992. He explained his proposals, and again emphasised the wish of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government to discuss them with the Chinese side. But Chinese leaders refused any such discussion. They later demanded in public that the Governor should withdraw his proposals before any discussion of electoral arrangements could take place. In the following two months, the Chinese Government-controlled press in Hong Kong mounted increasingly strident attacks on the Governor and on his proposals, without offering any alternative ideas. Statements from the Chinese side cast doubt on the continuing validity after 1997 of Government contracts and franchises and suggested that China might begin to prepare alternative arrangements for the legislature in 1997. This public campaign caused anxiety in the community in Hong Kong. The stock market fell temporarily, although Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remained strong. 17. At a press conference immediately after the Governor's visit to Peking, a senior Chinese official claimed that the Governor's proposals violated agreements and understandings reached in exchanges of correspondence in early 1990 between the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and his Chinese counterpart. To set the record straight, Her Majesty's Government published the seven documents concerned in October 1992. These showed that the two sides had reached a common view that there should be eighteen directly-elected seats in the Legislative Council in 1991, but there was no agreement on electoral arrangements for 1995. These were left open for future discussion. PART II: Talks between Britain and China on Electoral Arrangements (a) Establishing a basis for talks 18. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government made clear from the outset that they were open to alternative ideas, either from the Chinese side or from people in Hong Kong. A wide range of alternative suggestions were made by groups and individuals in Hong Kong in the months after the Governor's announcement. The Hong Kong Government published in early 1993 a compendium of these alternative ideas and passed a copy to the Chinese side. This compendium was intended to assist members of the Legislative Council when they came to consider the draft legislation which would be required to give effect to the electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995. 19. The Hong Kong Government's original intention had been to submit such draft legislation to the Legislative Council in February 1993. But, early in the year Her Majesty's Government, in conjunction with the Hong Kong Government, took the initiative to repeat formally to the Chinese side that they were willing to hold talks about the electoral arrangements without preconditions. This led to intensive diplomatic contacts in Peking during February and March 1993 to explore whether a productive basis for formal talks could be found. Her Majesty's Government confirmed that they were ready for talks on the basis, as proposed by the Chinese side, of the Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between Britain and China. They also made plain that in any talks the British team would include the necessary Hong Kong Government officials, on the same basis as other officials from London and Peking. This was consistent with the practice followed in previous discussions between Britain and China, including the negotiations on the Joint Declaration and in the Joint Liaison Group. 20. The Hong Kong Government introduced into the Legislative Council in February a Bill covering one aspect of the Governor's proposals: the establishment of a Boundaries and Election Commission. This was passed into law in May 1993. In early February Hong Kong's Executive Council also endorsed draft legislation embodying the remainder of the Governor's proposals. Despite strong pressure from the community in Hong Kong for the draft legislation to be published, the Hong Kong Government held back publication for five weeks to give the contacts between the British and Chinese sides the maximum chance of success. But at the end of that time it had still not been possible to agree on an acceptable basis for the talks, or that they should start at an early date. The draft legislation was therefore published on 12 March. But it was not introduced into the Legislative Council. The publication of the draft legislation was criticised publicly by the Chinese side. However, on the basis of a further initiative from the British side, contacts resumed between the British and Chinese Governments on the holding of talks. Agreement was announced on 13 April that the talks would be held on the basis of the Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and understandings previously reached. 21. The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government in the talks was to establish whether an understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of electoral arrangements which they could commend to the Legislative Council in Hong Kong. These would need to provide: --First, that the elections in 1994 and 1995 should be fair, open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. --Second, that there should be agreement on clear, objective and acceptable criteria for the Preparatory Committee (Footnote 1) to apply in 1997 when confirming members of the Legislative Council elected in 1995 as members of the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997 (the through train). The through train was a matter of cardinal importance, since the whole rationale for the talks was to agree on arrangements which would provide continuity through 1997. Candidates and voters would need to know in 1995 what criteria would be applied by the Preparatory Committee in determining whether members of the Legislative Council could serve through 1997 for their full four-year term. Without agreed objective criteria for the through train, there would be no point in agreeing with the Chinese side detailed electoral arrangements for 1995. 22. The talks fell into four distinct phases. (b) First phase of talks: April-May 1993 (Rounds 1-3) 23. The British side (Footnote 2) explained that the talks would need to be completed in good time so that orderly arrangements could be made to hold the elections in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995; explained the Governor's proposals, noted that the Chinese side had criticised them but had not put forward ideas of their own; and sought specific Chinese proposals so that the talks could move rapidly to discussion of practical electoral arrangements; and emphasised the importance of acceptable objective criteria to ensure a through train for the Legislative Council. 24. The British side also sought assurances from the Chinese side on three further points: --Consultation on the Hong Kong membership of the Preparatory Committee. This Committee will prescribe the specific method for forming the first government and the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Fifty percent of its membership will come from Hong Kong. The British side proposed that there should be consultation between the two sides about the Hong Kong membership in the same way as there was consultation about the membership of the Airport Consultative Committee. --The ultimate aim of election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. Annex II of the Basic Law allows for that in 2007. The British side proposed that the Chinese authorities make clear that they would support universal suffrage in 2007 if that was the wish of the Special Administrative Region. --Arrangements for selecting Chief Executives of the Special Administrative Region. The Basic Law lays down that there will be a "Selection Committee" for the first Chief Executive and an "Election Committee" for future Chief Executives. The British side proposed that if the two sides reached agreement on the method of forming the Election Committee which would elect ten members of the Legislative Council in 1995, the Chinese side would use the same model for the future Selection and Election Committees for Chief Executives and that these Committees would be selected by open elections. 25. The Chinese side spent the first three rounds insisting that before discussion could move on to matters of substance, it was necessary for the two sides to reach agreement on a list of principles. They claimed that these reflected earlier agreements and understandings. In fact, these "principles" would have had the effect of prejudicing the subsequent discussion of substance. The British side took the view that in order to be productive, the talks should deal with matters of substance, that is the practical arrangements for the 1994/95 elections, on which no prior agreement had been reached. 26. At the end of the third round the Chinese side dropped their precondition about an agreement on principles, and accepted that the talks should move to matters of substance. (c) Second Phase: May-June 1993 (Rounds 4-7) 27. The second phase of the talks was taken up largely with the Chinese side moving slowly to set out their initial views on the main issues. The British side continued to press for a discussion of the through train, and of the other three issues listed in para 24 above. Footnotes 1. The Preparatory committee is, according to a Decision of the National People's Congress reproduced in Annex 2, to he established in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which would come into being on 1 July 1997. 2. The term "the British side" is used for convenience. At all stages the position put forward in the talks by Sir Robin McLaren and (for Rounds 16-17) by Mr. Christopher Hum as British Representatives, was agreed between Her Majesty's Government and the Governor, acting on the advice of his Executive Council. 28. The Chinese position on the main issues is set out in more detail in Part III. In summary, their position was: --The provisions in existing Hong Kong law disqualifying members of legislatures outside Hong Kong from serving on the District Boards, Municipal Councils or Legislative Council should be amended so that Hong Kong residents who are members of China's People's Congresses could become members of these bodies. --On District Boards and Municipal Councils, that their functions should remain unchanged and some appointed members should be retained. --On the functional constituencies, that there should be no expansion of the franchise in the existing 21 constituencies, and that the nine new constituencies should not involve a substantial increase in the size of the electorate, and should be based on corporate voting. --On the Election Committee, that the composition and ratio should follow precisely the model set out in the Basic Law, Annex I (which specifies the Election Committee that will be responsible for electing Chief Executives after 1997 and some members of the Legislative Council) but that the size of the Committee should be different (600) from that prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law (800). One effect of this would be that Hong Kong Deputies to the National People's Congress, and representatives of the Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would have seats as of right on the Election Committee, even though they had not been elected in Hong Kong. (The text of Annex I of the Basic Law is reproduced at Annex 3 of this White Paper.) (d) Third Phase: July-August 1993 (Rounds 8-9) 29. The position in late June, therefore, was that after seven rounds of talks the Chinese side had finally put forward an opening position on the main electoral issues, but one which contained significant gaps and ambiguities. They had also consistently refused to discuss criteria for the through train or the three other issues raised by the British side. Since the effect of the Chinese position would have been to ensure the minimum development of Hong Kong's political system based on restrictive electoral arrangements, there was a wide gap between the two sides. 30. The Foreign Secretary took the opportunity of his presence in the region for the Tokyo Summit to visit Peking for talks with the Chinese Foreign Minister on 8-9 July 1993. His aim was not to negotiate, but to focus the talks on the essential issues, and to stress the need for early progress. The Foreign Secretary set out the principles which would need to apply if revised electoral proposals were to meet our requirements: --On the Election Committee, that its members should be elected fairly and openly in Hong Kong, not selected; and that the arrangements for elections which took place within the Election Committee should themselves be open and fair. If agreement could be reached on these principles, the British side would be willing to consider whether an Election Committee could be devised on the basis of the composition and ratio set out in Annex I of the Basic Law. --On the functional constituencies, the electorates should be of substantial size. Experience had shown that corporate voting could lead to an individual having control over several votes in functional constituencies. With very small electorates, there was a risk of corruption, of which there had been a recent case in Hong Kong. The British side therefore proposed to maintain the gradual development of the existing 21 constituencies, and would be willing to examine proposals which could meet the requirements of both sides. The Foreign Secretary also underlined that the whole purpose of holding the talks was to achieve continuity, and that it was therefore essential to reach agreement on objective criteria for the through train. The two sides agreed to make efforts to speed up the progress in the talks. 31. In rounds eight and nine, the British side fulfilled the Foreign Secretary's undertaking by putting forward revised proposals on the Election Committee and the functional constituencies, even though the Chinese side still maintained their refusal to discuss objective criteria for the through train. The details of the revised proposals are set out in Part III of this White Paper. Part Ill also explains why the Chinese proposals on these issues were unacceptable. (e) Fourth Phase: September-November 1993 (Rounds 10-17) 32. During these rounds, the British side offered further important moves on the functional constituencies and issues related to the Election Committee (See paragraphs 35 and 77 below). The Chinese side made some minor adjustments to their position on functional constituencies. A discussion of through train criteria finally got underway. The possibility of an interim agreement dealing with the most urgent issues was fully explored. At a late stage, the Chinese side made plain that they would only be willing to reach an interim agreement if the British side undertook not to take unilateral action on any of the remaining issues under discussion. 33. The Foreign Secretary held a further meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October. The Foreign Secretary expressed disappointment at the lack of progress, despite the major moves by the British side in an effort to bridge the gap. He emphasised that the British side were working for success in the talks, but that before the talks could make further progress, it was essential that a discussion of through train criteria should begin. In response to a proposal from the Chinese side, he explained that an interim agreement on District Board and Municipal Council elections only was not attractive, since a number of the elements also applied to the Legislative Council elections (eg voting age and voting method) and should be dealt with together. The Foreign Secretary briefed the Chinese Foreign Minister on the main points relating to the talks on the Governor's Annual Address to the Legislative Council which was delivered on 6 October. 34. In his address to the Legislative Council, the Governor was careful not to breach the confidentiality of the talks. But in the light of extensive press leaks, he confirmed that the British side had put forward revised proposals on the functional constituencies and the Election Committee, conditional on reaching an acceptable overall agreement that included through train criteria. He emphasised that the British side were working for success in the talks, but that for practical reasons there were only weeks rather than months left in which to reach an agreement. 35. In the course of October, the British side put forward a further revision of their proposals for the nine new functional constituencies, taking account of points made by the Chinese side. The details are in paragraph 77 below. They also put forward new proposals on the Election Committee, accepting the Chinese position that the Committee's size should be about 600, and confirming that Hong Kong residents who were deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) would be free to stand for election to the Election Committee. 36. In late October, the Chinese side proposed that the two sides record an interim understanding on five points: that there would be no change in the nature or functions of the District Boards and Municipal Councils; that the voting age in all three tiers of elections, including the Legislative Council, should be 18; that the restriction on Hong Kong residents, who are members of Chinese People's Congresses, serving in Hong Kong's representative bodies should be lifted for all three tiers; that the voting method for the District Boards and Municipal Councils should be single-seat, single-vote; and that the two sides should record their differing view on the question of abolishing appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils. On the last point, they proposed that it should be for the Special Administrative Region Government to determine on its own the number of appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils. 37. The British side responded rapidly by developing these points into a draft Memorandum of Understanding. (The text is reproduced at Annex 4.) Given the urgency, this draft was handed over on 3 November, in advance of the following round of talks. The British Ambassador followed this up by calling on the Chinese side's Representative on 5 November. The British side explained that they had added one point of substance to the original Chinese proposal: that the single-seat, single-vote method should also apply to the Legislative Council geographical elections. Provided draft legislation on all these issues could be introduced into the Legislative Council quickly, a little more time would be gained to resolve the remaining issues. But a first stage understanding would have to include the voting method for the Legislative Council. On all the available evidence, it would not be acceptable to the Legislative Council or the community to include a proposal for the voting method for the District Boards and the Municipal Councils but exclude a similar proposal for the Legislative Council elections, particularly since other aspects of the proposed first stage understanding, such as the voting age and the lifting of the restriction on Hong Kong residents who are members of Chinese People's Congresses, were to apply to all three tiers of government, including the Legislative Council. The British side reconfirmed their understanding (which had been spelled out in the draft Memorandum of Understanding handed over on 3 November) that the formula proposed by the Chinese side would leave the British side free to abolish appointed membership in the 1994/95 elections, and that the Special Administrative Region authorities would be free in 1997 to decide whether to reinstate appointed membership. They explained that unless that was what the Chinese proposal meant, it would be of no value. The Chinese side made no attempt either on 3 November or on 5 November or at any point prior to Round 16 to contest this understanding. 38. Following a Ministerial meeting, attended by the Governor, on 10 November, the Prime Minister sent Premier Li Peng a message. He welcomed the progress which had been made towards an understanding on the most immediate issues, and indicated that for practical reasons it would be necessary to reach agreement on them very soon. The Prime Minister also noted that if it was possible to reach early agreement on these matters, there would be a little more time to tackle the more difficult issues, and proposed a more intensive final phase of the negotiations. 39. The British side therefore sought in the two rounds following this message (Rounds 16 and 17) to reach agreement on the text of a Memorandum of Understanding. Also in Round 16, in an effort to reach agreement on objective criteria for the through train, the British side handed over a draft of an extended oath of allegiance to the Special Administrative Region, to be taken by Legislative Councillors in 1997. This draft text (which is set out at Annex 5) built on points made by the Chinese side in the previous round. But the British side made it clear that it would be unacceptable for the criteria to apply retrospectively. 40. On the Memorandum of Understanding, the Chinese side refused to agree that a first stage agreement should cover the voting method for the Legislative Council geographical elections. They also said in Round 16 that their formula on appointed membership did not mean that the British side would be free to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils in 1994-95. They claimed that there had been a misunderstanding, notwithstanding the clear statements at the time by the British side on how they interpreted the formula. 41. In informal discussion during Round 17, the Chinese side put forward two texts for an oral understanding: one covered only arrangements for the Municipal Council and District Board elections; the other covered the same ground but with the addition, for the Legislative Council elections, of the voting age and the removal of the restriction on Hong Kong residents who are members of Chinese People's Congresses. The Chinese side said that in either case, if the British side would accept that the voting method for the Legislative Council should not be included in the understanding, they could accept an "agreement to disagree" formula on appointed membership that would allow the British side to abolish appointed seats in 1994/95. The formula they put forward was as follows: "The British side propose to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils with effect from September 1994 and March 1995 respectively. The Chinese side propose to retain an appropriate proportion of appointed seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils to be constituted in 1994 and 1995. The Chinese side state that, from 1 July 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will determine the number of appointed seats of the District Boards and Municipal Councils in accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law." 42. This formula was different from that put forward in Round 15, notably in the omission of the words "on its own" after the reference to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Chinese side made clear in their presentation of this proposal that if the British side insisted on abolishing appointed seats in 1994/95 the Chinese side would in the future establish an appropriate proportion of appointed seats. After 30 June 1997 the Special Administrative Region Government would, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic Law, determine on their own the number of appointed seats. It did not mean that the Special Administrative Region Government would in the future determine on their own whether to retain or abolish appointed seats; that decision would be for "the Chinese side". 43. Even if the British side had been able to accept the Chinese prerequisite for such a formula, namely the exclusion from the deal of the Legislative Council voting method--and they could not do this they could not have accepted such an understanding on appointed membership. The Chinese proposal represented an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. It should be for the Special Administrative Region authorities on their own to determine by law the composition of the "district organisations", including the question of what (if any) should be the number of appointed District Board and Municipal Council members. This should be a matter within the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong is guaranteed under both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. In addition, the Chinese side's reassertion, in the context of the discussion of a first stage agreement, that we should not legislate unilaterally on any matter not agreed with the Chinese side, remained an obstacle. 44. When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would not be possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the British draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British Representative made plain that his instructions did not give him authority to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding. But he emphasised that the British side wished to continue discussion of the remaining issues, and proposed that a further round be held in December in order to do so. The Foreign Secretary sent a message to the Chinese Foreign Minister on 30 November, confirming that for practical and political reasons it would be necessary for the Governor to introduce draft legislation on the issues covered in the draft Memorandum of Understanding to the Legislative Council in the first half of December, and to announce his intention to do so to the Legislative Council on 2 December. The Chinese response, received on 1 December, was to say that this would lead to a breakdown of the talks. The British side emphasised again in reply that they were not breaking off the talks and remained ready for further discussion of the other issues. On 2 December the Governor informed the Legislative Council that draft legislation on the first-stage issues would be gazetted on 10 December and introduced into the Council on 15 December. That legislation has now been fully debated and passed by the Legislative Council. PART III: Analysis of proposals put forward during the talks [subhead] 45. This part considers the various electoral proposals put forward by the British and Chinese sides against the essential requirements of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government: that the 1994/95 elections should be open, fair and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. Voting Age 46. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the voting age should be reduced from 21 to 18 for all elections in Hong Kong. 47. The voting age is 18 in both the UK and China, and this proposal was widely supported in Hong Kong. 48. The Chinese side took no position on this issue until Round 15, when they accepted that the voting age could be lowered to 18 for all three tiers of elections. Eligibility to stand for election 49. The Chinese side proposed that Hong Kong law should be changed to permit Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Congresses to serve in the Legislative Council and District Organisations. But the prohibition on members of other Parliaments and Councils should remain. 50. The British side agreed in Round 14 that as part of an agreed overall package, they would be willing to commend to the Legislative Council an amendment to the law to permit Hong Kong residents who were People's Congress Deputies to become members of the Legislative Council and District Organisations. In Round 16 they offered to agree, as part of a Memorandum of Understanding on the more urgent issues, to introduce legislation to that effect. District Board and Municipal Council Elections (1994/95) 51. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that all members of the District Boards and Municipal Councils should be directly-elected (except for ex-officio members in the New Territories, who are elected representatives of rural bodies). 52. Since their inception the District Boards and Municipal Councils have been moving away from a wholly appointed membership towards an elected membership. The Governor's proposal is fully consistent with the principle of open and fair elections, and of the gradual development of Hong Kong's political system. 53. The Chinese proposal made in Round 4 of the talks was that the nature, functions and method for forming the District Organisations should remain unchanged. Appointed membership should be retained. In Round 15 they proposed a small reduction in the number of appointed members (from 31.7% to 27.2% in the case of the District Boards). Later in the same round they proposed that, as part of an interim understanding on the District Boards and Municipal Councils, the two sides should record their differing views on the abolition of appointed membership, and that it should be left to the Government of the Special Administrative Region after 30 June 1997 to determine on its own the number of appointed members in accordance with law. The British side built on this proposal in producing the fifth point in the draft Memorandum of Understanding at Annex 4. This would have enabled the British side to introduce legislation to abolish appointed membership at the 1994/95 elections, without prejudice to a future decision by the Special Administrative Region authorities on whether to reinstate them. But the Chinese side made plain in Round 16, and subsequently, that they could not agree to abolition of appointed members on this basis. (A fuller account of this issue is set out in paragraphs 40-43.) The British side continues to believe that abolition of appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils is an essential part of the gradual development of Hong Kong's electoral system, particularly as the Legislative Council will be composed entirely of elected members from 1995. Legislative Council Elections (1995) The "Through Train" 54. The British side proposed in Round 1 of the talks that the only necessary qualification for legislators elected in 1995 to continue in office until 1999 should be a pledge of allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and a pledge to uphold the Basic Law. This would be exactly the same requirement as that set out in Article 104 of the Basic Law for Special Administrative Region Government officials, Executive and Legislative Councillors and members of the judiciary on taking office. 55. The Chinese side initially took the position that they would only be willing to discuss criteria for the through train when they were satisfied that the composition of the 1995 Legislative Council would conform to their interpretation of the Basic Law. They also pointed out that according to the Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method for the formation of the First Government and the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (reproduced at Annex 2) it would be for the Preparatory Committee to confirm members of the Legislative Council as members of the first Special Administrative Region legislature. 56. In Round 13, the British side suggested a method for achieving early promulgation of objective criteria, consistent with the role laid down in the Basic Law for the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Preparatory Committee. This would involve the two sides reaching agreement on criteria; the Chinese Government recommending this to the NPC Standing Committee for approval and promulgation before the 1995 elections; and the NPC Standing Committee deciding that these criteria--and no other--should be used in 1997 for confirming members of the Legislative Council. The Chinese side said that they could not accept this proposal, but that it should be possible to find a solution. In the event, they did not propose any alternative. 57. In Round 15, the Chinese side did, however, finally respond to the British side's proposal on through train criteria. In addition to meeting the straightforward requirements in the Basic Law, including a pledge of allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Chinese side proposed that in order to "uphold the Basic Law" a Legislative Councillor would need to: --Love China and love Hong Kong; --Uphold the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong; --Be dedicated to bringing about a smooth transition and transfer of power in 1997; --Support the "one country--two systems" principle; --Not commit (or have committed--the tense was ambiguous in the Chinese statement) actions such as opposing the Basic Law, or participating in or leading activities such as attempting to overthrow the Chinese Government or undermining the socialist system on the mainland. 58. The British side noted that all these points were already covered by the Basic Law. But the essential point was that any criteria should be forward-looking; it would be unacceptable to have any test of past political views or actions. In a further effort to take account of the Chinese side's wish for a detailed set of criteria, the British side put forward in Round 16 a draft of an extended oath to be taken in 1997. (The text is at Annex 5.) It builds on the Chinese side's points, and makes clear that it applies to future behaviour. The Chinese side made no response to this proposal. Voting Method in Legislative Council Geographical Constituencies 59. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that there should be 20 members directly elected from 20 single-seat geographical constituencies. 60. The single-seat, single-vote method is simple, and preserves a clear link between the electorate in each constituency and their elected representative. The Hong Kong electorate is accustomed to this system of voting, which is already used in the Municipal Council and most District Board elections. 61. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that for the 20 Legislative Council geographical seats, there should be 20 members directly elected from the existing nine geographical constituencies using the multi-seat, single-vote method. They refused to accept the single-seat, single-vote method for the Legislative Council, even though they agreed that it should be used for all Municipal Council and District Board elections in 1994-95. 62. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government, the multi-seat, single-vote system would not provide a fair and open system. It would artificially freeze the constituencies as they were demarcated in 1991, taking no account of demographic trends in Hong Kong. It also appears to be designed to ensure that seats go to parties winning small percentages of the vote. In 1992 the Hong Kong Legislative Council itself voted in favour of the single-seat, single-vote system for Legislative Council elections and in November 1993 the main political parties reaffirmed their support for it. Election Committee 63. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government consider that if the election of ten members of the Legislative Council by an Election Committee is to be fair, open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong, two essential requirements will need to be satisfied: --That members of the Election Committee should be elected fairly and openly in Hong Kong. --The arrangements for the elections of ten members of the Legislative Council by the Election Committee should themselves be open and fair. 64. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the Election Committee should draw all or most of its members from the directly-elected District Boards; and that the Election Committee should be able to vote for any qualified candidate, not just for members of the Election Committee. 65. This proposal meets the two essential requirements. It would also provide a simple solution, since no new electoral machinery would be needed. 66. The Chinese side's proposal (tabled in Round 7 of the talks and later clarified, in response to repeated questions from the British side, in Round 14) was that: --The composition and ratio of the Election Committee should follow precisely the four-sector model set out in paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (notwithstanding the fact that paragraph 2 of Annex II makes clear that the Election Committee for the first Legislative Council is not the same as that provided for in Annex I) but the size of the Committee should be about 600, not 800 as in paragraph 2 of Annex I. --The voting method would be that each of the four sectors would elect three candidates for election by the Election Committee to Legislative Council making twelve in all. Candidates would not have to be members of the Election Committee, but would have to come from the relevant sector. The election of these three candidates in each sector would be by block vote, using a simple majority system. All members of the Election Committee would then elect 10 of the 12 to become members of the Legislative Council by simple majority. 67. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government the Chinese side's proposals do not meet the essential requirements and would not therefore provide a fair and open method of election. It should be noted in this context Annex I of the Basic Law requires that the Election Committee after 1997 should be formed in accordance with the principles of "democracy and openness". 68. Following precisely the composition for the fourth sector set out in paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law raises two problems. First, the Basic Law model includes members of the present Legislative Council, not all of whom have been elected. Second, it includes the Hong Kong Deputies to the National People's Congress and representatives of Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These people have not been elected openly and fairly in Hong Kong; to include them in the Election Committee simply by virtue of their membership of these non-Hong Kong bodies would be a major breach of the requirement that the Election Committee should be composed of people who had themselves been elected openly and fairly in Hong Kong. It would mean that part of the Election Committee was produced in an undemocratic way. 69. The voting method proposed by the Chinese side is self-evidently restrictive and cumbersome. 70. Following the Foreign Secretary's meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister in July 1993, the British side introduced in Round 8 of the talks a revised proposal on the Election Committee. In a major move towards the Chinese position, this accepted that the Election Committee should be composed of four sectors on the lines set out in Annex I of the Basic Law. The first three sectors would be elected by groups of functional constituencies. Electors in each functional constituency would then elect a specified number of members to the Election Committee, as well as a functional constituency representative to the Legislative Council. On the fourth sector, the British side proposed that it should be returned by members of the District Boards, the Municipal Councils and the Heung Yee Kuk (Footnote 3). They made clear that for the reasons noted above, it would not be appropriate for members of the 1991 Legislative Council, or Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to serve on the Election Committee simply by virtue of their membership of these bodies. During Round 14, in another effort to narrow the gap, the British side confirmed that Hong Kong residents who were deputies to the NPC and CPPCC would be free to stand for election to the Election Committee; and accepted the Chinese proposal that the size of the 1995 Election Committee should be about 600, as part of an overall package deal. 71. On voting method, the British side proposed that the functional constituencies would elect the first three sectors by the block-vote method, ie each functional constituency elector would have as many votes as the number of members to be returned by that functional constituency. Elections within the Election Committee would use the single transferable vote method. Any registered voter who was eligible to serve on the Legislative Council would be eligible for election by the Election Committee, provided he or she secured at least five nominations by Election Committee members. 72. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government, this revised proposal, although less simple than the Governor's original proposal, would meet the essential requirements by ensuring that the Election Committee would be elected by people who had been elected fairly and openly in Hong Kong, through either the functional constituencies or the District Boards, and that the elections inside the Election Committee would take place in an open and fair manner. Functional Constituencies 73. The Hong Kong Government's 1988 White Paper defined functional constituencies as representing sectors of substantial size and importance in Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government consider that if the functional constituency system is to meet the requirements of fairness and openness, there are two lessons to be learnt from recent experience. First, corporate voting, which is now used in electing 11 of the 21 functional constituency seats, can lead to an individual having effective control over several votes in functional constituencies. Second, the very small electorates in some of the existing constituencies lead to a risk of corruption, of which there has been a recent example in Hong Kong. It is therefore necessary to provide for constituencies of a substantial size. Footnotes 3. The Heung Yee Kuk represents the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories. 74. The Governor's proposals in October 1992 took account of these points. He proposed that for the 21 existing functional constituencies, the process of gradual development should be maintained by replacing all forms of corporate voting with individual voters. For the nine new functional constituencies, the Governor proposed that the simplest and fairest approach would be to define them so that they included the entire working population. On that basis, the Governor proposed nine constituencies based on the existing classification of industrial and commercial sectors. 75. The Chinese side's proposals, put forward in Round 6 of the negotiations, were that the composition and voting method of the existing 21 functional constituencies should remain precisely as they were in 1991, retaining the concept of corporate voting. They proposed that the nine new functional constituencies should be: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association; one extra seat for the existing Labour Functional Constituency; agriculture and fisheries; textiles and garments; Importers and Exporters Association; Kai Fong Welfare Associations; insurance; maritime; and sports. These constituencies should also be based on corporate voting. 76. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government, the Chinese side's proposals would not deal adequately with the problems associated with corporate voting and very small constituencies. The nine new constituencies they were proposing would add only about 20,000 voters to the franchise of 110,000 for the existing 21 constituencies. Some of their specific proposals also failed to meet the requirements for functional constituencies. Kai Fong Associations are not economic or professional groups of importance in the community. They would in any case yield a tiny functional constituency since there are only some 60 such associations in Hong Kong. The proposal for a Chinese Enterprises Association constituency is inconsistent with Hong Kong's general approach of treating all investors and enterprises in the same way, regardless of national origin. It could be divisive to create constituencies on the basis of "national" interests rather than economic and professional groups. Many Chinese enterprises are already registered electors in other functional constituencies. The Chinese proposal for an Insurance Functional Constituency could only be formed by splitting the existing Financial Services Constituency which was already very small. Given the small number of authorised insurers in Hong Kong (229) the insurance constituency by itself would be tiny. In later rounds, the Chinese side hinted that they might be prepared to be flexible on the number of corporate voters within a corporate voting system. But they were never specific. The British side's view remains that corporate voting should in all cases be replaced by individual voting, for the reasons given above. 77. The British side put forward revised proposals on the nine new functional constituencies in Round 9. These took account of the Chinese proposal that functional constituencies should all be based on organisations, and also built on six of the nine specific Chinese proposals. In subsequent rounds, the British side offered a number of further revisions to their list of functional constituencies, in a major effort to bridge the gap. After these amendments, the British side's nine proposed constituencies were: --Textiles and Garment --Wholesale/Retail and Import/Export --Manufacturing --Agriculture and Fisheries --Transport --Utilities and Communications --Services --Sports, Culture and Entertainment --Lands/Works/Housing and Construction The total franchise for the 30 functional constituencies on this basis would be some 840,000. 78. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government, these revised proposals, as part of an overall package, would still meet the minimum requirements of fair and open functional constituency elections based on constituencies of substantial size and importance in the community. Nationality Provision 79. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that the Hong Kong Government should implement the nationality provision of the Basic Law in 1995, two years before the Basic Law comes into force. This provides that permanent residents of the Region, who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries, may be elected to the Legislative Council "provided that the proportion of such members does not exceed 20% of the total membership of the Council". 80. The British side made clear that it would not be possible to discriminate in this way against British nationals, in elections held in 1995 while Hong Kong was still under British sovereignty. The nationality status of individual members of the legislature could change between the elections in 1995 and 1 July 1997. But the British side said that they would be willing to discuss any Chinese ideas as to how this provision might be implemented after I July 1997, in the unlikely event that more than 20% of members were at that time foreign nationals or held right of abode outside Hong Kong. PART IV: Conclusion and the way forward 81. As the preceding section makes clear, many of the individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves, technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides was simple. The proposals put forward by Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government were, in essence, designed to produce a Legislative Council and District Organisations that would truly represent the interests of Hong Kong and its community, thereby embodying the concept "Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people". The Chinese side wanted far more restrictive electoral arrangements, with far fewer voters. The smallest of their proposed new functional constituencies would have had an electorate of under 100. Such arrangements could be manipulated and would not, in the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government, guarantee elected institutions likely to reflect in undistorted form the interests of the people they represent. 82. The argument has been made that an agreement should be reached at any cost, on the grounds that the consequences of failure to reach agreement would be too serious. As this White Paper explains, Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government have done everything possible to try to secure an acceptable agreement. But they do not consider that a flawed agreement would be better than none. The consequences for Hong Kong of the electoral arrangements proposed by the Chinese side would themselves be very serious. 83. The central objective of the Joint Declaration is to preserve Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and the open society on which these are based. At the heart of this, and of Hong Kong's success over the years, is the rule of law, and equally important the confidence in Hong Kong itself and internationally, that this will be maintained after 1997. It is difficult to envisage the maintenance of the rule of law in a community where the legislative body is neither fairly elected nor free from the possibility of manipulation. 84. Fairly and openly elected representative institutions are also necessary to protect other fundamental aspects of Hong Kong's way of life. The level playing field for business, which has brought so much prosperity to Hong Kong, and from which so much of its international reputation derives, depends in the last resort on the ability of the Legislative Council to ensure that Hong Kong's economic and social needs, and not closed-door pressures from vested interests, determine how money is spent. Likewise, Hong Kong's success in recent decades has owed much to its ability to root out corruption. The introduction of electoral structures or practices which cast doubt on the integrity of the Legislative Council could threaten that success. 85. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government regret that it has not been possible to reach agreement with the Chinese Government on these issues. In the absence of such an agreement, it is the firm view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government that Hong Kong's best interest lies in making electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995 which carry forward the already agreed and established process of democratic development, which are themselves open and fair, and which can command the broad support of the people of Hong Kong. 86. Within the limits of these principles, the British side were prepared to offer revised proposals during the talks, in an effort to secure an acceptable overall package, including agreed through train criteria. We tried every means to give the talks the best possible chance of success. We tried to secure a first stage agreement on the simpler and more urgent issues. When it became clear that this could not be achieved, we introduced separate legislation on these issues to create more time for talks to continue on the other issues. We have now come to a point where we must get on with legislation on these remaining issues. 87. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government have given careful consideration to the basis on which that legislative process might begin. We would have been prepared to commend to the Legislative Council the revised package of proposals, if we had secured an overall agreement with the Chinese side, including the through train. But such agreement proved out of reach. The Governor's October 1992 proposals, on the other hand, have been the subject of three motion debates in the Legislative Council and were endorsed on each occasion. Throughout the last 16 months they have been widely discussed, and they command wide support within most sections of community. They are also compatible with the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, and do not breach any past agreements between the British and Chinese Governments. They thus remain our preferred basis for beginning the legislative process. The Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council and the support of Her Majesty's Government, has now decided to introduce into the Legislative Council a bill based on that package. 88. Constitutionally, the Legislative Council has the responsibility to pass legislation for the 1994 and 1995 elections. It will have before it the Hong Kong Government's Bill, as well as other ideas that have emerged in the community, and in the context of talks with the Chinese side, in the past 16 months. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor have said repeatedly that they do not wish to go further, or less far, than the people of Hong Kong wish them to go. We are confident that the Legislative Council, in discharging its heavy responsibility, will take full account of the wishes of Hong Kong people.
