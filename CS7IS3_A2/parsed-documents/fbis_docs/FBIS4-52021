Japan and the United States Are in a State of Drift It is attributable to the bureaucrats that Japan did not compromise at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Noticing this, the Clinton administration is assuming an attitude "of neglect" toward Japanese bureaucrats. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Kantor has given strict orders to Under Secretary of State Joan Spero, Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, and other members of under secretary-class in charge of negotiations with Japan "not to meet with Japanese bureaucrats." On the other hand, Japan has not changed its principle that "numerical targets should never be accepted" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs). An uncompromising argument is spreading within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] that "for at least the next two years, while President Clinton is in power, it will be impossible to have serious talks with the U.S. Government." Sources in the U.S. State Department say without doubt that "Japan-U.S. relations are in a state of drift." Presently, Japan-U.S. relations are similar to the "game of chicken" performed by James Dean and his rival in the movie Rebel Without a Cause. In the game, the one who takes the most risks becomes the winner. In the movie, a tough guy who was supposed to be the winner dies in an accident. In the game of chicken there is no real winner. The United States has come through difficult international negotiations such as arms reductions with the former USSR, and with the end of the Cold War is focusing its attention on the Japanese market. Japan has undertaken a policy of concentrating authority with the economic bureaucrats. We have now entered an era when the two countries, Japan and the United States, compete with one another in "economic" field. In the United States, business circles and Congress, which are asking that Japan open its market and show objective criteria to ensure that its trade surplus is being reduced, are also putting pressure on the Clinton administration. In Japan, political leaders have been entrusting negotiations to the bureaucrats who claim "it is suicidal for Japan to introduce macroeconomics and establish numerical targets in an individual sector." Anxiety exists in both Japan and the United States. Even within the Clinton administration, which has been saying positively that "the lack of success in the economic talks does not affect Japan-U.S. relations as a whole," a voice is beginning to be raised that, "if no agreement is reached at the next summit, we are not sure what will become of Japan-U.S. relations". According to this logic, the Japan-U.S. summit to be held in Naples in July during the G-7 meeting will be the time limit to avoid the crisis. Japanese Politicians Rely on Bureaucrats' Judgment Japanese bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance and MITI do feel anxiety that Asia and the world may be affected should discord arise between Japan and the United States, which both possess 40 percent of the world's gross national product and which are both deepening their interdependent relations in international finance and industry. Despite the potential crisis, the United States maintains its request that numerical targets be established, and the Japanese bureaucrats refuse this request. Together with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Hata has relied totally on the judgment of the bureaucrats since he was foreign minister. The U.S. strategy toward Japan is clear. The United States intends to drag down from negotiations those bureaucrats who are causing delays in deregulating the Japanese market, who are asking that the prime minister increase rather than reduce taxes, and who negotiate directly with political leaders. The real intention of the United States is to negotiate directly with Prime Minister Hata and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is an embarrassment to the Japanese bureaucrats with his "ready-to-compromise" attitude toward the United States, and by all means to attain visible results. However, leading Foreign Ministry officials seem to be confident, saying, "Hata even argued down USTR Kantor when Kantor claimed that past commercial negotiations were not fruitful. It is impossible for Hata to accept numerical targets." Ozawa played the role of mediator at the recent cellular phone talks, bringing about this political solution. Criticism was raised in the United States that "the USTR had cooperated in clearing Motorola's outdated analog mobile phone stock." It has become necessary for Japan Mobile Communication Co., Ltd. to make double capital investments in order to introduce digital mobile phones. Bureaucrats claim a "political solution" is not necessarily the best solution. Even if the economic framework talks were reopened in a similar style, the result would be fruitless and there would be no winner. There would be left only a feeling of distrust, and Japan-U.S. relations would be further aggravated. It would be for the worst if discord is created between Japan and the United States, especially in light of the nuclear suspicions involving the DPRK, which is likely to require much time to solve, and the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula. To Open Its Market Is Japan's International Responsibility What is required of the new administration is to neither compromise one-sidedly nor refuse totally. Aside from numerical targets requested by the United States, it is Japan's own international responsibility to "open the Japanese market." It is beneficial if government institutions purchase U.S.-made supercomputers and medical instruments which are based on fair appraisals and which are more competitive than Japanese products. It is moral for automobile manufacturers doing business in a free market to voluntarily open their network to foreign automobile manufacturers and to purchase foreign-made parts at a lower price. The United States is asking Japan to open its pension market. The Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation and investment advisory companies also admit that the pension burden of the people and enterprises will be reduced if the regulations placed by the Ministry of Finance are removed, and if they can freely entrust the operation of their public pensions and private enterprise annuities to European and American investment advisory companies and financial institutions which can earn higher returns through investment in assets. In short, the capability of the political leaders is to be tested by whether or not they can direct the bureaucrats to "give priority to consumers," which is a matter of course. Though the Hata coalition government claims it will follow the lines of the Hosokawa administration, it is also possible that the new administration might adopt an easygoing manner, thinking "it is merely playing the role of a transitional government." If the new administration follows the same style in dealing with the United States, it could cause a calamity. The leadership is in a serious position to take responsibility.
