Right now, and at the request of President Guillermo Endara, PA presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber and PA leader Carlos Rodriguez are meeting with him at the Presidency of the Republic. When she arrived at the Presidency, Dona Mireya Moscoso de Gruber talked to reporters and commented on the possible withdrawal of the current Molirena ministers. [Begin recording] [Gruber] The president will have to make this decision, and it will be a hard decision to make. Members of Molirena, as well as members of the Authentic Liberal Party and the PA, have served to support his government. Therefore, I believe the president must choose what is best the country -- not for his party or for himself -- at this time. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the government will work the same if Molirena is not in the government alliance? [Gruber] We, the Arnulfists, feel a bit uncomfortable with the situation, because the members of Molirena are now going to be in the opposition. I believe the government will not work properly without them. Nevertheless, the president must make the decision, and we should leave it in his hands. [Reporter] Will the Arnulfists make any recommendations on this issue? [Gruber] No, we have not talked to the president yet. [Reporter] Is that the reason for today's meeting? [Gruber] The president called me and said he wanted to talk to me. I will learn the reason for the meeting when I meet with him. [end recording] Mireya Moscoso also acknowledged that the president and his government team will be faced with a difficult task if Molirena withdraws from the government. [Begin recording] [Gruber] President Endara's relations with the Legislative Assembly will be difficult. However, I hope the legislators will act to help the country and not a specific party. Their responsibility is to further the good of the country, not to further their own interests. That is why they were elected. [Reporter] Has President Endara's government been weakened with the latest events and with Molirena's possible withdrawal from government? [Gruber] I do not think so. The PA is a big party. We demonstrated it yesterday when more than 100,000 people backed us at Santa Ana. Those people are the president's political backing. [end recording]
