FR940204-1-00047 FR940204-1-00004 Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that results of a stress analysis check have revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to cracking of the support structure of the aileron drive quadrant, and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. Jetstream has issued Series 4100 Service Bulletin J41&hyph;53&hyph;011, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure below the flight compartment floor. This modification involves reinforcing the upper and lower support diaphragms of the aileron drive quadrant support structure by installing a new lower support bracket on the lower diaphragm and a new doubler plate on the upper diaphragm. The modification also includes performing functional tests of the aileron and elevator controls, and an operational test of the autopilot system. Accomplishment of the modification will increase the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure for the tail-to-wind gust load design case and will ensure the structure meets the strength requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure below the flight compartment floor. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $1,100 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket.
