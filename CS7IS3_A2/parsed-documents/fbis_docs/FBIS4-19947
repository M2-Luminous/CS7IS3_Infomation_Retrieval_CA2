Italian farm organizations consider this accord insufficient and in a joint communique, Coldiretti [National Confederation of Small Farmers], CIPA [Italian Confederation of Agricultural Experts], and Confagricoltura [General Confederation of Italian Agriculture] today insisted that the new international regime for farm products would prove deleterious for this primary sector in Italy and especially for those particularly Mediterranean products such as wine, olive oil, olives, fruit and vegetables. These organizations are calling for a reform of the relevant joint market organizations within the European Union [EU] and revised guidelines which take into account the increase in EU resources that will be brought about by Community enlargement to include Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria.
