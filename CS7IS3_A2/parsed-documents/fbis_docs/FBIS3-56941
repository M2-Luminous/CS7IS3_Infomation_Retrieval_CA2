Once again, as during the previous round in Geneva and Brussels, a great opportunity to reach agreement has been wasted." This is how Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative and deputy minister of foreign affairs, assessed the outcome of the talks on a Bosnian settlement which ended here today, and which were attended by the delegations of the conflicting sides -- the Muslims, Serbians, and Croatians -- and the presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Although co-chairmen Turvala Stoltenberg and David Owen proposed solutions and approaches which could be "satisfactory in order to stop the war," no compromise was achieved, the Russian diplomat noted, speaking to journalists in Geneva's Palais des Nations. V. Churkin, who met the representatives of the various sides during his stay in Geneva, describes the agreement signed today between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia on the opening of official missions in Belgrade and Zagreb as "an important step in their relations." It may lead to the emergence of "a more positive atmosphere for solving major issues," in particular the problem of Krajina.
