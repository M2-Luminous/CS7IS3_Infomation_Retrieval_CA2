In this news bulletin we present a report on this event. [Begin recording] [Shushkevich] Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with the results of the visit. [passage omitted] [Kebich, in Russian] I should like to say that the government took an active part in setting up the program of the visit, and this question was agreed upon personally between Stanislav Stanislavavich [Shushkevich] and me. The government commission was headed by Mikalay Dzmitryevich Myasnikovich -- he is here -- and the visit was well organized. We discussed many topics. [passage omitted] [indistinct passage] [Shushkevich, in Russian] First of all, I want to note that the question of compensation for the (?fissionable) material being removed was raised during the talks for a third time. We received an assurance during the talks with Senators Lugar and Nunn, then in talks with Mr. Christopher. Today the position was categorically confirmed by the U.S. side. This position was agreed upon with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. We, and the U.S. side, raised the question many times. So, now it is a question of formulating specific accords. Now I would like to tell the esteemed correspondent: The question should not be asked as to whether the positions were agreed upon between the government and the Supreme Soviet at the talks. That is an incorrect way of putting the question, because we were one and the same [word indistinct], we have no differences of view when it is a matter of the interests of the Republic of Belarus. There is no difference, there never was and never will be, because it is senseless and useless. [passage omitted elaborating on this; Kebich agreeing with him] [Kebich, in Russian] I can just add to what Stanislav Stanislavavich said, that before the visit of Mr. Clinton I received a letter from Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, saying that Russia will take part in payment of this sum from the sale of the uranium belonging to the Republic of Belarus. But as for this sum, I do not want to name it -- this sum is subject to an agreement, but I want to say that this sum will be sufficiently large to support the economic condition of our republic. To put it briefly, it will be equal to the equivalent of the nuclear weaponry being removed. [passage indistinct] [Kebich, in Russian] We have an interest in strengthening interaction with NATO countries. We absolutely exclude the possibility of political interference in our internal affairs, and therefore, we have a very correct approach to those specific proposals that are due to be included in the declaration, as you understand, and in order to express our attitude to Partnership for Peace with the NATO countries, we must conclude a declaration with NATO, and in this declaration there must be a certain number of articles. There is a proposal from the Defense Ministry on this issue, but we specifically did not bring them into our negotiations. I think that this a subject for discussion in parliamentary commissions and in the government. We are working out our attitude to this matter. [Shushkevich, in Russian] We did not bring in these questions, since I knew that these questions of (?foreign) policy activity are questions that are in the competence of the Supreme Soviet. [passage indistinct] [Shushkevich, in Belarusian] Bill Clinton made a good statement at the beginning our talks, that he would not want in any way to give us advice how to act here in Belarus in solving the main political questions. And I am grateful to him for this. [passage omitted] [end recording]
