FR940622-2-00013 FR940622-2-00007 [C&hyph;412&hyph;811] Notice of Court Decision: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From the United Kingdom AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annika L. O'Hara or Julie Anne Osgood, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4198 and (202) 482&hyph;0167, respectively. SUMMARY: On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') that United Engineering Steels, Ltd. (``UES'') was being subsidized by reason of subsidies previously bestowed on a government-owned company which sold one of its productive units to UES in an arm's-length transaction. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In its Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From the United Kingdom, 58 FR 6237 (January 27, 1993), the Department determined that subsidies previously bestowed on the British Steel Corporation (``BSC'') passed through, in part, to UES, a joint-venture company, when UES purchased one of BSC's productive units in an arm's-length transaction. The Department's determination was challenged. The Department subsequently requested, and was granted, a remand in order to reconsider its final determination. On remand, the Department adopted its reasoning in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From the United Kingdom, 58 FR 37393 (July 9, 1993), in which it determined that part of the price UES paid for the productive unit purchased from BSC constituted payment for prior subsidies. On June 7, 1994, in Inland Steel Bar Co. v. United States, (`` Inland Steel ''), Slip Op. 94&hyph;93, the CIT overturned the Department's determination that previously bestowed subsidies are passed through to a successor company sold in an arm's-length transaction. In its decision in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. section 1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in Inland Steel on June 7, 1994, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final affirmative determination. Publication of this notice fulfills the Timken requirement. Accordingly, the Department will continue to suspend liquidation pending the expiration of the period of appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision. Absent an appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the countervailing duty order will be revoked effective June 17, 1994. Dated: June 16, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15179 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
