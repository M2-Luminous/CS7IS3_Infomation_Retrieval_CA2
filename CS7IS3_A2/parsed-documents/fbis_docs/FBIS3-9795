"We came to the conclusion that there are no reasons for special protection of Deputy Meciar," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan Simko told journalists today. He said that under the law Meciar had the right to a personal bodyguard for three months and after that he could ask new Premier Jozef Moravcik to confirm the permission for his personal protection. The Slovak Government today dismissed Anna Nagyova, Meciar's close co-worker, from the post of the head of the premier's Secretariat. The cabinet also approved the proposal by Vice Premier Brigita Schmognerova for the dismissal of Chairman of the Slovak Statistics Office Rudolf Krc. Stefan Condik was proposed as new chairman. The proposal of Krc's dismissal and the appointment of his successor now has to be approved by the president.
