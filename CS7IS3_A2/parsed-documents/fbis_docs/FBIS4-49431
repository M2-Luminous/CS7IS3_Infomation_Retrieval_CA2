What is the present situation of public order in rural areas after all? This is an issue about which people are universally concerned. Since reform and opening up, party committees, governments, and functional departments in various localities have focused closely on economic construction as the central task, persisted in building the material and spiritual civilizations simultaneously, and put into comprehensive effect various measures for the overall control of social security, so that the public order situation in rural areas is generally stable. People longing for stability and good order are the mainstream of rural society at present. It is also necessary, however, to note calmly that the public order problem remains comparatively conspicuous in some rural areas. A small number of places are in a state of chaos, and the situation in a few places -- where peasants have expressed strong feelings of dissatisfaction -- is relatively serious. What are the manifestations of prominent problems concerning social security in rural areas at present? In recent years, crime has increased continuously in rural areas. In a few places, serious cases of violence -- including murders, explosions, injuries, and other incidents -- have increased by a larger margin than in cities. According to statistics, there were more than 1.61 million cases of crime throughout the country in 1993. Of this total, serious offenses exceeded 530,000. In rural areas, the total number of cases exceeded 750,000, and serious cases numbered more than 160,000. Various kinds of evil forces -- including "village tyrants [ba 7218]," "land tyrants," "water tyrants," "grain tyrants," and so -- on have emerged in a small number of rural areas and become a ferocious force that has jeopardized social security. Some of them have even become gangs of an underworld nature. According to the study and analysis of these gangs, it has been discovered that a great majority of them are composed primarily of former criminals who were released after having served their prison terms, but who refuse to mend their evil ways. They have rounded up groups of rural hooligans who were idling about and doing indecent things. These groups have gathered together, acting like overlords [ba 7218] and endangering public order in rural areas. Some gangs have engaged in frenzied criminal activities, such as theft, robbery, rape, blackmail, and so on. "Train robbers and highwaymen" have run rampant, darting here and there to commit crimes, and seriously affecting rural economic development. Criminals have conducted their evil activities unscrupulously and in broad daylight, which has made passengers and drivers tremble with fear. The problem of lawbreaking activities conducted by people from other localities is particularly conspicuous in those areas that are relatively developed economically. It has been learned that in the river valley areas of northern and southern Jiangsu, the alien population accounted for more that 60 percent of the crimes committed, and for more than 80 percent in some areas. As "nowhere under the sun is a better place to make money than Guangdong," in a large number of cities and counties in the economically developed Zhu Jiang Delta area, convicts on the run and the alien population accounted for more than 70 percent of the crimes committed, with the figure reaching 95 percent in some localities. Activities aimed at seizing properties, which include stealing or looting the facilities of state key construction projects, oil fields, power stations, waterworks, and other installations, as well as railroad and highway materials, are extremely serious. Incidents of armed fighting by the masses, which were triggered by disputes over land, forests, irrigation, roads, clans, and other causes, have increased. According to statistics from the public security departments or bureaus in 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, there were more than 600 cases of mass armed fighting in rural areas in 1993, which caused some 100 deaths, approximately 1,000 inuries, and direct economic losses amounting to more than 6 million yuan. The forces of rural patriarchal clans have revived in some areas, and activities related to feudal superstition and reactionary secret societies have gained ground to some extent. In a small number of areas, there emerged a situation in which clan forces even stood up as equals to grass-roots party and government organs, in a vain attempt to take their places. The ugly social phenomena of practicing prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, and gambling -- among others -- are spreading in rural areas, and such lawbreaking activities as abducting and selling women and children are very serious too. II. In the course of covering news at the grass-roots level, this reporter has learned that the increase in law-and-order problems in the countryside was brought about by complicated factors, but the primary reason was the ineffectiveness of leading bodies. In some localities, rural cadres paid attention only to economic work, while neglecting public order and the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. As a result, law and order in some rural areas is out of control. In particular, some grass-roots party branches and village committees were not well-organized, were weak and loose, or even were paralyzed. This resulted in a situation in which no one was responsible for the maintenance of law and order. In some places, there was no village committee or village party branch at all, still less any organizations for public security and order. Some local public security committees existed in name only, and did not perform any function. As some people described the situation: "Good guys dissolved their organizations, and bad guys ganged up to do evil." In the second place, the actual input of human and material resources into the maintenance of law and order in rural areas was far insufficient as compared with actual needs. This found expression in the fact that social management and public security functions were weakened; the comprehensive measures for the maintenance of law and order were not implemented effectively; the forces for guaranteeing public security in rural areas were insufficient, their organization was loose, and their management and operation were disorderly; and insufficient attention was paid to security work, the means were ineffective, and input was insufficient. The large population and insufficient land caused a large number of surplus rural laborers, and the ineffective management of this population was also a major factor in the chaotic law-and-order situation. Although the surplus labor force was somewhat reduced -- thanks to employment offerred by town and township enterprises and by laborers traveling away from their homes to do business and seek work -- many people in the countryside remained idle and were apt to become lawbreakers. Some of these people ganged up to do evil and harm the security of local communities. There are signs that crimes committed by peasants account for an increasing proportion of urban crime, and a large number of jobless peasants make up the "reserve force" for urban crime. The rapid expansion of people's desire for consumer goods and their relatively low income formed a sharp contrast, and this also made some people lose their psychological balance and degenerate into lawbreakers. This tendency was particularly obvious among some peasants who had a weak sense of morals and the law. They tended to fulfill their desires for getting rich by means of breaking the law. In addition, although the peasant masses -- as compared with urban residents -- gained real benefits from the adoption in the countryside of the contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, most peasants were still short of money. This was a deep-level problem that affected rural stability. As for public security work, although great efforts have been made in recent years to consolidate law and order in rural areas, and a great deal of work has been done, this was still unsuited to the developing law-and-order situation in the countryside. In most places, there were only two or three people per rural police station, and there were even one-person stations. In some towns and townships there was no police station set up. Policemen have been working in difficult conditions. The insufficient numbers, shortage of operating funds, backward equipment, and other difficulties in police work also constrained the effective operation of law enforcement organs in the countryside. III. Effectively maintaining law and order in the countryside is an important condition for developing the rural economy. The central rural work conferences in 1993 and 1994 both set out strict requirements for the rectification of law and order in the countryside. In order to implement the central instructions properly, the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security decided to focus efforts on solving problems in rural areas, where the incidence of crime was serious, and to strive to meet the peasants' expectations for solid results in improving the law-and-order situation. Mou Xinsheng, vice minister of public security in charge of community law-and-order affairs, recently told this reporter: "The law-and-order problems in the countryside have occurred against the background of some major changes in people's thinking and mentality, and in the forms of economic and social organization in rural communities. Such problems are related to the situation in which organizational and management work was not suited to the rural work as a whole. Therefore, in the new situation we should actively study and explore new ways to strengthen rural public security work and to consolidate law and order in the countryside." Some people of insight have said: In view of the current public order problems in rural areas and the fact that the proportion of crimes among peasants is rising, the public security organs should adopt measures more pertinent to this situation. The party committees and local governments at all levels should attach importance to guiding the rural public security work, and should increase actual manpower, material, and financial investment in rural public security work so as to meet the needs in the arduous public security tasks in rural areas. Efforts should be focused on more sternly cracking down on the conspicuous criminal activities in the countryside, such as theft, robbery, murder, assault and battery, and the abduction of women and children. Anticrime campaigns should be launched in good time, on various scales, and in flexible forms so as to crack down on certain sensational crimes. In particular, the crackdown should be focused on criminal syndicates and evildoing forces that endanger law and order in certain areas. At the same time, it is necessary to explore more effective ways of solving criminal cases and to enhance efficiency in the solution of cases. Of course, the settlement of the existing problems in rural public order cannot rely only on the isolated work of the public security organs, but also must rely on the joint efforts of all circles in society and on the adoption of comprehensive measures. When talking about this, Chen Jiping, member of the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security and director of the committee's General Office, said: The primary issue is that party and government leaders at all levels must really shoulder political responsibility for ensuring the public security of local communities, actually strengthen leadership over the work of exercising comprehensive public security management, and support law enforcement departments in sternly cracking down on criminal activities that seriously harm law and order in rural areas. Second, it is necessary to actually consolidate the grass-roots party and government organizations in the countryside, and to restore and reinvigorate the paralyzed and semiparalyzed village organizations through comprehensive rectification in terms of ideology, work style, and organization. Third, the mass organizations for maintaining law and order should be strengthened, and the mechanisms for cooperation between local residents and the police also should be consolidated. In particular, the rural public security committees and the civil mediation committees should be organized properly. Fourth, legal education should be conducted for grass-roots cadres and the masses so that they will better understand the law, and will carry out activities to maintain law and order in their own communities according to the law. Fifth, attention should be paid to making good use of the surplus labor force in the countryside and to doing something effective to help peasants overcome poverty and get rich. Sixth, it is necessary to further improve relations between cadres and peasants, correctly handle various contradictions among the people, and prevent the intensification of such contradictions as may affect social stability. Public security and order in the countryside are an important issue China faces in the late 20th century. As long as we do down-to-earth work with a realistic attitude, take effective measures, and mobilize the joint efforts of all quarters for comprehensive management, then we will change the worrisome situation in this regard into a gratifying one, and will bring order out of chaos. The successful settlement of this issue will have a decisive impact on the vigorous and momentous process of modernization in our country, which has a large rural population, on into the 21st century.
