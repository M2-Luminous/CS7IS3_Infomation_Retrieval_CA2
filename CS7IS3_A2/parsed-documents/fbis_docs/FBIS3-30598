You may be interested in the fact that the name Nova was chosen by a lady living in Bratislava. The license was awarded by the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council of the Czech Republic on 30 January 1993, and the deadline for starting the broadcast was yesterday [4 February]. Nova is ambitious: It will broadcast on average 19 hours a day, using the former F1 [federal television] channel. It will broadcast newsreels and current affairs programs, some documentaries, and entertainment and musical programs. To begin with, it owns broadcasting rights for more than 400 foreign films, which will be broadcast dubbed. Nova will use the opportunity to insert advertisements during film screenings, but only with the approval of the films' authors. Also, much is expected from daily morning programs. An interesting program feature is a vox populi, a sort of television Hyde Park. In the Krone department store [in Prague], there is a television cabin where, for a fee of 10 [Czech] korunas, you can record any message you wish. [passage omitted] According to Vladimir Zelezny, the Nova director general, the viewers are expected to be average Czech citizens. There are no unnecessarily high expectations about their viewers, but they are not being underestimated, either. [passage omitted]
