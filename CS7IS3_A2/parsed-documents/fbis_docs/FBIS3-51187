Up until 12 April -- when the ceremony for the final signing of the Uruguay Round of the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) talks will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco -- tariffs may not be increased. Lampreia, Brazil's top negotiator in the Uruguay Round, denied that the Brazilian agricultural sector was harmed by the negotiations. "Brazil did not win, but is not worse off than it was," he said. In making an evaluation of the Uruguay Round, Lampreia admitted that the liberalization of trade for industrial products was more comprehensive than it was for agricultural products. "Negotiations over farm products are always more complicated," he emphasized. Lampreia said that Brazil could still obtain tariff reductions in the U.S. and European markets, especially on orange juice. The United States reduced tariffs on orange juice by 15 percent, and the Europeans by 20 percent. Lampreia explained that the greatest progress made in the Uruguay Round was represented by the agreement on the rules that will ban the adoption of unilateral, arbitrary, antidumping measures. "The margin of arbitrariness will be considerably reduced," he said, adding that after the ceremony in Marrakesh, which will be attended by the foreign ministers of 117 countries, the agreements signed in Geneva will be translated and sent to each signatory country. The Senate Economic Affairs Committee will begin studying the agreements by mid-May. Lampreia said that there are no possibilities for any modifications. "Either the Senate approves them or rejects them," he noted. At the beginning of 1995, GATT will host a ministerial conference to evaluate the approval of the agreements, and will start the work for the creation of the International Organization of Commerce, which will replace GATT. Lampreia said the new organization will begin operating in July 1995.
