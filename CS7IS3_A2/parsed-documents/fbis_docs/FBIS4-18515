On Wall Street, U.S. shares have lost about 10 percent of their value this year; in Tokyo minicrashes alternate with spectacular gains; the interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic are leaping virtually like goats. All this reflects the insecurity of money managers around the globe, who are currently reacting a bit more sensitively than is usual in this branch. The reason for the nervousness is the unresolved question whether interest trends that run counter to each other can persist in the United States and in Europe, especially in Germany. While overseas the lively economic development is able to bear the careful pressure on the interest brake applied by Reserve Board chief Alan Greenspan, the German economy still needs declining interest rates. The Bundesbank has made good progress in the short-term sphere with that; regarding medium- and long-term durations, however, there has been a setback. There the yields are almost 0.75 percentage points higher than the lowest level last year. One thing can already be said now: There are limits to an opening of the interest rate gap between the United States and Germany. These limits are reached as soon as investors begin to turn their backs on the mark and turn toward the dollar, because, in addition to higher interest rates, they can also expect gains from the exchange rate. In view of the enormous need for capital to finance German unification over the next few years, the Bundesbank cannot go it alone. In this respect, it is very likely that not all dreams regarding interest rates will come true in our country.
