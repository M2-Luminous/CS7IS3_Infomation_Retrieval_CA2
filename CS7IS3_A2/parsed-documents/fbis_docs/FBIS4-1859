The Japanese air traffic control unit involved has made an oral apology to the CAA. The official pointed out: Before the plane left for Taipei's air traffic information zone, the CAA had notified its Japanese counterpart and obtained its consent. The whole process, which was conducted properly, can be certified by referring to existing records. The official said: The CAA plane was conducting its task when two F-4 Phantom planes of Japan's Self-Defense Force scrambled to make an "identification check." Our unit involved in the incident was quite confused by the Japanese move, and immediately cabled the Japanese side to find out more about the situation. The CAA official pointed out: The Japanese air traffic control unit soon apologized to the two pilots in the test plane through our air traffic control unit. The Japanese side said that the mistake was a result of faulty coordination between a Japanese air traffic control unit and a Self-Defense Force control unit. The incident was only a "misunderstanding" because the fighter planes were merely making an "identification check." The CAA official said his office is still negotiating with the Japanese air traffic control unit to work out methods to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents.
