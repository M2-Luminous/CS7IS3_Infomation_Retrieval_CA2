Obviously, the percentage should be lower in ecologically sound regions and much higher in zones of ecological problems and crises (and at least 15 percent of Russia's territory falls into these categories). It is also obvious that someone must take responsibility for health impairments beyond the citizen's control. Finally, it is also obvious that the protracted absence of state concern for this connection between the state of public health and the state of the environment has led to one of the most substantial threats to national security because the average lifespan--one of the general statistical indicators of national health--has been plunging disastrously since 1986. When we say that the state must defend the rights and freedoms of the individual and that individual rights are above all other rights and freedoms, we are also referring to the now constitutionally secured right to compensation for health impairments resulting from the deterioration of environmental quality. At the beginning of 1992, just after the Russian Federation laws "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Welfare" and "On Environmental Protection" were passed, it became obvious that the exercise of the right of citizens, declared in these laws, to compensation for health impairments caused by environmental factors would require additional legal and analytical work. We need standards and rules stipulating the actions that victims can take to protect themselves from the unfair judicial actions of polluting enterprises. What these victims need even more, however, is reliable proof that a specific impairment is caused directly by the pollution of the environment from a specific source. Without this information, they cannot expect a court to hear the case and rule in favor of the injured party. As a result of the intense work of a team of specialists, mainly connected with Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight] and begun in spring 1992 under the auspices of the Russian Presidential Council on Ecological Policy, a set of standards and rules was drafted. The draft has already been "under discussion" in the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economics for more than a year, and the end of this process is not in sight. I can appreciate the difficulties this kind of deliberation entails: This document would grant citizens rights comparable to the right to protect personal inviolability and the right to own property. In view of these difficulties, a decision was made to enlist the aid of epidemiologists in the codification of the effects of specific environmental pollutants on various health indicators--in a format suitable for a judicial hearing. It was not possible to achieve all of these goals: The information that is being published today sometimes sounds more like a scientific treatise than the anticipated set of guidelines, but even the results to date are important enough to publish. The effects of other ecological factors of human origin on human health--chemicals, as well as noise, radiation, and others--will also be analyzed in the future. We hope that this research will eventually be recognized as the official set of standards and guidelines. Armed with an awareness of the general state of affairs and the effects of pollution on his own health and the health of his children and grandchildren, each individual will choose his own method of avoiding this potential danger--by leaving the zone affected by the pollutant or be uniting with other affected citizens and forcing the polluter (through various channels, including judicial proceedings) to stop the pollution. Therefore, the report that is being published today was written, on the one hand, for the public--to inform each citizen and offer more effective protection of the right of each citizen to a healthy environment--and, on the other, for the administrators and owners of sources (irrespective of forms of ownership) of dangerous chemical pollution, so that they will stop the hazardous emissions and dumping without waiting for legal judgments against them. We wish to thank the newspaper and its special "Prescription" supplement for this publication--it is addressed to literally each person in Russia. An applied science conference will be held soon on "Problems of Public Rehabilitation in Zones of Ecological Damage." The conference will be held by an association of trade unions in regions with unhealthy ecological conditions and by the International Fund for Socioecological Aid. Through the efforts of these organizations, the participants in the conference should receive our report in the form of a brochure to be used as a guide for action. These may just be the first tentative steps, but they are signs of progress....
