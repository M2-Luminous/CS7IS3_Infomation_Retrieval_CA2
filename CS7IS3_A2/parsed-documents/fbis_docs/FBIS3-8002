Following the tried and tested Sarajevo ploy, the criminal [Serb military leader Ratko] Mladic's gunners continue to murder civilians. After yesterday's massacre in Bihac, when 11 citizens were killed and dozens wounded in a queue for the distribution of humanitarian aid, the Serb aggressor is again today attacking this region ferociously. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps fighters are still managing to repulse all these attacks, unshakable in their commitment to defend their people and their territories.
