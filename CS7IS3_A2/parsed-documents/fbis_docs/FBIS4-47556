Survival rates of 40 to 83.4% prevailed in mice infected intramuscularly with 8-10 LD[.sub]50[/] viral dose and treated per os or intramuscularly with 0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg/day of reserpine (24 h before infection and for 1-2 days thereafter, or 30-60 min after infection and for 3-4 days thereafter). Analogous studies on rabbits yielded 100% survival vs. 33.3% for placebo controls. Reserpine treatment was also seen to prolong the incubation period two-fold. These observations indicate that reserpine may be a promising agent for use in combined therapy of rabies in conjunction with vaccines. Tables 2; references 10: 8 Russian, 2 Western.
