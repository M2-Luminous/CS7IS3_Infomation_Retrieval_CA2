On the one hand, the concept of the development of nuclear power envisaging the putting into operation on 24 new power plants by the year 2010 is taking shape. Some of these power generating sets will replace the reactors that exceeded the prescribed service life. On the other hand, energy consumers are in no hurry to pay for electricity to Russian nuclear power stations, so there are no funds to pay salaries to operators on time and to purchase the neccesary equipment and fuel. The shock that affected the population and even, in some measure, nuclear power specialists after the Chernobyl accident seems to be wearing off, and the crisis of nuclear energy is passing. Even the Cossaks on the Don who used to support environmentalists now see the need for the use of nuclear power in the region. Cossaks asked the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power to support their initiative for setting up a public information centre on nuclear power in Rostov-on-Don. People in various areas begin to realise that there is no alternative to the use of nuclear power in present economic conditions. Former union republics began to admit dependence on Russian nuclear power. The Armenian nuclear power plant inactive for over four years will soon resume operation. Its fifth reactor will go into operation by next winter. The republic's population will be supplied with light and heating. Gagik Markosyan, chief engineer of the Armenian station, told ITAR-TASS that ties with Russian nuclear power specialists have nether been severed. Surveys of equipment and work to instal technical novelties is done with Russia's assitance. Many research institutes and design offices are engaged in creating safer reactors. The new generation of water-moderated water-cooled power reactors is being designed by the regional design office "hydropress" (Podolsk, the Moscow region). The reactors will be used at the nuclear power stations in the Cola peninsula, the Far East, the Leningrad region. Foreign countries, for instance, China and Iran show interest in this reactor, Valentin Fedorov, general designer, director of "Hydropress", told ITAR-TASS. Agreements are beign drafted with some foreign countries. Meanwhile, difficulties are expirienced by nine Russian nuclear power stations at which 29 power generating states now operate. Energy consumers have debts running into hundreds of billions of roubles. The Novovoronezhskiy nuclear power plant is about to stop. There is no money to pay salaries to the staff. The preventive repair of the fifth reactor that was planned for January has not yet began. There is no money to pay for the ordered spares. The Leningrad, Kursk and Smolensk nuclear power stations have fuel reserves to last them about a fortnight. Experts now cast about for a way out that would be more effective than seeking new credits.
