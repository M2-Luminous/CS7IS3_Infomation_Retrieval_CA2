Speaking after a cabinet session, he also said the Czech side believed that the core to the solution was a "domestic agreement," and outside intervention could only supplement, and not replace, a domestic solution to the situation. Klaus said no representative of the Czech Republic had criticized the NATO Council's decision to bombard the positions of Bosnian Serbs if the Council's ultimatum was not upheld. "Nobody, including me, has made any statements concerning how we would react in the event of attacks," he said. Last Thursday [10 February] Klaus said the Czech Government and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, of which he is chairman) were afraid there would be outside military intervention in Bosnia and were of the opinion that civil war should not be ended by foreign intervention but by settlement at home. He said that he personally considered the possible air strikes approved by the NATO Council on Wednesday as "unfair from a human point of view." Klaus stressed today that it was not the task of the Czech Republic to find a way of solving the crisis in Bosnia. As far as the difference between the standpoints of President Vaclav Havel and Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda, both of whom support NATO's position, and his standpoint was concerned, it was unnecessary to consider the difference a dispute.
