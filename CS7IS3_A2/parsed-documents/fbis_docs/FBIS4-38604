At the request of ITAR-TASS, he commented upon reports in the British media that the possibility of the special services of the Russian Federation, the United States, and Great Britain cooperating on collecting information on attempts by certain countries to create their own nuclear weapons is being discussed at the diplomatic level. S. Nunn stressed that ideas on this kind of cooperation had been put forward by Senator Warren, by experts of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, and by himself a few years ago. The senator said: "It is a tragic paradox that now that confrontation between the nuclear powers is a thing of the past, our countries are defenseless in the face of a nuclear threat from terrorist groups." The report that the special services have begun to hold talks on cooperating in this sphere is "good news," Senator Nunn noted.
