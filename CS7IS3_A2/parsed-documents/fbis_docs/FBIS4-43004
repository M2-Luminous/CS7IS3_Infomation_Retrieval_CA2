According to the police, a letter in which a leftist autonomous group claimed responsibility for the attack was found at the scene of the crime. At 0233, the rather amateurish bomb exploded between two windows in the courtyard of the office and destroyed several windowpanes and parts of the facade of the building. No one was injured. The 15 inhabitants of the building were temporarily evacuated. The house with the seat of the CDU district association had already been scribbled on with paint before. Next Thursday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) wants to take the floor at a European election event.
