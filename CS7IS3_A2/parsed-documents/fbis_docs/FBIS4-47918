In a letter to the UN Security Council dated 1 May 1994, the RPF said that the massacres in Rwanda have been two-pronged: First, to eliminate all the political opponents of President Habyarimana's MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] and CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic], and second, the massacres have been intended to exterminate people of Tutsi origin. The RPF says that the neo-Nazi ideology in Rwanda is using the news that Tutsi people originated from Ethiopia and should be therefore thrown into rivers [word indistinct] which will eventually lead them back to Ethiopia. The massacres have claimed more than 500,000 people [as heard] and the number is increasing every hour. The RPF states that the international community should go after these criminals in Rwanda who are committing genocide in contravention of the UN convention against genocide adopted on 9 December 1948. This genocide has been planned for some time but was put into effect when the RPF started an open confrontation with Habyarimana's dictatorship. [passage omitted] The death of President Habyarimana was used as a pretext to escalate the massacres in Rwanda. The massacres are continuing to this day, organized by the illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF requests the UN Security Council to isolate this government on all fronts. The RPF is willing to furnish more evidence on the genocide in Rwanda if it is requested to do so. This letter to the UN Security Council was signed by the RPF chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.
