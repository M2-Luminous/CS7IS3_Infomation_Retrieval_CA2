Is the Krajina blood money earned in western Bosnia the backing for the solid dinar? How are 10 television sets smuggled with the help of a wounded man? You can find the answers to all these--and other--questions in this article. Why are wars even waged? There are two theories about that: the romantic one and the realistic one. The romantic interpretation cites "historic rights," "living space," "national dignity," and "the state is more important than bread." The realists do not believe all this, but they have nothing against it: They expect wars to begin, and sometimes they even help the process along (depending on investments that have been made and the pace at which money turns over). Wars are able to turn into business at a surprising speed, and romantics are not skilled in business dealings. They are there to perish heroically or afterwards, as cripples, to marvel at the fact that they have nothing while the realists are getting rich. For example, there is a well-reasoned theory to the effect that the war in Laos (1960-75) was not waged against communist aggressors, but was instead about achieving a monopoly over the opium trade. In order to turn war into successful business, there must be authorities who--by their very nature--impose obligations and restrictions that generally do not suit their subjects. The foundation of ruling authority lies in romantic, ideological presumptions, but miraculously there are usually realists among those in power. For example, authorities introduce various measures for patriotic reasons: universal military conscription, a prohibition on the misappropriation of weapons and military equipment, restrictions on the movement and activities of citizens of other nationalities, a prohibition on cooperation with the enemy, and similar expected and seemingly normal things. However, you cannot eat patriotism, and it is not noted for generating profits (except in some cases, to be discussed later). All the noted prohibitions and commands, it turns out, are transformable into quantities of German marks [DM], which depend primarily on the laws of the market. In a nutshell, this means: Whoever pays is exempt. The conditions for this transformation were created very quickly in the 1990 Balkan wars. Specifically, the belligerent Serb lands, the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and the republic of Srpska, are very poor. Under the normal conditions of the old Yugoslavia, they survived exclusively as part of an economic and market entity and with state support for underdeveloped areas (aside from two or three regional exceptions). Both states made it through the first phase of the war with the help of mother Serbia and through plunder. However, as the Vikings discovered in their day, the plunder economy has one major shortcoming--something can be pillaged only once. That phase is now complete, which is reflected in the increasingly poor state of public security in these lands: Plunder has become a normal affair, so that now some people need to be reeducated, because they have gotten used to it; they have used up the effects of others and moved on to their own people. This is a critical period of history: Now, it is necessary to move on to some more organized, institutional form of business. Market Laws The first and traditional economic resource is the population and its elementary needs for survival: food, clothing, alcohol, cigarettes. Whoever establishes a monopoly over satisfying these vital needs is the winner. For example, a certain Zeljko Holman of Zenica has become the main supplier of food to that large city; half of the total supply has passed through his hands since the war began. He founded the HOS [Croatian Defense Force], put together a team of 30 people who never saw the front, declared himself a general (although he has a sixth-grade education), and started up the Zagreb-Zenica trade, which lasted until Easter 1993. That was when the cooperation between Croats and Bosnians ended; someone else wanted control over the food, Holman was arrested, and allegedly they are still beating him at the Zenica Culture and Education Center to find out where the money is. Serb brothers have also turned a good profit in Zenica: There are two brothers who had an exclusive monopoly over cigarettes and Cerali tractor-trailer trucks for months. A pack went for DM10 retail. Incidentally, a record in these wars was registered in 1993 in central Bosnia: A carton of Marlboros cost DM500. This is a case of the unbending natural law of supply and demand. In Zenica, the prices at the illegal market in Gluva Bukovica, at the foot of Mt. Vlasic, where Serbs and Muslims trade were as follows in January 1994: white flour--DM20; a liter of cooking oil--DM20; a kilogram of meat--DM15; a liter of brandy--DM10, and so forth. In other places (primarily in central Bosnia), there are more luxurious items available: A gram of cocaine costs DM300 (DM150 in Belgrade); a gram of "domestic" grass DM10-12 (Belgrade: DM3-5). All of these transactions are the result of private initiative by individuals and a free black market where there is no competition. The profit margins are great, but do not even approach those realized on the state level. Because it can block free trade through administrative hurdles, the state is beginning to charge for freedom of trade. As long as the end buyer pays the state racket and as long as the dealer can endure the reduced profit margin, the state is financially stable. State revenues from taxes, rackets, its own black-marketeering, and the exploitation of natural resources (sometimes suicidal--as in "Hadzic's barricades") can hardly cover the costs of extended warfare. After all, war is a costly pastime, and if it does not bring some sort of benefit or a stable peace quickly, the state is in trouble. For example, soldiers of the republic of Srpska are already publicly grumbling that Serbia charges them "a high price for every bullet and shell"; for months now, the armed forces of the RSK have received payments of food and basic necessities in kind instead of actual wages. The events in Banja Luka in September 1993 are the best illustration of the crisis in the republic of Srpska: Reservists rioted because their families were starving (and they, in the trenches, were too), while dealers and swindlers were growing nice and rich. Dr. Radovan Karadzic put down the rebellion, while promising protection to "business people," on whom--as he put it--"the future depends." Patriotism is patriotism, but money is money.... Because of all this, all the warring states in the Balkans are forced to enter into certain transactions that are completely understandable to realists, while among romantics they elicit confusion that sometimes borders on despair. One Hand Washes the Other Transactions between states also depend on supply and demand: who has something and who needs it. Thus, the Bosnians have people but no weapons; the Serbs have weapons but are short on people; the Croats, with both people and weapons, are somewhere in-between, but they have tactical and strategic problems. These things vary from region to region, just as tactical interests vary. Because of that, we have seen all possible alliances between two parties against a third. This began back during the war in Croatia, when the Bosnian police of Alija Delimustafic cooperated fraternally with the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army]; then the JNA fraternally armed the just-established HVO [Croatian Defense Council] in Kiseljak; then the Bosnians and Croats fraternally clobbered the Serbs, the Serbs and Muslims clobbered the Croats (Herzegovina, Kupres), and the Serbs and Croats seriously united against the Bosnians (although they regularly supplied ammunition to them in Herzegovina), all the way up to several days ago, when yet another Croat-Bosnian pact was signed. The best reflection of this in practice can be found in central Bosnia, i.e., the Kiseljak-Kresevo front. This began in the summer of 1992 with the renting of artillery to HVO forces (with or without crews and ammunition); it continued through the renting of tactical services (artillery support), and concluded with the sale of major weapon systems and ammunition. At one point in 1993, the Serbs sold the HVO one T-55 tank, one "Praga" (a two-barrel 30-mm antiair gun on a tank chassis), and 2.5 million rounds of various ammunition for a sum that was later disputed. Specifically, the HVO contends that it paid DM4.5 million, while the Serbs contend that they received DM4 million; one Serb source says that he believes the Croats and wonders where the half a million marks went. Case of Bihac It is not only the Serbs and Croats who are doing business. The example of Cazin Krajina and Fikret Abdic's autonomous province of western Bosnia [APZB] shows that local tactical circumstances result in realistic alliances. As Miroslav Lazanski writes in his new biweekly ARGUMENT, there is fierce fighting around Bihac between units of the 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the command of Atif Dudakovic and Fikret Abdic's forces, which include Serbs. "The probable goal of operations by the Serb army and Fikret Abdic's forces in this region is... to break out to the banks of the Una River, whereupon this region would be territorially divided between the republic of Srpska and the autonomous province of western Bosnia." VREME has learned from independent sources in the field around Bihac and from our special reporter who stayed in Bihac that at least since the end of 1993, entire military units of the Serb armed forces of Krajina [SVK] and of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of Krajina have been fighting for Fikret Abdic. Legend has it that Babo asked his friend from Bijeljina, Zeljko Raznatovic, whether he could take Bihac for him; when he heard that Arkan was demanding DM8 million, Babo reportedly concluded that for that amount of money he could take Bihac himself, and he turned to Captain Dragan. The bulk of the aid from the RSK is provided by the people of Capt. Dragan Vasiljkovic from his "Alpha" training center, while the rest is filled in by SVK soldiers and special units of the MUP of Krajina. It appears that authorities in Serbia are familiar with the entire operation, because weapons and equipment are allegedly received through them. The people fighting in the APZB are listed in Serbia as being on leave. The operation is organized on-site in Velika Kladusa by a certain major with the SVK. The going rate for this fighting is as follows: DM2,000 for five to seven days of action; DM1,000 for one day of reconnaissance inside enemy territory; DM200 for a prisoner; special rewards for each occupied town (DM1,000-2,000 per person). Renting fire support and other services costs the following: DM50 for each day at the RSK military hospital in Vojnic; DM50,000 per day for three T-55 tanks with crews; DM50,000 per day for a battery (six pieces) of 122-mm howitzers plus DM1,000 for each fired shell if the artillery is on APZB territory, but if it is fired from Serb territory, then only the ammunition (between DM1,000 and DM3,000, depending on the type of ammunition); one day of antitank support from a "Gazela Gama" helicopter costs DM100,000. VREME's reporter in Bihac says that "Gazela" helicopters fired on the towns of Srbinje and Sokolac during her stay there (in early March), and also reports continuous artillery fire against Bihac from the Grabez and Golubic plateau. French Colonel Legrillet of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] has confirmed this activity. The 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina presented an ultimatum to Abdic to surrender by 10 February, or else it would move on Kladusa; four days before the ultimatum ran out, the Serb offensive against Bihac and the forces of the 5th Corps began, so that the pressure was taken off of Abdic. At the same time--interestingly enough--UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb was systematically ignoring and downplaying events on the Bihac front (the situation is normal, an occasional mortar shell here and there...). Where does Fikret Abdic get the money to pay for all these services and goods? It has long been known that Abdic imports from Croatia into the APZB much more food, fuel, and other goods than the local population needs. Also, a large part of the "Agrokomerc" capital has been successfully turned over abroad (purchasing arms for Croatia), while it is felt in Zagreb that a large part of the capital of the powerful Herzegovinan war-mafia lobby is moving by way of Babo and his friend Alija Delimustafic. Thus, Babo is buying for the Serbs what they need and charging them both in cash (trade) and in services (warfare). At present, this suits the Croats in tactical terms; UNPROFOR has closed its eyes (and that costs money), while Serbia is making a political point out of Fikret Abdic: He is a model of exemplary "coexistence" and ethnic tolerance.... Sad Ending However, everything changes if the Washington Bosnian-Croat agreement by some chance goes into effect. In that case, two important players in the Balkans become superfluous, or even detrimental: Fikret Abdic and Gojko Susak. If the Bosnians and Croats actually, sincerely enter into a new alliance, without the usual back-stabbing (as has happened many times in the past), Abdic is left all alone: The Croats do not need him, and he is left without oil and food, and in that case the 5th Corps quickly grows stronger; nor do the Serbs need him any more, because he has neither money nor goods. If the Croats have really decided in favor of an alliance with the Bosnians, it will not work, nor will anyone believe them, as long as several Herzegovinan political figures are a visible presence at Jelacic Square. Gojko Susak sensed this immediately, given the fact that two weeks ago he started grumbling about "swallowing a bitter pill": The Serbs say that "he has a bee in his bonnet," i.e., that thought is being given to him. Specifically, Dr. Tudjman was wrong to enter the war in Bosnia at Herzegovinan insistence, and the entire adventure went awry. Now he must acknowledge that he made a mistake; someone must pay for this, and Dr. Tudjman would rather not be that someone. The list of other candidates is not a long one.... Here we arrive at one interesting political speculation of a completely hypothetical nature, although it is quite reasonable. In the event of a successful Bosnian-Croat alliance, it is not only Abdic and Susak who are superfluous and detrimental; the logic of Realpolitik says that Mile Martic will also not be as desirable as he is today. He has the least money, and in that case his state is the most threatened; in any attempt to abandon Krajina to Croatia (because in that case defending its sovereignty would be too costly), Martic is superfluous. The same is true of Herceg-Bosna; Mate Boban is already on thin ice in Zagreb, even though he still holds real power. When all of the above is considered, we arrive at a natural junction of interests: Who is most interested in undermining and subverting the Washington accord? Susak, Boban, Martic, Palama, and Abdic, more or less in that order. If that is true--and it appears to be--then nothing is impossible, especially since everything has already happened in the past. It is known that the RSK air force has already conducted combat missions in Bosnia (bombing and helicopter support) for the VRS [armed forces of the republic of Srpska], but also for the HVO and APZB forces, for monetary compensation. Relations between the RSK and UNPROFOR are so poor that neither side was interested in insisting on this: UNPROFOR would not know what to say (it is tied up anyway), while the RSK would have to explain why its airplanes are flying over Bosnia but did not fly against the Croats during the offensive at Medacki Dzep. The very fact that all sides continue to refuse to take responsibility for the bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno and for the four ill-fated airplanes is clearly disturbing here; the romantics have perished, while the realists are not foolish enough to acknowledge it. It is unknown whether the Herzegovinans paid for it while Serbs from the two states did the flying in order to subvert the Bosnian-Croat alliance, but it will be learned sooner or later. Catch-22 No war is pretty, on the contrary. However, these wars of ours have managed in record time to degenerate into cynical business dealings and ordinary plunder as the main motives. Since the motives and interests of all sides are similar (which is not to say identical), mutual understanding is somehow inevitable: If the momentary ally is in trouble, we will sell him a pack of cigarettes for DM10, or a tank, shells, and so forth for the price that he is able to pay. Thus, the "Border 94" campaign in the republic of Srpska revealed that there is a great deal of trade going on with "the enemy" (tanks, ammunition, weapons, vital strategic materials). Everyone aims at transformer stations (which are repaired by UNPROFOR) because a lot is earned on oil for transformers; wounded Serbs being treated in Serbia have the right to a television set, so that as many as 10 plundered television sets are smuggled in for each wounded person and his permit. Strategic installations of the military industry, such as "Kosmos-Cajavec" in Banja Luka, produce electronics for poker gambling machines--a serious business that yields serious money (and heads roll because of those machines, too) supplying the significant Eastern European market. Avramovic's solid dinar has been introduced in the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina (20 million have been issued); if each dinar is backed by foreign exchange--and Martic and Karadzic swear that such backing exists--then where are the marks coming from? Certainly not from the economy and exports. What remains is rentals of personnel and military technology, money from the Herzegovinan political lobby, the remainders of the pillaged stashes of money and [trange-frange] with Serbia (importing food and vital necessities and sucking foreign exchange out of the populace). Who is whose "enemy" now? The answer is offered in the classic study of all warfare--Catch-22, by Joseph Heller. There, Milo Minderbinder offers an interpretation of why he has agreed with the Americans that they first bomb an overpass, and also agreed with the Germans to defend it. "The Germans are not our enemies. True, we are at war with them, but Germans are prominent members of our syndicate, and I must protect their rights...." Later Milo agrees with the Germans to bomb his own air base, because he has run out of cash. A scandal results, the newspapers bluster, mothers of recruits protest (which we know something about), but Milo has the impeccable logic of a war realist: "In a democratic state, the people are the government. And are we not a people? So why should we not hold on to our money and eliminate the middle-men? Quite frankly, I would like most of all for the governments to give up war and turn this entire field over to private initiative." If war has become the only branch of the economy that can turn a profit--why not?
