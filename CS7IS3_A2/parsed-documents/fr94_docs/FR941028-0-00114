ACTION: Continuation of regulations. SUMMARY: The final rule continues in effect without change 24 CFR 81.41 through 81.49, the book entry provisions of the Secretary's regulations governing the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). This final rule authorizes the issuance and trading in book-entry form of mortgage-backed and debt securities of Fannie Mae. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``the 1992 Act'') provides for a transition period during which all rules promulgated by the Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, are to remain in effect. Under the 1992 Act, the transition period expires November 28, 1994, which is 18 months following the appointment of the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight. Today's action is an emergency regulation to continue the existing book-entry provisions of the regulations in order to avoid disruption to Fannie Mae's continued authority for book-entry issuance and trading of Fannie Mae securities. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective November 28, 1994, 24 CFR part 81, subpart E, continues in effect.

Justification for Final Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. No new substantive regulations are being adopted through this rulemaking; rather, the Secretary is merely continuing in effect rules that were not affected by any substantive statutory change under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``1992 Act''), enacted as Title XIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992; codified generally at 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641). The rules continued in effect do not include any changes in the statutory authority of the Secretary made by the 1992 Act. This rule serves the critical need to ensure continued authority for book-entry trading of the large volume of Fannie Mae debt and mortgage-backed securities issues. At the same time, the rule does not impose any additional burden on the public. II. Background The 1992 Act significantly revised the regulatory requirements and structure for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), including its Charter Act (the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq. ). Section 1356 of the 1992 Act includes provisions for a transition period during which all rules promulgated by the Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the Act, are to remain in effect. The transition period is to expire 18 months following the appointment of the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight; at such time, both the Secretary's and the Director's rules under the Act were to have been proposed for public comment and completed in final. The OFHEO Director's appointment was confirmed by the Senate May 28, 1993; therefore, the 18-month period referenced in Section 1356 expires November 28, 1994. The Secretary will soon propose comprehensive regulations implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under the 1992 Act, but such regulations will not be effective until after the expiration of the 18-month transition period. The rules due for automatic expiration on November 28, 1994, include regulations promulgated by the Secretary in 1978 that authorize book-entry procedures for issuance and trading of securities of Fannie Mae (24 CFR 81.41&hyph;81.49). Today, virtually all of Fannie Mae's debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issuances and trading market depend on book-entry procedures. As of September 30, 1994, Fannie Mae debt outstanding was $239.3 billion and Fannie Mae MBS were $523.5 billion. The 1978 book-entry rules assure the efficient trading of Fannie Mae securities and enhance the secondary mortgage market. To ensure that Fannie Mae may use book-entry procedures, the Secretary issues this emergency regulation to continue in effect the 1978 book-entry rules. The Department of the Treasury requires that book-entry regulations be in force for agencies whose securities are recorded under the book-entry procedures of the Federal Reserve System. This recodification is required, therefore, to assure continued authority for trading of Fannie Mae securities in book-entry form after November 28, 1994. Failure to extend these regulations may be disruptive to the financial markets. Prior to the issuance of book-entry regulations, Fannie Mae, investors, brokers, and dealers incurred increased administrative expenses because of the lack of such authority. Accordingly, the 1978 regulations imposed book-entry requirements that enhance Fannie Mae's charter purpose of assisting the secondary mortgage market by improving the distribution of investment capital available for home financing (12 U.S.C. 1716(3)&hyph;(4)). The Secretary is empowered to recodify these regulations under section 1321(a) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4541), which confers on the Secretary general regulatory authority and the authority to ``make such rules and regulations as shall be necessary and proper'' to ensure that the purposes of the 1992 Act and the Fannie Mae Charter Act are accomplished. Accordingly, effective November 28, 1994, 24 CFR part 81, subpart E, continues in effect. Dated: October 24, 1994. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.
