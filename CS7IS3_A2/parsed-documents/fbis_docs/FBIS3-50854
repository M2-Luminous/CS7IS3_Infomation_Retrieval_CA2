Although it is known that they are posted throughout the country, their real mission here is not clear. It has been said that they are here to carry out civic work, but other sources insist they are participating in counternarcotics operations. Several contingents of U.S. soldiers have arrived in Colombia to participate in the so-called cooperation plan in the struggle against drug trafficking. Several soldiers traveled to Leticia in the Amazon Region to install radar to control clandestine flights in the southern part of the country. That decision generated an extensive debate in Congress. Leticia residents protested, saying that heavily armed soldiers had occupied the streets. A group of U.S. soldiers also arrived on San Andres Island to install a radar to control aircraft coming from the United States. Approximately 50 persons from the U.S. Navy, known as SeaBees, arrived to build a base equipped with several patrol boats on the banks of the Guaviare River. A similar mission is being conducted in the Puerto Lopez area, Meta Department. Soldiers from Ft. Rucker, Alabama, are stationed at Malaga Bay. According to authorities from both countries, the troops arrived in Valle del Cauca to build a school and a clinic and to repair several roads in Juanchaco. The arrival of troops and their equipment in helicopters and warships has made residents of those areas skeptical; some believe they came with a different objective. A total of six U.S. bases have been built throughout the country.
