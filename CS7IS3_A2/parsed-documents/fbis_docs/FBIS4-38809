INTERFAX Note: There has been a string of publications and radio and television broadcasts in which calls were made, mainly on behalf of Azeri refugees, for dissolving parliament and clamping presidential rule in the country. However, administration officials deny such a scenario of events. Presidential spokesman Salakhaddin Guliyev told INTERFAX that Aliyev had no intention of resorting to any drastic decisions concerning parliament or the internal situation as a whole in the near future. Many say Aliyev seems to be favoring a more measured approach based on recommendations from government adviser Arif Ragimzade for the time being. Ragimzade proposes that mandates be withdrawn from radical opponents of the ruling regime including former foreign minister Tofig Gasymov and one of the leaders of the National Front Ibragim Ibragimli. Both of them were behind a recent protest against the government decision to sign an agreement on cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh during a meeting in Bishkek. Opposition members say Speaker of Parliament Rasul Giliyev's signature does in fact put a seal on recognizing the enclave as a party in the conflict. Gasymov and Ibragimli were both expelled from parliament by a majority vote late on Tuesday [31 May]. In a statement afterwards, Gasymov accused the government of wanting to get rid of the opposition in parliament and the society. For his part, Ibragimli said that Azerbaijan was firmly on course towards "dictatorship and a military-police regime" predicting hard times ahead and inevitable social unrest. Opposition experts predict the onset of authoritarian trends in Aliyev's rule following the expulsion of his staunch opponents from parliament. This view was also echoed by leader of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov who described the parliament's decision as destabilizing. He said "the parliament's actions indicate that there are forces who want to derail oil contracts with the West and help introduce Russian troops into Azerbaijan."
