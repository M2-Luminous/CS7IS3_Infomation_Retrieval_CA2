It embraces democratic political parties, nonparty democratic figures, people's organizations, minority nationalities, and patriotic figures from all walks of life; and it includes all socialist working people, patriots who support socialism and uphold the unification of the motherland, and compatriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and Chinese nationals residing abroad. The PRC Constitution provides that the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultations under the CPC's leadership will exist and develop for a long time to come. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee [CPPCC] is a patriotic united front organization of the Chinese people. It is an important organ of multiparty cooperation and political consultations under the CPC's leadership. In exercising the powers of the National People's Congress [NPC], which had not yet been founded, and representing the will of the Chinese people, the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC proclaimed the founding of the PRC in September 1949, thereby fulfilling an important historical function. Since the convening of the First NPC in 1954, the CPPCC has continued to do much work in China's political and social life and in the field of friendly activities with foreign countries, thus making great contributions in these respects. Since the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in December 1978, the CPPCC has continued to play an important role in eliminating chaos and restoring order; consolidating and developing political stability and unity; shifting the focus of state affairs to economic construction; promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; striving for national reunification with the return of Taiwan; and launching the struggle against hegemony and safeguarding world peace. Led by the CPC following the founding of the PRC, Chinese people of all nationalities have abolished the system of exploitation and have established a socialist system. Fundamental changes have taken place in the class situation in Chinese society. The worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated. Intellectuals, like the workers and peasants, are force to be relied on in our socialist cause. The overwhelming majority of people formerly belonging to the exploitive classes have now become laborers earning their own living. The democratic parties, which have advanced along with the CPC in the people's revolution and construction and which together with it have undergone trials and made important contributions, are playing increasingly vital roles as political coalitions of sections of the socialist working people and patriots supporting socialism connected with them. A socialist relationship based on equality, unity, and mutual help has been established between China's different nationalities. Patriotic figures in religious circles are taking an active part in the country's socialist construction. Patriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and Chinese nationals residing abroad love their motherland, uphold her reunification, and support her construction. China's patriotic united front has taken on greater vitality in the new historical period, and it remains an important "magic weapon" for uniting the Chinese people in their struggles to build up their country and achieve national reunification. It will be further consolidated and developed. China is in the primary stage of socialism, and the main contradiction at present is the contradiction between the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs and the backwardness of our social production. Because of internal factors and influences from abroad, the struggle of the Chinese people against hostile forces and elements at home and abroad will still be a protracted one. Class struggle, although continuing to exist within limits for a long time to come, will no longer constitute the principal contradictions in Chinese society. The basic task of the Chinese people of all nationalities is to act in accordance with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the basic line in the primary stage of socialism, concentrate their efforts on socialist modernization, and work hard and self-reliantly to achieve the modernization of industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology step by step to turn China into a strong and prosperous socialist country with a high level of culture and democracy. On the political basis of love for the PRC and support for the leadership of the CPC and the socialist cause, the CPPCC will do all it can to further strengthen and develop the patriotic united front, mobilize all positive factors and unite all people who can be united, work with one heart and with everyone contributing ideas and efforts, focus on economic construction, protect and develop the political situation of stability and unity, advance the socialist democratic and legal systems, promote socialist spiritual civilization, push forward the development of the socialist market economy, and fulfill the fundamental tasks of the people of all nationalities across the country. The CPPCC is an important instrument of socialist democracy in our country's political life. In accordance with the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the CPC and the democratic parties and nonparty figures and the principle of "treating each other with all sincerity and sharing weal or woe," it participates in political consultation with regard to major state policies and important issues concerning the people's life and it practices democratic supervision by making suggestions and criticism.
