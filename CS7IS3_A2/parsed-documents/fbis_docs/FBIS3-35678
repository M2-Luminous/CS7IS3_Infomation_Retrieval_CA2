Even President B. Yeltsin, who is still defined as a democrat and whose accomplishments are constantly trumpeted to the world, as though remains in a shadow. Two names are mentioned most often -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Andrey Kozyrev. One can find many common issues in their recent statements: The Russian empire and its eternal interests, the misfortunes and offenses of the Russian-speaking population, blatant visions of the future, and plans to turn neighboring countries into the subordinates of the authoritarian Russia. On Wednesday [19 January], a two-day meeting ended in Moscow where Russian envoys to the CIS and Baltic states had discussed foreign policy in the "near abroad countries" together with officials from the Russian Foreign Ministry and other institutions. Having not even reached the middle, the meeting became odious and was commented throughout the world, while the reaction of the Baltic states was harsh and angry, which is a rare case. The response of our foreign minister was unbelievably fast, although previously he had required several days for such a move. His reply notes those statements in the speeches of the Russian foreign minister which are unacceptable to Lithuania. A. Kozyrev demonstrates imperial fists quite often, and it would be naive to expect that all this is done without B. Yeltsin's knowledge. Everyone remembers A. Kozyrev's speech in Stockholm which astonished the world and was revoked later (did the minister joke?!). On Tuesday, he declared that the Russian Army cannot be withdrawn from the CIS states altogether, because enemy forces may penetrate into them. All three Baltic states assessed the speech of the Russian foreign minister negatively. A. Kozyrev hurried to explain very efficiently that journalists of the official news agency who presented a twisted report to the public were to blame for everything. Such an act is as traditional as is demagogy in politics. Our politicians are equally fond of spreading various "sensational" statements abroad, and later accusing the local press for misinterpreting everything. It would be too great an historical honor for A. Kozyrev to call him the new Machiavelli of diplomacy. This minister is an actor in the theater of politics, who in a real theater is given only one role -- to ask loudly on cue: "What would you like?" The new Russian parliament, where thus far fighting goes on only in the canteen, is likely to dictate the new rules of the game even now. The foreign minister also wants to retain his position. The president wants to find if not a way then at least a path between the right and left "hurrah patriots." A. Kozyrev's refutations, which Moscow television broadcast so lavishly, may have hardly convinced anyone. We have heard too many promises. However, we have learned that the Russian Army would invade Latvia's territory within 15 minutes in case of necessity. Which part of A. Kozyrev's speech denies this Russian principle? There is always the word in the beginning. However, it would be good if it did not become the deed. The statements and assessments of our politicians are often similar to magicians' incantations that have to be translated into the Lithuanian language. During his visit to Lithuania, Estonian Prime Minister M. Laar put it straight that the external threat forced the Baltic states to unite. Lithuanian and Polish politicians noted at their meeting in Warsaw that there was a shadow of Russia's threat over both countries. It seems that the establishment of facts is a professional prerogative of historians. However, politicians have no foundation: The security concept is nowhere to be seen, and no one knows what the defense doctrine is like.... The negotiating delegation [with Russia] was disbanded, and its experts were deemed not politicians. The opposition engages in a passionate exposure of the idleness and lack of competence in the ruling force. The latter intimidates us with plotted coups and later explains that participants of the press conference misunderstood it. Seimas [parliament] deputies seem to have forgotten completely for what they have been elected, because the state's security and its positive development is not a priority to politicians who work at home. The most important issues for them are their own chairs and Seimas' internal problems while explaining political colors rather than the present and future of politics. It is absolutely clear that A. Kozyrev's refutations do not mean changes in Russian policies. Russia will "defend" its tribesmen, particularly in the Baltic states, and penetrate toward "its interests," while we will dissipate incantations alone. The Estonian legislature proposed that the president and the government express their harsh protest to Russia. We decided to take advantage of a historical precedent. When Russia was trying to defeat the Tartars in the battle of Kulikov, there were two warriors in the beginning -- Russians and Tartars. We allowed two ministers -- A. Kozyrev and P. Gylys -- to fight each other. Will the nations remember them 600 years later as well? There is no evidence that the Russian foreign minister was encouraged by the U.S. President who had promised to support his country. However, was it not Bill Clinton who "induced" the events in Estonia's Russian-speaking part, when talk about citizenship and pensions emerged again. Was it not he who made the head of the delegation for negotiations with Estonia "sick" when the agreement on the deadline for the Russian Army withdrawal had already been drafted? It is yet unclear what unexpected events this might suggest to Lithuania. It would be good not to miss them while trying to clarify the situation.
