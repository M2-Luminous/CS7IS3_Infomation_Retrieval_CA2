Vlasov; UDC 542.61:547.21] [Abstract] The use of n-paraffin hydrocarbons as diluents for alkylphosphate extractants in operations involving solutions of spent nuclear fuel is encumbered by the separation into two layers of the metal-containing extracts upon reaching a certain (critical) concentration of metal (thorium, plutonium, strontium, etc.). These layers are not water-soluble and make the extraction process more difficult (possible disruption of the hydrodynamics of the process and raising the danger of a nuclear accident resulting from poor prognosis in the accumulation of highly concentrated fissionable material in the apparatus). Various methods are known for increasing the volume of the extractant such as raising the temperature, introducing aromatic compounds and alcohols, and using an isoparaffin as an extractant diluent. Known advantages of the latter include low freezing point, and low viscosity of products in aqueous solutions, as compared to normal paraffins. In the present work a study was made of dynamic viscosity and density of isoparaffin diluents of tributyl phosphate as functions of temperature. It was demonstrated that it is possible to raise the volume of the extractant in respect to plutonium. Empirical relationships are presented for computing maximum extractant volume (tributyl phosphate in isoparaffin solvents) as functions of mobility. Figure 1; references 4: 2 Russian, 2 Western.
