"I am firmly convinced that the worst of recession is now behind us," Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi wrote in his contribution to the report, adding: "I believe...that the turning point came at the beginning of last autumn and that signs of recovery in production have emerged since then." Ciampi also renewed his encouragement to foreign investors, "to have trust" in Italy, in its parliament, which has done a "tremendous" amount of work, and in the government, which has worked in a "concrete" fashion. According to Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, Italy is "on the right tack" and now needs to "turn on the engines to push it forward." In his statements for the "Spring Report," Barucci also said that the new parliament to be elected next week and the new government that will follow "have only one road to follow, and there are no others," referring to austerity measures put in place to reduce the deficit, contain inflation and cut spending. Barucci also placed the poorer southern regions, indebtedness and unemployment as three main agenda items for future executives and parliaments. Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association, Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], in his statements warned against reducing working hours in an attempt to save jobs and suggested shifting taxes from capital and labor to consumption and distributed wages. Abete also asked future legislators to provide "political stability" and "consistent rules" to ensure growth and warned that the goal of stabilizing the ratio between debt and gross domestic product may not be reached in the next three years. For his part, Finance Minister Franco Gallo spoke of so-called fiscal federalism, in which regions are given greater autonomy in setting and collecting taxes, saying that it must be "treated seriously and gradually." He also suggested possible changes to the current tax system. The "Spring Report" defines unemployment as the single most important issue of the year, noting that for the first time ever the seven major industrialized countries have held a special meeting to discuss jobs. The report noted that unemployment in Italy gradually rose from 7.7 percent in 1979 to 11 percent early this year, and suggested where to focus energies: research and technological development; professional training; a more flexible job market; expansion of so-called industrial districts; improving the credit system.
