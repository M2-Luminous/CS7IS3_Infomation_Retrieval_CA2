On behalf of the Yemeni people, we congratulate you on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni Republic. These days, our country is living through a regrettable war launched by certain separatist elements, led by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] headed by traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who returned to the black history before 22 May 1990 when he announced late last night the official secession from the Yemeni body. He announced secession for his personal objectives and for the objectives of certain influential elements in the party. We would like to reassure our people, the good people and unionists in the world, and the masses of our Arab nation that unity continues and exists, and is backed by wide popular support all over united Yemen. Separation [word indistinct] only concerns individuals and a clique that includes certain elements in the YSP leadership. I welcome the press and the news agencies again, and I am ready to answer all questions. [Sulayman Nimr, AL-HAYAH and BBC] Your Excellency the President, now after 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP have announced their separation from the united Yemen, does this mean that the cease-fire will end? Will this mean that you will continue the battle to end the current situation in Aden? [Salih] Yesterday we announced a decision by the presidential council, the speakership of the House of Representatives, and the council of ministers--in response to the demand of the unionist elements within the YSP and Arab and international efforts to end the war--to provide a chance for the rebels, led by the party, to surrender themselves to justice and to give a chance for those who were deceived in the Armed Forces and who were left under the authority of the YSP to return to legitimacy and to the army of unity, the army of unity and democracy, the army of the constitutional legitimacy. We issued this decree to cease fire for 72 hours, three days, in order to give them a chance. This decision was met with support from our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the United States. However, YSP-led separatist elements did not respond to this decision and they continued the war on various fronts. This decision or decree stated that if those who hold sway over the YSP do not stop, the response will be firm. They did not stop. Regrettably, the battles continue. [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency the President: The entire Arab world is one body and Yemen is a part of it. President Husni Mubarak held numerous unpublicized contacts to close Arab ranks. [Words indistinct] Egypt's role and what is expected from it? [Salih] Egypt is exerting itself and Brother President Mubarak urged the parties to cease fighting. We responded to the cease-fire call. The leadership held [word indistinct] and made a decision. We cannot do without Egypt's role; We have a soft spot for Egypt. Egypt has exerted itself to bring an end to the hostilities. [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Yemeni masses for civilian life to continue, and democracy, and political pluralism? [words indistinct] Yemeni expatriates around the world about what is actually happening in Yemen, and what is the future of Yemen [words indistinct]? [Salih] First of all, the bulk of the Republic's territory is under the control of the army of constitutional legality, even the areas where the military has no presence are absolutely committed to Yemeni unity. We reassure our people, our Arab masses, and expatriates that, God willing, the secessionists will be defeated or arrested and brought to justice. They may seek to flee the country. Yemen will see an extensive development program following the frustrations experienced by the Yemeni people in the southern and eastern governorates while under the control of the YSP when they and ourselves shared power after the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen. Then, instability, insecurity and lax bureaucracy and financial and administrative corruption were the order of the day. That was a deliberate policy on the part of the secessionist YSP leadership. The future of Yemen, God willing, promises to be one of security, stability, democracy, political party pluralism, and modern institutions. God willing, local government will be improved and there will be a greater degree of decentralization -- financial and administrative. Local governments will enjoy greater and wider powers throughout Yemen. [Unidentified correspondent] Many happy returns of the 'Id. I would like to begin by saying that, despite the political leadership's high credibility and the fact that news correspondents have been given the liberty to move directly to the field of action, reports carried by some agencies and radio stations do not reflect what is taking place in the Yemeni arena. [Words indistinct] credibility. What would Your Excellency the President like to tell these correspondents so that they will measure up to the trust placed in them by the political leadership that has allowed them freedom of movement? The second part of my question: We are not surprised by the secession. The secession was declared on the very day the merger was proclaimed. Evidence is found in the stockpiles of [word indistinct] divisionist weapons. This is not strange, coming from the gang that plotted secession from day one. But what is the link between the timing of the official declaration of secession and the remarkable successes scored by our Armed Forces, the forces of constitutional legality? Thank you, Your Excellency the President. [Salih] Thank you. I mean [word indistinct] the beginning of the question. First, with regard to the world news agencies, press, and television stations, as well as the Arab and foreign television stations, we in fact regret the biased role played by some papers, news agencies, and television stations. Perhaps, some foreign television stations take reports from some Arab television stations and newspapers, so the former stations did not follow up on the facts themselves in order to find out the actual situation. We, however, do not pay attention to certain distortions of positions and to the lack of credibility by some media. We pay attention to what takes place on the ground. We do not pay attention to what is said by certain radio stations, journalists, or television stations. We pay attention to our presence on the ground, to tightly controlling the Republic's territory, and to repulsing and expelling the secessionist elements. [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President: The second part of the question is: What is the link between timing the official declaration of secession [word indistinct] moments, and [word indistinct] the great victories achieved by our Armed Forces, which are defending unity and legitimacy? [Salih] The link is that victories were achieved on the ground. Thus, there was no room for al-Bid and the secessionists' clique but to officially declare secession because al-Bid is unable to confront the army of the people, unity, and legitimacy. He has officially declared secession at a time when he has actually seceded, but in an undeclared manner, since he returned from Washington to Aden. We, however, were not surprised by this issue because he had seceded in the first place. Moreover, he unwillingly joined unity, and he did not like unity. Representative of the YSP, al-Bid's political rhetoric said that it is the party of unionists. He, however, lost credibility regarding his party, himself, his homeland, and the Arab and foreign world. They say that the YSP was established on unionist bases. How could this be true now that secession has been declared? Thus, where is this credibility? [Unidentified moderator] May we give an opportunity to non-Arabs, please? [Salih] Go ahead. [Moderator in English] Come, non-Arabic speaking correspondents. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] We already have indications that some Arab countries, and perhaps others as well, are prepared to give support to the declaration of independence by Mr. al-Bid. How worried are you about this, and what effect will it have on your objection so far to any form of negotiations [words indistinct] with Mr. (?al-Bid)? [Salih] First of all, any Arab country or any friendly state that attempts to sympathize with this secessionist decision will be counted in the camp of the enemies of the people of Yemen. This is also considered flagrant interference in Yemeni affairs. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [words indistinct] So, after this truce, which will last for three days or so, do you intend to go only to Aden, to take over Aden or [words indistinct] [Salih] We are now tightening the ring around Aden, the economic and commercial capital. After tightening the ring around Aden, our intention was not to enter the capital with the Army. But with 'Ali Salim al-Bid's announcement of secession and declaration that Aden is the capital of his party, we will have to enter Aden by any means necessary. Afterward, the Army will chase the remainder of the party's leadership in al-Mukalla. Thus, al-Bid will have to flee either to Oman or to (?al-Sharawrah) toward Saudi Arabia to join his secessionist colleagues living abroad. In fact, he and his colleagues have sent their children and families abroad as well as the fortunes they have accumulated from here and abroad. He will be forced to go after the funds he has deposited in banks abroad, funds he received as price for the crisis, and with which he ignited the war. He will run after the funds he managed to amass during this period. He has no cause, and if he did have a cause, he would have stood fast in Aden and would not have left Aden. As he left Aden for al-Mukalla, so will he leave al-Mukalla for outside Yemen. [Unidentified correspondent] President Mubarak [word indistinct] the cease-fire during the 'Id. You responded to this. Al-Bid announced that he accepts the cease-fire but after that he announced secession? [Salih] [Words indistinct] cease-fire announcement [words indistinct] but immediately after the cease-fire announcement, he proclaimed the secession. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, [words indistinct] 'Ali Salim al-Bid [words indistinct] [Salih] For the second time, any recognition of this means that this country will be the direct enemy of the Yemeni people. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] In light of the declaration of the separatist state, do you intend to continue the war in the next three days [words indistinct]? [Salih] We said [words indistinct] cease-fire but the [words indistinct] did not stop fighting. This [words indistinct] forces us to pursue military operations. [words indistinct] for the information of the press, several of the units loyal to the YSP announced [word indistinct] yesterday after the secession decision [words indistinct] announced their loyalty to legitimacy. This was the ('Affan) Brigade, one of the most important brigades, the [word indistinct] Brigade, the Hunayshan Brigade, and the [word indistinct] Brigade announced their allegiance to legitimacy. [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] regarding other political reactions [words indistinct] the YSP members [words indistinct]. What is their stand on the [words indistinct]? [Salih] [Words indistinct] in the Yemeni arena, they condemned this decision. We demand condemnation [words indistinct]. They have conveyed to us their condemnation over the phone. Other parties [words indistinct] should condemn this secessionist decision through the press and electronic media. Most YSP leaders in Yemen, not only in the north, but in Yemen as a whole, support unity. Most of them have made their stands known. Perhaps statements will be issued by the YSP organizations in some governorates of the Republic. Some YSP leaders have submitted their resignations en masse. I have received their party cards and resignation letters from various governorates of the Republic. [words indistinct] this excellent unionist stand. Only 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those who stand to benefit from this situation among the leaders of the YSP have remained. Eventually, he will be left alone. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [Words indistinct] much longer [words indistinct]? [Salih] This is up to the commanders in the field to decide. Our hope is that the battle will be decided within hours or days. However, we are facing the YSP war machine that once belonged to a member of the socialist bloc. After the declaration of the republic, particularly after the beginning of the crisis nine months ago, the YSP received double the quantity of the weapons that it inherited from the socialist bloc. We are facing difficulty, but we have taken approximately 80 percent of their equipment. This includes what has been hit, surrendered, or seized. During the past 12 hours, we have received information that a number of strategic Tupolev planes are transporting a cargo at the al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut, (?each carrying two tanks). There is also a vessel carrying a number of vehicles, ammunition, artillery, and tanks to the al-Mukalla port. From this premise, we warn all countries involved in this affair and that seek to prolong this battle. We warn against weapons sales, and the arrival of vessels to ports that fall under the control of the party, and aircraft that pass through Yemeni airspace, we warn against their arrival, and this will be viewed as blatant interference. This will prolong the battle. We warn all the friendly and fraternal countries against becoming involved in this matter to support this secessionist party as this will be viewed as blatant interference in Yemeni affairs. [Unidentified correspondent] What role are regional countries playing in the Yemeni crisis? [Salih] [Words indistinct] weapons from arms dealers. Arms sales are funded by the YSP, which has large amounts of money. Thanks again to the press and newsmen. Many happy returns.
