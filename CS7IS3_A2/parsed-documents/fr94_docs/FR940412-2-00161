SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On April 8, 1986, applicant (then known as ValueGuard Stock Fund, Inc.) filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on August 6, 1986, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that same date. 2. On June 25, 1992, shareholders of the Timed Equity Asset Management Fund series (``TEAM Fund'') of applicant redeemed all their TEAM Fund shares at the net asset value per share determined on that date, in exchange for which TEAM Fund distributed all of its assets totalling $409.86. 3. On June 18, 1992, and again on October 26, 1992, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to transfer all of the assets of its Ray Equity/Income Trust series (``Ray Fund'') to the Capstone Fund of the Southwest series (the ``Acquiring Fund'') of Capstone Series, Inc., in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all identified liabilities of Ray Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other because certain of applicant's directors and officers also serve as directors and/or officers of the Acquiring Fund. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 4. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the low asset size and consequent high expense ratios of Ray Fund (b) limited investment flexibility due to Ray Fund's small asset size, (c) the compatibility of applicant's investment objectives and practices with those of the Acquiring Fund, (d) the potential of enhanced investment performance, greater flexibility, and increased stability due to larger asset size, and (e) economies of scale to be realized primarily with respect to fixed expenses.
