FR941128-2-00054 FR941128-2-00044 [Docket No. R&hyph;0856] Federal Reserve Bank Services AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Board has approved a private sector adjustment factor (PSAF) for 1995 of $94.7 million, as well as 1995 fee schedules for Federal Reserve priced services. These actions were taken in accordance with the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which requires that, over the long run, fees for Federal Reserve priced services be established on the basis of all direct and indirect costs, including the PSAF. DATES: The PSAF and the fee schedules become effective January 3, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Private Sector Adjustment Factor The Board has approved a 1995 PSAF for Federal Reserve Bank priced services of $94.7 million. This amount represents a decrease of $8.9 million or 8.6 percent from the PSAF of $103.6 million targeted for 1994. As required by the Monetary Control Act (MCA) (12 U.S.C. 248a), the Federal Reserve's fee schedule for priced services includes ``taxes that would have been paid and the return on capital that would have been provided had the services been furnished by a private business firm.'' These imputed costs are based on data developed in part from a model comprised of the nation's 50 largest (in asset size) bank holding companies (BHCs). The methodology first entails determining the value of Federal Reserve assets that will be used in producing priced services during the coming year. Short-term assets are assumed to be financed by short-term liabilities; long-term assets are assumed to be financed by a combination of long-term debt and equity derived from the BHC model. The mix of long-term debt and equity was modified slightly to ensure an imputed equity to asset ratio of 4 percent as required for adequately capitalized institutions under provisions of Regulation F (12 CFR 206). Imputed capital costs are determined by applying related interest rates and rates of return on equity (ROE) derived from the bank holding company model. The rates drawn from the BHC model are based on consolidated financial data for the 50 largest BHCs in each of the last five years. Because short-term debt, by definition, matures within one year, only data for the most recent year are used for computing the short- term debt rate. The PSAF comprises capital costs, imputed sales taxes, expenses of the Board of Governors related to priced services, and an imputed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance assessment on clearing balances held with the Federal Reserve to settle transactions. Asset Base The estimated value of Federal Reserve assets to be used in providing priced services in 1995 is reflected in Attachment Table A&hyph;1. Table A&hyph;2 shows that the assets assumed to be financed through debt and equity are projected to total $622.9 million. As shown in Table A&hyph;3, this represents a net decrease of $28.6 million or 4.4 percent from 1994. This decrease results primarily from lower priced asset base levels at the Reserve Banks and Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS).
