The government issued the warning because of mounting tensions in the region following the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision last week to allow air strikes, the officials said. According to the officials, there were 66 Japanese in Serbia as of December 1 last year. While there were no Japanese listed as residing in Montenegro, the area was included due to increased tensions there. Those residing in Serbia include government officials, company officials and members of the press as well as their families, they said. NATO warned the Serbs last week that its warplanes could bomb their heavy weapons supplies positioned around the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo unless the weapons are withdrawn or put under U.N. command by February 21.
