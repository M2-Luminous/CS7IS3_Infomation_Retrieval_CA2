FR940111-0-00021 FR940111-0-00006 A number of commenters addressed the reentry permit provisions of the proposed rule. Most suggested that the proposed provision precluding issuance to most aliens who have been abroad for more than 4 of the last 5 years since becoming a permanent resident was too limiting, did not provide for exceptions, and did not recognize the needs of permanent residents who are employed by multi-national companies on extended assignments abroad. As was explained in the proposed rule, the Service's intent was to minimize the current broad review by the Government of all the circumstances surrounding a person's absence, and instead focus on the simpler issue of how long he or she has been gone. The language of the rule was written in such a way that a person is able to stay abroad for almost 6 years, with only short trips back to the United States every 2 years, before he or she would become ineligible for a reentry permit. This standard would have meant some people would not have received a permit, but, again, this ineligibility in and of itself would not have jeopardized permanent resident status. We believe a clear standard is preferable to an abstract one in which the Government must look at the person's intent, location of domiciles and assets, employment circumstances, and other circumstances of his or her life and make a discretionary decision of whether to issue a permit. However, upon further consideration, the Service recognizes that there may be those who will be unable to obtain a travel document other than the reentry permit. Therefore, the rule will be modified so that rather than precluding the issuance of the document, any such further issuance will be limited to a validity of one year. This simply means that a person who remains abroad for more than the specified period will thereafter have to return annually to file an application for a reentry permit instead of every 2 years. Also, based on the comments received, the Service has revised the list of exceptions to the time limit rule to include permanent residents defined in 8 CFR 211.1(b)(1)(i)(B), 211.1(b)(1)(ii) or 211.1(b)(4), as well as persons employed by a public or national organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, and their dependents. The rule also exempts professional athletes who compete in the United States and worldwide. Other issues Several commenters suggested that the Service issue to any applicant for a replacement alien registration card an interim work authorization document while it considers his or her application. However, this would encourage people to file merely to get a document to enter the labor market. Under such circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the Service to give a benefit before having an opportunity to determine if the person is actually eligible for it. Instead, the Service is taking steps to accelerate the processing of this type of application in order to deliver a replacement card more rapidly to those who are eligible. Several commenters pointed to the situation of permanent residents in exclusion or deportation proceedings, and suggested that the rule should clearly prohibit the confiscation of the permanent resident alien registration card until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered. The rule has been clarified to indicate that such a person is entitled to evidence of permanent resident status until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered. As requested by several commenters, the Service has modified the proposed rule to clearly allow for the concurrent or subsequent filing of an application for further action on an application or petition, and to provide flexibility to incorporate additional, similar processes by revising the form. The Service has also made minor editorial changes in the rule for clarity. One commenter suggested that to further streamline processing, the Service should require applicants to mail all adjustment of status applications to the INS Service Centers, and eliminate the mandatory interview requirement. The Service has since addressed this issue in a separate rulemaking, which was published in the Federal Register on November 2, 1992 at 57 FR 49374&hyph;49375. It should be noted that most of the ยง264 items addressed in the proposed rule were published in the Federal Register on September 20, 1993 at 58 FR 48775&hyph;48780, and therefore are not included in this rule. In addressing filing requirements and procedures, this rule also clarifies the effect of a ``bounced'' check or other filing fee remittance being returned as not payable. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation merely sets forth evidentiary rules and processes by which persons may apply for and receive certain immigration benefits and does not alter substantive requirements. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers. List of Subjects 8 CFR Part 103 Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations (Government agencies), Freedom of information, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds. 8 CFR Part 214 Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment, Foreign officials, Health professions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Students. 8 CFR Part 223 Aliens, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
