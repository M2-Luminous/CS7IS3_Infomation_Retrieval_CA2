"When Paris made its decision, we considered it a gesture of aggression. However, the international community, in the voice of the UN Security Council, covered France. If France sticks to its humanitarian mandate, then it will be a very good thing. We are not in principle opposed to a humanitarian operation, we simply would have preferred it to be carried out by soldiers from another country." The threat of confrontation between the RPF resistance fighters and French troops is no longer valid, according to Mr. Kanyarengwe. This contradicts what his representative in Europe, Jacques Bihozagara, let it be understood on Thursday [23 June], the day after his meeting with Alain Juppe. The RPF president said he was reassured by the statements made by French diplomats who came to Mulindi last last week to clarify Paris' intentions to him. "I simply made it clear to them that the entire territory of Rwanda is a zone of operations," he stressed. The RPF's less virulent tone does not erase its old grievances -- far from it. "France supported the old regime by the military presence of its troops, financing and training Rwandan military personnel and militias, and by diplomatic actions abroad," Mr. Kanyarengwe recalled. He sees no "direct involvement" by Paris in the attack which cost the life of President Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April. Mr. Kanyarengwe is satisfied militarily. "The RPF now occupies more than half of Rwandan territory. We hold the prefectures of Byumbo, Kigali, and part of the Ruhengeri, Gitarama, Gigumbo, and some areas in the prefecture of Butare," he said. "Kigali is under pressure and should fall soon. It is just a matter of days now." The RPF leader affirmed that he wanted to reach a cease-fire agreement "with the government military forces" once the massacres have ended. He demands that those responsible for the genocide be brought to justice before discussing any alterations to the Arusha accord. This accord, signed in August 1993 by the Rwandan political parties, "will have to serve as the foundation for setting up future transitional institutions," Mr. Kanyarengwe said. [passage omitted]
