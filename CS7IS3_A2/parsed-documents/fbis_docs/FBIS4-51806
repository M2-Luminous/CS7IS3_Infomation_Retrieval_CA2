Before selling the government-owned shares, the ministry will allow the CNB to increase its capital by 20 billion won by way of making it go public and listing it on the Korea Stock Exchange in August. But even after the privatization of the CNB, it said the CNB's function to support small- and medium-sized firms will continue. CNB's paid-in capital is 191 billion won and its equity capital amounted to 406.4 billion won as of the end of 1993. It also plans to sell the government-owned 1.6 percent stake of Korea Exchange Bank [KEB] this year and the Bank of Korea-owned shares will be sold some time during 1994-1995. Out of KEB's total paid-in capital worth 605 billion won, 65.3 percent is held by the central bank [Bank of Korea]. KEB's equity capital amounted to 1.6 trillion won as of the end of 1993. Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Korea Housing Bank (KHB) will also be privatized sometime during 1996-1997, it said. The ministry said it will privatize first those banks which have the most similar characteristics with commercial banks. The ministry's move to privatize state-run banks is part of its policy to exempt commercial banks from extending government-supported policy loans and make specialized banks exclusively deal with the policy loans in the long-run.
