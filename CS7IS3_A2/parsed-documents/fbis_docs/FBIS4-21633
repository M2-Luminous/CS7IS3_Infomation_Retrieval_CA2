The project will seek to solve the city's waste recycling problem, guaranteeing its rational, safe, economic, and harmless return to the environment. CNEA will provide the funds, engineering, direction, construction, and installation for the plants, as well as the radioactive material (Cobalt 60) and the training of the personnel who will operate the plant. The plant's construction will be made to coincide with the construction of the Sewage Disposal Plant in San Felipe. The contract was signed by Roberto Oscar Marques, CNEA radioisotopes and radiation area manager, on behalf of the atomic agency. Engineer Jorge Guillermo Graino also attended. During the ceremony at DIPOS, CNEA experts and officials exchanged ideas on the project. The contract establishes that CNEA will intervene and supervise the installation's security as well as any operation involving the movement of radioactive materials inside and outside of the plant. Operation periods will not exceed 10 years. In the 11th year the ownership of PIBA will be transferred to DIPOS. The treatment consists of forcing the "sludge" around a cobalt-60 radioactive source carrier installed in an irradiator, which is a bunker built eight meters underground with concrete walls 1.4 meters thick acting as armor against radiation. Once the sludge is pasteurized it will go into a tank for bacteriological and radiation control. Here routine controls will check whether the sludge is harmless.
