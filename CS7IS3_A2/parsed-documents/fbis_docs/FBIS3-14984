"We can only regret about the breaking up of ties on the economic space of the former Soviet Union," he said. Snegur believes that Moldova is unable to reject the Eastern market. "We have had a try of following the agreements at Belovezhskaya Pushcha. As a result our economic indices have dropped very low," said Snegur. He sees the way out of the situation in implemeting the agreement on the formation of an economic union within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was signed by Moldova. Snegur has denied speculation saying that Moldova intends to sign, within the CIS, agreements other than economic. "We take part in integration on the issues that do not infringe our independence," he said. Speaking about the relationships with Romania, he said: "We have one language, we are brothers and continue integrating economically and culturally, but we are building our independent states."
