Within one month Wan had cleared up the debts and the mill had earned a net profit of 90,000 yuan. In the second month this had risen to 180,000 yuan and in the third to 500,000 yuan. The 56-year-old Wan attributed this success to his experience at the Shanghai no.2 woolen textile mill, a noted profit-making enterprise where he serves as concurrent director. "The main reason why the No. 12 Woolen Textile Mill had been in the red for five years running and lost 61.52 million yuan was because its accounts were not in order and a few employees fished in troubled waters," said Wan who became an apprentice at a textile mill at the age of 16 and completed a college course through self- study. Soon after Yang Guangjie from the Shanghai No. 25 Cotton Textile Mill, a profit-making enterprise, became the head of the Shanghai Hongzhang Cotton Textile Mill, he was mocked and left out in the cold. Many professional skilled workers had transferred to other work units. While reforming the labor and income distribution systems by selecting and putting talented people in important positions, Yang concentrated on developing new products and setting up joint ventures in co-operation with Hong Kong and Taiwan business people. As a result, the mill has resumed its vitality, and the average employees' wages are expected to reach the middle or top levels of Shanghai's textile industry this year. To get experienced managers to work in money-losing enterprises is one way to help these factories to extricate themselves from their difficult position, according to Jiang Yiren, vice-mayor in charge of industry. "While supporting state enterprises with better economic results," he said, "we must help the struggling ones change their operational mechanism and make profits in line with their conditions." By the end of last November Shanghai had 277 money-losing state enterprises, accounting for 28.9 percent of its total. "The general debility of state enterprises hampers the national economy and the people's livelihood," said Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC's Shanghai Municipal Committee. "State enterprises are the backbone of the national economy, and have contributed 80 percent of the state's 500 billion yuan tax revenues over the past four decades," he said. "Shanghai's economy can hardly develop without these enterprises." Under the old central planning system state enterprises used to make products according to the plans of the government, which offered them production materials and took charge of disposing of all the products. As the government encouraged market economy, a number of major state enterprises did not known what to do or how to adapt to the market. One example is the Shanghai heavy machinery plant, a major state enterprise with 10,000 employees, which was at a loss what to do and daily getting deeper in debt. It was at this time that the government sent an official to the plant to turn it to market-oriented production. "We used to wait for state contracts," a plant official said. "Now our salesmen positively go out to collect orders and our employees voluntarily work extra shifts to fulfil orders ahead of schedule. We also offer after-sale service, and the sales volume this year is scheduled to reach 600 million yuan-worth." This year 46 money-losing industrial enterprises in Shanghai are expected to begin making profits. Meanwhile, some which have been in the red for a long time and of which the property can hardly pay its debts in kind, will close down, merges with other enterprises or go bankrupt.
