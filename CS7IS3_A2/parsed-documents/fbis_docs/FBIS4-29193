Kazo Watanabe, director of the second largest opposition party's General Affairs Bureau, told a news conference at the Japan National Press Club that Japan and North Korea should also resume talks as early as possible to establish diplomatic relations. Officials of the (North) Korean Workers' Party have told SDP officials in Pyongyang they want to unconditionally restart normalization talks stalled since November 1992, Watanabe said. An SDP delegation headed by Watanabe visited North Korea for six days up to Wednesday as part of efforts to promote ties with the North's ruling party. The SDP has traditionally maintained close relations with the Korean Workers' Party. Watanabe also said the SDP will oppose the idea of slapping sanctions on North Korea as a means of ending Pyongyang's alleged quest for nuclear weapons. Two legislators of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party are also visiting Pyongyang for talks on North Korea's nuclear program.
