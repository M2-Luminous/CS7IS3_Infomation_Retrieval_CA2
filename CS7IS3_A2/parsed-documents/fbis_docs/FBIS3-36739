Evidently neither of the sides intends to retreat from their initial positions. Estonia has not softened its conditions for local Russians to receive Estonian citizenship. Russia, just as it promised three years ago, intends to withdraw its troops by September this year, at the same time it demands normal living conditions for military pensioners who wish to stay and live in Estonia. Commenting on the present situation, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik noted that Russia does not yet accept Estonia as an equal partner. The concern of Tallinn politicians is understandable since Russia, even after the withdrawal of its troops, will still have a powerful weapon to influence Estonia's policies -- the almost half a million strong Russian-speaking community that has not yet received Estonian citizenship and is, therefore, under Russia's particular attention. So, although the talks are not justifying the hopes, it is not worth breaking them off either, the Estonian Foreign Ministry considers.
