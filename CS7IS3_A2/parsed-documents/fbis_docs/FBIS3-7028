Korean authorities" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) recently published a "Detailed Report on the War Crisis on the Korean Peninsula" concerning the ever more open war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group against the North, according to the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National Salvation. Recalling that the U.S. imperialists have already worked out a war scenario to cope with a "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula under the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" and abruptly turned toward the provocation of an adventurous war against the North, the detailed report says: WASHINGTON POST December 2, 1993 reported that in case a military conflict broke out on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. Forces would dispatch 500,000-strong reinforcements including six aircraft carriers, eleven army brigades equipped with heavy arms, thirty-four combat flying corps and four flying corps of bombers, which are nearly equivalent to a half of the U.S. combat units. This is the kernel of the war scenario written by the U.S. Defence Department to cope with a "case of emergency". The U.S. imperialists have designed even a U.S.-South Korea-Japan military command system, not to speak of a U.S.-South Korea operational command system to perform the above war scenario. On September 27, 1993, former U.S. Defence Secretary Aspin, at his talks with the director-general of the Japan Defence Agency, decided on the involvement of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" in a war against the north of Korea and its share in it. On the basis of the "new military strategy", the United States is reorganising and reinforcing its huge aggression forces in and around the Korean peninsula. The 95,000-strong U.S. Army, Naval fleets and Marine Corps stationed in South Korea and Japan are waiting for an order of action, while twelve of the thirteen U.S. aircraft carriers in the pacific are alerted as an "emergency relief force". The bellicose Kim Yong-sam group has completed the wartime system, while brutally cracking down on the struggle of the people for independence and democracy, peace and reunification with "civilian" fascist tyrany. It formed a mobile army corps of the "ROK Army" allegedly for a "case of emergency" and revised the "system of examination for conscription" so it could draft any civilian into the army any time. And it has supplied to 3,800 officers of the "reserve forces" the same combat uniforms as those for the officers in active service, doubled the combat police force and modernised the combat equipment to be hurled into a war any time. The U.S. imperialists plan of war against the North is near the danger line for going over to a real war. If the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique against the North are not frustrated quickly, our fellow countrymen will suffer a disaster, the detailed report says, and stresses: Anyone who opposes war and wishes to live in peace must rise up to shatter the war provocation moves against the North and expel the U.S. imperialist aggressors and overthrow the traitorous Kim Yong-sam group.
