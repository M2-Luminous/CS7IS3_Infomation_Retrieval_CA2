A Russian-Kazakh intergovernment memorandum on "Mutual Understanding in Maintenance of the Baykonur Space Launching Grounds" was signed a month ago and membership of an intergovernment commission for Baykonur has been confirmed. The commission is expected to prepare draft bilateral documents on status and conditions of the use of Baykonur and the town of Leninsk and rent of Baykonur and Leninsk facilities within two months. Under the memorandum, Russian military units were to temporarily stay on Baykonur territory and the launching grounds themselves were to be rented by Russia. However, the Kazakh side continues to insist on Baykonur demilitarization, meanwhile preparations and launches of rocket boosters and spacecraft are so far impossible without servicemen of the Russian aero-space forces. The Russian side wants to rent Baykonur which is in principle supported by Kazakhstan. The rent term is so far unclear (a rent period of less than 30 years is inefficient for Russia). Kazakhstan has its own notion of the rent and it will be the most difficult to agree on the rent amount. Thus, Russia may have to boost the creation of its own launching grounds (a project of the sort is already available) to include defence and security tasks now solved only in Baykonur. Another acute question is the Kazakh demand for compensation for the damage done by Russian organizations at Baykonur space launching grounds and other three testing grounds located on Kazakh territory. According to estimations, the full cost of restoration of basic assets and Russian compensation for 1992-1993 maintenance and use of Baykonur and the testing grounds exceeds seven billion U.S. dollars. Baykonur seems to be used for bargaining and pressure on Russia. It has been established that the population was harmed only by nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk, and not a single nuclear explosion was registered there since the moment Russia proclaimed sovereignty. Thus, Russia cannot be responsible for damage done to the population in the past.
