On this occasion, Michal Kovac met journalists at the Borik Hotel in Bratislava. Our editors Magda Pospisilova and Zuzana Stukovska were at the news conference. [Stukovska] As expected, the majority of questions asked by journalists concerned Slovakia's internal political crisis. Commenting on the current situation, the president said that it might bring about a certain denouement, or at least a temporary one. He expects that an agreement to call early parliamentary elections will be reached. This might, according to Kovac, calm our society to a certain extent. [passage omitted] Because the 26th session of the National Council is to resume tomorrow [16 February], our colleague Magda Pospisilova asked the following question: [Pospisilova] Mr. President, if parliament passes a vote of no-confidence in the coalition government and the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] parliamentary group goes into opposition, what conditions will you set for agreeing to lead the Cabinet, or what are your criteria for selecting someone to whom you would ask to form an interim government? [Kovac] "There is no way I intend to lead the government. This is out of question. As far as these criteria are concerned, I want to hold talks with all representatives, above all with HZDS representatives, to ask them to remain in government and to propose somebody else [for the post of prime minister]. I will concentrate my attention on this. "If we fail to convince the HZDS representatives, following an agreement with other representatives of parliamentary political parties and movements, I will look for someone prepared to be asked to form a government." [Pospisilova] Journalists went on to ask: The foreign minister, whose current position is extraordinary, is supposed to accompany you on the planned visit to Austria. Do you think the complications are accidental? [Kovac] "I think that these things are not connected. I firmly believe that, at the time when the visit is to take place, the foreign minister will be able to accompany me." [Pospisilova] Two early elections dates have been mentioned: June and November 1994. Which of them is favored by the president, and what sort of government should be ruling Slovakia before the elections? [Kovac] "With regard to the debate, I think that the majority of the parties favor November. I do not want to get involved in this because this is really the business of the political entities, but, on the basis of what I was able to find out so far, I think that this [November] would be the optimal choice. If a vote of no-confidence in the government was passed before November, it would certainly be most suitable to have a broad coalition government of all parliamentary parties and movements. This government should prepare a number of bills that need to be passed by the government." [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] The next question is from Radiozurnal. Mr. President, it is known that relations between Prime Minister Klaus and President Havel are not ideal, but no one says that their relationship could damage the state's interests. This cannot be said about Slovakia. Do you think that relations will be the same between Neuwirth and Carnogursky [both of the Christian Democratic Party] or Weiss and Ftacnik [of the Movement for a Democratic Left]? [Kovac] "I do not know whether it will be, but, in any case, it is a pity because the lack of proper relations between the president and the prime minister can be negatively reflected in internal policy and also in foreign policy. This depends on personalities. To speak for myself, I have no pangs of conscience. I feel no share of guilt for the state of this relationship, and I do not know what I can do to improve it. I do not seek controversy, I am not conceited, I am cooperative and ready to cooperate. I am really vexed with this situation. I do not know what I can do apart from resigning." [Pospisilova] Have you received such an offer in the interests of improving relations? President Kovac's reply to this question was the last at this news conference. [Kovac] "No, I have not, and I do not intend to resign either. I was only mentioning it as a theoretical possibility, but I do not think the situation requires it. I see it as my duty to stay until the end, as long as my health allows me to do so, because I am becoming convinced that it is necessary to have patience, not to give up, to bring integrating and unifying elements into our society. As long as I am even slightly successful in this, it is my duty to continue in this policy."
