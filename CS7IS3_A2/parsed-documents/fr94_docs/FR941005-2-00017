Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on September 8, 1994, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive directs you to require an export visa for certain textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Laos and exported from Laos on and after October 1, 1994. You are directed to delay the implementation of the visa requirements until November 15, 1994. Effective on October 1, 1994, you are directed to amend the September 8, 1994 directive to prohibit entry of textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Laos and exported from Laos on and after November 15, 1994 for which the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic has not issued an appropriate export visa. Goods exported during the period November 15, 1994 through November 30, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24653 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
