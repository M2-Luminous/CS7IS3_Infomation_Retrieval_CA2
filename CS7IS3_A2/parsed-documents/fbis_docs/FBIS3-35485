The program is entitled "The Blockade," and is subtitled "A Special Program on the Impact of the Economic Blockade on Iraq." A map of Iraq is shown in yellow. A white ring surrounds the middle of the map near Baghdad. No other countries are shown on the map, the rest of which is colored green. The program opens with a Qatari announcer standing under a monument in Baghdad commemorating the Iran-Iraq war. The monument consists of two long swords stretching from the two sides of a wide avenue and forming a huge arch. The video then cuts to show Baghdad streets and people shopping in a market place. The announcer opens the program with the following announcement: "The blockade has created a big crisis inside Iraq. The Iraqi people are looking to the international community to end this blockade. Today, what is the main picture of the economic, social, and health conditions in Baghdad and other Iraqi provinces? To convey this picture from where it is happening and from the center of events, a Qatari television mission set out on a journey that lasted over 10 hours between the Jordanian capital Amman--the only gate to Iraq--and Baghdad. It is a trip that conveys several images and many answers to what is taking place in Iraq after almost three and a half years of blockade." The announcer interviews a citizen who complains that he cannot find the medicine prescribed for him by a doctor. The citizen blames the blockade for the shortage of medicine. He says he "wants the world to see our suffering." Another citizen says "all the people need food, not only medicine. The blockade is unjust for all the Iraqi people." A third citizen notes that children are especially suffering because of lack of medicine. However, he notes that "despite the blockade, the Iraqi people are standing fast." More citizens complain about the high price of food and clothes. The announcer says: "The Iraqi individual is facing an economic crisis in view of his low daily or monthly income. The average monthly income does not exceed 500 Iraqi dinars." A woman says she cannot buy new clothes and has to be content with old and hand-stitched clothes. A man says his monthly salary is 120 dinars, which is just enough for a meal in a restaurant in Baghdad. Another man says his monthly salary is 125 dinars, while the price of a kilo of meat is 160 dinars. Young men cannot get married, as a wedding costs between 50,000 and 100,000 dinars. He appeals to humanitarian organizations to help the Iraqi people. A citizen says that "because of the blockade some people have resorted to crime--to theft, kidnapping, rape, etcetera." More citizens are interviewed and they all complain about the high price of food and clothing. The announcer notes that "food staples, such as rice, sugar, and flour, are available in most markets of Baghdad and other provinces, but their prices are beyond the reach of most Iraqis." In a four-minute interview, Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad Mahdi Salih is asked what the materials are that can be imported from abroad and what the materials are that can be exported under the current blockade. He says that no exports are allowed because "UN Security Council resolutions still prevent Iraq from exporting any commodity." He notes that "after Resolution 687 was issued and after the military aggression against our country stopped, Iraq was allowed to import food and medicine. But how can it import when there are no oil exports and when our funds in foreign banks, specifically in U.S., British, French, and German banks, are still frozen? Therefore, the means of importing these materials are also frozen. At the end of 1991, we were allowed to import through the frozen funds. We imported a quantity of foodstuffs, but another resolution, No. 778, was issued at the end of 1992 re-freezing the Iraqi funds and preventing Iraq from using them to buy food and medicine." Asked about a certain UN Security Council resolution allowing Iraq to export a specified quantity of oil -- just enough to enable it to import humanitarian materials -- the minister says: "In fact, this resolution was designed for the purpose of paying the expenses of the inspection teams and other UN expenses and not for the purpose of securing the needs of the Iraqi people. Therefore, the resolution was designed and its technical details were drawn up in such a way as to secure the export of a quantity of oil without securing the import of materials. This resolution also interferes in the country's domestic affairs regarding the distribution of materials to the population." Asked about the recent arrival of ships at the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, the minister says: "In fact, when funds are available, the materials that are allowed to be imported, such as food, come through al-'Aqabah. The Turkish line is also open for food imports. However, the problem lies in financing imports. As for Umm Qasr port, its opening and the entry of ships into it last month enabled Iraq to have direct contacts with the outside the world and to import permitted materials and commodities. In other words, goods arrive at our national territory directly and we have direct contacts with the outside the world. This is an essential point on the subject. In addition, the cost of imports is reduced when goods come to our ports directly. The harsh economic conditions in the country require a reduction in the cost of imports when the country is in a position to import any quantity of food and medicine." The video then shows the Jordanian border point of al-Karamah on the Jordanian-Iraqi border and trucks transporting Iraqi crude oil to Jordan. More scenes are shown of Iraqi markets and more interviews are carried out with Iraqi citizens. The program then carries a two-minute interview with the Hashim 'Ali 'Ubayd, under secretary of the Ministry of Finance. He says: "The current exchange rate of foreign currencies, especially the dollar, in the Iraqi market and in the so-called parallel market does not represent the real exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar. This is because Iraq's foreign assets and funds are frozen. Iraq has not been allowed to export any commodity to earn these currencies. The current market of foreign currencies is very small and depends on what is available of these currencies in the market. It does not represent the real exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar." The video then shows children in Iraqi hospitals and notes lack of medical equipment, in addition to lack of medicine. Several women who were interviewed stress that there is no medicine for babies, either in hospitals or in pharmacies. A nurse says that babies are suffering from anemia and malnutrition. A pediatrician says there are no antibiotics or other medicine. In a 8-minute interview, Health Minister Dr. 'Umid Midhat Mubarak says: "Regrettably, the unjust UN resolutions have affected the situation. We can no longer obtain diagnostic materials such as primary chemical materials. We cannot even obtain isotopes, which everyone knows cannot be used for nonmedical purposes." He says the "mortality rate for children under five years old in 1989 was not more than 375 children per month. In December 1993, the mortality rate was over 4,000 per month. As for citizens over five years old, the mortality rate in 1989 was 1,700 per month; now it is approximately 6,500 per month." The health minister says most surgery is being postponed due to lack of equipment and medicine. He notes that due to lack of foreign currencies, Iraqi patients cannot be sent abroad for treatment. He regrets that some countries who claim to be defenders of human rights have denied entry visas to Iraqi patients. He notes that "the brothers in Qatar have recently sent medical consignments." He expresses the hope that "the brothers and real friends will realize this injustice inflicted on every single one of the Iraqi people for purely political reasons." He says these reasons are no longer justified and there is no need to use them to bring political pressure." In a two-minute interview, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf is asked whether he expects the blockade imposed on Iraq by the UN Security Council to be partially or wholly lifted in the near future. He gives the following answer: "We are working to complete the implementation of Paragraph 22. Logic says that the correct course is for Iraq and the Security Council to complete the work together to implement Paragraph 22 without any political conditions being added to it by any party. There is a very clear text. There are requirements which should be fulfilled to implement this text. These requirements are that Ambassador Ekeus, chairman of the Security Council Ad Hoc Committee, and Dr. Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], should submit a report to the Security Council, in accordance with the mandate given to them, saying that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Section C, that is Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. We are close to reaching this situation. We will work with the Ad Hoc Committee and the IAEA to complete the technical formulas for beginning the implementation of the supervision programs in accordance with Resolution 715. Consequently, it will be the duty of the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22." The video then shows more interviews with Iraqi citizens praising the State of Qatar and appealing to Arab states to help the Iraqi people. One citizen says "Kuwait returned to its people and Jabir returned as its amir. So what does the United Nations want? What does the Security Council want? What does the world want? What do the great powers want? What do they want from the Iraqi people? The people are suffering greatly and dying. There is no food, no medicine, and no essential goods."
