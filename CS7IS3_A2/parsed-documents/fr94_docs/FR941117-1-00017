FR941117-1-00017 FR941117-1-00004 Comprehensive mental health planning for a child or adolescent would typically involve representatives from the State mental health department, the child welfare authority, the educational/vocational services agency, the public health department, and in some cases the alcohol/drug treatment agency, and/or the juvenile justice system. The Medicaid agency would participate with these agencies in determining the proportionate share of funding responsibility for the services needed under the plan. The child or adolescent and the parents or guardians would also be involved in developing the services plan, and parents or guardians must also be involved in any treatment provided in order to ensure maximum long term benefit from the treatment. We would revise §441.106, Comprehensive mental health program, which implements the statutory requirement for a comprehensive mental health program, to reflect the statutory provisions more explicitly. The revision of this section, consistent with sections 1902 (a)(20) and (a)(21) of the Act, would require that each State's comprehensive mental health program involve all agencies in the State that serve mentally ill individuals. Medicaid's statutory authority for requiring a comprehensive mental health program applies to all States offering services for individuals age 65 and over in institutions for mental diseases (currently 46 States) and our regulations at §441.106 have long required that the comprehensive program cover all ages. Section 1912 of the Public Health Service Act includes a similar mental health planning provision and we would specify that any program developed as a result of that requirement would meet the Medicaid requirement. An annual progress report on the State's comprehensive mental health program is required under existing §441.106(c). We would move this requirement to §441.106(b), and modify it to specify that a comprehensive mental health services plan developed under section 1912 of the Public Health Service Act would satisfy the Medicaid reporting requirement. If a separate report is prepared, the interagency group involved in mental health planning would participate in the report preparation. The revision would also specify that the report must be submitted to the HCFA Regional Administrator within 3 months after the end of the fiscal year. In §441.151, General requirements, a new paragraph (c) would be added to require that services provided to an individual under the psychiatric L 21 benefit must be compatible with the individual's comprehensive services plan developed as specified in §441.45(b) (discussed above). We also would delete the existing regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation in §441.151(b). As discussed in section II of this preamble, this requirement was removed from the law in 1984 and the Joint Commission has indicated that it does not wish to have its accreditation mandated in HCFA regulations since accreditation is voluntary. We would require that psychiatric facilities meet either the psychiatric hospital requirements specified in existing §482.60 and proposed §483.202, or operate as an inpatient psychiatric unit in a general hospital that meets the requirements of existing subparts B and C of part 482 and proposed §483.202, or meet the psychiatric residential treatment facility conditions of participation that we are proposing in §§483.210 through 483.224 of the new subpart F of part 483. To summarize, all providers of the psychiatric L 21 benefit would be required to meet the condition of participation in §483.202 relating to active treatment and the inpatient plan of treatment, in addition to meeting the other regulatory requirements applicable to the particular setting.
