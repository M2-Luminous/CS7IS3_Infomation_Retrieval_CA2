In the near future, there will be talk of an all but complete operational integration of the most important surface ships of the two navies. The frigates and minehunters of both countries will then, in practice, comprise a single navy, although control of the ships will remain in national hands. The command center for the joint fleet will be in Den Helder, manned by military personnel from both countries. [passage omitted] In The Hague there was talk Tuesday [26 April] that this was similar to the German-Netherlands Army Corps to be set up in Muenster. This corps will comprise two German divisions and one Netherlands division. The difference is that the German-Netherlands Corps will be under a revolving command. The Netherlands Navy commander will continue to be the primary person responsible for the joint navy with Belgium. [passage omitted] The cooperation is designed mainly to produce military budget savings. The Netherlands Navy will have to reduce its personnel nearly 30 percent by the year 2000. With a total budget reduction of 18 percent since 1989 and considering that the Navy's budget accounts for some 20 percent of the overall defense budget, it is clear that there have been major savings in this branch of the Armed Forces over the past five years.
