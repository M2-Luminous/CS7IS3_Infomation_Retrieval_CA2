FR940224-1-00003 FR940224-1-00001 The AMA authorizes voluntary official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other products such as raw nuts, Christmas trees, and flowers. The AMA provides that reasonable fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered. The program seeks to maintain an unobligated balance that is at least equal to 4 months of operating expense. The unobligated balance for the Federal inspection service at destination markets at the end of fiscal year 1993 was 1.1 months of operating expense. Approximately $240,000 in increases are expected in the cost the service pays for General Services Administration office rent and Federal Telecommunications Service, and a $120,000 increase is expected for the cost of implementing a locality-based pay system in January 1994. The service plans to implement cost-cutting actions during fiscal year 1994 that are expected to save approximately $350,000 each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 1995. These cost-cutting actions will offset some of the expected increases in service costs; however, further action is necessary to meet all rising costs and for the program's unobligated balance to grow to the 4 month level necessary to provide contingency funding. AMS regularly reviews this program to determine if fees are adequate. The last fee change was effective on November 12, 1992 (57 FR 48929). With the planned cost-cutting actions, but without a fee increase, the unobligated balance of this program is expected to decrease to seven-tenths of a month by the end of fiscal year 1994 and to two-tenths of a month by the end of fiscal year 1995. Based on the program's need to offset various rising expenses, to increase its unobligated balance, and to incorporate user-fee funding for standardization activities, AMS proposes to increase the fees for destination market inspection services. Additionally, regulations would be added or clarified to (1) establish a new inspection fee for 50 packages or less of the same product; (2) reflect the lower level of effort typically required to inspect small lots compared to that required for half carlot equivalent lots with 500 to 1,000 packages; (3) charge for waiting time at the prevailing hourly rate when an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible; and (4) apply dock-side inspection fees to cases where the applicant offers the product to AMS for inspection at the dock-side facility but AMS chooses to inspect the product at another location. The following table compares current fees and charges with proposed fees and charges for fresh fruit and vegetable inspection as found in 7 CFR 51.38. Unless otherwise provided for by regulation or written agreement between the applicant and the Administrator, the charges in the schedule of fees as found in ยง51.38 are:
