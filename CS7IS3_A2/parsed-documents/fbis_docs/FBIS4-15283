In Russia the exports and imports of weapons and military equipment have been entrusted to the government-owned company Rosvooruzheniye recently formed by a decree of President Boris Yeltsin. Our reporter Vitaliy Jibuti has interviewed its General Director Viktor Samoilov. INTERFAX: Analysts claim that Russia has lost a considerable share of the arms markets of the Soviet Union. How true are such claims? SAMOILOV: In my opinion only the countries affected by UN sanctions are lost. This applies primarily to Libya and Iraq. By the way, several capitalist countries received compensation from the United Nations and the International Monetary fund for severing economic ties with those countries. Only the Soviet Union and Russia as its legal successor got nothing after the introduction of sanctions. According to my estimates, the losses of the Russian Federation amount to $1015 Bn. INTERFAX: Which of the traditional arms markets has Moscow retained best? SAMOILOV: The Middle East, India, China, Africa and East Europe. However, the difficulty lies in the change in the very structure of the arms market. In the past there was no question of settlements in hard currency with socialist countries. When in 1990 it was decided to switch to settlements in hard currency, which I by the way find absolute thoughtless and wrong, 1991 was declared the year of payments. As a result the Soviet Union and Russia after were left in debt to practically all former socialist countries. I think the lack of professionalism of the economic leaders of that time the main cause for such an imbalance. The matter will have to be settled yet. The Soviet Union supplied East Europe with valuable raw materials and manufactured goods getting in return mostly green peas and tomatoes. As a result the Russian Federation owes its partners hundreds of millions of dollars. At the present stage the main article with which Russia can pay back its foreign debts, I think, is weaponry. INTERFAX: If Russia has kept its traditional arms markets, why has trade dropped? SAMOILOV: The volume of trade changed with the change of the methods of settlements. Since 1991 Russia has practically stopped selling arms for credit. Earlier the Soviet Union supplied arms and military hardware mainly on the basis of government agreements and credits. Political as well as economic factors were taken into account. Credits were given for a minimum of seven years. Often the term was 10 or even 20 years. There is even one contract for 43 years which is still in force. This is the explanation for the impressive volume of trade and the recent leadership of Moscow in the business. I would want to remark that at the moment the volume of American arms trade for cash is practically the same as Russian. Last year Moscow imported armaments worth $2 Bn. The the USA claims that it sold $30Bn it means credit deliveries as well. The credits are usually given at sufficiently advantageous terms. Today it is senseless speaking of a return to the old volume of Soviet arms trade. This requires a healthy economy and solid investments in the industry, because ties should be of long-term nature here. Any contract for cooperation in defence is concluded for at least 20 or 25 years. It is clear that partners can be satisfied with only government contracts. That is why at the end of last year the Russian government united several organizations trading arms in one, "Rosvooruzheniye". The leadership of the company does not wish to keep this megacorporation for a long time. As soon as the process of forming joint-stock companies in the munitions industry picks up speed and structures appear guaranteeing foreign companies the observation of contracts for 20 to 25 years in complex types of equipment, Rosvooruzheniye is going to give freedom and independence in arms trade to them. However, the appearance of such Russian companies requires time. At the moment American arms dealers have only one competitor - the Russian Federation. The program of arms sales should be part of the program of military development and adjusted to the program of conversion. That is we should know what plants are going to survive in 20 to 25 years, what types of equipment are going to remain competitive on condition of their modernization during this time. Otherwise Russia risks to lose its markets. Individual deals can only keep up the staggering military-industrial complex for some time. But such an approach is devoid of statesmanship. INTERFAX: What realistic amount of weaponry can Russia export this year? SAMOILOV: Trade for cash can be increased by 100 to 150 percent. If we take trade for credit, in a favorable situation the contracts might total $10-15 Bn, but with a delay in payments. This is in line with the defence programs of the countries that are capable of purchasing Russian weaponry. I must say that the figure includes the markets from which embargos might be lifted. The figures are realistic because Russia, unlike the Soviet Union, is not isolated from the world community. The Russian banking and financial systems are integrated in the international system. That is why for concluding one deal or another Moscow can use first class foreign banks as guarantor. Besides, Russian commercial banks are gradually becoming stronger, developing into solid financial institutions which can be dealt with. I am convinced that if our company offers them a well- considered program of crediting some country or another to which Russian army goods are going to be sold, Russia banks will show interest in that. But today constant complaints on political and economic instability in Russia undermine the reliability of domestic arms manufacturers and contracts for the delivery of weapons. This has also affected the volume of Russian exports. Why should a solid client sign a contract with the Russian Federation for the delivery of the latest weaponry, if it is not clear who is going to control the manufacturing facility tomorrow and whether the country is going to stand by its commitments in general? "Rosvooruzheniye" has worked out a program of covering part of Russia's foreign debts by deliveries of special equipment. The program is designed for two or three years and should bring the country over $1 Bn. For the purpose our company has asked a government credit to support Russian arms manufacturers. After 1991 the manufacturer has been getting the returns for the exports, but not all manufacturers are satisfied with the terms of the financial transactions. Many of them do not believe in the stability of the Russian government or are dissatisfied with the tax system. That is why some companies are trying to keep their money in foreign banks. This is an understandable desire, I think. "Rosvooruzheniye" guarantees full return of hard currency to Russia, the sale of half of it to the state and the return of the rubles to the manufacturer.The manufacturer also gets the rest of the hard currency, but only in the territory of the Russian Federation. I would also want to say that Rosvooruzheniye is interested in direct contacts with regions and in the possibility of uniting manufacturers into industrial groups that could carry out serious economic programs. Our company has set up a scientific center that supports such an economic policy. Production groups in the military-industrial complex should become the main performers of major contracts on military- technical cooperation and guarantee their functioning for 20 to 25 years.
