FR940610-0-00139 FR940610-0-00024 For the current fiscal year that began on October 1, 1994, the Service is making expeditious progress to propose and list (within the six conterminous States where bull trout reside), at least 80 plant and animal taxa with listing priority numbers between 2 and 8. The Service, therefore, finds that listing the distinct vertebrate population segment of bull trout residing in the conterminous United States is warranted, but precluded due to other higher priority listing actions. Such species are placed in category 1 of the candidate species list. More detailed information regarding the above decisions may be obtained from the Service's Olympia office (see ADDRESSES above).
