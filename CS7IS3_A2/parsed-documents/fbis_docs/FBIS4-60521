The Sudanese Government's representative was noticeably absent from the celebration, despite the fact that the Sudanese Government was sent an invitation by the head of the African diplomatic corps. Ugandan Ambassador to Sudan E. Obitre Gama, doyen of the African diplomatic corps in Khartoum, delivered a speech in which he condemned the measures taken by the Sudanese authorities against the Egyptian interests in Khartoum, such as the Egyptian Club, where the celebration was supposed to have been held. Because of this, the celebration was moved to the home of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum. Ambassador Gama thanked Egypt and its ambassador for hosting this celebration and not cancelling it. This gave many Africans an opportunity to celebrate their day. During the celebration, the Egyptian ambassador received notification from the head of the Egyptian Irrigation Department in Sudan that this evening the Sudanese authorities took control of another house of the Egyptian Irrigation Department in Khartoum, the resident of which is currently on annual leave in Cairo. This report drew condemnations from the sons of the African communities in Sudan who were attending the celebration. Thus, the number of houses that have been occupied has risen to 14, in addition to the Egyptian Defense Office's three rest houses. In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum, Dr. Hasan Jad-al-Haqq affirmed at the end of the celebration that no matter what happened, today's celebration of Africa Day was not going to be cancelled. He affirmed that he considers the residence of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum to be the home for all Africans in Sudan.
