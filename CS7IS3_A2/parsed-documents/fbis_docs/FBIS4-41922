Prestige is gradually gained by people in the Belorussian [Belarusian] political arena who are unconnected with existing parties and clans but who are skilled at winning votes from the electorate with attractive ideas. On this occasion the idea in question is the struggle against corruption. A short while ago the government press attempted to depict People's Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenka as some Hercules cleaning out the Augean stables of corruption. But when the Council of Ministers' ideologists went into reverse, it was already too late: The former parliamentary commission chairman remained more or less the only honest person in the minds of the general public. What is more he is one of them, a man of the people. But on his own Lukashenka would hardly have been able to maintain this essential position. Help came to him from politicians of the new wave whom former Speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich once called the "young wolves." The Lukashenka team's "think tank" comprises Dmitriy Bulakhow, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission for Legislation; Valeriy Tsepkala, a former adviser to Stanislaw Shushkevich; Viktor Hanchar, deputy chairman of Maladechna City Soviet Executive Committee; and several other people whose names are as yet little known to the public. The unifying force between them is a strong desire to get their way into power. Their backing for Lukashenka is for the moment proving to be justified. The "young wolves" have organized and are running his election campaign in a professional manner, which cannot be said about the majority of other teams. Without making any particular effort to win the votes of relatively small groups in the population, such as the intelligentsia, they have basically oriented themselves toward the rural areas and the urban working class. This brought them success in the first round. The results of the 23 June poll came as a real shock for the government team. On Thursday [23 June] evening, journalists who were trying to get in contact with the Council of Ministers, discovered that nearly all its staffers who were at work were heavily under the influence of alcohol. It was in this way that stress was relieved throughout the weekend, which hardly promoted a sober assessment of the situation or helped to map out a future course of action. In the meantime, it seems that Vyacheslaw Kebich's entourage did everything it could to sink its own candidate in the first round. [There were] constant attempts to bribe voters (in one rayon veterans were handed envelopes with "from Vyacheslaw Kebich" on the outside and money inside, after which it was suggested that they vote immediately). The promotion of the prime minister's candidacy and the vilification of Lukashenka, Poznyak, and Shushkevich have rebounded. These tricks are no longer tolerated by the Belorussian public. But Kebich's team proved unable to put forward anything else at the time. The democrats' failure is for the most part conditioned by a lack of unity in its ranks. The tiny parties -- the Belorussian Social Democratic Assembly [gromada] and the United Democratic Party of Belorussia [Belarus] -- decided to show everyone that they are just as good as anybody else, but were unable to come up with anything better than to nominate Stanislaw Shushkevich as a candidate. The former speaker flopped. Once the preliminary results of the poll's first round were already known, the "Assembly" managed to complain in print about the Belorussian People's Front which did not support Shushkevich but nominated its leader Zenon Poznyak as a candidate, who, incidentally, polled more votes. Kebich's team will attempt to change the course of the contest. The 24 hours [of breathing space] promised by Lukashenka to officials he considers guilty of corruption in which to "escape to the Himalayas" is not much of a consolation. Members of the Council of Ministers evidently have no idea of how in fact they will act. The few who were fit to work on Friday were hoping that all those who did not vote for the anticorruption campaigner in the first round would now vote against Lukashenka and therefore for them. But this scenario does not seem realistic. Even if events develop very favorably for Kebich, he will not succeed in closing such an immense gap. The only chance for his team is to wreck the election's second round and this will not be simple. For his part, Lukashenka and his associates will attempt to build on the success they have already achieved. A strike against his rivals is not ruled out by way of an extra measure. According to information in the possession of IZVESTIYA, Valeriy Tsepkala is at present in Nigeria. His trip there was preceded by an incident involving the detention of a transport plane allegedly bound for this African country (though in fact actually bound for the former Yugoslavia) carrying Belorussian arms. If Tsepkala returns with serious enough compromising materials on the Council of Ministers, there can be no doubt that this information will soon be in the public domain.
