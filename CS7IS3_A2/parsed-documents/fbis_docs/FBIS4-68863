But unfortunately so since, as specialists believe, Ukraine could lose in it more than it finds. Well, judge for yourselves. We offer for your attention our correspondent's interview with Pavel Petrenko, chief specialist of the Department of Foreign Economic Relations of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. [Oleynik] So Ukraine is an associate member of the CIS Economic Union. May it be hoped that many problems of economic disintegration will now be overcome more successfully? [Petrenko] If we attempt to avoid emotions and operate only with facts and intellect based on strict economic realities, the situation is defined as follows. The development of the CIS Economic Union in the interests of all its participants, as the treaty declares, will depend primarily on the possibilities and readiness for cooperation of the participants, first and foremost on the national systems of the management of foreign economic relations. An analysis of the treaty testifies that the majority of its articles do not, to put it mildly, coincide with the interests of the people of Ukraine. In the legal respect, for example, the treaty is not adjusted and requires an enormous amount of supplementary exegesis and clarification. This state of affairs automatically enables one of the strongest parties to the treaty to immediately avail itself of these lacunae, which promise Ukraine nothing but losses. The rights and obligations of Ukraine in the treaty are not balanced or weighed. It is not at all clear how Ukraine's banks will participate in the shaping of currency-financial and banking legislation of the Economic Union. It may be forecast even now, therefore, that realization of the treaty will undoubtedly have ambiguous consequences for Ukraine and its trading partners not only on a CIS scale. This applies primarily to the spheres of the so-called "four freedoms" which were determined by the Treaty of Rome of the countries of the European Union: free movement of goods, services, manpower, and capital. [Oleynik] Does it not seem to you that realization of the terms of the treaty in the deformed space of the CIS, hopelessly backward in the legal and technical-economic respect and not even remotely reminiscent of the former Union space, is simply unrealistic? [Petrenko] I am sure it is, unfortunately. The preamble to the treaty even speaks of the formation and development of a common economic space. And an attempt is made even to decipher these terms. Article 3, say, specifies the free movement of goods, a coordinated tax, price, foreign economic, and customs policy, and the harmonized economic legislation of the Contracting Parties. But what is meant by this free movement of goods, primarily for Ukraine? If we are guided by the treaty, Ukraine is required to provide for the unimpeded transit across its territory of goods from the customs territories of other countries of the Economic Union or any third country. That is, Ukraine will once again be left with precious little, as it was in the times of the USSR. Free trade does not, incidentally, prevent the importation into Ukraine of commodities exerting a negative influence on its environment. No provision is made together with the abolition of tariff and nontariff regulation and the lowering and elimination of duty, taxes, and charges for the preservation of quota-determination for commodity imports and exports. For Ukraine such a state of affairs--Viktor Pynzenyk is absolutely right here, incidentally--is unequivocally disadvantageous inasmuch as it has a negative balance of payments with Russia. [Oleynik] The treaty provides for concerted tariffs on materials-handling operations. As experts maintain, it is in fact a question of regulation of the rate of profit of Ukrainian transport enterprises. They note the improper formulation of the question of the parties' "common customs tariff" and the "coordination of the participants' foreign economic trade." [Petrenko] The disastrous consequences for Ukraine, as an independent subject of foreign economic activity which is only just attempting to plug its national economy into the system of the world economy, are obvious in this respect. If we keep to the letter of the treaty, the doors to the market of European states will be closed even more tightly to Ukraine. And, believe me, we will be guaranteed technical and technological backwardness even longer. According to Article 7, the parties "will pursue a coordinated policy in the sphere of the development of transport and communications geared to the efficient transportation of freight." It is a question, of course, of freight that is shipped via Ukraine. It is reasonable to ask: Why is particular emphasis being put (for the umpteenth time) on the transport system? The answer lies right there on the surface--thanks to exploitation of Ukraine's transport systems and enterprises and the elimination of taxes and charges on freight (Articles 5 and 6) that is conveyed across our borders, the parties to the treaty will strengthen the economy of their states at our expense. And what price the explanations in Article 9 to the effect that the parties "will undertake without mutual concordance unilateral actions of a noneconomic nature to restrict access to their markets." How is the term "of a noneconomic nature" to be qualified? Economics, just like nature, does not have things that are purely independent of something or other or of consequences. Who has computed what restricted access to CIS markets of its rolled metal and machine-building and chemical products would cost Ukraine? Thus Ukraine is on the one hand a subscriber to the treaty, on the other, sanctions of a "noneconomic nature," which would inevitably entail not only financial but also social difficulties, could be applied to it. [Oleynik] How are we, from the viewpoint of an independent state, to understand Article 13, which says that "...The Parties will coordinate their investment policy... in sectors of mutual interest." [Petrenko] We could agree to this were we to forget that the imperial system of management in Ukraine bled the national economy white, leaving us a deformed structure of industry. But we would then have to forget about the main assignment of the current and prospective development of the economy of Ukraine--a reorganization of its economic structure for the needs of the populace. Articles 14 and 15 speak of the creation of an interstate free trade association, according to which the Ukrainian currency would belong to a multi-currency system, and the Russian ruble would be detached as something intermediate between multi- and mono-currency systems. We are talking about the formation of a currency union which is to provide for mutual settlements based on a common (reserve) currency. It is not hard to foresee that the functioning of the currency union will ensure only the stability of the ruble, and the national currencies of the other states will be working concertedly for the accomplishment of the goals identified by the "ruble" currency union. And Article 16 proposes the creation of a payments union, which would provide for payments in the national currencies via multilateral clearing in the Interstate Bank of the CIS. This union is intended for the achievement of the full convertibility of the currencies as integration processes intensify and would necessarily be transformed into a unified currency system. It is clear even to the nonspecialist that we are talking about the restoration of the Soviet settlements system. [Oleynik] But perhaps these are, indeed, merely proposals? [Petrenko] An analysis of the treaty testifies that the ultimate goal of the Economic Union is gradual deprivation of the independent states first of economic, then of political levers. The proposed methods and principles of the formation of a currency and monetary system among the states of the CIS are not news, incidentally. They existed at the time of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance, but in this case the authors of the treaty took account of the CEMA omissions. The mechanism of mutual settlements and influence on the economy of the participants in the CIS Economic Union which has been created blocks as much as possible the structural reorganization of Ukraine. This is evident from the content of Articles 17 and 18, which "guarantee" for the Ukrainian currency a Procrustean bed until such time as the Russian ruble becomes fully convertible. Only after this, if we have not lost the state by this time, will it be possible to commence structural transformations of the economy, but this will be many times harder to do than now. [Oleynik] And what will guarantee the standardization of the tax system of the participants in the Economic Union, which presupposes a common mechanism of taxes and tax rates? [Petrenko] Harmonization of tax policy based on a unity of methodology of consideration of production costs is required of the parties to the treaty. Article 29 proposes for this the creation of common executive and coordinating institutions. What does this mean? That we have, in fact, to give up our own tax system, which is essential for strengthening our economy, and hand over the planning of all processes of economic life to supra-state executive and coordinating institutions. In addition, the Economic Union specifies that within the framework of the treaty the leadership of the states' foreign economic relations shall be exercised by a discrete organ of administration. It should be expected that it will in time be accorded the functions of central organ of planning of the CIS states in the sphere of foreign economic activity. The performance of the said functions will inevitably entail the creation of a vast bureaucracy, and a great deal of money will be spent on this. At the same time, on the other hand, Russia has thus far blocked all questions concerning the shareout of assets earned together, the gold and currency reserves, the Black Sea Fleet, and such. Thus the Economic Council in the form in which it exists today and in which Ukraine has already agreed to participate with associate-member status will accomplish the intentions of the neo-allies and deliver a crushing blow to the sovereignty of Ukraine. Following which it will take us a long time to approach even today's level of political and economic independence.
