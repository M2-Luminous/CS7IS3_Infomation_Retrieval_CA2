Bratislava SME in Slovak on 22 March on page 1 carries a 400-word "asa"-signed report entitled "M. Knit: I Expect Changes in the FNM Presidium and Executive Committee." The report notes that "on Friday, 18 March, the FNM SR Presidium withdrew from Jan Kato the authorization to hold the post of chairman of the FNM SR Executive Committee. It charged Karol Danys, a member of the FNM Executive Committee, with the provisional management of the FNM Executive Committee." The report then quotes M. Knitl, a member of the FNM Presidium, as having told SME that "he expects parliament to devote itself in the very near future to the election of new members of the FNM Presidium and assumes that changes in the FNM Executive Committee will follow suit." Asked whether he believes that "political criteria prevailed over professional criteria in the election of current members of the FNM Executive Committee," Knitl concedes that "in some cases, the two criteria were not in conformity." Confronted with "claims casting doubt on some privatization projects" that were approved by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before its dismissal, Knitl says that "the FNM has been only the implementor of government resolutions" and can be made responsible only for the technical realization of projects. On the same page, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a 100-word interview with Karol Danys, "a member of the FNM SR Executive Committee charged with its management," by an "asa"-attributed SME reporter. The interview, the place and date of which are not given, is published under the headline "We Have Agreed To Freeze FNM Accounts." In the interview, Danys announces that "we have agreed with the minister of privatization to ban trading in FNM securities and to freeze its accounts. To prevent the situation regarding privatization, around which there is plenty of confusion, from deteriorating, we have agreed to halt all property transfers."
