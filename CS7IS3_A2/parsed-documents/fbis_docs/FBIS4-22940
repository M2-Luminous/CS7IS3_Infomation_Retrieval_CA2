Ivakhnyuk, O.E. Babkin, and N.F. Fedorov, Saint Petersburg Technology Institute; UDC 661.183] [Abstract] The process of synthesizing sorbents and chromatographic carriers based on ultradisperse powders not only permits wide variation of the pore structure and surface properties but also makes it possible to create materials with actively sorbing surface pores. Packing and fixing ultradisperse particles in the form of granules and/or products makes it possible to obtain sorbents with uniform pores (i.e., with a narrow distribution of meso- and macropores). Grafting compounds with specified chemical properties to the surface of sorbents with uniform pores is, for example, necessary for immobilizing enzymes for chromatographic separation. The effectiveness of this technique may be seen by comparing the characteristics of starting and hydroxylated mesoporous carbon sorbent based on commercial-grade carbon. Hydroxyl groups located on the surface of carbon sorbents may also be used effectively to graft other functional groups such as amino groups, which may in turn serve as centers for immobilizing biologically active compounds. Sorbents based on ultradisperse powders may be produced by 1) creating primary transport porosity in the molding stage and 2) using heat treatment to develop meso- and macroporosity with a narrow distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent radii (with the pore volume and pore radius being determined by the diameter of the starting ultradisperse particles, molding pressure, amount of binder, and sintering temperature). Sorbents synthesized in this manner have a well-developed porosity (0.50 cm[.sup]3[/]/cm[.sup]3[/], no micropores, and a narrow distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent radii. Additional thermochemical treatment in the form of high-temperature chlorination (or vapor-gas activation of carbon sorbents) may then be used to develop the volume of adsorbing micro- and supermicropores while maintaining transport porosity. In this way it is possible to synthesize adsorbents with a bipore structure from ultradisperse powders of materials that are not themselves active sorbents, such as metal carbides or metalloids. High-temperature chlorination of carbides or carbonitrides makes it possible, thanks to layer-by-layer reaction, to create a porous actively sorbing carbon layer. Such absorbents have proved to significantly reduce the time required for chromatographic analysis without in any way diminishing the separative power under one and the same set of conditions.
