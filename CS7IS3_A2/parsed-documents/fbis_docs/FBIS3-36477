The possibility of conducting joint military exercises was discussed last year during a working meeting between Russian and U.S. defense Ministers in Bavaria in summer, and during the visit by the Russian defense minister to the United States in autumn. A final agreement on joint exercises was reached at the January U.S.- Russian summit in Moscow.
