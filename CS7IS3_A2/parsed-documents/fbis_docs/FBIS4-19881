Mehmet Ali Yilmaz, Turkish state minister in charge of Cyprus affairs, paid a farewell visit on Denktas this morning. Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Denktas said that there are promises made in the first version of the CBM package and recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis accepted the package before it was changed. Explaining that the package was eliminated as a result of negotiations conducted subsequently, Denktas noted that Kliridhis acted as if he accepted the package although he actually had not. This was Kliridhis' tactics, Denktas remarked. Denktas declared that the original package must be reinstated, adding that work can be conducted on this version.
