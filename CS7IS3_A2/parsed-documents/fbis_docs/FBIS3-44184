Addressing a press conference after meeting Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence Makwetu in Johannesburg on Thursday, Mr Buthelezi said the alliance was waiting for a written compromise by ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki before talks resumed on Friday. "But frankly, I am not optimistic about it. Nevertheless, since we are determined to do everything in our power to find a solution we feel we should do that and go the whole hog in trying to reach an agreement." On changing the April elections from a single ballot paper for national and regional candidates to a two-ballot system, Mr Buthelezi said ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had refused to discuss the issue. He said agreement on a two-ballot system would help in getting the IFP to participate in the election, but indicated outstanding consitutional issues such as stronger regional powers would also have to be settled. The IFP leader said a delegation for Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini was discussing the ballot issue with the government. "The king said he would not encourgage his amakhosi, the chiefs, and his people to participate in elections if the single-ballot system was imposed on his people."
