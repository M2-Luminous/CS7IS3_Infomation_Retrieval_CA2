[Van Miert] Behind this controversy over personalities there are also different concepts. The British are in favor of a -- how should I say -- very flexible Europe, a sort of free-trade area, and would prefer to do as little as possible as far as environmental or social issues are concerned. So their concept is completely different to that of Mr. Kohl or Mr. Mitterrand, for example. Behind this crisis over electing a new Commission president is actually also a more profound crisis. I think that this is why the coming years will be very difficult. [Hochner] One sign of the crisis -- not of the EU but of the member countries -- is the horrendous unemployment figures: Official figures speak of 17 million, while some have said that the actual figure may be as high as 20 million. If it wants to be or to remain credible in the eyes of its citizens, does the EU not have to develop and implement adequate concepts quickly against unemployment? [Van Miert] Of course, it has to. This is why the European Commission with the driving force of Jacques Delors presented this White Book, which actually creates the framework conditions for a common policy toward employment policy, stimulating the economy again, of course, also for environmental policy, and for better protection of the EU against third countries. Unfortunately, all this was not dealt with adequately in Corfu. Therefore, I am most disappointed that all that happened there was the dispute over who will succeed Delors. The great problems such as unemployment, the competitive strength of our economy, etc., were actually only dealt with marginally, which is a shame. [Hochner] One of the problems of the future -- you have mentioned competition -- is to make competitive strength compatible with the protection of the environment. There are those who say that environmental protection kills jobs -- industry representatives often hold that view, whereas others say that environmental protection creates jobs. Is this linkage appropriate at all, or does one not have to say clearly that environmental protection is necessary to protect the environment, and jobs have to be created or saved because we need jobs. [Van Miert] I think that a modern economy has to do both, which is why we need an overall strategy. There can be no doubt that we must try to achieve enough growth. Yet, this must not be done in the old way, for we need growth in quality. Of course, we have to do something to reduce the cost of labor; for example, if we introduce a new carbon dioxide tax, an energy tax, then we could use the money to reduce the social costs of work. So there is a lot to do and, as I said before, all relevant proposals are already included in the EU's white book. What we lack are the joint efforts by the member states to tackle this challenge. The real tragedy is that today we do not have too much of Europe but too little to tackle these great challenges in the sphere of growth -- growth in quality -- environmental policy, competitive strength, and employment policy; efforts are still too much based on national priorities and sometimes one member state even does something against other member states. My conclusion is clear, and it is something against the currently prevailing opinion in Europe: We will manage to overcome this great challenge only when we cooperate more and cooperate more efficiently than in the past. This means that we must also depart from the veto right, from the principle of unanimous decisions. If we fail to do that, things will never turn out as they should.
