Ms Raphel is expected to proceed to Pakistan immediately after her India trip. It will be very surprising if Ms Raphel does not once again change track and start harping on her favourite theme of human rights abuses in Kashmir and question the territorial integrity of India. Should this happen, it would be most unfortunate. The inability of the world's two largest democracies to see eye to eye has created a somewhat anomalous situation. In the economic sphere, India's relations with the United States seem to be on a perfectly even keel. The commerce department had designated India as one of the ten major emerging markets in the world to receive special attention as the United States formulates its worldwide export strategy. The United States continues to be the largest market for India's exports, accounting for 20 percent of what we sell abroad. The United States is also the largest foreign investor in India with investments in 1993 representing as much as 42 percent of the over $2 billion approved by the Government of India. Apart from these interesting facts, the newly formed India Interest Group, reflecting the views of 20 major American corporations which include such well-known names as General Electric, American Express, AT&T, IBM, Coca Cola and Citibank, is doing a wonderful job in raising the visibility of U.S.-India bilateral relations with policy and decision-makers in Washington. As far as the liberalisation policy is concerned, the U.S. support seems well defined. But it is the inability of the two countries to strike rapport in political matters that has been a cause for concern. Strategic alliances here seem thicker than economic opportunities. The inability of the foreign-policy-makers in Washington to understand the psyche of Indian and Pakistani suspicions of each other's intentions which are deeply rooted and thus not easily dissipated, and their trigger-happy secretaries talking about human rights abuses without understanding the ground realities have led to their shooting off their mouths, souring not just bilateral relations between India and Pakistan, but also among India, Pakistan and the United States. Two important reasons as to why India and Pakistan are not able to thrash out differences are: Pakistan's inability to overcome the fact that it lost Bangladesh because of India and so retribution via Kashmir; second, the United States' inability to put the sub-continent's priorities over its own strategic policies, leading to ambiguous mouthings, convenient to boosting its own image and interests. Unfortunately, both India and Pakistan have been playing into the hands of the United States by each trying to win over the super power. If the same will and initiative was shown in resolving differences between the two countries, so much more would have been achieved and the Raphels of the world would not have been ruffling our feathers. It is difficult to accept Ms Raphel's statement that the United States is not siding with Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and that the Clinton administration has no quarrel with the territorial integrity of India. If that be the case, Ms Raphel owes India an apology for all her utterances. Indian policy-makers have, for once, taken the offensive in saying that they do not want to have talks on Kashmir. That is how it has got to be. They should also be prepared to hear in a short while, Ms Raphel switching to her familiar role of India bashing, the moment she leaves our shores. The firm stand taken by the External Affairs Ministry and the Home Ministry should send definite signals to Washington about their misplaced South Asia policy. Also, India is fully within its rights not to discuss what is an internal matter with a third country. So, lay off Raphel. If, as she says, the Clinton administration really wants a strong and productive relationship with India, the most important thing to do would be for her to save her energies and remain silent. The less you talk, the fewer mistakes you commit. That is the moral.
