FR941110-2-00035 FR941110-2-00009 Comment 38: Timken asserts that Koyo's failure to report home-market sample sales in its original submission, and then, at the Department's request, Koyo's submission of a list rather than a computer tape, should not be countenanced. Timken claims that the printout of home-market sample sales Koyo provided in its supplemental response is clearly from a computer file. Therefore, Timken concludes that submission of a computer tape of home-market sample sales could not be as difficult as Koyo professes. Moreover, Timken chides the Department for not requesting such data despite Timken's timely protest of Koyo's failure to report home-market sample sales. Absent sample sales, the home-market sales listing is incomplete and unreliable. In Timken's view, the only proper solution, short of rejecting the entire response, is to require immediate submission of a computer tape listing of sample sales. Timken maintains that Koyo elected not to comply because the Department has only limited options regarding ``best information'' under these circumstances. Timken states that in 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs the Department addressed Koyo's failure to support its claim that particular home-market sales were samples. Koyo argues that the Department properly excluded its home-market sample sales because they are de minimis in volume and value and have been verified by the Department as sample sales outside the ordinary course of trade. Koyo characterizes Timken's suggestion that Koyo be required to submit an entire new computer tape of the home-market sales, including these sales, as ``ridiculous'' and contrary to Timken's own stated desire not to ``increase the cost of bringing this proceeding to a final conclusion.'' Department's Position: In our October 1993 supplemental questionnaire we requested that Koyo submit a listing of its home-market sample sales. In response to our supplemental questionnaire Koyo submitted a hard copy computer printout of its home-market sample sales (November 1, 1993, Exhibit 1). At verification we confirmed the accuracy of the nature of these sales ( i.e., samples) and the value and volume reported. We determined that the volume and value of these sales were indeed minuscule and the fact that we did not have them electronically could not have any measurable or significant impact on our ability to conduct these administrative reviews. We are confident that the home-market data base we used for comparison purposes was indeed sufficient and complete. Requiring a computer tape of the home-market sample sales would be, in this instance, superfluous and unnecessarily time-consuming. Comment 39: Timken notes that the Department relied upon the revised data submitted by Koyo in 1991 for its analysis and did not consider other information contained in the administrative record. In view of Koyo's decision to revise its data, Timken asserts that the Department should draw adverse inferences in any instance where data are deficient or missing. According to Timken, the Department's failure to draw any adverse inference based on the omission of various data ( e.g., home-market sample sales, some variable costs) allowed Koyo to control in part the Department's calculation of margins. Koyo asserts that it is absurd for Timken to suggest that Koyo's co-operation in the resubmission of its data for the 1979 through 1986 PORs should be used against Koyo, when Koyo is in no way responsible for the delays in this proceeding. Koyo states that the CIT made it clear that respondents must not be prejudiced by the government's undue delays in the completion of administrative reviews, and, similarly, respondents cannot be punished for intervening changes in the Department's antidumping methodologies ( Koyo Seiko ). Koyo also objects to Timken's conclusion that Koyo's cost data should be rejected in their entirety. In Koyo's opinion the Department should not even conduct a below-cost investigation (see Comment 30). However, should the Department do so, Koyo states that the Department has had several years in which to request supplemental cost data or other germane information, and the Department cannot now decide that Koyo's data are inadequate without unduly and illegally prejudicing Koyo's rights in these proceedings. Department's Position: We disagree with Timken's contention that we should draw the most adverse inferences in applying BIA to Koyo's revised submission where data are deficient or missing. The Department agreed to accept a consolidated response from Koyo to facilitate and expedite the completion of these administrative reviews. We verified Koyo's consolidated response and found that, for the most part, Koyo's data were reasonable and accurate (see Verification Report, November 22, 1993, and Comment 31 regarding the adequacy of Koyo's cost data). We used BIA when we did not agree with Koyo's methodology in calculating an expense, or when data were missing from the submission. Therefore, we do not believe that we allowed Koyo to control the calculation of the margins in any way. Comments Regarding Clerical and Ministerial Errors Comment 40: Both Timken and Koyo addressed the following clerical errors: 1. The preliminary program erroneously sets the VCOM and other variables equal to zero (see Comment 45).
