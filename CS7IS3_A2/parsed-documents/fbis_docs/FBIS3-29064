Under the reorganization which will be implemented immediately after President Kim gives the go-ahead next week, the Economic Information and Education Bureau will be reduced to a division responsible for economic information in the Economic Planning Bureau. The three bureau chief-level coordinators under the assistant minister for international policy coordination will be trimmed to two, while a new job of defense budget examination will be created under the assistant minister for budget. The system of sending a bureau chief-level official to a foreign educational institution for study will be scrapped. Several bureau-class offices will be rechristened: For instance, the Fair Trade Policy Bureau of the Fair Trade Commission will be renamed the Policy Bureau. The reorganization plan will also affect some 20 division-class offices: For example, in the Economic Planning Bureau, the manpower development planning division and the social development planning division will be merged into a new manpower division.
