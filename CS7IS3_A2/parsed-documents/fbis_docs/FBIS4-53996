The force, which will be attached to a British company, amounts to around 10 percent of New Zealand combat ready troops and is the country's biggest military commitment since the Vietnam War. "This is not a decision the government has reached lightly, but I firmly believe it is the right decision," Bolger told parliament in announcing New Zealand's first contribution to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. The prime minister said New Zealand had special responsibilities as a current member of the Security Council and as a founding member of the United Nations. He said the New Zealanders would face danger. "The nature of the conflicts and the tasks undertaken by UNPROFOR make this unavoidable." Bolger added: "Peacekeeping is no soft option in defence terms," he said. "We will take every care to minimize the risk to our personnel, but the element of risk cannot be totally removed." The force is to have six weeks training immediately in New Zealand and would then leave for two weeks training in Britain before deployment in Bosnia. An attempt to hold a parliamentary debate on the contribution was frustrated when the leader of the small opposition New Zealand First Party, Winston Peters, objected. The main opposition Labour Party said they supported the contribution. "This is not New Zealand going to fight a European war, it is a New Zealand contribution to maintaining peace," opposition leader Helen Clark said. "The government considers it important that New Zealand as a small member state, strongly committed to the founding principles of the United Nations, plays its part to the greatest extent possible of supporting and implementing the decisions of the UN Security Council," the prime minister told MPs. He said the size of the contribution was determined in order to meet UNPROFOR requirements and to be as self-sufficient as possible. "It would enjoy a distinctive national identity yet be readily integrated into the larger British unit," Bolger said. "Satisfactory arrangements can be established to ensure that New Zealand would retain full control of the New Zealand contingent while operationally attached to a British battalion." Thirty six other nations also contribute to UNPROFOR.
