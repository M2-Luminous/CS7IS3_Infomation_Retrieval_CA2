The government of the United States has decided to reinstate the Super 301 clause through an Executive Order. However, unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute settlement rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be established as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round are explicitly prohibited. At a time when we have essentially agreed upon these new international trading rules, the Government of Japan cannot keep silent its concerns over this move to strengthen procedures enabling the United States to initiate unilateral actions against another country in the resolution of trade problems. 2. While it is necessary to closely watch what sort of measures the United States will take based upon the provisions of the reinstated Super 301 clause, the Government of Japan, in recognition of the responsibility for the development of the world economy that Japan and the United States, as the two largest economies in the world, bear in striving to maintain smooth bilateral economic relations, strongly hopes that the Government of the United States will act in a sensible manner, and for its part, recognizes the need for a restrained response. 3. In this regard, at a recent meeting of cabinet ministers concerned with external issues at the ministerial conference for economic measures, the Government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to advance voluntary measures toward further market opening. The Government of Japan is determined to make its utmost efforts to strive for smooth operation of our external relations, irrespective of the aforementioned moves in the United States.
