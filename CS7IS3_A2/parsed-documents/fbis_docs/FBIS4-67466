Alfredo Livi reports: [Livi] These drums, which have been crammed into this immense concrete cistern, contain 13,000 tonnes of hazardous waste. They were buried in this pit in Borghetto Santo Spirito, which is on the Ligurian Riviera in the province of Savona. This is the largest find of this type in northern Italy, perhaps in the whole of Italy. The hazardous material, contained in 11,000 drums which have been reduced to scrap, was leaking into the water table. At this immense illegal tip, the men behind this trade in hazardous waste accepted material which certain industries wanted to get rid of in a hurry. Acting on the complaint made by a brave mayor, a team of judges from Savona uncovered the trade and the illegal tip. However, technicians from Castalia, the state- controlled environmental company which is cleaning up the site, have discovered that the situation is far worse than at first thought. It will cost the local authorities 10 billion lire to clean up this ecological timebomb. It is estimated that the men behind the illegal trade made 50 or 60 billion lire. The dump discovered in Borghettto Santo Spirito is just the tip of the iceberg.
