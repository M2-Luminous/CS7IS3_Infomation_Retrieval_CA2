FR940805-1-00035 FR940805-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 250 RIN 1010&hyph;AB99 Training of Lessee and Contractor Employees Engaged in Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) AGENCY: Minerals Management Service, Interior. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to revise regulations governing the training of lessee and contractor employees engaged in drilling, well-completion, well-workover, well-servicing, or production operations in the OCS. Current requirements may restrict the ability of companies to use new technology and innovative programs to meet the needs of a changing industry. The revisions will attempt to provide more flexibility to companies and provide them with the ability to better integrate their training program into their overall operations. DATES: Comments should be received or postmarked by September 19, 1994 to be considered for this rulemaking. ADDRESSES: Mail or hand-carry comments to the Department of the Interior; Minerals Management Service; Mail Stop 4700; 381 Elden Street; Herndon, Virginia 22070&hyph;4817; Attention: Chief, Engineering and Standards Branch. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Richard, Information and Training Branch, telephone (703) 787&hyph;1582 or FAX (703) 787&hyph;1575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3 of the OCS Lands Act establishes that operations in the Outer Continental Shelf should be conducted in a safe manner by well-trained personnel using technology, precautions, and techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize the likelihood of blowouts, loss of well control, fires, spillages, physical obstruction to other users of the waters or subsoil and seabed, or other occurrences which may cause damage to the environment or to property, or endanger life or health. (43 U.S.C. 1332) The MMS implements this authority largely through the establishment and enforcement of the regulations in 30 CFR part 250, Subpart O, Training. These regulations require that lessees and contractors properly train employees engaged in drilling, well-completion, well-workover, well servicing, or production operations in the OCS. Current training requirements include the proper operation of equipment, operating procedures, and techniques to avoid hazards to people, property, and the environment. This training takes place at MMS approved training schools. To obtain MMS approval, training schools submit all training programs to MMS for approval. The MMS reviews the program for compliance with requirements of the regulations and conducts an onscene review of a class and training equipment. Based on the findings, MMS either certifies that the school meets MMS requirements or informs the training company of the deficiencies. Once a school is approved, MMS conducts unannounced audits of classes to ensure that the schools continue to comply with the regulations. Workers must successfully complete an approved course in the appropriate area (e.g., drilling well control) and then must repeat the basic course or an advanced course once every 4 years. Additionally, drilling, well-completion, well-workover, and well-servicing workers must successfully complete a well control refresher course each year between the required basic courses. Production workers must successfully complete a refresher course 2 years after completion of the basic course. The existing regulations at 30 CFR part 250, Subpart O, Training, determine the content and set the length of courses. These are either basic, advanced, or refresher courses in drilling, well completion, well workover, well servicing, or production safety systems. Drilling, well-completion, and well-workover courses include an option for surface or subsea operations. Well servicing is a term used to refer to coil tubing, small tubing, and snubbing operations. Courses may address one of the well-servicing areas, a combination of two of the areas, or all three areas. Although MMS has never done so, the existing regulations allow MMS to test workers at the worksite or trainees at the training facility to evaluate the effectiveness of the approved training programs. The MMS established minimum requirements for training of drilling operation workers in December 1977. For production operation workers, MMS established fewer minimum requirements leaving more latitude to the training companies to determine what a training course would include and how often courses would be repeated.
