Bulgari called the destruction of the current forms of Agricultural enterprises technological regression. Without the necessary agricultural equipment and infrastructure, small farms will go bankrupt. He also mentioned that advanced technologies need huge investments. Businessmen from abroad expect that Moldova will achieve a political and economic stability and set taxes at the level of the European ones or even lower. Moldova has no choice but to cooperate with the ex-Soviet republics and Eastern European countries. "By founding the Economic Union (EU), I think that all problems will be solved on the basis of the equal rights; the EU statute is favorable for Moldova." Bulgari added that Moldova has chances to reconquer some of its lost positions on the Russian market as the excises on goods from the West, which made Moldovan wine uncompetitive, will soon go up because Russia, as an EU leader, will intensify the measures of protecting its market and producers. The protection of the internal markets of the EU member states must constitute a large-scale strategy, promoted by all members of this community, said Bulgari.
