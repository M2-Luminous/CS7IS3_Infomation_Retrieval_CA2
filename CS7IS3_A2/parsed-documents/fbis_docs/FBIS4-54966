We discussed the changes in our approach to these institutions, and in their approach to us, with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova. [Rabay] Has devaluation under certain circumstances ever been considered? [Schmognerova] No. [Rabay] Even if it had been considered, you would hardly be likely to admit it. Let us therefore formulate the question the other way around: What will save us from devaluation at a time when we talk about the need for financial balance? [Schmognerova] The IMF does not discuss these issues with the government but with the National Bank. Of course, we, too, would know about it. [Rabay] At a news conference following your return from Washington you said that the IMF's position in relation to the Eastern European countries is becoming more flexible. In which way? [Schmognerova] What I had in mind was that they are now incorporating the building of a social safety net into their program so as not to jeopardize the reforms through a deterioration in the position of the weaker social strata, which might provoke unrest.... [Rabay] This new approach thus has a political rather than an economic dimension.... [Schmognerova] The IMF focuses mainly on the macroeconomic balance. My critical objection to this was that it is necessary to see the broader connections of reforms. [Rabay] Could you be more specific about how their position is more flexible today? [Schmognerova] For example, until recently, they had not been pushing for the building of a social safety net. Now it is also possible to cooperate to a greater extent with the World Bank in structural changes to the economy. If measures taken in fiscal and monetary policy, which can be implemented fairly quickly, are not supplemented with measures in the real sphere, that is, at the company level, the effect from the attained financial balance disappears very quickly and even tougher monetary measures will have to follow. [Rabay] I think that we have already been able to convince ourselves of the truth of this statement. As regards the World Bank, we know that, when promising assistance, it demands from the other side a clear setting of priorities. Are we able to set them today, or are we going to subordinate ourselves to whatever life will bring? [Schmognerova] Our problem is not that we did not formulate our basic priorities but that we have not been able to implement them. Even the preceding government subscribed to transformation and privatization. In the Memorandum on Economic Policy, for example, it pledged to liberalize energy prices, but it was not able to push it through. Privatization ground to a halt. The law on bankruptcies preserved in many enterprises the pretransformation situation because only the article of the law permitting the suspension of bankruptcy proceedings was used. In short, all kinds of things had been prepared but little was actually done. [Rabay] Are you suggesting that the present Slovak Government's more active approach, which you have repeatedly stressed on other occasions, actually means that the previous government's policy is being shifted into the phase of implementation? [Schmognerova] We are realists, we know that only five months are ahead of us. At any rate, we would like to set this phase in motion. [Rabay] Are you thinking of privatization? [Schmognerova] Not only privatization. We would also like to speed up the transformation of the social sphere and start very energetically tackling also the financial situation in the company sphere and in commercial banks. This is a long-term process but it needs to be speeded up.... [Rabay] Is this a signal that bankruptcies will start? Is there some kind of a list of companies that are earmarked for bankruptcy? [Schmognerova] There is a list at the Ministry of Economy. Of course, it will not be applied mechanically. Especially with respect to enterprises of regional significance with great impact on the social sphere, bankruptcies must be preceded by measures providing security for the people laid off. The World Bank's assistance could be significant precisely in this regard. [Rabay] Do you think that foreign investors' interest in Slovakia will increase during this government's term of office? [Schmognerova] Measures such as tax relief do not seem to me to matter all that much in this respect. Foreign investors are interested chiefly in political stability, which, it seems, we have succeeded in improving, as foreign reactions show. As regards specific steps, we are expecting the arrival soon of a mission of potential U.S. investors.... [Rabay] A large-scale mission of Canadian financiers and businessmen pursuing a similar aim was to take place a few days ago. Why did it not materialize? [Schmognerova] It had not been well prepared on the Canadian side, that is, on the part of Canadian Slovaks. With regard to conditions for foreign investors, we want to concentrate particularly on eliminating administrative obstacles to their participation in privatization. [Rabay] But is coupon privatization not one such obstacle? Three years passed before the companies privatized in this way in the first wave could proceed to their actual transformation and behave as independent entities.... [Schmognerova] What we need most badly today is a real change in the conduct of companies.
