If successful, agreements on the amounts of supplies of the product to the world market will be ratified. And in Moscow light will be shed, finally, on the fate of Anatoliy Dyakov, chairman of the Unified Power System of Russia stock company, whose removal is being spoken of in the Council of Ministers as a done deal. These two formally unconnected events have common roots. The initiator of Mr. Dyakov's dismissal and the key figure for presentation in Canada of Russia's "aluminum" position is Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the government. The aluminum industry has become the most expressive example, perhaps, of Russia's "Asiatic" move onto Europe's metal markets. From 300,000 tonnes in 1990, our exports have jumped to 1.6 million tonnes. Prices have collapsed almost twofold, and Western producers initially began to toss and turn and then, having instituted against Russia an anti-dumping inquiry, forced it into a civilized discussion, into consent to hold back its aluminum expansion included. Having plucked the "foreign currency primrose," our enterprises have now encountered a very unpleasant situation: Exports have been compulsorily restricted, and the domestic prices of primary aluminum and rolled products have gone beyond world prices. In addition, the release price of the aluminum combines (2 million rubles [R] per tonne) is almost double the price of the independent dealers on the Moscow Metal Exchange. It is not surprising that demand for the enterprises' product has fallen. But the sector is in a mood neither to cut back on production nor to lose its dividends. And the only way it can preserve the status quo is to freeze the price of electric power, the consumption of which constitutes up to 30 percent of the prime costs of the output of the group of enterprises. It has to be said that electric power is a natural monopoly, and the cost of a kilowatt-hour is, in any case, regulated, at three levels, what is more: The government determines the tariffs for the public and agriculture, the Federal Energy Commission establishes them for the Unified Power System of Russia regional stock company, which supplies the giants of industry, and the regional commissions impose tariffs for the local industrial enterprises. In accordance with regulations approved last year for the Ministry of Economics, the electricity tariffs shall be revised "with a change in external conditions." The external conditions, that is, the prices of each and every thing, are growing by the month, and the electricity tariffs are raised administratively not more often than once a quarter. For the Unified Power System of Russia regional stock company, they have not been revised since September 1993. Rising up on each occasion as a wall has been Oleg Soskovets, who stated in February in the Council of Ministers Commission for Operational Matters that the power engineers had "established communism for one sector." Waves of indignation at the price policy of the fuel and energy complex, which is allegedly to blame for the endless inflation, have been rolling through the press in parallel with this. Clearly referring to the regional stock company's Mr. Dyakov, a representative of the industrial directors said that "one stock company is, in fact, directing the whole country." The reasons for Oleg Soskovets' decisions, which are synchronous with the "public indignation," are, generally, there on the surface. On the one hand, the state's share of the exports of rolled aluminum constitutes 91 percent, and it does not, understandably, want such a channel of foreign currency to dry up. On the other, the prices of the extensive product list of the iron and steel complex have already scaled world heights, and the price of a kilowatt-hour is five times lower--and a further rise would confront a large sector of the economy with a dilemma: either bankruptcy or a difficult rearrangement of the groups of enterprises. "Power engineering is literally oppressing the entire economy. Prices in the regions are being established chaotically, essentially, and managers are not being held responsible or to account," Oleg Soskovets declared. This position precisely reflects the group interests of market outsiders and has nothing in common with public interests. The first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers knows full well that it was the wild move "into the light" of Russia's metallurgists that knocked down world prices and that the energy consumption of aluminum industry considerably exceeds Western standards and is a consequence of the technological backwardness of the groups of enterprises. The abundance on the domestic market of imported commodities in aluminum wrapping against the drastic reduction in rolled products of this metal in Russia is clear evidence that the country is pumping cheap electricity to the West via aluminum. As far as the alleged arbitrary price action of the power engineers is concerned, this is, perhaps, the sole sector counting tariffs "the old way"--strictly according to the formulas from 21 supplements to the computation procedure, which can always easily be checked. None of this is any secret for Mr. Soskovets. He could take on a task of truly state dimensions--gradually invert the pyramid of energy consumption in the country, whereby heavy industry bears the main price burden, and agriculture and the public get electricity for a pittance, virtually (5-6 percent of the cost). He could set about a leveling of the 20-fold price spread by region (threefold in the United States), for which he would win the industrial consumers' gratitude. But Oleg Soskovets, former chairman of the State Committee for Metallurgy, has opted for a path more in keeping, evidently, with the scale of his personality--he has begun to lobby Soviet-style for sectoral interests. When, in February, at a meeting of the board of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the power engineers presented him with evidence that the metallurgists, who were in debt to them, had money in their accounts, he told the meeting hall with irritation that "such shadowing is impermissible." He, however, beleaguered the power engineers who had shown him documents demonstrating how great was the prime cost of the product of the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk aluminum combines. And then Mr. Soskovets decided radically to "investigate" energy prices, instructing Anatoliy Chubays to study the question of the "expediency" of Anatoliy Dyakov continuing in office as chairman of the Unified Power System of Russia regional stock company. Removing Mr. Dyakov as a warning is, generally, uncomplicated. As is, in principle, holding back energy prices. This would turn out badly for the whole economy, it is true. With the 46 percent wear and tear of power engineering equipment, a shortage of investments would very quickly result in a growth of the breakdown rate and a reduction in scheduled maintenance. The sector is, as a whole, inertial. You might not build here for a couple of years, and this hits three or four years later. At the start of the 1980's the introduction of capacity in power engineering constituted 10 million-12 million kilowatt-hours, incidentally; now, it is roughly 10 times less. Oleg Soskovets has been "on the political Olympus" just under a year. Everyone has come in for it in this time--monetarists and "moderates"--and the press has hit at Gaydar and Chernomyrdin, Fedorov and Zaveryukha, Chubays and Glukhikh. The first deputy prime minister has, surprisingly, emerged from the battles totally "unscathed." He has remained beyond criticism, although industrial policy has failed completely, and the concept of financial and industrial groups sponsored by Mr. Soskovets is decaying at root. There have been no breakthroughs in the field of ideas, except for curatorship of the work of academicians Shatalin and Abalkin "on a correction of the course of the reforms." Despite the lack of achievements, the first "vice" remains under a charm and continues to gain more and more political authority. According to a recent order of the prime minister, Oleg Soskovets will coordinate key spheres of economic policy and direct 14 ministries and departments, and the composition and structure of the federal executive authorities and the federal civil service are in his hands. He is head of the government's Commission for Operational Matters, to which the function of distribution of centrally allocated credit to industry was recently transferred. And this same commission, judging by documents of the Council of Ministers, will shortly win distribution of the Western credit received by Russia and the centrally allocated foreign exchange resources of the government. In a short space of time the 44-year-old Oleg Soskovets has made a dizzying career from deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of Kazakhstan to first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of Russia. He has concentrated an enormous amount of power in his hands. Both this surge and his being off limits for criticism on the part of the president and the prime minister compel doubts as to the authenticity of the original version of his elevation: Boris Yeltsin had brought into the government "his man" Lobov, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, in response, made a move with the little-known Soskovets. It would seem, however, that people had gambled on Oleg Soskovets somewhat earlier and had pushed him persistently and recommended him just as persistently to the prime minister. Indicating who is "pushing" Oleg Soskovets is not that easy. One thing is for certain: Among the persons with an interest in him are the industrial directors who have not joined in the reforms.
