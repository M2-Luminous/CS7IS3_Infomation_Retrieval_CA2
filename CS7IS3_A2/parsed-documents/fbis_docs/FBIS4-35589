More specifically, he is important because the elements under his command were the ones who arrested Israeli pilot Ron Arad in 1986 after his military aircraft was shot down during an air raid near Sidon. The pilot remained in al-Dirani's custody for a period of time. According to informed sources, Washington had prior knowledge of the kidnapping operation and encouraged it, provided that it was a "clean operation." Washington is interested in al-Hajj al-Dirani for one reason: He is accused, while he was an Amal official, of smuggling in his car U.S. intelligence officer William Higgins after he was kidnapped on 17 February 1988 and handing him over to the party that announced his execution in 1989, a few days after Israel carried out a commando operation in Jibshit in which it kidnapped Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd. (At that time AL-SHIRA' published information indicating that Higgins was dead before Hizballah announced that it had executed him.) [passage omitted]
