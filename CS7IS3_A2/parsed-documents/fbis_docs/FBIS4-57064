Nevertheless, he was also optimistic enough to say that his administration is doing its utmost to overcome the situation. Following constant subsidies totalling nearly 120 billion bolivares authorized since this past January, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] is now the owner of approximately 72 percent of Banco de Maracaibo shares. Fogade President Norys Aguirre announced the names of the new Banco de Maracaibo Board of Directors, which will be headed by Jorge Correa. The new board of directors will be responsible for executing and implementing the reorganization plan that includes, among others, the following measures: streamlining spending, restoring Bank of Maracaibo's losses with Fogade financial assets, increasing the bank's capital to more or less 6 percent of assets, reorganizing operations by injecting resources, implementing auditing practices, and requesting technical assistance from international experts specializing in the subject. The Fogade president also indicated that by intervening in the Occidente Mortgage Bank, the Banking Superintendency was able to stabilize the bank's situation as part of Latino Group. Aguirre pointed out that she supports the reorganization plan about to be implemented by intervention board President Enrique Faria de Lima. He has set 17 May as the date for offering guarantees to depositors. According to the Fogade president, all of these traumas which the Venezuelan financial system is enduring represent one of its worst crises. Nevetheless, she believes that one should not fall victim to the mistake twice. [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress]...an improved supervisory organization. A renovated oversight organization that will not allow situations to develop to a level such as that at which we have arrived today in Venezuela. [end recording]
