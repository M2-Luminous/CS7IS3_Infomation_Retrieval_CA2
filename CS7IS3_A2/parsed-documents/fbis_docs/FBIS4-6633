Verceles Sr., yesterday branded as "thoroughly gratuitous and inappropriate" the stand taken by Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo concerning the United States' insistence on international inspection of the nuclear facilities of North Korea. Verceles, a recognized United Nations expert in economic diplomacy and international law, pointed out that Romulo's criticism of the United States on the nuclear inspection issue could be misconstrued that the Philippines is siding with North Korea. "As a former diplomat, I find the statement, twice now, of Secretary Romulo criticizing the United States for its stand vis-a-vis North Korea as thoroughly gratuitous and inappropriate," he said. "(Romulo's statements) might create the impression that the Philippines stands by the side of North Korea which certainly should not be the case. Indeed, such statements would tend to exacerbate the already sensitive situation in the (Korean) peninsula." Verceles, who had participated in more than 100 major U.N. and bilateral conferences as chairman and/or member of the Philippine delegation, said that it was the refusal of North Korea to allow the international inspection of its nuclear facilities, in accordance with treaties of the United Nations, that has spawned the controversy. The U.N. Security Council has already called on North Korea to adhere to its commitment to permit inspection of the seven declared nuclear sites in the country. According to Verceles, the Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security under the U.N. Charter. "Clearly," he said "it is the better part of wisdom and prudence for us to await action of the Security Council. Verceles said that instead of pointing an accusatory finger at the United States, Romulo should join the call of the civilized community of nations for inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities. "We must realize that the Philippines is a piddling power in the arena of international politics" he said. "We should not pretend to be otherwise. We should always bear in mind that when elephants quarrel or make love it is the grass that gets trampled underfoot."
