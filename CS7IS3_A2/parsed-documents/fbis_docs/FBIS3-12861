In an interview carried on Radio Free Lebanon's "Dialogue With an Official" program, Dallul stated: We must not forget that these agencies were very recently an object of admiration and appreciation by all citizens and officials. We must have confidence in the security agencies and give them a chance to uncover the perpetrators of the crime. It is still premature to say that they have failed. Regarding coordination among these security agencies, Dallul admitted there is a flaw in this respect, which he ascribed to the statutes by which they were established which ignore the issue of operational coordination among all these departments. He added: Of course, the Central Security Council meets regularly under the chairmanship of the interior minister, but perhaps we should have more practical and effective coordination. Dallul said it might be possible to give some good news to the citizens to offset some of the sorrow that they have suffered since the church bombing in al-Zuq. He said he has the impression that there will be some results very soon, noting that the citizens, officials, and media must support the security agencies and disregard any aspersions against them at this particular time. Regarding reports of the arrest of some women who allegedly carried out the bombing, Dallul said this is a lie told at the expense of the security agencies and is not the work of any agency seeking to discredit another. He added: They exploited an individual working in a certain media institution who also serves the interests of a certain group and disseminated this report through him. The report aims to confuse the entire investigation. The authorities immediately arrested this person and interrogated him. Dallul said that everyone who has been interrogated has been treated as a witness with possible useful information, not interrogated as a suspect.
