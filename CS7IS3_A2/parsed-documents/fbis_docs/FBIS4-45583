These figures, according to Mr. Abiodun Adesola, the Acting Press Secretary of the Agency, do not include the massive haul of a special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes with a conservative estimate of N1.2 billion ($300 million) imported from Bangkok, Thailand. The cargo was intercepted at the Apapa Wharf, in Lagos last December. "A cursory look at the figures showed that the number of arrests and the quantity of seizures were far more in 1993 than the previous years," Adesola stated in a statement yesterday. He attributed the arrests and subsequent seizures to the takeoff of two additional zonal commands at Warri and Maiduguri which began operations last year. According to him, marijuana, cultivated locally, with a total seizure of 7,461.744 kilogrammes maintained the number one slot on the list of hard drugs seizures made last year. This was followed by cocaine, 1,308.6697 kilogrammes, heroin, 39.2862 kilogrammes and other psychotropic substances, 1.825 kilogrammes. On quarterly basis, the fourth quarter of the year was the period the highest number of arrests were made, 145 suspects in all. Next was the first quarter with 121, followed by third and second quarters with 100 and 87 suspects. Adesola said the agency recorded her highest number of arrests within the year under review in March with the arrest of 55 suspects. October and November followed with 52 and 47 arrested suspects. However, the largest drug haul was recorded in February with 2,724.896 kilogrammes of hard drugs seizure. This was followed by the 1,647.2515 kilogrammes seizure in October while November of the same period under review was next with 1,419.3283 kilogrammes. "One striking observation made in the Agency's operations, last year was the seizure of psychotropic substances like Amphatamines and pemoline, a development which may be attributed to renewed vigilance on all types of hard drugs covered in the mandate given to the Agency instead of only concentrating on cocaine and heroin trafficker," he added.
