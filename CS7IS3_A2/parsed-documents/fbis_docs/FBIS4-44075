I believe it has been agreed to give a new push to all the important issues that were noted by the Greek Presidency and were included in the agenda. This concerns unemployment, as a main problem of the European economy, particularly unemployment of the youth and long-term unemployment. This concerns small- and medium-sized businesses and their capability to incorporate modern technology, contribute in the labor sector, and encourage local development activities. As you know, we have adopted the 11 projects of the transportation sector in order of priority. These include the Egnatia highway and the Patrai-Athens-Thessaloniki highway that are especially important for our country. Finally, we agreed with promoting a society of information, with new possibilities that open up due to the importation of modern telecommunications technology, development, employment, and improved quality of life. Regarding the EU prospects, a group has been formed to prepare the intergovernment conference of 1996. As you know this was a Greek proposal. Because of this proposal, a compromise has been achieved in Ioannina that made the EU expansion possible for four new countries. The group will begin its work on 2 June 1995. This is the day that the Mersin conference convened. This way, we ratify our old position about a new Mersin. We have proposed this in our previous presidential term. Spain--which will hold the EU presidency during that period--will preside over the conference. The conference will also include--this was another goal of the Greek Presidency that was accepted by all Council members with a promise to the European Parliament--two representatives of the European Parliament who will participate in the group. We agreed in taking action in the domestic and justice sectors against racism and fear of foreigners. There is a specific action plan. We also agreed to combat crime and drugs. Finally, we have adopted a text for the countries that are possible EU members. On Cyprus we went a step forward, stressing that the next EU expansion phase will include both Cyprus and Malta. It is the first time that Cyprus and Malta are included in the overall expansion chapter and their fate is linked to the expansion course. The expression on Cyprus disengages the accession course from the Cyprus issue. Of course there is a separate reference on this. Finally, I would like to mention as briefly as possible the decisions made on EU foreign policy. We agreed to develop our relations with the Mediterranean countries, and we will examine the possibility of convening a conference between the EU and the Mediterranean countries. This is a significant push to the EU's Mediterranean policy. We will also continue the efforts for peace in the Middle East, particularly reinforcing the Palestinian entities in the occupied Israeli areas. We call upon the Commission to make as many proposals as possible for agreements with East and West European countries and the Baltic states. We asked Russia to withdraw its troops by 31 August, and we asked Latvia to reconsider its immigration law in a way that it will not create problems in the protection of human rights. We intend to promote the decisions that we have made within the framework of the stability treaty, which followed the Paris Conference on Security and Stability. We condemn the genocide in Rwanda and preannounce that we will take action to protect the country's population. Regarding South Africa, we will continue our work to restore economic and political relations with the entire region, particularly the new South African Republic where a regime of freedom and personal rights exists. Regarding Ukraine, we decided specifically on the amounts that we intend to contribute to permanently close the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. We expressed our concern for North Korea's policy and we asked this country to respond to its obligations. We have expressed our satisfaction for the democratization developments and the protection of human rights that have been noted recently in Latin America. We have adopted guidelines for joint activity in the 1995 conference for the renewal of the nondistribution of nuclear weapons agreement. Therefore, the community will undertake an activity--something that it did not have--on the nondistribution of nuclear weapons. This is a new chapter. Finally, we called upon all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to show political will to resolve the problem and ratify as soon as possible the statement of intention so that the European Union may take control of Mostar. We also intend to contribute to the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as conditions allow it.
