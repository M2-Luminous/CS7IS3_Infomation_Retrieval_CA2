On Wednesday President Bill Clinton advised congress that the moratorium would be extended a year until September 1995. Foreign Minister Don McKinnon welcomed the decision, saying it meant Clinton regarded worldwide restraint on testing as important in making progress in nuclear non-proliferation. "New Zealand agrees," he said in a statement. "I hope other nuclear weapon states which have suspended testing programmes will be reassured by the US decision. I think we can take it that existing moratoria will be maintained. "China still has to agree to a moratorium. "It would be fitting for China to show restraint at a time when the world has justified expectations of an end to the development of these terrible weapons," McKinnon said.
