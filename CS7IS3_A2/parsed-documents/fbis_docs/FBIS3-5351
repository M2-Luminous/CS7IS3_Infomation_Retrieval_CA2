He told KCNA: The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is to open before long as a series of controversial matters between the DPRK and the United States including the "nuclear issue" have been coordinated. Japanese politicians including the high-level authorities, however, are slandering the DPRK, urging it to accept "special inspection." They seek in this to instigate the hardline conservatives of the United States to lay obstacles in the way of the DPRK-U.S. talks and attain their sinister political and military purposes. We cannot but watch with vigilance the attempt of the high-placed officials of Japan to impede the settlement of the "nuclear issue" with rash acts against the DPRK and find a pretext for a lawful promotion of their nuclear armament, which has reached the danger line. If Japan arms itself with nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realised, the inter-Korean joint declaration on denuclearization will be invalid and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be virtually meaningless. If Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula is to be nuclear-free, not only Asia but also the world must pay due attention to Japan which is accelerating nuclear armament. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide.
