Even the budget drafting is no exception." In this way, he indicated the ruling coalition should take a free and unbiased stance in working out policies. However, regarding the possibility of forming "a wide-range alliance" with the LDP, Ozawa clearly denied this, and said: "If such an alliance were formed, there would be only one political force as before. One advantage of the current situation lies in the fact that while more than two political groups are cooperating with one another based on a free and unbiased stance, if one group fails in promoting its administration, another can take over." When asked about how the ruling coalition should cooperate in the next election under the new electoral system following passage of the political reform bill, Ozawa pointed out: 1) The five major ruling coalition parties are bound to be defeated if they conduct their election campaigns without cooperation; 2) to say nothing of the fact that the coalition's ultimate objective in forming a thorough-going cooperative network lies in functioning as if they were one party, it should strive to establish a framework for promoting thorough-going cooperation; and 3) such cooperation among coalition parties will be tested for the first time in the election for the House of Councillors next summer (if no general election is held in the meantime). Thus, while keeping the next House of Councillors election in mind, Ozawa indicated his intention to quickly lay the groundwork for cooperation among the ruling parties. As for the timing of holding the next general election, Ozawa indicated his negative view on early dissolution of the House of Representatives, saying: "It is not necessarily logical to hold the general election as soon as possible just because of changes in the electoral system." In response to a question as to why Ozawa excluded reporters of SHUKAN GENDAI (published by Kodansha) from the news conference, he stated: "I may file a suit against SHUKAN GENDAI. I have asked my counselor to study the case." Furthermore, he added: "My secretary will also file a suit against Tokyo Sports, (a newspaper publishing company), and we will fight it in the courts."
