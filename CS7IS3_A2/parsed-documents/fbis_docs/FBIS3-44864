It is hoped that public security organs and the armed police force will keep a strong sense of political responsibility and mission and exert themselves to do a good job in safeguarding social and political stability. When giving a speech at the national meeting attended by directors of the public security departments and bureaus, Luo Gan said that this year, a series of major reform measures will be successively adopted for the finance-taxation, banking, investment system, foreign trade, and price systems. The depth, breadth, and intensity of reform will substantially exceed those in previous years. In the long run, these reform measures are of great significance for increasing China's comprehensive national strength, enhancing the people's living standards, and promoting well- coordinated economic and social development. However, they will immediately affect various quarters in different degrees and lead to adjustment of individual interests. Some new contradictions may thus appear, and some problems that affect social stability may also be brought about. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to keep a "sense of risk." He said: With economic development, there will be no foundation for stability and it will not be possible to keep social order and stability over a long time. Similarly, without a stable social environment, nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, going all out to safeguard social stability and promoting economic construction and advancing reform and opening is a major point of China's experience in basic practice over the past 15 years. Public order and security is a major aspect of social and political stability. Luo Gan said: In the last few years, public order and security were stable on the whole, but we should also note that cases of economic crime and other criminal cases markedly increased, and various ugly social phenomena also became rather prominent in some localities. In some localities, organized crime bearing the character of secret societies also occurred. Public security organs should adopt effective measures in light of the new characteristics of law-and-order problems under the situation of reform and opening, continuously settle prominent problems in public order and security, and effectively prevent the appearance of a lawless situation in some localities. He stressed the need to intensively and effectively crack down on various serious criminal activities, and raise the severe crackdown [yan da dong zheng 0917 2092 2435 3630] to a new high. The crackdown should achieve a deterrent effect. A number of prominent problems that threaten the safety of the masses should be settled in a short time, thus frightening and deterring criminals and also encouraging the masses. At the same time, laws must be enforced strictly. Luo Gan praised the public security organs for their effective work last year in safeguarding social and political stability and state security. At the same time, he also required public security organs to do effective internal anticorruption work. At present, efforts should be made to investigate and handle major and serious cases, and effectively check problems of offending and bending the law in the course of enforcing it among public security personnel. Corrupt personnel must be severely punished.
