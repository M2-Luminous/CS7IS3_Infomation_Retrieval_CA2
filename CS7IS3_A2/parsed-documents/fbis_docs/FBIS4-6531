A resolution on invigorating the movement for solidarity with the Korean people was adopted at the 14th plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party (Red Motherland). The resolution said the North of the Korean peninsula has no nuclear issue in actuality and that the "nuclear issue" was intentionally invented by the United States to divert elsewhere public attention from their nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea. It urged the United States to immediately stop the bellicose acts and the campaign over "nuclear threat from the North." The Arab Islamic Democratic Movement and the Islamic-Christian United Action Front in a letter to the U.S. President criticized the U.S. for reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and held that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks. The group for the study of the chuche idea of President Kim Il-song in Austria in a statement strongly demanded that the United States give up the scheme to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercises and the deployment of Patriot in South Korea and immediately stop all its hostile acts against the DPRK. The Congolese committee to support the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo in an appeal to the peaceloving people of the world called on them to heighten vigilance against the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and denounce it.
