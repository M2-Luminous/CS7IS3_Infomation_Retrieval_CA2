Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan was rated the world's third best country for investment, next to Japan and Switzerland, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday [11 May]. Ministry officials said that the rating was listed in the latest report of the New York-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence S.A. (BERI), which regularly evaluates investment profit opportunities in the world's 50 major countries. BERI issues the investment climate report three times a year, in March, July, and November, they said. The March report said that Taiwan's ranking may advance to second place sometime within the next five years. This will put Taiwan on equal footing with Japan and Singapore, the report said. Switzerland is expected to keep hold of its top position, the report added. The BERI evaluation on investment profit opportunities is based on three major indicators: the operation risk index, the political risk index, and repatriation capabilities. A final cumulative assessment comes out after separate evaluation of the three factors. In terms of the operation risk index, which comprises 15 items including inflation, the balance of international payments, transportation and telecommunications, and long-term loans and trust funds, Taiwan topped the economic growth list and and ranked second in the local attitude toward foreign investors and their profits as well as labor costs versus labor productivity. Taiwan was placed fourth with Norway in the political risk index, behind Switzerland, Singapore, and Austria. In repatriation capabilities, Taiwan was currently rated as third, behind Japan and Switzerland, but was expected to jump to the top position in the next five years. The officials, commenting on the BERI report, pledged that they would continue their efforts to help improve Taiwan's investment environment.
