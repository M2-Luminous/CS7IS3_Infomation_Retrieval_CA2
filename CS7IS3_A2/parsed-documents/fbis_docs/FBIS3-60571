Of the 1,159 cases, 211 are foreigners and Overseas Chinese and 948 are Chinese. China has found 19 aids victims, 14 of whom have died. Most of the HIV/AIDS carriers in China are drug abusers or returnees from abroad, said the official. On the eve of ``World AIDS Day'', a national association of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and AIDS control and prevention was set up here. Addressing the inaugural meeting of the association, Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, said that the association will help the government organize figures from various circles to take part in STD and AIDS prevention activities. Meanwhile, it will focus on health education, information exchange and international cooperation on STD and AIDS control. According to Chen, the Chinese Government has always attached importance to preventing and controlling the spread of STD and AIDS. It has passed laws and regulations on prevention of AIDS and STD, which have promoted the management, research, surveillance and treatment of such diseases. However, STD and AIDS epidemic areas are still expanding in China. ``We lack publication and comprehensive management measures on STD and AIDS prevention,'' said Chen. He urged government departments at all levels and communities all over the country to undertake commitments in STD and AIDS prevention and control. Meanwhile, he called for more cooperation on AIDS control among different departments in the country.
