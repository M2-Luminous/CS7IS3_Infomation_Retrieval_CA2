FR941004-2-00053 FR941004-2-00030 The proposed delivery point will be located on Texas Gas's Herbert-Cannellton 8-inch pipeline at Mile Post 3+1662 near Weberstown in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, and will be known as the Weberstown Delivery Point. Texas Gas states that the Weberstown Delivery Point will enable Western to render natural gas service for residential heating in the community of Weberstown. Texas Gas states that the Weberstown Delivery Point is actually a ``reclassification'' of an existing ``farm tap''. Texas Gas states that it will not be necessary for Texas Gas to construct any new facilities or modify any existing facilities at this location. Texas Gas states that Western will replace the two meters it currently owns and operates at this location with a single larger meter to accommodate both the existing service rendered at this ``farm tap'' and the projected requirements for the Weberstown community. Texas Gas states that service to this new delivery point will be accomplished within Western's existing contract quantities as set forth in Western's Firm Transportation Agreement-Zone 3 with Texas Gas and its Firm No Notice Transportation Agreement with Texas Gas. Texas Gas further states that since no increase in contract quantities has been requested by Western, the above proposal can be accomplished without detriment to Texas Gas's other customers. The estimated maximum annual quantity of natural gas to be delivered to Western at this point will be 2,500 MMBtu, with a proposed maximum daily quantity of 10.5 MMBtu.
