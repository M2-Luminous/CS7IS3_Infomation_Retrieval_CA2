Located at the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the center will be responsible for technically guiding the study and appraising the research results of sexual diseases and leprosy, providing scientific data for the Ministry of Public Health to draw up policies for controlling the diseases, undertaking education and technical training of personnel in the field, monitoring the situation of epidemic diseases throughout the country, collecting international information about sexual diseases and leprosy, and conducting international academic exchanges in this field. After several years of effort, sexual diseases had been basically wiped out in New China by the late 1950s and early 1960s. Meanwhile, the incidence of leprosy had been greatly reduced. Statistics show that so far a total of 360,000 victims of leprosy have been cured. At present, there are about 10,000 leprous patients in the country. However, the incidence of sexual disease in the country has risen again since the 1980s. In order to more effectively bring the diseases under control and to reach the goal of wiping out leprosy in China by the year 2000, the Ministry of Public Health decided to set up the national center.
