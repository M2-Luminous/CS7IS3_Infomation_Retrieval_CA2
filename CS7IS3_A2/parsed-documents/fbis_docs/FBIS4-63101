Commenting on Moscow's intentions to win a special status in relations with NATO, he compared the Partnership for Peace Programme with a restaurant in which every visitor chooses a dish to his or her taste. "Russia is a client like any other," said the department chief, "on accepting the programme, it has every right to build and develop its relations with NATO as believes most useful for her." The NATO session in Brussels this week confirmed its former position: The Partnership for Peace Programme includes standard principles for all states joining it and cannot grant advantages to anybody. Having accepted its principles, every country chooses forms and volume of its individual participation in accordance with its wishes and capacities.
