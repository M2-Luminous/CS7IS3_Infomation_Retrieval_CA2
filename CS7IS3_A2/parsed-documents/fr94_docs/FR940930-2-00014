No. 95&hyph;91) Section 602(a) of the Department of Energy (``DOE'') Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95&hyph;91, hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'') prohibits a ``supervisory employee'' (defined in section 601(a) of the Act) of the Department from knowingly receiving compensation from, holding any official relation with, or having any pecuniary interest in any ``energy concern'' (defined in section 601(b) of the Act). Section 602(c) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Energy to waive the requirements of section 602(a) in cases where the interest is a pension, insurance, or other similarly vested interest. Mr. John Tyler Carslon has been appointed as Area Manager in the Phoenix Area Office of the Western Area Power Administration. As a result of his previous employment with Public Service Company of Colorado, Mr. Carlson has a vested pension interest, within the meaning of section 602(c) of the Act, in the Employees' Retirement Plan of Public Service Company of Colorado and Participating Subsidiaries. I have granted Mr. Carlson a waiver of the divestiture requirement of section 602(a) of the Act with respect to this vested pension interest for the duration of his employment with the Department as a supervisory employee. Dated: September 8, 1994. Hazel R. O'Leary, Secretary of Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24263 Filed 9&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
