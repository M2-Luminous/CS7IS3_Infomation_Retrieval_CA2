The council members decided to answer with silence and to abstain from answering any message. They will wait for the results of an investigation being conducted by the Attorney General's Office and Congress. This is President Gaviria's answer to the State Council: Given the declaration approved by you yesterday I want to address, through you, all the council members to reassert, as a citizen and president of Colombia, that that high-ranking organization deserves my greatest respect; and, by defending the government's views in connection with the cooperation given by foreign military members in our country, I did not seek to insult that important organization. Instead, I wanted to clearly state our views on matters that are extremely important for the country. I fully share your views, meaning you would rather wait until a debate is held in Congress to carefully analyze the two sides' position. In the end, allow me to tell you I do not consider this disparity of viewpoints to be a confrontation between branches. Instead, it is a characteristic of a democracy.
