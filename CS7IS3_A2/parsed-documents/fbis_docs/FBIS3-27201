If the Hong Kong Government wants to publish the contents of the talks, this should be conducted through diplomatic channels. It should not violate the principle of confidentiality agreed upon by the two governments. Qin attended the "Hong Kong United Association for the Advancement of Feminism in All Walks of Life" Spring Festival get-together yesterday evening. When asked by reporters about the British Hong Kong Government's claim that it would publish the contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks, he said: On this issue the British Hong Kong Government should understand three points: First, the Sino-British talks on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements are a matter between the Chinese and British Governments and the Hong Kong Government has no right whatsoever to publish the contents of Sino-British talks; second, at the beginning of the talks, the Chinese and British Governments agreed on a common principle--the principle of confidentiality, and the Hong Kong Government should take this into consideration prudently; and third, if the Hong Kong Government wants to publish the contents of Sino- British talks, this should be conducted through diplomatic channels. Qin stressed: If the Hong Kong Government unilaterally publishes the contents of the talks, it will violate the principle agreed upon by the two governments and he asked that the Hong Kong Government take a prudent attitude. Regarding the appointment of the third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, Qin said: It is hoped that the list of the third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers can be made public in March. He said: We hope to expand, as far as possible, the channel for soliciting the views of Hong Kong people and unite with Hong Kong compatriots to ensure a stable transition for Hong Kong.
