FR941012-0-00159 FR941012-0-00011 ``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business. *␣*␣* Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 519&hyph;522 (1981) ( ATMI ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' ``[T]he fundamental objective of the Act [is] to prevent occupational deaths and serious injuries [ Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 11 (1980)].'' ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America [S. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1291, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (``Leg. Hist.'') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].'' ``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [ Id. at 324; see also 510&hyph;511, 517].'' [T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses. *␣*␣* Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. [ Id. at 518&hyph;19 (Senator Cranston)] Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious employer might experience when inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. C. As Construed by the Courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act Sets a Threshold and a Ceiling for Safety Rulemaking That Provide Clear and Reasonable Parameters for Agency Action OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates `` any permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [ Industrial Union Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) ( Benzene ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would a fortiori not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business.') [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].''
