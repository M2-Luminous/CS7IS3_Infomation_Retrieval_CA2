He told Czech Television that former Czechoslovakia and later on the Czech Republic had always supported peaceful and just settlement of the situation in the region. This attitude has been evidenced by balanced relations with the two parties, Havel added. "The Czech Republic is undoubtedly ready to continue its assistance, especially regarding the reconstruction of the self-rule areas," Havel stressed.
