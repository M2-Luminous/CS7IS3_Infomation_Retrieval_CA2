At the 10 A.M. opening, the shop provided the first 150 customers with four kilograms of domestic rice, which was sold out in 10 minutes. The remaining 80 bags -- some containing imported rice, some a domestic-foreign rice blend -- were sold out in half an hour. "We cannot endure unappetizing foreign rice, being familiar with domestic rice," said Hitomi Terai, 43, a local resident and one of the pleased 150. Terai had tried Thai rice, but "could not manage to eat it because it tasted dry and bad." The morning queue began on February 28, a day before the Food Agency began offering full supplies of imported rice, and the line has since grown, said Hisao Nakaya, store manager of East 21. Such a scene has been seen every morning, everywhere in Japan, with the apparent disappearance of domestic rice from the shelves. The agency has sold rice imported from China, Thailand and the United States to make up for a shortfall caused by a record poor harvest last fall and the government's limited stock. The government blames consumers for the shortage, saying they shy away from foreign rice and stockpile the domestic crop. The woman at the front of the line said she has no choice but to wait because her neighborhood shops sells rice only for restaurants and other bundle use, not for individual customers. Nakaya said customers are anxious about the quality of imported rice, especially since a lawmaker remarked in early March that Thai rice being sold in Japan is infested with mice and cockroaches. Eating foreign rice is a rare experience because Japan has banned imports for many years. The coalition government decided in December to partially open the market through the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Food Agency plans to supply 500,000 tons of rice in March, equivalent to last year's volume, that will be a half-and-half of domestic and imported rice. From April through June, the percentage of imported rice will be raised to 70 percent. Terai's husband, Masahiko Terai, 46, said the queues may have swelled to twice their size from the previous day before due to the Food Agency's most recent announcement. The agency said that retailers will not be allowed to sell domestic rice unless it is mixed with at least 20 percent thai rice in order to prevent consumers from rushing to the Japanese crop. "The move will worsen the situation. When all official rice is mixed with foreign rice, people will then be after domestic rice on the black market," he said. Black market prices for the staple have soared 60 percent from the end of last year. Nakaya, the manager, said the measure may ease panic if pure domestic rice truly becomes unobtainable. However, about 30 percent of domestic rice is said to be independent from the Food Agency's control and will go to the black market. People panic because, Nakaya said, "rice is very special for Japanese. Other food would not cause such a confusion." Hitomi Terai blamed the government for its policy that forced farmers to reduce their acreage of paddies in order to control production, resulting in the current shortage. Toshiharu Nishiguchi of Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market research agency in Tokyo, said consumer demand differs from the intentions of the government, wholesalers and retailers to maintain a constant supply. "At the end of February, wholesalers and retailers apparently had a little more domestic rice than a year earlier to sell later to their regular customers when foreign rice prevails. It may have upset consumers," he said. He predicted that more imported rice will be sent to shelves as early as mid-March. "So the shortage, at least of imported rice, will ease before long."
