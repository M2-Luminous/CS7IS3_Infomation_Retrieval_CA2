After the latest slaughter in Sarajevo, nothing would be worse for Western credibility than a fleeting burst of anger. Indeed, it will be easy to stress that previous UN or NATO admonitions to the belligerents remained devoid of any consequences. This powerlessness in implementing decisions actually made stems from Western disagreements on ways to bring the conflict to an end as well as on the political objectives to pursue. Should the standing threat of selective air strikes be carried out? Military officials do not relish this solution because, beyond the risks it implies for their men, they fear military activism may only be a smoke screen for the inertia of politicians. For such strikes to be meaningful, they must be part of an overall strategy which provide very clearly for a "second strike," the one that may become necessary if the first one -- regardless of its degree of success on a technical level -- does not bring the expected political result. In other words, the international community must ask itself how far it is ready to go and for what ends. Objectives can range from putting an end to the shelling of Sarajevo and lifting the siege of the city to achieving a general ceasefire leading to renewed and serious negotiations; the targets will then vary accordingly, as will the extent of the resources used and the duration of the operation. Until now, Western nations have disagreed on just about anything, be it the importance of the conflict in the definition of the post-Cold War world, the allocation of mutual responsibilities, the solutions to be implemented, or even the necessity to act. They tried to alleviate the situation through means often courageous, sometimes hazardous, and perchance effective from a humanitarian viewpoint, but which only contained the pain as they could not cure it. Some may deem it positive that the conflict has not extended, that foreign powers have not contributed, as they did before, to a new Balkan war, that the European Union has somehow preserved its unity, albeit at the cost of its credibility. Can one stick contentedly with such modest objectives and not attempt to impose rules of good neighborly conduct to peoples bent on mayhem? Even retreating to our ivory tower -- however inglorious a proposition -- would be less of a disgrace than useless swagger. However, if we believe action is the right choice, then we must stop talking about what we will not do, and then suit our action to our word.
