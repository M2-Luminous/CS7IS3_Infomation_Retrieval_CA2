Rexhepi: "Serbian Nostalgia for the (Non)Exploitation of Kosova"] [Text] Despair over the failure to achieve a "Serbian paradise" and the rapid fall from fashion of the "Vozd" brand of perfume are now very evident not only among the Serbian leadership but in its forcibly installed regime in Kosova. The euphoria of the mass dismissals of Albanian workers, hailed as a great victory for united Serbia, was accompanied by the similarly large-scale incorporation of Kosova collectives into Serbian firms. It was realized at the time that these mergers were to the detriment of the Kosovar economy and were carried out not only out of political interests but because of narrow personal interests of certain Serbian individuals and circles. The fact that even officials of the Serbian-installed regime in Kosova have begun to talk about such damage best indicates the alarming situation. This is why certain officials of the Serbian regime in Kosova are talking with nostalgia and are here and there even criticizing the Serbian Government, blaming it, for instance, for the massive losses suffered by Trepca in one year. Their nostalgia waxes even greater when they hark back to days of yore, when Trepca alone earned almost $100 million a year from exports of its minerals and products, when Feronikel similarly earned $100 million a year, when the Tube Factory in Ferizaj [Urosevac] earned $50-60 million on foreign markets, followed by the shock absorber factory, the wallpaper factory, and the textile and timber industries, and so on. The tears of these Serbian officials over such hard currency sums, which under bankrupt Serbia's current circumstances are breathtaking, not only testify to the failure of their violence against the Kosovar economy, but also indicate a certain regret for the time when Albanian workers, especially in Trepca, labored for miserable wages that were much lower than in other areas of the former Yugoslavia. The sweat of Kosovar workers was soaked up by the funds of exporting and re-exporting firms in Belgrade, while the Trepca miners and metalworkers took their pensions without roofs over their heads and with empty pockets. However, this does not worry this regime, which is subjecting Albanian workers, like all the Albanian population in occupied Kosova, to continuous violence; what worries the regime a great deal is the lack of interest among the invited Serbian colonists to work in the mines, foundries, and factories of Trepca, in the furnaces of the power stations, in Feronikel, or elsewhere. The fact that the few experts that were brought with such a fanfare from Belgrade and other Serbian cities are now starting to run away from the "Serbian paradise" in Kosova adds to their anxiety. These experts did indeed live and earn well for a time at the expense of the reserves and funds created by the Albanian workforce, but, now that these are exhausted, they have started to go back to where they came from. Thus the Serbian officials installed in Kosova moan and groan that the resources of Kosova are not being exploited, expecting that they can thereby explain themselves to their "patrons" and to workers whom they do not even allow to enter the factory yards, let alone the factories themselves. It seems that Avram's magic dinars, which Serbian officials swear by, will not be able to open factory gates in Kosova. As consolidation for this, the Serbian parliament this year earmarked the sum of 3,600,000 dinars for the budget of the Serbian-installed regime in Kosova (or Kosovo-Metohija, as the Kosovo-Polje-types like to call it), approving this without a single comment or amendment, not even from the delegates from Kosova. This was not because they thought the sum was enough, but apparently because they reasoned, "Why should we wear ourselves out and waste time in front of the television cameras over such a sum, which we can gain in a single day of police operations inspecting (and plundering) Albanian firms in Kosova?" On the other hand, the Serbian Government predicts for the "Kosmet-ites" a Nis-Prishtina-Peje highway, which will be connected with Podgorica and the Adriatic coast by a tunnel underneath Cakor. The fortune-tellers say that this will rescue the Dukagjin plain from Albanization. Meanwhile, while the plum brandy glasses clink over this magnificent project, Serbian television has inaugurated another plan with a distinctive Serbian "Kasikara" perfume, which is expected to be noisily welcomed in international business circles. At least, this is what its designers claim. In order not to leave our respected readers in bewilderment, we remind them that a "kasikara" is a hand grenade, a product of the Serbian arms industry, which Serbian soldiers have used extensively in their appalling aggression against the Croats and Bosnians. It is with this sort of marketing and logic that they want to conquer the world market, thus securing hard currency for the "Serbian paradise" in Kosova, which for the "Kosovo-Polje-types" of "Postojbina" now sleeps deep under Cakor.
