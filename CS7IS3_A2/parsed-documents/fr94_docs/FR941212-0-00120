(d) Property for the loss or damage or which claims may be settled under this subpart includes_ (1) Real property used and occupied in connection with training, field exercises, or maneuvers. An allowance may be made for the use and occupancy of real property arising out of trespass or other tort, even though claimed as rent.

A claim may not be allowed under this subpart that_ (a) Results from action by an enemy or results directly or indirectly from an act of the armed forces of the United States in combat, except if it arises from an accident or malfunction incident to the operation of an aircraft of the armed forces of the United States including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to combat, and occurring while preparing for, going to, or returning from a combat mission. (b) Is purely contractual in nature. (c) Is one for which a foreign country is responsible under Article VIII NATO&hyph;SOFA, or other similar treaty or agreement. (See §536.148). However, if a foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the senior Army JA in country or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS, may authorize a foreign claims commission to consider the claim. (d) Arises from private or domestic obligations as distinguished from Government transactions. (e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;4.) (f) Is a bastardy claim. (g) Arises from the operations of a nonappropriated fund activity, unless generated by military personnel performing assigned duties (subpart L). (h) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States incurred incident to service. (See §536.25.)

(k) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under workmen's compensation type laws or regulations, including local law or custom, in cases where contribution is made or insurance premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee. If, in the opinion of a foreign claims commission the claim should be considered payable; (e.g. injuries did not result from the normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws,) the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, who may authorize payment of an appropriate award. The Commander, USARCS, also may specify that all or any part of any compensation received by the claimant from workmen's compensation sources, as above, will be deducted from the award to claimant. The claim of an insurance carrier subrogee who has received premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee, however, is not payable. (l) Is for taking of property by technical trespass, such as the overflight of aircraft or a taking contemplated by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as distinguished from common law trespass.

The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation of DA directives. (p) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by §536.152(c)(1). Real estate claims founded upon contract are generally processed under AR 405&hyph;15. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.) (q) Is not in the best interests of the United States or is contrary to public policy, general principles of equity, or the basic intent of the FCA. Examples are claims by inhabitants of unfriendly countries, claims by or based on injury or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States, or claims for property losses resulting directly or indirectly from illegal activities of the claimant, such as drug dealing, black-marketing, or illegal loan sharking. When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, the issue will be presented to the Commander, USARCS for determination of the applicability of this exclusion.
