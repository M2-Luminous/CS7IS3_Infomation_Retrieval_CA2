He told CTK he did not think that his appointment could jeopardise the fund's activity. "I do not believe that people will leave the fund due to my appointment," he said, adding that his primary task will be to put an end to long-lasting feelings of uncertainty among the fund's employees. In his opinion, an FNM chairman should devote all his time to management, not politics. He described his predecessor Tomas Jezek as a "remarkable political figure." Ceska was born in Plzen, western Bohemia, on January 29, 1964. After finishing studies at a grammar school in Plzen he left for Prague where he graduated from the Prague School of Economics. He started working in the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences Economic Institute in 1990, and when the Privatisation Ministry was created he became an advisor to then minister Tomas Jezek. After the parliamentary elections in 1992 Ceska was appointed deputy privatisation minister.
