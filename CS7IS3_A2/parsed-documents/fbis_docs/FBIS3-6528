"In this (Asia-Pacific) region, a series of favorable developments can be seen after the end of the Cold War, but there are some destabilizing factors such as North Korea's nuclear (program)," the official quoted the premier as saying in an interview with journalists from China. North Korea is suspected of producing nuclear weapons at its facilities in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. It has refused to permit the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, to conduct checks at a nuclear site. The interview, held at the premier's official residence for nearly an hour, came a day before Hosokawa begins an official three- day visit to China. During his stay, he will meet with Chinese Premier Li Peng and other leaders in Beijing and make inspections of an economic development zone in Shanghai. Hosokawa expressed hope to reaffirm with Chinese leaders the shared view that Tokyo and Beijing should further enhance their ties so that together they can contribute to the international community, the official said. "I wish to have a meaningful and candid exchange of views with them to further promote Japan-China ties toward the 21st century," he reportedly said. Touching on expanding bilateral trade and growing Japanese investment in China, Hosokawa also told the Chinese reporters that the prospects for Japan-China economic and trade relations are bright.
