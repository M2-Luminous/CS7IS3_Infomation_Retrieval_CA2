FR940928-0-00054 FR940928-0-00019 VII. Review Under Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Authorization Act This notice of interim final rulemaking incorporates by reference Illuminating Engineering Society, American National Standards Institute and International Commission on Illumination commercial test procedures to measure the efficiency of general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps and the color rendering index of fluorescent lamps. The commercial standards are Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;9&hyph;1988, Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984, Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;20&hyph;1983, Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991, Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;58&hyph;1982, Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;1991, American National Standards Institute C78.1&hyph;1991, American National Standards Institute C78.2&hyph;1978, American National Standards Institute C78.3&hyph;1991, American National Standards Institute C78.375&hyph;1991, American National Standards Institute C82.3&hyph;1983, and International Commission on Illumination Publication No. 13.2.-1974. Pursuant to section 301 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91), the Department of Energy is required to comply with section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, as amended by section 9 of the Federal Energy Administration Authorization Act of 1977. 15 U.S.C. 788. The findings required of the Department of Energy by section 32 serve to alert the public regarding the use and background of commercial standards in a proposal and through the rulemaking process. They allow interested persons to make known their views regarding the appropriateness of the use of any particular commercial standard in a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Department of Energy has evaluated Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;9, LM&hyph;16, LM&hyph;20, LM&hyph;45, LM&hyph;58, LM&hyph;66, American National Standards Institute C78.1, C78.2, C78.3, C78.375, C82.3, and International Commission on Illumination Publication No. 13.2 with regard to compliance with Section 32(b). The Department is unable to conclude whether these standards fully complied with the requirements of section 32(b), i.e., that they are developed in a manner which fully provided for public participation, comment, and review. As required by section 32(c), the Department of Energy will consult with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission concerning the impact of these standards on competition, prior to issuing a notice of Final Rulemaking. VIII. Interim Final Effect The Interim Final Rule establishes the Department of Energy test procedures for general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and medium base compact fluorescent lamps incorporating by reference industry standards. This Interim Final Rule allows the Department of Energy to promulgate test procedures so that lamp manufacturers can meet the schedule imposed by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 123(f)(2). The normal rulemaking process would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest because the process would not allow for promulgation of a final rule in time for manufacturers to complete testing for certification. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires manufacturers to test lamps for a 12-month period preceding the date standards are to take effect in order to certify that the lamps meet the standard. Section 123(f)(2). For two lamp types, the Energy Policy Act specifies that the effective date for standards to take effect is April 30, 1994 and for others the effective date is October 31, 1995. Section 123(f). Until a test procedure is prescribed, compliance with the standard cannot be determined. This interim final rule will allow manufacturers to begin the 12-month testing period to determine compliance with the standards. The Department could not practicably facilitate such a result if a proposed rule were necessary. It is in the public interest to facilitate that result and therefore to issue this interim final regulation without providing for public comment prior to giving them final effect. 5 U.S.C. 553. However, the Department of Energy is providing for a post-publication public comment period and expects to respond to relevant comments in a notice of Final Rulemaking. IX. Public Comment A.
