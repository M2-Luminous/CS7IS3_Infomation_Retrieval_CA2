Speaking on Russian television on Sunday, Lavrov said that the programme will be submitted to the government as soon as the sources of its financing are found. He voiced concern about the position of many Russians in some republics of the former Soviet Union, especially in Latvia and Estonia where about 1.5 million Russians are deprived of their civil and political rights. He said similar problems face Russians in Central Asian republics, including Kazakhstan. Although Russia has friendly relations with that republic, the Kazakh Constitution says that the Kazakh nation, rather that Kazakhstan's people, will seek to restore its statehood. This lends an ethnic flavour to the entire concept of statehood of Kazakhstan where Russians and Kazakhs account for about 40 per cent of the total each, the deputy minister noted. Lavrov said that the idea of dual citizenship is encountering tremendous difficulties in former Soviet republics. He admitted, however, that although dual citizenship will not solve all the problems, it may have a positive psychological impact on people and help ease tension.
