Diesel will increase 46 centavos between April and December, at the rate of seven centavos a month; gasoline will increase 14 centavos each month; the minimum rate for electricity consumption will increase from 51 to 55 cordobas; and the minimum water consumption rate will increase from 16 to 17.07 cordobas. In addition, the ESAF -- which will guarantee $660 million in funds and the renegotiation of the $11.638 billion foreign debt -- will not help the current agricultural season, because the funds will not begin arriving in the country until July. The coffee and cattle sectors and the FISE [Emergency Fund For Social Investments] and PAMIC [National Program to Support Microenterprises] projects will benefit from funds from the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, and the BCIE [Central American Bank of Economic Integration]. According to Lacayo, with the ESAF, the government is "righting the wrongs" it inherited from former President Ortega and recovering "the sovereignty lost" by contracting a debt which he estimated at $12 billion. The members of the economic cabinet were especially harsh in their references to the Sandinist Front, which they accused of "mortgaging" and "harming the sovereignty" of the country during the past decade. According to them, it is not until now that the economic policy is being handled responsibly. It was announced that "the government is not going to pay the military debt [deuda belica]" left by the past administration. According to Foreign Minister Erwin Kruger, Nicaragua owes $3 billion to the former Soviet Union. Russia demands the payment of at least $500 million, but the Violeta Chamorro government is willing to renegotiate only $150 million. According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, the ESAF "will open opportunities for everyone, specially the poorest people," because it will reduce public expenses by 250 million cordobas and strengthen the social protection umbrella. Minister Lacayo stressed the ESAF does not represent new "rough times" for the country, but an opportunity to pay less to the Paris Club; greater financing for agricultural production; and more schools and health centers. "This is a fundamental phase to place the house in order; it is directed at resolving debt problems," Finance Minister Emilio Pereira said. "The new phase is one of opportunities and of an economy for progress." Minister Lacayo said that even though the ESAF will mean that the country will have "the opportunity to grow in a sustained and equitable manner," the government is ready to face any protest by the people. In a positive tone, Minister Lacayo said that through the ESAF, three jobs will be created for each one of the 13,500 jobs that will be eliminated in the state sector in the next three years, adding 84,675 jobs.
