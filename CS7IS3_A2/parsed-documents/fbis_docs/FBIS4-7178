Some 150 workers from the Song Be Garment Export Co. stopped work for two hours Thursday in favor of overtime payments and the lowering of production levels required by management. Company director Le Thi Bich Ngoc, rejected the strikers' demands, saying they could resign if they felt they were unable to meet the production demands. The strikers plan to stop work again by the end of the week if their demands were not met. The latest strike followed similar action earlier this month by 2,500 workers at the state-run peanut firm Thanh Le against working conditions and low salaries. Labor unrest in southern Vietnam has increased in recent months, particularly in companies controlled by foreign firms. Vietnam plans to adopt a labor code in May in which the right to strike is to be defined for the first time.
