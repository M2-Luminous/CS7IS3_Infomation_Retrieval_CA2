In agreement and coordination with Army Commander General Emile Lahhud, the Army has been reinforced. However, the Lebanese media have described the matter as if the Army has entered a forbidden area. This is wrong. The Army and the internal security forces have been there. The refugees began to return last year. They will continue to return where they can with the help of the ministry and the Army. [Correspondent] Do you consider what happened yesterday and today a reinforcement of the Army's presence? [Junblatt] This is a new security plan. I have personally asked for some action to give assurances [to the returnees]. There are steps that have been taken by the Army for reasons only known to it. We do not deal in the Army's military affairs. However, the Army has been there. What is the reason for all this drum beating and trumpeting as if the Army has entered the Israeli- occupied south?
