FR941103-0-00116 FR941103-0-00016 (c)*␣*␣* * * * * * Extreme dynamic loading means the maximum single-acting loading a cargo tank may experience during its expected life, excluding accident loadings. * * * * * Normal operating loading means the loading a cargo tank may be expected to experience routinely in operation. * * * * * (i)*␣*␣* (2) The strength of the connecting structure joining multiple cargo tanks in a cargo tank motor vehicle must meet the structural design requirements in §178.345&hyph;3. Any void within the connecting structure must be vented to the atmosphere and have a drain located on the bottom centerline. Each drain must be accessible and must be kept open at all times. The drain in any void within the connecting structure of a carbon steel, self-supporting cargo tank may be either a single drain of at least 1.0 inch diameter, or two or more drains of at least 0.5 inch diameter, 6.0 inches apart, one of which is located on the bottom centerline. * * * * * 16. In §178.345&hyph;3, paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows: §178.345&hyph;3 Structural integrity. * * * * * (b) ASME Code design and construction. The static design and construction of each cargo tank must be in accordance with Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code. The tank design must include calculation of stresses generated by the MAWP, the weight of the lading, the weight of structures supported by the cargo tank wall and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in the calculation of thermal stresses. (1) Stress concentrations in tension, bending and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with Appendix G of Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code. (2) Longitudinal compressive buckling stress for ASME certified vessels must be calculated using paragraph UG&hyph;23(b), Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code. For cargo tanks not required to be certified in accordance with the ASME Code, compressive buckling stress may be calculated using alternative analysis methods which are accurate and verifiable. When alternative methods are used calculations must include both the static loads described in this paragraph and the dynamic loads described in paragraph (c) of this section.
