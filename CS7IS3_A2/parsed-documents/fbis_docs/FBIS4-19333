If old Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre, the crusader of precouncil fundamentalism, was still alive, no doubt his eyes would shine with emotion. Could he ever have dreamt, at the time the hated Rome of the Papacy was drifting toward modernism, that a traditionalist like Irene Pivetti would be nominated for the post of speaker of the lower house? Each word is like a stone being thrown: "It is a Catholic's specific duty to endeavor to convert others and not leave them prey to error." Does Article 18 of the Declaration of Human Rights not guarantee everybody the right to profess their own religion? "It is a Catholic's duty not to subscribe to it uncritically." Because there is only one possible goal: "Building a society in which Catholic religion is shared by everybody." Combative Irene -- the League's true Joan of Arc -- has never been afraid to speak up. She has never given up making polemic, adamant, cutting remarks. Against the progressive intellectuals: "I do not give a hoot." Against Cardinal Paolo Martini: "He manages the Milan curia [archbishopric] like a holding." Against those who accuse her of wanting to foster the northern race. "There is nothing wrong with that. It is not the League saying there are fewer births in the north than in the south, it is a statistical fact." She is always straightforward with what she believes in: God, Bandwagon [League nickname], and family -- forward like a tank advancing on gentle tracks with the hoarse thundering voice of someone who has smoked too many Gauloises cigarettes and against everything and everybody, including her own boss, if necessary. Like that time when [League secretary] Bossi invited "that dear little hot number [Federation of Italian Socialists Secretary] Boniver" to taste the strength of "hard-on-ism." With her strict air of a Swiss nanny of the Frau Rottermayer variety, the Bandwagon's virgin maid frowned and said: "I felt uncomfortable. A vulgar attack...." She even burst out: "I felt like punching him in the nose." She carries her 31 years with somewhat starched gracefulness: vaporous, chestnut-colored, 30's-style hairdo; somewhere between dove-color and sapphire blue, transparent eyes; a slightly absent, suffering air; a beautiful mouth which rarely opens into a smile. Irene Pivetti was born in Milan, on 4 April 1963, on St. Isidore's day. Daughter of a film-director and an actress, both of them Catholics, she attended the scientific high school, deepened her religious faith by taking part in spiritual rites and contemplative experiences, discovered commitment by dealing with ethnic music for the curia's broadcasting station "Radio A." She chose the path of modern languages, enrolling in the Sacro Cuore University and graduating with the highest marks, having submitted a thesis on 15th-century linguist Benedetto Varchi's unpublished work -- a choice which was in line with family traditions. Once sarcastically branded by FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA as "the League's titmouse," she is in fact the niece of Aldo Gabrielli, the author of the dictionary published under his name, whose latest edition she supervised herself. Intelligent, cultured, willful, politically educated by FUCI [Italian Catholics University Federation] and ACLI [Christian Association of Italian Workers], she told of how she had discovered the League just over four years ago: "I wrote an article against those who dismissed the League too offhandedly. Bossi phoned me and treated me to a pizza." Love at first sight. She was immediately entrusted with the bandwagon's Catholic Consultation Office [Consulta], together with Giuseppe Leoni (who, years later, censored her, saying she "speaks like a Lefebvrian"), immediately stood as a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, and was immediately elected with a forceful slogan "Your soul to God, your vote to Bossi." A meteoric rise which was offset by a family crisis, namely the deterioration of her relationship with her husband, Paolo Taranta, a young left-wing Catholic economist close to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. A Catholic-Communist (the worst possible combination, in Irene's view) who greeted his wife's election to the Chamber of Deputies with an icy: "Congratulations. What a shame you happen to be in the wrong party." Dressed always in yuppy manageress suits -- often enlivened by the glimmer of a gold necklace (the "Vandee [18th-century French counterrevolutionary movement] cross," testifying to her faith in revolt: "A beautiful example of the people's religious heroism"), dismissed by [Forza Italia sympathizer] Deputy Vittorio Sgarbi with an anti-Scalfaro quip ("We have moved from the contemplation of the Madonna, to the Madonna herself"), Irene Pivetti has now been for years at the center of -- often violent -- polemics. Let us mention only three. The first was a campaign in the name of Cardinal Ratzinger ("a true guarantor of Catholic faith and morals") against Cardinal Martini, conducted in such harsh tones as to lead Umberto Bossi to say that "like all Catholics, Irene also often adopts fundamentalist attitudes worthy of Khomeyni." The second campaign was that against abortion: "The law must be reviewed from top to bottom. In the abortion surgery factories, there must also be doctors who object to abortion and enlighten people's consciences." The third polemic was aimed against the "antiracist Savonarolas" [virulent 15th-century Florentine moralist preacher] who, in her view, had stirred up a "great fuss" by demanding an antiracist law only because of a few "stars of David stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish people in Rome." A multi-episode polemic: Accused by a foreign newspaper of using anti-Semitic tones, the League deputy (beware of calling her "right honorable": "I cannot stand it") submitted a motion in parliament -- [Radical leader] Pannella recalled -- asking to be protected against the "Jewish freemasonry." Replying to those "more or less well-known members of the Jewish community" who had dared criticize her (such as [Journalist] Arrigo Levi, in a CORRIERE DELLA SERA article), she replied with three words which her uncle only included in his dictionary with bashful embarrassment: "Balls, balls, balls!"
