The Department is also making an additional $2 million of FY 1993 HBCU funds eligible for program applicants.

In addition, the Department is extending the application due date to 4:30 p.m. on February 11, 1994, to give additional applicants an opportunity to apply for funding under this program. However, applicants who have already submitted an application may not submit an additional application. The total of $13,000,000 announced as available in this Notice will be awarded under the same terms set forth in the FY 1993 NOFA, cited above (September 17, 1993, 58 FR 48716).
