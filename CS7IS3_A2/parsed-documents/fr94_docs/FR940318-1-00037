FR940318-1-00037 FR940318-1-00013 An analysis of air quality and emissions data for the nonattainment area of Sheridan demonstrates that violations of the annual NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct particulate matter emissions from re-entrained road dust and woodburning. The emission inventory and CMB data for Sheridan did not reveal any significant sources of sulfates or nitrates in the area. Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude any such sources from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is proposing to make a general finding for this area, today's proposed finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) The PM 10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further progress is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. In considering the quantitive milestones and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1) of the Act). The PM 10 SIP for the Sheridan nonattainment area demonstrates attainment by December 31, 1994 satisfying the initial quantitive milestone requirement. 8 EPA also proposes to find that at this time the SIP meets Reasonable Further Progress. 8 The emissions reduction progress made prior to the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (only 46 days beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first milestone requirement (57 FR 13539). The de minimis timing differential makes it administratively impractable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations. 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). The credited control measure contained in the SIP is the SWMP, addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (Including RACT).'' This control measure applies to winter time street sanding and sweeping. The mayor of Sheridan approved and adopted the street sanding plan on February 21, 1989. This signed document was submitted as part of the August 28, 1989 SIP submittal. The program designates specific city limitations/guidelines for the following parameters: sanding routes, application rates, sanding materials and street cleaning. The program, according to the State's Attorney General, is enforceable by the State if the local agency fails to implement the program. The authority is derived directly from state statute (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;201, 701 and 901). 8. Contingency Measures As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures must be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the areas's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Sheridan SIP's contingency measure is the use of a chemical de-icer in lieu of sand on certain roadways. The SIP provides that the contingency measure can take effect without further action by the State or EPA Administrator, should EPA determine that the Sheridan, Wyoming nonattainment area has failed to make RFP or to attain the PM 10 standard by the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1994. After review of the contingency measure, EPA is proposing to approve the Sheridan, Wyoming, contingency plan. III. Implications of Today's Action The EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision originally submitted to EPA for the Sheridan nonattainment area on August 28, 1989 along with the subsequent submittals mentioned earlier (including the contingency measure). The State of Wyoming has demonstrated that the Sheridan moderate PM 10 nonattainment area attained the PM 10 NAAQS in 1989 and that it will continue to maintain the standard through 1994. As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas, such as a new source review permit program meeting the requirements of sections 173 and 189 of the Act, were due after the November 15, 1991 SIP requirements addressed in this notice. The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.
