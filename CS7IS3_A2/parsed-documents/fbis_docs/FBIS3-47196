There are many problems, including financial system reforms, but Japanese companies on the scene are generally optimistic. Approximately 40 km from Shanghai City center, the industrial zone of Songjiang County, Shanghai City, is located. Since land prices and personnel expenses are cheaper than in Shanghai City center and laborers who do not dislike factory work are plentiful, the interest of Japanese companies in the zone has been increasing recently. A neatly paved highway runs from Shanghai City to Songjiang County. The scenery of Shanghai outskirts, observed when traveling on this road to visit the industrial site, was very impressive. Waterways ran here and there in the extensive paddy fields. Groups of several farm houses were standing. It was a rural scene commonly found in Japan. Many apartment houses and deluxe villas were under construction. There were even buildings to which access roads could not be seen at all. When I asked, "With all these apartments and villas being built, are people really going to live in them," the local guide replied, "Hong Kong and Taiwan investors are buying them for speculative purposes." Redevelopment projects have climbed to approximately 300 in the center of Shanghai. Concerning this real estate development, a knowledgeable source said: "From around last fall, the names of influential figures began to appear. I had been thinking it might be a recurrence of `government corruption' (illegal acts by government officials), which became a problem during the Tiananmen incident, when the big campaign to prevent corruption started." Though not related to real estate, an agent who personally brokered currency exchanges without going through the foreign exchange control center and collected commissions was said to have been prosecuted recently. This action might be considered a part of the campaign to prevent illegal and corrupt practices. Since Deng Xiaoping's visit to the south in early 1992, China accelerated the speed of economic growth. As growth accelerated, inflation spiraled and speculative property and stock manipulations intensified throughout China. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is the official who is fighting to restrain the economic overheating that the Chinese call the "bubble." As soon as Vice Premier Zhu took over the Central Bank presidency concurrently in July, control measures, such as reraising of interest rates, early recovery of illegal or speculative loans by financial institutions, 20-percent cut in fiscal expenditures, etc., were presented one after another. Control Measures Begin To Show Results "Prices of steel materials and cement have stopped rising and in fact, seem to be falling. For construction companies like ours, that is a desirable trend." So states Hachiro Yamano, acting chief of the China Office, Fujita Corp. At present, the company is independently developing an industrial site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, a national project. Construction materials have spiraled in cost because of the real estate boom. In Shanghai, during the one-year period beginning April 1992, prices increased approximately 70 percent for cement, 95 percent for steel rods, and 150 percent for lumber. "Land prices soared, too, because of the infrastructure buildup in the Pudong New Area and redevelopment of the old urban area. However, probably out of caution for monetary tightening, real estate has not moved since summer" (Shinichiro Sugano, manager of Shanghai branch, Industrial Bank of Japan). As for stocks, too, the price index jumped from 393 in late 1992 to 1,532 in February 1993 in the Shanghai market, out of speculation craze, but it plummeted after control measures took effect and has fallen to the 800 level. Also, at the Shanghai foreign exchange control center, the exchange rate has stabilized from approximately 11 yuan to 8.8 yuan to the dollar after enforcement of the control measures. Thus, as far as curbing excessive property and stock investments are concerned, the effect of the restraining measures has become evident. However, separate from the central government's concern, the effect has begun to appear even in sound corporate operations. Liu Shunxin, deputy director, Shanghai City Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and head of its foreign affairs office, denies the effect of the control measures on the current Pudong development, saying "it is a priority national project and there is no problem in fund procurement." On the other hand, he says, "There is some effect on procurement of renminbi yuan (RMB) in joint ventures. Since banks are extremely tight on granting new loans, there are cases where counterpart state enterprises cannot procure people's yuan and joint venture plans tend to be delayed. "State-owned enterprises, with which we are not familiar, contact us unexpectedly or send letters asking for loans" (Tsutomu Hiroe, deputy manager of Shanghai branch, Bank of Tokyo). There are cases where the opening of a letter of credit (LC) is delayed because of the squeeze on the Chinese company's funds. "There are even cases where the banks demand 100-percent deposit in foreign currency" (Terumasa Iohara, head of Shanghai office, Mitsubishi Corp.). Also, Hiroshi Komata, general manager of Shanghai Isetan, says, "Since September, sales of all Shanghai department stores have been falling." A native of Shanghai pointed out that Isetan's location on "Nanjing Road was a place where people from the country and foreign tourists visit; fashion-conscious Shanghai residents go to Huaihai Middle Road." A store was opened in June 1993 on that Huaihai Middle Road. The effects of these restraining measures are beginning to appear gradually not only in Shanghai but in various places. Financial System Reform Is the Key "Macroeconomic control"--that is the phrase that is presently being used like a catchword in China. Zhang Yunfang, deputy director of the Development Research Center, affiliated with the State Council of the central government, states, "I think that the reform and liberalization course has entered a new stage." He adds: "The reform was carried out until now while maintaining the planned economy setup, but hereafter, there must be a substantive change toward market economy. To do that, a systematic reform must be promoted to build the system that is suited to market economy. Future economic management will be switched from the "command-type," based on fiscal policies, to the "coordinated-type," based on market economy. That is the real meaning of "macroeconomic control." Therefore, the central government is now pushing financial system reform as the top-priority task. At the "Japan-China International Monetary and Financial Symposium" (sponsored by the State Council's Development Research Center and Japan-China 21st Century Economic Symposium) held on 13 September in Beijing with deputy director Zhang Yunfang as the Chinese secretariat chief, the basic steps of the financial system reform were announced. The main points are: 1. Separation of governmental and commercial banks. Long-term development credit banks, export-import credit banks, and agricultural banks will be newly established while governmental banks will be converted to independently operated commercial banks. 2. Nurture of financial markets. Short-term capital markets and intra- enterprise short-term loan markets as well as short exchange markets, securities markets, etc., will be organized and developed. 3. Strengthen the functions of the People's Bank of China as the central bank. Devise means to stablize the RMB rate and control currency supply. As the economic overheating worsened, the so-called "three financial misdeeds," i.e., illegal procurement of funds by financial institutions, illegal loans, and chaotic business operations by the banks, began to occur frequently. These practices aggravated the disorderly establishment of development zones and speculation in real estate and stocks. "Even the regional branches of the People's Bank of China, which is the central bank, have stronger ties with local entities than with the main bank. For that reason, although the central bank tries to control currency supply, branches make loans in response to requests of local governments and influential local leaders" (Japanese corporation). Reportedly, there are many cases where the banks themselves engage in property and stock speculation through nonbanks. With respect to loans by financial institutions, call-in instructions were issued with the deadline of 15 August. "Loans by banks that were illegitimate because of interest rates, time limitations or usages were recovered" (Chinese bank official). According to the media, 72.7 billion yuan, or one-third of the targeted amount, were recovered nation-wide. Unless these systematic defects are overcome, "macro economic control" through financial policies is still just a dream. Under present conditions where policy tools are still far from adequate, coercive tightening by the government is inevitable. The fact that extreme restraints on bank loans are presently affecting not only property and stock speculations but even sound business operations may be said to be the negative effect of such policies. Because "triangular claims" (bad claims with debts being passed along among companies) have reappeared, views are being expressed that the policy might change again to monetary easing. However, the problem is how the aforementioned financial reform can be realized by relying on such short-term tightening and easing measures. Whether it is possible to get on a stable growth track, or not, also depends on that point. Views Toward China Change "They should make a soft landing, somehow." When Japanese companies in three locations--Dalian, Beijing and Shanghai--were questioned as to whether the current adjustment measures would be successful, the replies were generally optimistic. The reasons given are the early start with countermeasures being planned from last fall, the lessons learned from the Tiananmen incident, etc., but above all, the fact that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, "who understands economics," has taken command is building up a strong confidence. In fact, daily sundries and foodstuffs are abundantly available. Personal income has risen more than increases in commodity prices and conditions are different from those existing immediateldy before the Tiananmen incident. A factor behind this optimistic view of Japanese companies is the basic change in posture of the Japanese industrial circle toward China: "Even the management of companies listed on the stock exchange's first section foresee the growth and future potentials of China and are beginning to think of long-term investments" (trading company source). Sun Hunchao, director of the China-Asia-Pacific Region Economic Research Institute, expresses hope for steady investments by Japanese corporations: "As compared with U.S. and European enterprises, Japanese companies require time in making decisions but most of the projects that are undertaken are successful." Jiao Sufen, director of the Foreign Investment Administration Office, Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission, states: "A liaison conference of multinational companies, including Japanese, was held for three days beginning 9 September. During the conference, demands and proposals of multinational firms were brought up and there were many requests to establish holding companies and investment firms in China." He adds: "There are also companies that wanted to establish an Asian headquarters in China and conduct foreign currency exchanges at the headquarters." When asked about concrete procedures for establishing holding companies, the reply came that "they are under scrutiny, at present" (Director Jiao Sufen). For the present, the guideline for approving holding companies seems to be that permission will be granted to a company with more than three established local corporations and over $10 million in new investments. As large companies make inroads into China and start production in various areas, the advantages of establishing holding companies in China increase, such as consolidated management of taxes and finances, bulk purchases of raw materials, currency control among various bases, etc. The emergence of these requests to establish holding companies probably signifies that entry into China of foreign capital enterprises has entered an important stage.
