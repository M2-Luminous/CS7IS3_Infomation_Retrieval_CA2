Loudoun County, Virginia AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of final action. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce the final Agency action regarding the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on September 15, 1993 to Patowmack Power Partners, L.P. in Loudoun County, Virginia. This determination was appealed to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). DATES: The Environmental Appeals Board of the EPA issued an Order Denying Review on February 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Eileen M. Glen, Chief, New Source Review Section, Air Enforcement Branch, Air, Radiation and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, Mail Code 3AT22, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, (215) 597&hyph;8379. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 6, 1993 and October 8, 1993, petitions were submitted to the Environmental Appeals Board requesting review of a PSD permit issued to Patowmack Power Partners, L.P. for construction of a 315-megawatt gas/oil fired electric generating facility in Loudoun County, Virginia. These petitions were submitted by Edward A. Mainland and Mary Fraser-Priest, respectively. The PSD permit was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) on September 15, 1993, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the EPA, Region III, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Because of the delegation, any PSD permit issued by the VDEQ is an EPA-issued permit for purposes of Federal law (40 CFR 124.41; 45 FR 33413 (May 19, 1980)), and is subject to review by the Agency under 40 CFR 124.19 before becoming final. The Environmental Appeals Board issued an Order Denying Review of the permit on February 24, 1994, concluding that review of VDEQ's permit determination was not warranted and that it met all necessary requirements of Federal law. Anyone wishing to review the final permit, petitions, Order Denying Review, or related materials should contact one of the following offices: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, Air Enforcement Branch, New Source Review Section (3AT22), 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107. Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 10089, Richmond, Virginia 23240. Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.19(f)(2), for purposes of judicial review, final Agency action occurs when a final PSD permit is issued and Agency review procedures are exhausted. This notice, being published today in the Federal Register , constitutes notice of the final Agency action denying review of the PSD permit. If available, judicial review of these determinations under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act) may be sought only by the filing of a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from the date on which this determination is published in the Federal Register . Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, this determination shall not be subject to later judicial review in any civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement. Dated: April 15, 1994. W.T. Wisniewski, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10054 Filed 4&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
