FR940902-0-00055 FR940902-0-00010 A few comments were received on public relations costs versus the costs of outreach. These comments tended to view public relations as an outreach cost and recommended that it be charged to the training related and supportive services category. The Department agrees that public relations can be an effective tool that enhances outreach activity, but also believes that the costs of general public relations is more appropriately a part of the overall costs of administration. No change is made in the final rule. The Department also agrees with commenters that time distribution should be reasonable and not burdensome and that alternative distribution bases should be allowable. Language is added to paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(3)(i), and (e)(1) to provide that other equitable cost allocation methods may be used. Other equitable cost allocation methods may be either financial based or non-financial based methods. Limitations on Certain Costs Section 627.445(d) of the interim final rule clarified the provision made in section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act for excluding administrative costs incurred by CBO's or non-profit organizations from the SDA's administrative cost limitation under certain criteria and conditions specified in the Amendments. A number of commenters responded to that provision and regulatory clarification. Most of these commenters incorrectly perceived the 10-percent limitation as an absolute ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers and requested relief from that ceiling. Other commenters raised questions of whether the 90/10 provisions were based on budget or actual expenditures and the effect on the 90/10 provision if more than 10 percent is expended by the CBO or other non-profit service provider for administrative costs. The Department emphasizes that the provisions of section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act and paragraph (d) of the regulations do not constitute a mandatory ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers. The relief provisions apply to the SDA's administrative cost limitation and are only applicable for those situations in which the SDA and the CBO or other non-profit service provider agree to the 90/10 arrangement. Where such agreement is reached, the SDA may avail itself of the relief to total administrative costs only if the actual expenditures of the CBO or other non-profit service provider conforms to the 90/10 provisions. Costs charged to the JTPA program for the costs of a CBO or other non-profit service provider that are for less than 90 percent for direct training and training-related and supportive services costs or for more than 10 percent for administrative costs negate the applicability of this provision. No changes other than grammar and deletion of the word ``private'' are made to this section. Program Income Section 627.450 contains a definition of what is and what is not program income for JTPA purposes, including the incorporation of the new provisions of section 141(m) of the Act, and establishes timeframes and requirements for the treatment and use of program income. The JTPA cost categories and the administrative cost limitations are also made applicable to program income. A number of commenters responded to the provisions of this section. The comments contained a number of suggestions, including: That the Department should adopt the OMB Circular A&hyph;102 definition of program income; that program income should not be subject to the cost categories or administrative cost limitation; and that the regulations should eliminate the presumption that a contractor is entitled to the earned revenues by law, especially a contractor with whom the State or SDA is no longer contracting. Other commenters raised the question of whether earned program income must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned it and still others requested clarification of the time frame for use of program income. It is the Department's intent to adopt the basic A&hyph;102 definition of program income and to add to that definition the specific provisions of section 141(m) of the Act. In addition, the Department recognizes that the potential to earn significant amounts of program income exists within the Act and these regulations. To avoid the possibility of creating windfalls of administrative funds available to entities that choose to use the new provisions in such a manner, the Department is imposing the administrative cost limitation on program income. Section 141(m) of the Act specifies that program income may be retained by the entity that earned it and used for program purposes. The Department believes that the regulations, as written, are consistent with the statutory provision and that there is no authority to empower any other entity to use the funds, as long as the entity that earned the program income uses the funds for program purposes. In response to the questions about whether program income must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned it, or if it may be used for any JTPA program or title, the Department agrees that clarification is needed. While the interim final regulations limited the use of program income to the particular JTPA grant or subgrant under which it was earned, it is recognized that particular grants or subgrants may provide funds for multiple programs or subtitles. Therefore, paragraph (c) of this section of the final rule is amended to also limit its use to the JTPA title under which it was earned. In addition, language is added to paragraph (c)(3) to clarify that the time period for the use of program income is the funding period, usually up to three years. It was brought to the Department's attention that section 141(m) of the Act does not exempt interest earnings by States from the provisions applicable to income under the Act and, therefore, the regulations could not either. The Department agrees, however, the State is required by the CMIA, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6503(c), to pay interest on advanced funds from the time that the funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that the funds are paid out by the State for program purposes.
