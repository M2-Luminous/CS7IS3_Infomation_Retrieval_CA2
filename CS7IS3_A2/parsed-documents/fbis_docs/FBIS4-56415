In exclusive statements given to a national television newscast, Allende said: "These actions warrant only repudiation, which is the only word I can use, because I see no reason to harass Magda Montiel in this manner." She said this treatment is unbefitting behavior for civilized and normal human beings, adding that such treatment will fail to eclipse the results of "The Nation and the Emigrants" Conference, which took place on 23 and 24 April, thanks to local authority initiatives. Allende pointed out: "I personally think such behavior can in no way prevent what was accomplished in the conference from materializing; I believe this conduct will shadow those who behave in such a manner." Montiel and other citizens of Cuban origin who live abroad, mainly in the United States, are the target of aggression and harassment by extreme rightists in exile who oppose the renewal of relations between the island and its expatriate nationals. The harassment of Montiel, an American citizen and former congressional candidate for the Republican Party, began upon her return from Havana, because Miami television stations aired footage showing Montiel talking with President Fidel Castro during a reception he held for conference attendees. Isabel Allende recalled that members of the emigrant community, whom she called annexionist [anexionista] emigrants, tried to obstruct the Havana conference, which had been requested on many occasions by Cuban nationals living in many other countries.
