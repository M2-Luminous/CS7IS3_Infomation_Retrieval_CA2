About four months before the Bundestag election, the European election is also a particularly important domestic policy event, the chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] said in a DPA interview in Bonn three days before the voting. "After centuries of bitter wars between neighbors in Europe, the fact that elections will be held in 12 countries on Sunday [12 June] is a fantastic thing. We Germans need Europe more than all others," Kohl said. He announced that the Federal Government will make further attempts to considerably increase the rights and opportunities of influence of the parliament in Strasbourg in the near future. Since the Maastricht Treaty came into force, the 581 European representatives of the people have had the right of codetermination regarding the appointment of the European Commission members, including their president. The parliament also has to agree to international treaties and decide on the admission of the states that want to become members, he said. It is Kohl's objective to discuss how internationally organized crime can be more effectively combated and a joint European asylum law be agreed upon in cooperation between the council, the parliament, and the commission at the conference reviewing the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. In the chancellor's opinion, the previous regulations are not enough. Meanwhile, Kohl, French head of state Francois Mitterrand, and Spanish head of government Felipe Gonzalez have also set the course for the council presidency that will be consecutively performed by these three countries from 1 July on until the end of 1995 for six months each. "In these one-and-a-half years, we want to jointly initiate important things, for example, in the field of internal security," Kohl said. Among other things, the formulation of a joint foreign and security policy is also at issue. "The war in the former Yugoslavia stresses the need for increased EU efforts." In Kohl's opinion, it is particularly important that, at the EU summit on 24 and 25 June in Corfu, attempts at reducing unemployment in the EU will be made. One has to focus on economic policy questions, for example, an adequate strategy in view of the challenge from Asian competitors and the integration of the reform states in East and southeast Europe. "It cannot be unimportant to us whether these states are successful or not. If they relapse into old structures, this would have disastrous effects on all of us," Kohl said. As a troika, Kohl, Mitterrand, and Gonzalez also want to initiate a trans-European infrastructure, for example, in rail traffic. "It must be possible in the future to board a train in London and to leave it in Moscow after a trip across Europe. This is a first-rate offer of peace," the chancellor said.
