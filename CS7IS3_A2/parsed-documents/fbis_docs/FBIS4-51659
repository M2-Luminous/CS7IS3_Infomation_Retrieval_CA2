In recent days, it has not only significantly increased the monetary value of its intervention activities, but has moved aggressively in arranging consignment intervention by overseas central banks. The purpose of the increased intervention is to stop the rise in the yen which embodies the risk of imposing adverse effects on business psychology and to put the economic recovery on track. However, in contrast to such goals of the BOJ, the markets still seem to anticipate a higher yen. The situation seems to portend a continuing struggle between the BOJ and market trends. On 21 April, the International Bureau of the BOJ which is responsible for interventions in the foreign exchange markets seemed to be enveloped in a tense atmosphere. It engaged in intermittent yen-selling and dollar-buying operations, because the yen had risen to 102 yen for the first time in nine days. The value of dollars used in the intervention operations on that day rose to about $1 billion, a substantial rise from the average daily value of intervention running at $300-500 million through March. Sources at the International Bureau of the BOJ express concern in stating, "When the value of the dollar drops to 100 yen, sales of dollars involving currency-option transactions tend to rise and the rise in the yen accelerates." Despite a price of $1 to 102-plus yen and a comfortable margin before reaching a high of 100.4 yen, the judgment is that aggressive intervention must take place. Aside from the quantitative expansion in yen-selling and dollar-buying intervention, a qualitative change has taken place. According to market sources, the New York Federal Reserve Bank placed orders on 20 April to sell yen and buy dollars at just above 102 yen to the dollar on consignment from the BOJ. On 14 April, the BOJ engaged in consignment intervention through the German Federal Bank to sell yen and buy dollars, while concurrently placing rate checks on yen-dollar price levels with the Swiss National Bank. Intervention and rate checks in Europe were very unusual measures. On that particular day, the BOJ showed signs of engaging in consignment intervention in the United States as well and the actions were interpreted by the markets as a "demonstration by the BOJ of a stance whereby it was marshalling all resources to stop the rise in the yen." The increased intervention activity is backed by a strong feeling of a higher future yen. On the 18th, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) raised the federal funds (FF) rate which corresponds to the the Japanese call rate by 0.25 percent. That move led to a concern for the triple chain-reaction drop in bonds, stocks, and the dollar. Under such circumstances, there is the potential that money leaving the dollar and moving into the yen will cause a further rise in the yen's market value. Japanese surpluses are still running at high levels, including the highest historical record surplus of $121.9 billion in the fiscal year 1993 trade surplus which reflected a 10-percent rise over the prior year. On the other hand, according to Yoshihiko Koito, managing director of Sumitomo Bank, "Institutional investors such as life insurance companies are cautious about investing in dollar-denominated bonds and there is a continuation in the structure whereby funds once converted to yen because of trade surpluses no longer flow into other foreign currencies." Chase Manhatten Bank's European economist Robin Marshall speaks of the lingering prospect that "the United States will exercise pressure to raise the value of the yen to reduce the Japanese trade surpluses." However, more than a few question the effect of intervention. The reason is that at one time BOJ intervention represented a sizable proportion of overall market transactions, but now that the size of market transactions has expanded, the direct effect of intervention has diminished. In reality, there is a strong underlying demand among export firms to sell dollar futures and buy yen and the Industrial Bank of Japan observes that "there is the prospect that the yen will break through its previous record highs." The BOJ is poised to intervene in the markets at a daily rate of $3 billion in the event the dollar falls below 100 yen, but that does not mean that the BOJ will be able to cope with the yen-buying trend in the markets. Thus, there are sources that say, "Unless the New York Federal Reserve Bank engages in collaborative intervention with the BOJ, there will be no way that the rise in the yen can be stopped." The Economic Planning Agency, in its "Questionnaire Survey Concerning Corporate Actions," stated that the exchange rate at which export firms can operate profitably is 117 yen to the dollar. It is said that, at the current rate of just over 100 yen to the dollar, the majority of export firms must resign themselves to a drop in profits. A high yen runs the risk of adversely affecting an incipient recovery in the economy as a result of a deterioration in business psychology. Although the government and the BOJ state that "situations must be handled in an appropriate manner," the markets are becoming inured to intervention. The day when the dollar falls below 100 yen, which will pose many difficulties for the Japanese economy, is gradually nearing and the situation portends an agonizing battle for the BOJ.
