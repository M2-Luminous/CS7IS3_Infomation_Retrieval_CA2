With countless centuries behind it, one more century means hardly anything to China. For a generation or two, however, a century covers its entire life-span. Eighteen ninety-three. Year 19 of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. At 21, Guangxu had nominally taken over the reins of government for 4 years after coming of age. It was a time when everybody, from the emperor to his ministers and subjects, was committed to strengthening China. In September, the Shanghai Mechanical Textile Factory, which produced 600 bolts of cloth every day, was burned down. Li Hongzhang [2621 7703 4545] petitioned for its rebuilding. Cheng Xuanhuai [4141 1357 2037] was instructed to go to Shanghai. In Hubei, Zhang Zhidong [1728 0037 3159] set up a self-strengthening academy offering instruction in four disciplines: foreign languages, mathematics, natural science, and commerce. Lenin, 23, left Samara for St. Petersburg. Tchaikovsky, the Russian musician, died, leaving mankind a stream of beautiful music that would never run dry. In Britain, textile workers and coal miners went on strike one after another. In Spain, anarchists set off bombs in the two cities of Santander and Barcelona, probably the first acts of terrorism. An economic crisis erupted in the United States. To finance the construction of warships for use in military actions against China, the Japanese emperor issued an imperial edict cutting the salaries of civilian officials by 10 percent and dismissing 3,000 bureaucrats, thus saving 1.7 million Japanese yen. Mao Zedong Born Into a Troubled World Mao Zedong was born in a tiny mountain village on 26 December, a time when China was plagued by domestic strife and foreign invasion. The following year China suffered a disastrous defeat at sea in the Sino-Japanese War. This convinced Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of democracy, that China must reform across the board if it was to strengthen itself. So he set up Xingzhonghui in Honolulu. Those were troubled times all over the world. The great turmoil wrought on by the desire for survival, for development, energized human thinking like never before. Because of Lenin's passionate actions in Russia, Marxism became a worldwide movement. Mao Zedong was born at the right time. Although his successes and failures belong in the past, they still help shape China today. Adopting Marxist-Leninist Theory of Class Struggle A century ago, both China's national sovereignty and imperial power were in the hands of a weak and incompetent ruler. This made a profound impact on young Mao Zedong, rural-born but lettered. Every Chinese peasant dreamed about a mansion fit for a king, even the Forbidden City with all its splendor. Mao Zedong was no exception. He had read all the classics, inheriting lock, stock, and barrel that part of Chinese culture in which he had an interest. Since China was then an isolated empire, Mao Zedong had no knowledge of any foreign language, which prevented him from absorbing much of the fruit of human thinking outside China. He benefited the most from the theory of class differentiation as presented in popular Marxist-Leninist pamphlets and made it absolute. During the age of land revolution, this spiritual fruit miraculously turned into a material force capable of mobilizing the peasants. After the PRC was founded, the class struggle theory, having been made absolute, went international. As a result, China at peace remained in isolation for years even as one domestic struggle followed another on the home front. What should be affirmed is this: Mao Zedong took a firm and hard-line position in safeguarding national sovereignty even if it meant isolating China and falling out and subsequently clashing with the Soviet Union after Khrushchev came into power. From ancient books and historical texts Mao Zedong later got to learn even more about the experiences of emperors in successive dynasties in subjugating their subjects. He never shied away from acting imperial in matters of both style and substance, adopting the way of might as well as the kingly way. As they said, "The style of Emperor Wen and Emperor Wu was to be strict and liberal in turns." From the Yanan rectification movement of the 1940's to the anti-rightist struggle, Mao Zedong copied the best that literary inquisition in one dynasty after dynasty had to offer. Through confession movements effected by compulsion, Mao Zedong sought to eradicate unspoken criticism. Tragically, the overwhelming majority of intellectuals did not set out to slander Mao Zedong out of malice. Instead, they were persecuted for speaking their minds. Some were even motivated by a desire to curry favor with him. Mainland Intellectuals Trapped in Historical Vicious Circle Mao Zedong's attack on intellectuals was indeed a huge success. Only years later did people realize that he simply would not let you have a voice. The only thing he would let you do was to listen with respectful attention, not even repeat his words. In the anti-rightist movement, some people were attacked as rightists precisely because they repeated some of Mao Zedong's words as yet unpublished at the time. By the time the Cultural Revolution broke out, people no longer knew what to believe. On the other hand, they dared not omit a single word. Any documents co-signed by the CPC Central Committee, the central military commission, the CPC Cultural Revolutionary Committee, and the State Council might become wrongly transmitted imperial edicts overnight. Mao Zedong's closest comrades-in-arms might end up as conspirators the next day. All the masses in every faction in the civil war during the Cultural Revolution were blind followers who repeated every single one of Mao Zedong's words a thousand times. Many of the ways, voluntary and compulsory, in which these people pledged their loyalty to Mao Zedong reminded us of the scenes that took place under a corrupt monarchy. But Mao Zedong had no qualms at all, which goes to show that not even he could break the vicious circle in Chinese history (The hopes of the Chinese people rose and fell with dynastic succession). If nothing else he admired monarchical authority in spite of himself. In his old age he genuinely believed his words were the golden truth. After his death, Mao Zedong was roundly criticized by many people for his personal conduct. As he himself had said, there is no perfect human being, just as there is no perfect gold. In all fairness, Mao Zedong was largely free from corruption. He was a diligent thinker, determined, courageous, and hardy and frugal in his personal habits. He was a precocious military commander who took war as his instructor, a propagandist and agitator who had a profound understanding of Chinese peasants and enjoyed their strong support. In the pre-1949 war years, he had a knack for spotting talented people and putting them in the right positions. Moreover, he was a charming poet and lover. Certainly many emperors who founded or engineered the resurgence of a dynasty also possessed these qualities. In 500 B.C., King Goujian of Yue was defeated in battle and lost his kingdom. Enduring humiliation in order to carry out an important mission, he even refused to "eat any grain not grown by himself and wear any clothes not woven by his queen." What happened in the end? After conquering the Kingdom of Wu, he sentenced Wen Zhong to death and sent Fan Li into exile. Goujian went down the same road that all other kings and emperors had gone down before. In its entirety Mao Zedong's legacy is worth far less than the ill-gotten gains of some village chief in China today. His inheritance consists mainly of the royalties on his writings. Paying a Hefty Price for Personality Cult My screenplay "Bitter Love" came under attack in 1981. I was particularly taken to task for a minor scene in which the leading character, then a child, asked the elder of a temple, "How come Buddha's face is black?" The elder replied, "His face has been blackened by the incense burned by the worshippers." There is no denying the truth I am referring to: The cause-and-effect relationship between the worshipped and the worshipper in Chinese history. The Chinese paid a steep price for Mao Zedong's personality cult. Years of political struggle retarded production growth for long periods of time. The Great Leap Forward caused a mass famine. The disillusionment resulting from the Cultural Revolution caused a nervous breakdown among the entire population. In the end Mao Zedong's face was blackened by the incense burned by hundreds of millions of worshippers. Then came the Tiananmen incident during the Qingming Festival in 1976. Only then did Mao Zedong see his own blackened face in tens of thousands of eyes. The man, who had been spiritually tough and physically strong, never recovered from this episode. Chinese intellectuals in the late 1940's firmly believed that the Chinese nation would henceforth be strong and the nation would prosper and live in peace. They also believed that all past, present, and future successes should be attributed to Mao Zedong Thought, that Mao Zedong Thought was invincible, and that it was the beacon for the people of China and even the whole world. In short, Mao Zedong was perceived as an omnipotent god. Please Open the Door of One's Mind Most Chinese intellectuals gave up the right to independent thinking of their own accord. Many scholars regressed into juvenile or infantile thinking. Because of their intellectual sloppiness, they became either wolf-like or sheep-like. Intellectuals were completely stripped of their independent personality. In addition, a succession of political movements objectively drove home the grim fact that other than Mao Zedong, it was harmful and downright dangerous for anybody else to even think. No matter how senior their positions, however solid their credentials, they would all come to grief (Real-life examples include Liu Shaoqi [0491 1421 1142] and Peng Dehuai [1756 1795 2037]). There was a time when people of the Mao Zedong era congratulated themselves on the existence of Mao Zedong. Later they rejoiced over his passing from the scene. No leader, however great, can guarantee a nation's stable sustained development. What is needed is a political system that entrusts hope, democracy, and freedom to the people and where the people can effectively supervise and replace public servants, including the No. 1 public servant. Another century. With countless centuries behind it, one more century, one less century does not mean anything to China. For a generation or two, however, a century covers its entire life-span. Today, at long last, China has changed its course and headed toward the world. China must shed its isolation, poverty, and degeneration. But it must never again long for the birth of another great helmsman. For starters, everybody must unlock the door to his thinking, something that requires courage and strength because for too long he has been held prisoner ideologically. Then every door in China must be opened to let in fresh air. One door, however, must not be opened, namely the heavy door leading to the imperial throne. (Bai Hua is a Shanghai writer. His screenplay "Bitter Love" came under attack in 1981.)
