The Serbian side has assumed a serious and responsible approach to the European Union [EU] demands because it deemed that the EU has defined its proposition in a serious and responsible way, Milosevic added. He recalled that the EU demands were precisely set out: 33.3 percent of the territory for the Muslim republic, temporary UN administration of Sarajevo, EU administration of Mostar, and access to the Sava river for the Muslim republic. The Serbian side came to Geneva to sign the peace plan because it has accepted the EU proposal, the Serbian president said, adding that a plan perfect to the smallest detail has never existed; the remaining issues can be successfully resolved in bilateral relations after the peace agreement has been reached. Slobodan Milosevic added that he reasons along the lines of the logical view that acceptance of the EU proposal creates conditions for the peace plan to be signed and for ending the war. He stressed that the remaining critical points and alterations to the plan can be no one's reason for continuing the war and that a peace should be endorsed immediately, while any possible exchanges should be left to negotiations between the parties involved. The Serbian president said that the international community has an obligation to explain to the Muslim side its attitude to its proposal in the event of the Muslim side refusing to sign a peace in the circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the EU proposals. At the same time the European Twelve ought -- in keeping with their obligations -- to lift the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serbian people. The Serbian president said in conclusion that this is the international community's moral obligation. Sources close to the negotiators say that the plenary session was held in a depressing atmosphere against the backdrop of mutual recriminations between the Muslim and Croatian delegations. The Muslim army side is reported to have tabled new territorial demands with the Croats. The second plenary session is expected to begin this afternoon. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia have resumed their bilateral talks following the signing of their joint declaration. President Slobodan Milosevic and President of the Serbian Republic Radovan Karadzic have also talked to Co-chairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. Sources close to the Croatian delegation claim that Tudjman suggested to Bosnian Muslim Leader Izetbegovic that an arbitration commission be set up which would resolve territorial disputes between all three warring sides in the whole of Bosnia- Herzegovina. It has been unofficially learned that Lord Owen has proposed that the UN Security Council should set up a commission and that a cease-fire should be in effect while the commission is working. Sources close to the delegation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina say that the Serbian side has rejected such a commission. According to the latest indications, the current round of peace negotiations on Bosnia is expected to wrap up tonight.
