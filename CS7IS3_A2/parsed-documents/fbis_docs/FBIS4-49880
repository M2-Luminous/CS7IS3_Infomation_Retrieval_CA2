About 600 people from abroad and at home attended the opening ceremony of the meeting, which was co-sponsored by the China State Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems (SCRES) and THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. Among them were Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysian prime minister, Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany. Li Lanqing stressed in his speech that China is advancing toward its second goal in its economic and social development drive and establishment of a new socialist market economy. "At the moment," he said, "the holding of this important summit meeting will provide a multi-layer contact opportunity for high- ranking Chinese and foreign officials, entrepreneurs and economists to discuss economic theories and practices in the contemporary world and China." For this reason, he added, Chinese Government departments related to the economy will introduce their position with regard to the establishment of the socialist market economy, economic development, and reform and development measures put forward recently, so the delegates can obtain a full understanding of today's China. The vice-premier also gave a briefing on China's economic situation. In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: the Role of the People's Republic of China", Sutherland said that momentous developments are taking place in China along with the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, and prior to the set-up of the new World Trade Organization. "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced programs of liberalization and reform, particularly those relating to the exchange regime, taxation, state trading, licensing, tariffs and non-tariff measures," he said. "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world over, including those in China, are keen to see full implementation of these and other announced reforms. "I clearly view most positively the prospect of early completion of the negotiations on the terms and conditions for China's rejoining GATT," he added. Sutherland noted that China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line with the world trading system. Mahathir said in his speech that an anarchic situation was neither going to facilitate the growth and flowering of a free market, nor help the transition from a command economy to a market economy. "China is right in not making a total and immediate switch," he said. "It is right in not simultaneously attempting a radical political about-turn." He also spoke highly of China's socialist market economy by saying that "China did right in sticking to its brand of socialist politics while espousing a version of the market economy," because "it is apparently more successful in terms of the economy, which is growing very fast." Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of SCRES, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, also made speeches to introduce China's reform and opening drive. Entrepreneurs from Malaysia, Hong Kong and France also spoke at the meeting.
