FR941207-0-00078 FR941207-0-00014 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP Savannah 94&hyph;123] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulations; Savannah River, Savannah, GA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone for the departure of the Deck Barge Isle Del Sol and the Escorting Tugs on the Savannah River. The safety zone is needed to preempt the possibility of collision between converging vessels due to the large beam required in the river channel by the Deck Barge's cargo. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation becomes effective between November 21, 1994 and December 19, 1994, with times as published in Coast Guard District Seven local notice to mariners. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT. J.A. Simmerman, Marine Safety Office Savannah at Tel: (912) 652&hyph;4353, between the hours of 0730 and 1600, Monday through Friday, except holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since immediate action is needed to prevent possible hazards to mariners. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulations are LT. J.A. Simmerman, project officer for the Captain of the Port, Savannah, Georgia, and LT. J.M. Losego, project attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone for the departure of the Deck Barge Isle Del Sol and the Escorting Tugs on the Savannah River from Marcona Ocean Industries Dock, Fort Jackson continuing throughout its transit until it is east of the Colreg Demarcation Line. The zone will consist of an area within a 50 yard radius around the tugs and deck barge during its transit in the Savannah River. The Captain of the Port has restricted vessel operations in this safety zone. No persons or vessels will be allowed to enter or operate within this zone, except as may be authorized by the Captain of the Port, Savannah, Georgia. This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231, as set out in the authority citation of all of part 165. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Regulatory Evaluation These regulations are not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will be in effect for a total of 8 hours between November 21, 1994 and December 19, 1994. The specific times are as published in Coast Guard District Seven local notice to mariners. Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
