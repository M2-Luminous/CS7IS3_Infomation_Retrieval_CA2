A consultant of this commission Valeriy Menshikov explained that in the international convention "On Prohibition of Development, Production, Storage, and Exploitation of Chemical Weapons and its Destruction" signed on January 13, 1993 Russia indicated that there were about 40,000 tons of chemical weapons in its arsenal, stored on 7 bases, 6 -- in Russia's European part and one -- behind the Ural Mountain Range. However, as Menshikov says, there were several cases of secret destruction of chemical weapons and poisonous gases in the summer and autumn 1993. Given the fact that official destruction of chemical weapons should be carried out under the supervision of international controllers, now, as before Russia possesses 40,000 tons of chemical weapons. According to Menshikov, this means that by the moment the convention was signed the amount of these weapons exceeded the announced one. Menshikov failed to answer the question whether this means that there are military bases with chemical weapons which were not announced officially and if by now the number of the chemical weapons has been brought in correspondence with the announced number. Menshikov specially stressed that destruction of chemical weapons in accordance with the signed convention is an important step but "not a sufficient one." In his words, in order "to put an end to the possibility of chemical war and its threat" it is necessary to make public all data about the production, storage, testing, and destruction of chemical weapons in the past and to thoroughly investigate and, if necessary, to decontaminate the regions where it was stored. In the adverse case, Menshikov believes, the effects of chemical weapons earlier dumped on the territory of this nation and in the nearby seas will still be felt for some decades to come.
