FR940720-2-00047 FR940720-2-00037 [Docket No. 9071] Service Corporation International; Prohibited Trade Practices and Affirmative Corrective Actions AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Modifying Order. SUMMARY: This order reopens the proceeding and modifies the Commission's 1976 consent order by deleting the administrative provisions that required the respondent to distribute a copy of the 1976 order to its funeral homes and affected employees; provide prior notice to the Commission of certain changes in its corporate organization; and periodically notify the Commission regarding the acquisition or sale of any funeral homes. The Commission concluded that these provisions were no longer warranted or were essentially duplicative of requirements in provisions in more recent Commission orders against the respondent and therefore, warranted reopening and modifying the order. DATES: Consent Order issued October 12, 1976. Modifying Order issued May 12, 1994. 1 1 Copies of the Modifying Order and Commissioner Azcuenaga and Starek's statements are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, H&hyph;130, 6th & Pa.
