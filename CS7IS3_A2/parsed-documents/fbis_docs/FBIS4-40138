Serhiy Nikulin, chairman of the commission on state-building, legality, and law and order, noted that they had reached a new level of mutual relations as a result of the third round of talks. "The Ukrainian Supreme Council's full understanding of what is occurring has been observed. Ukraine has agreed to the proposal to set up an informational and legal base and admits the possibility of developing relations on a constitutional and a treaty basis," Nikulin stressed. A new group was set up for talks, and its powers were stipulated. The issue of the activity of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in reorganizing Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry into the main internal affairs directorate of Crimea was also discussed. The presidium's resolution notes that "the reorganization of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry does not facilitate the stabilization of the situation on the peninsula" and that mutual relations between Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry and the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry have become somewhat more complicated. Financing is being carried out in accordance with a new system. Funds for maintaining the militia come from the main internal affairs directorate of Crimea under Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, and not from Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry. It was decided to inform Ukraine's Supreme Council of the impermissibility of the actions of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry, and also to examine the issue of the Crimean government allocating funds for maintaining the Republic's militia. In connection with this, Mykhaylo Bakharyev, a member of the presidium, noted that "hooligans with general's shoulder boards spit at their own Ukrainian laws. Therefore, we should state this in the form of an ultimatum and not hold talks until they fulfill our demands." It was proposed that the old excise duties that Yuriy Meshkov had introduced be restored, in order to make it possible to remove tension from the budget, to find funds to repay the debt to Ukraine, which amounts to 761.8 billion karbovantsi, and to finance the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry.
