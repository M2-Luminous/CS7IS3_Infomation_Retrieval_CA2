The operations were used as a pretext to implement this conspiracy against fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it, especially after Jordan's recent position toward the blockade of the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its continuing participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting of the blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the martyrdom operations on the occupation government. AL-'AHD: It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and Muhammad Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do you have on this? Al-Liddawi: We do not say that the Jordanian Government withdrew their passports. But after the news conference that King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli threats to Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned Ghawshah and Nazzal to explain developments and the government's position on them. After listening to the two, the minister asked their permission to keep their passports with him. AL-'AHD: Many observers expect relations between Hamas and the Jordanian regime to become tense. Al-Liddawi: We do not expect such a thing. Our relations with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite what happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic countries, especially those where we have an information, political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened. The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last. [passage omitted] AL-'AHD: Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks ago that Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets. What is your comment on this? Al-Liddawi: That's what I and brother Muhammad Nazzal read in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened the Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. AL-'AHD: Does this mean that the target of these operations will be the settlements built in the territories occupied in 1967 or the ones throughout Palestine? Al-Liddawi: This question should be put to the Martyr 'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied Palestine because all the planning, preparation, and implementation of all the military operations is carried out in the occupied territories. AL-'AHD: How do you envisage the relations between Hamas and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the Palestinian police force into these two areas? Al-Liddawi: We yearn to maintain good relations with all the sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys support in the occupied territories and any fighting between Hamas and Fatah would trigger the fire of civil war in Palestine. We must avoid this as far as we can. Any struggle between the two inside the occupied territories would be bloody and destructive to our people. [passage omitted]
