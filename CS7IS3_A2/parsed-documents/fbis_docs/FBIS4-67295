According to the chief of the narcotics cell, DCP [Deputy Commissioner of Police] Rahul Sur, Mandrax tablets and methaqualone powder each weighing 100 kg and collectively valued at Rs 20 lakhs were seized from the factory along with a Maruti car. The factory, masquerading as Ambala Organic Chemicals Pvt Ltd in an industrial estate in Kadhi, Mehsana district, Gujarat, was spread over 10,000 sq feet and had five boilers 12-feet high. It is believed to have been in operation for the past nine months.
