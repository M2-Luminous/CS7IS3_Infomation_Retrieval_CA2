Militant Chinese pro-democracy activists said they do not expect "sharp repression" by the authorities as their movement gains more members and the government shows "restraint" in its reaction. Christopher, whose visit here was aimed at obtaining a guarantee for "substantial progress" in China's human rights record, left Monday without securing any change in Beijing's position that categorically opposes interference in what it considers a "private" matter. Dissident Yang Zhou, 50, who is spokesman for the Chinese Human Rights Association based in the eastern city of Shanghai, has said that "no country on its own could put pressure on China" to change. "China continues to resist external pressures while within the communist party there is a conservative current that wants to reassert its power," Yang said in a telephone interview. "If (U.S. President Bill) Clinton increases pressure, the democracy movement could suffer further." University professor Xu Liangying, 73, who was one of seven intellectuals to sign an "open letter" to Chinese authorities demanding greater democracy, is resolutely opposed to foreign pressure on China. "I am Chinese and I don't like foreigners putting pressure on my country," he said. However, Xu rejects the official Chinese view that economic development must precede any improvement in individual freedoms. "A little more than 200 years ago, France and the United States adopted measures in favor of human rights when their economic state was well below that of China today." Ding Zilin, a 57-year-old academic who has also added her signature to the letter, welcomed "all the support that foreigners could bring to the democracy movement." She added however that "improvements in China's human rights cannot be achieved overnight." Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 democracy movement that was crushed at Beijing's Tiananmen Square when troops opened fire on demonstrators, said: "human rights in China cannot be accomplished by the Americans or Europeans, only by Chinese themselves." The leading dissident returned to the capital Wednesday after several days of "forced vacation" in the countryside. Before and during Christopher's visit, some 15 well-known dissidents were detained by police with three of them still behind bars. Yang has been questioned four times since the beginning of the month, but says he believes that "the police have changed their attitude towards dissidents in Shanghai and carry out their work without brutality," showing "that the government is now more careful in treating the democracy movement." "The movement comprises many more persons than before and from all walks of life," Yang said. "We can speak out publicly to demand the freedom of arrested dissidents. I myself was able to express my criticisms to the police who questioned me, which would have been unthinkable a few years ago." Three open letters on democracy have been sent to the Chinese leadership in the space of a week, and some observers say it is the biggest act of defiance launched since the 1989 demonstrations. "At the time, the concept of democracy was a little too abstract. Now the movement is closer to reality, with more concrete objectives," Yang said. "We have passed from a clandestine stage to a public stage while trying to proceed in a legal way." Wang Dan agrees with the description of the movement's evolution, but adds that "with the progress of economic reforms, calls in favor of political reform will multiply." Ding says that "what is happening today is the continuation of 1989." Her 17-year-old son was killed when troops opened fire on students at Tiananmen Square. "Before I wasn't involved in politics. It was the death of my son that woke me up. I don't want the same thing to happen to other young Chinese and that is why I wrote that open letter with the other intellectuals."
