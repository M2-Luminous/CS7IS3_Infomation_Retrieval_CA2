The grand imam welcomed cooperation with the brother Copts and the pope, and his eminence the mufti was enthusiastic about the idea and expressed his readiness to participate. What is the starting point? AL-'ARABI has interviewed political figures and representatives from different national groups in order to form a common view on a starting point for this or any practical proposals to consider. [passage omitted] Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood, expressed support for Pope Shanudah's call and al-Azhar's favorable response to this call. He said that the agreement of the shaykh of al-Azhar and the pope on this issue is a good thing and reason for satisfaction. He called upon them to pursue this issue and continue to pressure the Egyptian Government and the Arab governments not to ignore the Jerusalem issue. One practical measure would be continuous public pressure on the government in order not to overlook this issue. While the status of Jerusalem is a matter for governments to deal with, this does not mean that the people should not get involved. Our role can be divided into two parts: The first is to collect donations to maintain the Islamic holy places in that city. The donations should go to a publicly trustworthy body. As for regaining Jerusalem itself, the major part of this task is the responsibility of the Arab and Islamic governments. We, as peoples, must exert maximum pressure through processions, seminars, conferences, and any other means to restore this city, which is dear to us all. Al-Hudaybi stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood welcomes this call and is prepared to attend any al-Azhar-sponsored conference in which the national church and political forces will join in discussing practical ways to regain Jerusalem. He added that the real significance of the pope's call and al-Azhar's favorable response lies in the fact that it confirms beyond any doubt the absence of so-called sectarian strife in Egypt, and that the violence taking place now is not directed against the Copts alone; its victims are both Muslims and Copts.
