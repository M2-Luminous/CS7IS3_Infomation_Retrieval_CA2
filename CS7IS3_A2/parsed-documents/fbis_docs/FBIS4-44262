The party presidium in Bonn specifically welcomed the statement of SPD top candidate Reinhard Hoeppner to run for the office of minister-president. The SPD federal presidium said the SPD would now discuss a joint policy program with Alliance 90/Greens as soon as possible. There would be no coalition talks with the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] was "invited to meet its political responsibility and support a government formed by Reinhard Hoeppner," the SPD Presidium said in Bonn. [passage omitted] Hoeppner said in Bonn he would resume talks with the parties represented in the Landtag on the support of a government led by the SPD. Earlier today, he had said: "For me there are only two government models -- either a grand coalition with the CDU under the leadership of the SPD, or a red-green minority government tolerated by the CDU." At the same time, the SPD top candidate had stressed that he would also let himself be elected minister-president with the votes of the PDS, which will in the future be the third strongest force in the Landtag. In the evening, Hoeppner answered a relevant question [on a coalition with the PDS] in the negative. [passage omitted] Chairman Roland Claus of the Saxony-Anhalt PDS said on 27 June that his party would not vote for Hoeppner as minister-president if he [Hoeppner] intended to form a grand coalition. However, Claus called upon the SPD to hold talks with the PDS. It was the PDS' goal to prevent a CDU government, Claus said. Alliance 90/Greens intend to support Hoeppner's candidacy. Heidrun Heidecke, the top candidate of the ecological party, said that with Hoeppner as minister-president, there were several conceivable variants of forming a government.
