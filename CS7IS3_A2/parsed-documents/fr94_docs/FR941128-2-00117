The transaction was to have been consummated on November 23, 1994. The transaction is intended to alleviate the congestion on N&W's own route between Fort Wayne and Chicago, IL, by giving it an immediate, alternative routing. The trackage rights are temporary and are to be used in connection with a line between Tolleston, IL, and Warsaw that N&W previously purchased from Conrail. N&W will purchase the Warsaw-Fort Wayne line from Conrail on or before January 10, 1996. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected under Norfolk and Western Ry.

If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to reopen will not stay the exemption's effectiveness.
