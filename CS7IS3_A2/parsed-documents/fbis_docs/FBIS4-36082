Enemy aircraft meanwhile continued their psychological warfare against the citizens of the south. Helicopters overflew Iqlim al- Tuffah and al-Nabatiyah this afternoon.

In another development, the citizen Jum'ah Shihadah al-Khalid died this morning when a fragmentation bomb detonated inside a grove in the al-Shawakir areas south of Tyre where he was tilling the land. His body was transferred to Tyre's Jabal 'Amil Hospital. It is noteworthy that the al-Shawakir area is close to al-Rashidiyah camp, which was formerly the target of repeated Israeli artillery attacks. The citizens appealed to the concerned officials to comb the area to make sure there are no more unexploded shells. Timor Goksel, the official spokesman for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, announced that a soldier serving with the Fijian contingent died today of injuries sustained during a clash with Hizballah last Friday.
