This is the main conclusion reached during the talks in Moscow this evening between Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian State Duma, and members of the Yugoslav Assembly delegation led by Radoman Bozovic, speaker of the Chamber of Citizens. The delegation arrived in Moscow today at the invitation of the Russian parliament. This is the first official visit of the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation to a foreign country -- at the invitation of partners -- since the introduction of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav delegation includes: Borisav Jovic, Milan Komnenic, Milan Gajovic and Milan Rochen, Yugoslav charge d'affaires in Moscow. The talks focused on parliamentary cooperation, the situation in the two countries and in former Yugoslavia, as well as on possibilities for ending the conflict and abolishing the sanctions. In a statement for Yugoslav reporters after the meeting, Ivan Rybkin said the sanctions against Yugoslavia are unacceptable -- this being his personal opinion and the opinion of the majority of Russian deputies. In his words it is first necessary to secure peace and this is the order of things which must be respected. Rybkin said that the conflict must be resolved in a peaceful way and that many international factors are involved in this process. In his statement for the journalists Radoman Bozovic said that the Russian State Duma is the place where the essence of the Yugoslav crisis and the pointlessness of the sanctions are best understood. He added that only a just peace can be permanent and stable. He is convinced that the sanctions are not only pointless but also that they fail to help resolve the crisis in Yugoslavia -- they are harmful and suit the advocates of war. We were pleased to hear, Bozovic said, that all deputies' groups share this opinion and that they have influence on the Russian Government and the international public concerning the sanctions, which are punishing a nation and encouraging those who favor continuing the war. The Yugoslav parliamentary delegation, which will spend several days in Moscow, will resume talks with Russian officials tomorrow.
