This issue will be discussed during a meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] early next week. Ajello said the only information he possesses is that government forces say they have not received orders to go to confinement centers. Only 19.6 percent of troops from the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] have been confined so far. Only 14,557 weapons from both forces have been collected so far. Meanwhile, militia and irregular forces are now being disarmed throughout the country. The process began in Maputo where 345 weapons have already been collected. Regarding the confinement process, Aldo Ajello feels the main problem is a lack of discipline on the part of the soldiers who do not want to obey local officials and can only receive orders from the central organs. As a result, salary problems are not resolved and there are logistical problems in confinement centers. On the training of the new armed forces, Ajello said Italy has given the $500,000 necessary to repair training centers. The 540 military instructors, recently trained in Zimbabwe, returned to the country yesterday. They are presently at the Dondo Military Training Center which has already been repaired. It is expected that before the end of January, 2,500 men from the government and an equal number from Renamo will be selected to form the first infantry battalions of the new Mozambican army. The two sides are studying the possibility of soldiers choosing to join the new army to go directly to training centers from their barracks and bases, without passing through confinement centers. Ajello also revealed that a project is under study to increase from six months to 18 or 24 months the granting of salaries to the soldiers that are going to be demobilized. This project will only be possible with the assistance of the international community.
