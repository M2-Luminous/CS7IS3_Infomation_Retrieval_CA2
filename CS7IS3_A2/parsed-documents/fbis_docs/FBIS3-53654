Mr. Zvili told our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that it makes no sense for the Labor Party to stop the political process in order to hold a referendum. According to Zvili no discussion on this issue has been held in Labor, and no decision on this issue was adopted by the party or government. The only basis for holding such a referendum is the coalition agreement with SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. Ministers Hayim Ramon and Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer also expressed reservations about the idea. Minister Ramon said that elections are preferable. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer says a referendum opens the door for a new system which could undermine democracy. According to Ben- Eli'ezer the government was elected for a period of four years after declaring its intentions. There is no need for a referendum, because the public might react emotionally rather than logically. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud, Meretz, Tzomet, and Darawshah's Arab Democratic Party announced they oppose a referendum on the Golan Heights. Our correspondent notes that a Knesset decision is required for holding a referendum, and so far it looks as though such a decision is not assured of a majority.
