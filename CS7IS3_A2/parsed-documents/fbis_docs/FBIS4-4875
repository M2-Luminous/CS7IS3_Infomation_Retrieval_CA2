Villa] [Text] Speaker Jose de Venecia unveiled P [Philippine pesos] 29. 7 billion worth of public works and private sector infrastuctural and development projects in ceremonies in Baguio City yesterday. Most of the projects were being financed with long-term Japan loans with counterpart allotments approved by Malacanang [presidential office] and Congress, De Venecia said before Rotarians from Bulacan, Nueva Ecija Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Quirino, and Cagayan. The projects include the P1.2-billion highway between Rosario and Pugo Marcos to Baguio City and the P536-million road from Naguillan to Burgos, La Union, to the Pines City. With the speaker in surveying the Northern Luzon projects were Representatives Rolando Andaya head of the House appropriations committee; Representative Bernardo Vergara of Baguio City, who helped package the rebuilding program from La Union to the summer capital for President Ramos; and Secretary Gregorio Vigilar of public works and highways. At the former Camp John Hay gathering, De Venecia said Taiwan's Tuntex Group has allocated P25 billion to redevelop the tourist city within the former United States military resort complex. The Shoemart group led by Henry Sy has decided to build a P3-billion five star hotel with a shopping megamall in the old Pines Hotel location. De Venecia and Vergara announced a P100-million flyover system between the city and La Trinidad, Benguet, to decongest the metropolis and create new satellite settlement areas. De Venecia addressed the 75th anniversary of the Rotary International District (3770) convention. The district is headed by its president, Mar Tupaz. The speaker challenged the Rotarians to harness their resources in participating in the government's agro-industrialization program through the build-operate-transfer law.
