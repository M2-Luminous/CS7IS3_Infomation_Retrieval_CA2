FR940324-1-00030 FR940324-1-00008 Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested FIP revision is not approvable for the following reasons. 1. The 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon is not a meaningful limit. It is merely an average VOC content of lacquers that are used. 2. The ``other'' category is not specifically defined and, as a result, it is not possible to verify how much ``other'' material is used. 3. The recordkeeping requirements are inadequate for the operating restrictions that are being requested. Neither the monthly usage of ``as applied'' coating nor the monthly use of ``other'' material is specifically required. These deficiencies were discussed with a representative of Service Plastics, Inc. on April 1, 1992. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment For the reasons stated above, USEPA is proposing to disapprove Service Plastics, Inc.'s request for a FIP revision in the form of operating restrictions on the amount of lacquer, thinners, and other VOC-containing materials used. Public comment is solicited on Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested revision and on USEPA proposed rulemaking action. Additionally, if requested, USEPA will provide an opportunity for a public hearing on this proposal. All comments received by the close of the public comment period will be considered in the development of the USEPA final rule. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. This action involves only one source, Service Plastics, Inc. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this RACT promulgation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Furthermore, as explained in this notice, the request does not meet the requirements of the Act and USEPA cannot approve the request. Under Executive Order 12866 today's action is not significant. It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.
