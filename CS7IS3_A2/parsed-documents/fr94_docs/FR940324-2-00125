FR940324-2-00125 FR940324-2-00070 [Docket No. 72&hyph;3 (50&hyph;261)] Carolina Power and Light Co.; Issuance of Amendment Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2502 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 10 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2502 held by the Carolina Power and Light Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the H.B. Robinson Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), located on the H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant Unit 2 site, Darlington County, South Carolina. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance. The amendment deletes the requirement to inspect the interior of the Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) at the ISFSI located at the H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit 2 site, as requested by the licensee by letter dated November 1, 1993. Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.56, the Commission has determined that the granting of the amendment is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. The amendment complies with the standards of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the exemption and license amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration and does not present a genuine issue as to whether the health and safety of the public will be significantly affected. The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance of the amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) Amendment No. 10 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2502, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated March 17, 1994, and (3) the request for amendment dated November 1, 1993. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and at the Local Public Document Room at the Nuclear Information Depository, Hartsville Memorial Library, 220 N. Fifth Street, Hartsville, South Carolina 29550. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 17th day of March 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Charles J. Haughney, Chief, Storage and Transport Systems Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
