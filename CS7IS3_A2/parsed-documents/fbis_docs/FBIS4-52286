In a full transcript obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, the 48-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate told Congressman Bill Richardson, "they tried to pressure me to leave the country with ways no self- respecting government should employ." Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for more than four years since July 1989, added, "there was no such move to have a dialogue with me. They only wanted to talk about the terms of my departure from the country." Richardson had pressed hard for the meeting when he met Myanmar's political and military strongman Khin Nyunt in Yangon [Rangoon] in August. During the three-hour interview, Richardson said, "I want you to know that in my meeting this morning with Khin Nyunt, I pushed for the unconditional release of you and all political prisoners. I also pushed for a transition to democracy." He added, "I plan to ask the SLORC to release political prisoners to me. I want to give them a chance to leave Burma with me if they so choose." Suu Kyi, however, firmly insisted that political dissidents should stay put in Myanmar. "The only thing I have refused is to discuss leaving the country," she said. "I am needed here. Moreover, the principle of trying to drive someone out of their own country is totally unacceptable." She also said, "please keep making demands on the (ruling) SLORC. International pressure does have an effect." On four years of her house arrest, Suu Kyi said, "I do not recognize the legitimacy of the law under which I'm being held -- it is totally unjust." She recounted that when she was first put under house arrest, she was not allowed to even offer food to monks, a deed expected of devout Buddhists. But, she said, "isolation is not difficult for me. Maybe it's because of my Buddhist upbringing. I have books to read and a radio to listen to." She sticks to a rigid routine, waking up just before dawn to meditate, exercise and do household chores, and goes to bed before 10 P.M. She keeps in touch with the outside world mainly through the BBC and has read hundreds of books and biographies on politics, philosophy, religion and international affairs. Regarding her financial situation she said, "I get part of the royalties from my book. They come in foreign currency, which I can change into foreign exchange certificates," she said. THE NEW YORK TIMES has earlier reported the main points of the interview because its reporter was allowed to accompany Richardson.
