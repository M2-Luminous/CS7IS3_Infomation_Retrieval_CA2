FR940324-2-00008 FR940324-2-00003 Comment 4 Peninsula et al. argue that the Department's methodology was erroneous because the sample was not representative. They point out that Peninsula and Fang, in a December 23, 1991 letter to the Department, argued that the pool of respondents was not homogeneous, and displayed clear biases related to company size. Peninsula et al. state that the Department presumed that it was dealing with a homogenous universe of potential respondents. They present a chart which shows quantity, value, and average per unit value for each of the firms in the pool, which, they argue, shows that there is an inverse correlation between volume of sales and unit price. They claim that the selected firms were predominantly large-size, low-unit-value firms, and the results for these big firms are being applied to the smaller, higher-unit-value firms. Peninsula et al. cite the Department's January 6, 1992 memorandum, in which we noted that the Korean respondents were theoretically correct in their argument that the sampling methodology was biased towards small firms, although the potential bias was minimal. Department's Position: Because of the way our sample was structured, firms with the largest volumes were more likely to be chosen. We assigned one point for every 0.5 percent of total sales volume within the sample, then randomly drew numbers, corresponding to the assigned points. Firms with less than 0.5 percent of total sales volume were assigned one point. As larger firms had more points assigned to them, they were more likely to be chosen. However, the theoretical statistical bias was actually in favor of the selection of the smallest firms, because there were five firms with less than 0.5 percent of sales volume, all of whom received one point. None of these low volume firms were selected for the sample, so this theoretical bias had no practical effect. We chose our sampling methodology because it was both representative and efficient. When we issued our proposed sampling methodology and invited interested parties to comment thereon, we asked that the parties focus on methodology rather than the decision to sample. In their submissions, NKSA, as well as Fang and Peninsula, objected to sampling, but did not suggest an alternative to the sampling methodology we proposed. Where, as here, the sampling methodology is legally adequate and the results have not been shown to be unrepresentative, the CIT has upheld the sampling of representative firms. In Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. U.S., the CIT upheld the Department's sampling of respondent firms in a less than fair value investigation, noting that ``the sampling methodology was legally adequate and the results of the sampling have not been shown to be unrepresentative.'' (704 F. Supp. 1114, 1122 (1989).) We also disagree that sales price should be used as the basis of stratification, as Peninsula et al. now suggest. Whether a company's price to the United States is high or low is not in itself indicative of the existence or level of dumping. Rather, dumping is measured by a comparison of U.S. prices to the home market or third country prices, or to constructed value. A company that sells at higher prices than a second company could have a higher margin of dumping, depending on the FMVs of the two companies. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to group respondents on the basis of price, or a surrogate for price, as Peninsula et al. suggest. Comment 5 Peninsula et al. argue that given the technical deficiencies in the sampling protocol, the Department should have allowed respondents who were not selected to participate voluntarily, without such firms' results going into the sample-rate calculation. They argue that Peninsula and Fang, in their December 23, 1991 letter, suggested that respondents not selected as questionnaire recipients be able to participate voluntarily without the rates for such firms being incorporated in the sample rate. Department's Position: We disagree. Every MMF sweater manufacturer/exporter in Hong Kong had ample opportunity to request that it be reviewed during the anniversary month of the antidumping duty order, should it have wanted its own rate. Peninsula and Fang, as well as other companies in the sample pool, chose not to request a review of their sales.
