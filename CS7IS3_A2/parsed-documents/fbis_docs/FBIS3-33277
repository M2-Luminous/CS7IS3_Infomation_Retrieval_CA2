[Begin de Leon recording] This unfortunate incident has happened because of the state workers' irresponsibility. Instead of meeting with the economic cabinet at the Finance Ministry and talking to try to find a creative solution, they want an unrealistic solution by demanding salary raises. It is their fault. There are only two ways of meeting their demands. One would be to start operating the little machine and print unsupported currency. Such an action would be irresponsible because, by meeting the demands of a minority, 100,000 or 150,000 public employees, the economy of 10 million Guatemalans would be jeopardized. This I cannot and should not do. The other solution would be to transfer investment resources from other sources. For the first time we will invest 28 percent of the investment budget in drinking water systems, health, and education. Diverting money from the health and education sectors to raise salaries would be an irresponsible decision. I could not, should not, and will not do this. Instead of playing around with the Guatemalan people's lives -- there is already one victim, and one human life is worth as much as 10, 20, 100, or 1,000 lives -- they should be seated and talk as representatives of Guatemalan state workers are doing today. I understand that a meeting is in progress and a general assembly will be held tomorrow to continue these talks. I regret deeply that their position has already cost a person her life. By looking after their particular interests only, they are violating the Guatemalan people's rights. Of course, I have issued instructions to conduct an investigation and ordered the Attorney General's Office to take drastic measures against these persons, who are responsible as individuals and as members of the institutions. They must be punished according to the law. We are dealing with human lives. As president of the Republic, I must act accordingly, regardless of whether it is only one life or more and no matter to which social level this person belonged. She was a Guatemalan woman who lost her life because she was neglected, because the workers only looked after their own private interests, workers whose duty it was to look after her. These workers are being paid a salary to attend to the population. This is an outrage, which falls in the category of crime. [end recording]
