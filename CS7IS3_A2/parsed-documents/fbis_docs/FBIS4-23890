Heavy fighting has resumed, and small arms fire can be heard in the streets of the Rwandan capital. The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels are currently aiming for the administrative district of the city. They already hold part of the capital, and they are resuming the offensive to control the whole country. This is how we will protect the Tutsis: we do not need France, they repeat, even threatening France. This is what Jacques Bihozagara, RPF spokesman in Brussels, had to say to Anne-Marie Mouradian: [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] The RPF agreed to humanitarian intervention, but we do not want a mission which is imposed upon us. For a long time, we have been opposed to a French presence among the blue helmets. We now see that France has decided on war. As you know, there was a Security Council resolution that defined the framework for intervention by the international community. Now France wants to go in alone, or with its friends or its acolytes. France is currently mobilizing African countries, in particular French-speaking countries, some of which are not all that independent from France. We consider French intervention as an act of provocation, and therefore we will meet it with the appropriate means. [Mouradian] By armed force? [Bihozagara] Yes, of course. We are quite ready for a trial of strength, and, as I said, we are prepared to make use of all the means at our disposal. If we must all die, then we will die, but I think France will also have to pay a heavy price. [end recording]
