The article says: South Korea is subordinate to the United States politically. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul indicates the orientation of internal and external policies to the puppet government, watches and controls their execution, holding the right of political domination over South Korea. The flunkeyist nature of the South Korean puppet regime without independence today is well illustrated by the fact that it is running headlong along the road of confrontation and war as a shock brigade in the nuclear row of its master to destroy the fellow countrymen. After the North-South agreement and the joint declaration on denuclearisation were adopted and effectuated, the United States forced the puppets to "shelve" their implementation, crying over the "nuclear issue" of the North. Yielding to the pressure, the puppets broke up all the dialogues and exchanges which had been held from the period of the preceding "regimes", raising the "nuclear issue" of the North as a precondition for dialogue, and are now leaving the destiny of the nation to outside forces, entreating the master for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen. The United States does all thing as it pleases from working out scinarios for framing up a "regime" and replacing it to choosing the "president" and changing him in South Korea. It was the United States that made Kim Yong-sam, a political charlatan, "civilian president". South Korea is totally dependent on the United States militarily, too. The U.S. Forces commander in South Korea, holding the prerogative of supreme and operational command of the puppet army and the U.S. Forces, uses them for a military lever against the DPRK and other countries in Asia. South Korea is thoroughly subjugated to the U.S. imperialists economically. The U.S. imperialists hold a full ideological and cultural "control" on South Korea. The U.S. economic domination over South Korea is maintained by "economic aid", various "treaties" and "agreements", predatory machines and investments of U.S. monopoly capital. By the early 1980s the United States had robbed South Korea of 120 billion dollars, or ten times the total "aid" granted to it. Through the "agreement on the transfer of finance and properties", the "agreement on economic and technical aid" and other "economic agreements" signed with the South Korean puppets, the United States took over the right to freely possess properties interested and appendages including movables and immovables in South Korea and seized unlimitted rights to infiltraoe U.S. monopoly capital into South Korea and engage in commerce, industry, banking and other profit-making activities. It takes a hand in the shaping of economic policy and drafting of the bugdet of the puppet government and supervises and controls their execution through the "U.S. International Development Agency" in South Korea. Through the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. International Communication Agency, the U.S. "cultural centres" and "information centres" in South Korea and "agreements" on ideological and cultural relations concluded with the puppets, the United States controls education, the press, culture and art and religion of South Korea for ideological and cultural backing to the colonial enslavement policy toward South Korea. It is a shame to the century and an intolerable stain on the era that there still remains a colony like South Korea on the earth when the 20th century is coming to an end.
