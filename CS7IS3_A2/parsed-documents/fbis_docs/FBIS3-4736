But, South Korea is witnessing a vigorous struggle of the farmers who suffered a crop failure due to flood and drought last year and are now deprived of their means of livelihood due to the Kim Yong- sam group's opening of the rice market. South Korea's agriculture is in a serious crisis due to the anti- popular agricultural policy of the authorities. Last year South Korea was hit by the worst crop failure in ten years. According to data released by the "Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries," the output of rice was 606,000 tons less than the previous year. In South Korea, which was once called a bread basket, the self- sufficiency rate of grain is on a steady decrease with a crop failure every year. The rate was 80.5 percent in 1970, and it dropped to 2 percent after 1981. Meanwhile, the amount of annually imported grain jumped to 12 million tons from 5.05 million tons in the 1980-1992 period. The ever-worsening crisis in agriculture and food forces an increasing number of farmers to leave the countryside. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique declared the treacherous rice market opening in December last year. When it is put into practice, the amount of imported grain of South Korea will grow to 15 million tons sooner or later and the self-sufficiency rate of grain will drop below ten percent. Two to three million more farmers will leave the countryside, the devastation of the rural areas will be precipitated and the socio-economic conditions of the working people as a whole will go from bad to worse.
