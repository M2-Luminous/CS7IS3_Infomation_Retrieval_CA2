FR941004-2-00009 FR941004-2-00005 [A&hyph;533&hyph;811] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From India AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sue Strumbel, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1442. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the ``Act''). The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 14148) the following events have occurred. On April 14, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( see ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;689). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b)(1994), antidumping duty questionnaires were presented to two Indian producers which account for over 60 percent of all Indian exports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings to the United States during the POI. These companies are Karmen Steels of India (Karmen) and Sivanandha Pipe Fittings Limited (Sivanandha). The petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination on June 30, 1994. The request was granted by the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). Scope of the Investigation The products covered by these investigations are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished form fittings based on other methods of fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (``POI'') is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994 for Sivanandha and August 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994 for Karmen. Although we originally established the same POI for both companies, Karmen was not able to provide foreign market values (FMV) for sales during that period because it had no home market or third country sales and its U.S. sale(s) involved merchandise which had not yet been produced. Therefore, in accordance with section 353.42(b)(1) of our regulations, we extended Karmen's POI by one month in order to capture sales of merchandise that had been produced. Product Comparisons For Sivanandha, we first compared merchandise identical in all respects. If no identical merchandise was sold, we compared the most similar merchandise, as determined by the model-matching criteria contained in Appendix V of the questionnaire (``Appendix V'') (on file in room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce (``Public File'')). For the U.S. sales compared to sales of similar merchandise, we made an adjustment, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.57, for physical differences in merchandise.
