Several thousand citizens of Knin spontaneously rallied in the square in front of the railway station in the Krajina capital this morning. The rally was addressed by members of the Citizens' Protest committee and representatives of other citizens' and youth organizations. "Our freedom is being threatened, world powers wish to transform us into a camp," this is only one of the messages that were voiced at this rally. The attitude of the citizens of Krajina is best reflected in placards carried by young citizens of Knin: "We cannot give up western Slavonia," "Protection yes, occupation no," "UNPROFOR, go to the Croatian border." Similar messages were voiced at other rallies in Krajina, in Vojnic, Benkovac, and other towns where strong support was voiced for Milan Martic, the president of the republic of Serb Krajina, to defend Krajina's sovereignty in talks with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi today.
