The show of military might in the troubled Bessarabian boondocks has given way to raids against enemy rear. The current Moldovan parliamentary election campaign has been marked by lightning strikes against the political reputation of a number of rulers of the unrecognized Dniester Moldavian Republic. The authorities' reaction was not long in coming... [Chelnokov] Aleksandr Ivanovich, how come that you, whom the Dniester people see primarily as the man who stopped the bloody war in Bendery 18 months ago, are now being accused by the authorities of the Dniester Moldavian Republic of virtually attempting a coup d'etat? [Lebed] Organizing coups d'etat, the charge they are leveling at me, is not my style. I am worried about the living conditions and the fate of the 25,000 14th Army servicemen and members of their families living in the Dniester region. The stores here are empty, prices in the food markets are astronomical, there are no medicines, and teachers are leaving. There is complete collapse and chaos. I call the government of the Dniester Moldavian Republic criminal -- that is why the local press sometimes calls me the "black general." [Chelnokov] The economic situation everywhere in the CIS right now is, to put it mildly, not in the best shape. The reasons for that, as a rule, are certainly not of a criminal nature.... [Lebed] The Dniester region is of tremendous interest to the Russian military-industrial complex. There are several unique defense enterprises here. I know that First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets would like to invest resources in this production, but the reputation of the local leaders as thieves is an obstacle. When these people get credits they shout for joy, plug a few holes in the budget, but put half the money in their own pockets. A bunch of adventurists has come to power in the Dniester Moldavian Republic by exploiting people's natural desire for freedom. [Chelnokov] In Russia it has long been the fashion to talk about mythical suitcases packed full of sensational documents allegedly attesting to the corruption of officials. Are you not afraid of finding yourself in the same tricky position as many Moscow setters of that fashion? [Lebed] I have sent a number of documents corroborating my accusations to the Dniester region's ministries of internal affairs and state security. What was the result? The rejected documents rebound against those who brought them. I sent a stack of compromising materials to the Russian law enforcement agencies -- the Military Prosecutor's Office, the General Prosecutor's Office, the Security Ministry, and counterintelligence. I do not know where it has all gone... It is a vicious circle. [Chelnokov] In that case what is the point of your revelations? To prompt the Dniester region's people to civil disobedience? [Lebed] I am calling for a civilized way out of the impasse in which the Dniester people find themselves. People must know that the hierarchy of the Dniester Moldavian Republic is politically compromised by participation in the October events in Moscow. On the instructions of President Smirnov there were between 70 and 110 people from the Dniester region in the White House on that day, according to various sources of information. As a consequence, Defense Minister Grachev phoned me 14 October and authorized me to notify this "criminal government" that all ties with them would be broken off. [Chelnokov] So in your opinion the only obstacle to the settlement of the Moldovan conflict is the leadership of the Dniester Moldavian Republic? [Lebed] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur is not fated to be a peacemaker either. A single phrase which he used on television when there were killings and robberies taking place in Bendery -- "Everything is fine, the constitutional process is being restored" -- turned him into a political corpse. Only the simultaneous replacement of the authorities in Chisinau and Tiraspol will make it possible to break the deadlock in the peace process and set a precedent for involving the Russian economy in the Dniester region. Snegur is now being most comprehensively wiped out. Moldovan speaker Lucinschi is gradually destroying him in all spheres. In the near future -- after the parliamentary elections -- Lucinschi will replace Snegur, you mark my words. [Chelnokov] Is the 14th Army prepared for a change in the political situation in Moldova? [Lebed] A certain military-political balance of forces has now been established in this region. The armed forces of Moldova and the Dniester region are semi-guerrilla, semi-militia gangs. It is no great difficulty to set one off against the other. The 14th Army, which represents the only real military force, is playing the part of the notorious sword of Damocles here and is thus maintaining relative stability. [Chelnokov] You have written a book called "The Spectacle Called a Putsch" ["Spektakl po imeni putch"] and the various events in which you have taken part are often called theater or circus. What is your role in this? [Lebed] I am a player-coach. This is an enforced role dictated by Central Committee practice which still persists. Ever since Sumgait in 1988 I have not received a single written order, it is all done by phone. "Fly down there. Things are not going well. Establish order," and that is all. For example, I went to Tbilisi with three regiments -- in 140 military transport planes. Imagine the job that we had: to get dozens of planes from different cities, form them into an airborne armada, fly down there, and then, when Gorbachev expressed surprise, we had to pretend: The devil only knows how they got down there.... Nothing has changed since that time.
