Despite all the complexities of the present reality, both states are actually working to create the backbone of the future Eurasian Union of CIS countries. It is this that largely accounts for President Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative of transforming the Commonwealth into such a fundamentally new association of like-minded countries, which he advanced at the end of last month during his official visit to the Russian Federation. An ITAR-TASS correspondent met with the minister and asked him to describe in an exclusive interview how this idea matured. "Our idea is the result of an impartial analysis of the state of the two states' economies," the minister said. "They virtually constitute a single whole. Therefore they are not subject to disintegration, although in reent years certain `hotheads' have committed quite a few follies here, with the result that we are all having to pay a high price for confusion and unprofessionalism. "For example, how will the power workers of the Urals and West Siberia work stably without Kazakhstani coal, if they are almost totally dependent on deliveries of it? Or Russian metalworkers, to whom our republic used to dispatch more than 8 million tonnes of iron ore and iron-ore concentrates and pellets every year? "There has recently been an ever greater number of complaints about paralysis in our passenger motor transport and housing construction. Just about everyone is blamed for this. In actual fact, however, the primary causes lie elsewhere. The republic is almost 100-percent dependent on deliveries of buses and timber from the Russian Federation. Until we have secured the reinstatement of this flow, people will continue to stand in line at bus stops for hours on end, and new buildings will stand for months without floors, doors, or window frames." [Akimov] But it will not be easy to reinstate the disrupted ties in their former volume, not to mention deepening and broadening them. Last year alone commodity turnover between our countries fell by a factor of more than four. Do you really believe that in this situation it is possible to speak of any start of integration processes? [Urkumbayev] They are already taking place. Forms and methods of mutually acceptable cooperation were identified at conferences of representatives of ministries, departments, and administrations of contiguous oblasts held under the auspices of our governments during 1992-1993, as well as in talks on a purely regional level. Including with the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Bashkortostan, Buryatia, and the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhniy Novgorod. It is now a question of ensuring that the agreements reached start to work in full. For this it is necessary to remove the last remaining obstacles. The chief stumbling block here has been the failure of payments to pass not only between individual enterprises but even between banks. This has now reached astronomic figures and runs to trillions of rubles. The lack of joint structures directly engaged in coordinating Kazakhstani-Russian economic ties and eliminating the misunderstandings that arise in their implementation also acts as a big brake. As a result of talks between our countries' presidents our countries' corresponding departments have, together with the state banks, already begun unraveling the tight tangle of contradictions occasioned by mutual debts. I believe that this work will be completed over the next six to eight weeks, along with the current preparation of proposals for simplifying mutual payment-clearing relations between business subjects, which have been complicated by the introduction of national currencies in our countries. Consequently, in June it is quite possible to expect the completion of the first, most difficult, stage in the normalization of Kazakhstani-Russian trade and economic cooperation. The second stage is connected with the creation of conditions for the free movement of goods, services, and capital. Here, too, everything seems to be starting to move. The groundwork has already been done for the formation of a single customs area. Compared with last year, Kazakhstan has already reduced the list of quota-regulated output by a factor of six, and Russia by a factor of more than seven. At the same time customs export duties on many types of products have been substantially reduced or even totally removed by mutual agreement between the sides. There will then follow the complete lifting of customs duties, taxes, dues, and other tariff and nontariff restrictions in mutual trade and a switch to a unified trade policy with regard to third countries. All this, in conjunction with the standardization of trade and economic legislation, is to serve as the basis for rapprochement in other spheres of Kazakhstani-Russian ties, including management structures, and lead ultimately to a union of the two countries of which Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke in Moscow. It is this union in turn, being a kind of guarantor of fair and honest partnership, that must become the backbone of the Eurasian Union.
