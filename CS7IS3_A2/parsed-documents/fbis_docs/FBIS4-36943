In a report published today, AL-JUMHURIYAH quoted Kurdish citizens as saying that after the two-week bloody battles, the groups of Mas'ud Barzani control the areas of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah. Iranian helicopters participated in these battles in accordance with an agreement Barzani concluded with the so-called Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan and the so-called Hizballah Party Shur Shkanri Kurd [name as transliterated] led by Adham Barzani and Shaykh Muhammad Khalid, son-in-law of Mas'ud Barzani. The newspaper said that in these clashes and liquidation operations 65 people of Talabani's group and 11 armed men of Barzani's group were killed, in addition to the hundreds who were injured on both sides. The heavy fighting in Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah forced citizens to escape the shells that haphazardly fell on their houses. The newspaper added that the so-called Democratic Party of Kurdistan, which controls these two areas, issued a stern warning to fleeing citizens that their houses will be demolished and property confiscated if they do not return to their homes and bow to the orders of his group. AL-JUMHURIYAH said it has information that a few days ago Iranian helicopters raided the area of Qahlajulan, where the headquarters and residence of agent Jalal Talabani are located. These helicopters also raided Banjwin, Qal'at Dizah, and the villages of Banqahlah and Ramaw, which are controlled by Talabani's group. A huge demonstration was staged from Salah-al-Din University a few days ago in which thousands of students participated to protest the crimes of the war of liquidation in which innocent people are victimized by the hate and vengeance of the Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani groups, whose statements show their inability to reach an understanding.
