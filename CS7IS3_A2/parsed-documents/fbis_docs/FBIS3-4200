Much of this drain of state property has taken place as government-owned firms are partially privatised through being converted into shareholding companies. State Council cadres have warned that in their eagerness to attract foreign capital to take over unprofitable state enterprises, regional officials have undervalued state assets. Informed sources said the teams were also investigating allegations of corruption in the many instances in which state assets had been transformed into the personal holdings of the owners of newly formed shareholding companies. The sources said a team of 30 officials was recently dispatched to Guangzhou and Shenzhen to find out why some of the most efficient state factories in the two southern cities had been sold to private-sector entrepreneurs or converted into shareholding units where Hong Kong and overseas companies held large stakes. The officials came from central Government units including the National Administrative Bureau of State-Owned Property, the State Planning Commission and the auditing authorities. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the investigators said the more robust units should stay with the state and not be privatised. Economic sources in Shenzhen said central officials were also concerned about the flow of capital much of it state assets, out of the Special Economic Zone into other provinces. Publicly, the Shenzhen leadership has admitted that four billion yuan worth of capital had left the zone since 1991. The sources said, however, that internal estimates put the drain at more than 20 billion yuan. "Much of the funds that have left Shenzhen have been invested in new enterprises in inland provinces," a source said. "The authorities are worried that in setting up the new companies, state asset have been transformed into private holdings." [passage omitted]
