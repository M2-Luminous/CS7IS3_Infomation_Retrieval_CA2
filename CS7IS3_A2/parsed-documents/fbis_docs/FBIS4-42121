Evert and Papoulias discussed the developments in Albania and Evert's upcoming visit to Romania, which will take place next Tuesday. Foreign Minister Papoulias described such meetings as helpful and said that he plans to invite the other political party leaders to briefings on the situation prevailing in Albania and other national developments. Replying to a question regarding a statement Evert made yesterday that there will be a collision between Greece and Albania if the persecution of the Greek minority continues, Papoulias said that there will be a conflict situation at the political and diplomatic levels. Papoulias also said that he will contact the UN secretary general today and send a letter to the U.S. secretary of state. In addition, Greece will appeal to the CSCE and Papoulias will have contacts with Mr. van der Stoul [CSCE commissioner on minority rights], who will be coming to Greece in the next few days. The Greek Government, Papoulias added, will ask for the support of our partners in the European Union [EU]. Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry general secretary, today briefed the 11 ambassadors of EU countries and the ambassadors of Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. Finally, the New Democracy chairman said that for the time being it is not considered necessary to hold a party leaders conference under the chairmanship of the president. Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that Greece is handling the problems with Albania, with which our country desires improved relations, with self-restraint and determination. However, without respect for the Greek minority's rights, Venizelos stressed, there can be no progress in that direction. The Albanian Government should take the Greek positions and representations into account. Regarding Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement that if the Albanian provocations continue there will be conflict at the political and diplomatic level, the Government spokesman said that there will be an exchange of political and diplomatic representations because, in our opinion, Albania is violating international law. Venizelos said the Greek Government hopes that all political forces will join together on national issues; the meeting between Papoulias and Evert was a part of that effort.
