Chechen Opposition Starts Talks With Moscow"] [Text] The Chechen Provisional Council has taken on responsibility for talks with Russia. In the opposition's view, since President Dzhokhar Dudayev does not want to establish normal relations with Russia, Moscow will finally have to bring troops into the Republic. In the very near future, a delegation of the Chechen opposition plans to fly to Moscow to hold talks with the Russian Federation Government on "the restoration of Chechnya's normal economic existence," as Umar Avturkhanov, chairman of the Provisional Council, put it to INTERFAX. The opposition bets on Sergey Shakhray, "the Russian Federation minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional polities, who is disposed to close contacts with them;" a precise date of a meeting with him will be known on 10 May. According to Mr. Avturkhanov, the question of Chechnya's sovereignty and its political status should be resolved by the people at a referendum and by the republic's constitutional authorities, elections for which can be held only after the situation returns to normal. The Chechen Provisional Council has not given up the hope that Ruslan Khasbulatov will join the opposition, because he belongs to their side of the barricades. Given that the former Supreme Soviet speaker's popularity in Chechnya is steadily on the rise, if he returns to politics and heads the opposition to Dzhokhar Dudayev, the people will "unequivocally rally around him" so as to start building a new life under his leadership. Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], is also inclined to think that economic talks may become the main means to straighten out relations between Moscow and Groznyy. In his view, this is possible because the talks with Chechnya will be held by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, not Sergey Shakhray. A dialogue with Dzhokhar Dudayev, the FCS director believes, should be held "in a tough manner," with normalization at railways passing through Chechen territory to be a priority matter. However, Mr. Stepashin said in Nalchik at a meeting with parliamentarians and government members of Kabardino-Balkaria, Boris Yeltsin may meet with Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president recognizes that his republic is part of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, not only is Chechnya reluctant to identify itself as a member of the Russian commonwealth, but it is entering the international scene as an independent state. The Chechen Foreign Ministry has stated that it will suspend any ties with Britain until "legality and the rule of law prevail in that country" and will not participate in the CITEX-94 international exhibition. So uncompromising a decision has been prompted by Britain's attempt "to taint the honor and dignity of the Chechen people by accusing them of a vendetta," after it charged relatives of the Utsiyev brothers of murdering Karen Reed in London. According to a Scotland Yard theory, the Utsiyevs arrived in Britain to buy guided missiles so as subsequently to resell them to the Azerbaijani side, and were killed by Armenian terrorists. Having accused foreign secret services of attempts to slander Chechnya, the republic's Foreign Ministry stated: "The secret services appear to have an insufficient knowledge of customs and traditions of the Chechens, for whom the murder of a woman, a child, or an elderly person amounts to a national disgrace."
