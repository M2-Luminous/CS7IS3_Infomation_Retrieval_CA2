The clear message from the Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Wang Fengchao, dashed hopes that legislators representing the existing functional constituencies would survive the disbanding of the legislature at the changeover. Asked if there were a chance for a partial through-train arrangement, Mr Wang said: "There is no such possibility. "According to the decision of the National People's Congress, the last legislature in Hong Kong must be formed in accordance with the Basic Law. "The composition of the Legislative Council should be taken as a whole, including members returned through geographical election, functional constituency election or the Election Committee. "Both the number of legislators in each category and the details of the election method should abide by the provisions in the Basic Law. There is no partial through-train arrangement," he said. Speaking after meeting Mr Wang, Liberal Party chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei quoted the deputy director as saying all 60 seats in the law-making assembly would be up for re-election in 1997. Though it was likely the 21 existing functional constituency seats would remain after 1997, Chinese officials told Mr Lee they must be re-elected. Despite the comments, legislators formally tabled their amendments yesterday to the electoral bill on the functional constituency seats, and the composition of the Election Committee. The United Democrats amendment demands that half of the Legislative Council be directly elected. It also includes the abolition of the Legco seats for the Urban Council, Regional Council and Heung Yee Kuk, to be replaced with three new functional constituencies covering retired people, housewives and students. The four Meeting Point legislators have indicated support. Another vocal supporter of democracy, Emily Lau Wai-hing, put forward an even more ambitious amendment which demanded a 100 per cent directly elected legislature. The Liberal Party has yet to decide whether to table its own amendment or support other similar ones. A group of independent legislators is working on a more conservative proposal which seeks to scale down the number of voters in the functional constituencies. Eric Li Ka-cheung, an independent legislator, has been liaising with several other independent legislators and the Liberal Party to formulate an amendment based on the compromise package proposed by the British side during negotiations with China last year which reduces the number of voters in the functional constituencies from 2.5 million to less than 650,000.
