FR941006-1-00153 FR941006-1-00016 7. Effective Dates The agency is proposing to make any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal become effective 180 days after its publication in the Federal Register . FDA is requesting comments on this effective date. In general, costs of compliance for labeling and other requirements are less if longer compliance periods are provided because firms can incorporate mandatory changes to product, labeling, and packaging with regularly scheduled changes. FDA requests information on the ability of manufacturers of products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit to convert their packaging within the suggested compliance period. C. Regulatory Flexibility The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses when possible. FDA is not aware that any small businesses will be affected by this proposed rule. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that this proposed rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses. FDA requests comments on any potential adverse effect on small businesses. D. Summary FDA has examined the impact of the proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and has determined that it is not an economically significant rule. The rule will result in total costs of approximately $53 million and discounted benefits of between $315 million and $653 million over the next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). FDA has also examined the impact of this proposed rule on small businesses in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. FDA is unaware of any iron-containing products manufactured by small businesses. Therefore, FDA has determined that this rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses. VII. Effective Date The agency is proposing to make any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal became effective 180 days after its publication in the Federal Register .
