FR940705-1-00017 FR940705-1-00007 In addition to the guidance on establishment of control period by area, EPA has issued additional guidance related to the oxygenated gasoline program. On October 20, 1992, EPA announced the availability of oxygenated gasoline credit program guidelines in the Federal Register . 2 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content than is required (i.e. an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight. 2 See note 1. EPA was issued guidelines for credit programs under section 211(m)(5) of the Act. EPA issued labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These labeling regulations were published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992. 3 3 See ``Notice of Final Oxygenated Fuels Labeling Regulations under Section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act as Amended_Notice of Final Rulemaking,'' 57 FR 47769. The labeling regulations may be found at 40 C.F.R. Part 80, section 80.35. II. Background for this Action EPA has determined that the 1988 and 1989 data for the Washington, DC area is invalid because of poor data quality and therefore inadequate to properly characterize the ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). Therefore, EPA used data from 1987 and 1988 to designate the Washington, DC area as a CO nonattainment area with a design value of 11.4 ppm. 4 Under section 211(m) of the Act, the District of Columbia was required to submit a revised SIP under section 110 and part D of title I of the Act which includes an oxygenated gasoline program for the entire District of Columbia by November 15, 1992. 5 4 See ``Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes,'' 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). 5 See credit program guidelines at 3, wherein the November 15, 1992 SIP revision due date was specified. On October 27, 1993, the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs submitted a revision to its SIP for an oxygenated gasoline program. The revision included additions or amendments to 20 District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2. These regulatory revisions were adopted by the District of Columbia on July 16, 1993 and became effective on September 30, 1993. EPA summarizes its analysis of the state submittal below. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) dated February 23, 1994, which is available from the Region III office, listed in the ADDRESSES section.
