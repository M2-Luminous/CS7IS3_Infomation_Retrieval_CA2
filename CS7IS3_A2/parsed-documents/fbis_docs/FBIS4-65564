Otherwise he will lose his grassroots support with incredible speed, and we are ready here to reconstruct the true Italian Social Movement [MSI], with the help, among others, of many of his own men, including all those from the Salo Republic [fascist republic in northern Italy in 1943] and the MSI grassroots groups." Thus spoke Maurizio Boccacci, the 37-year old leader of the Italian extreme right and formations which were disbanded last year through the Mancini law. [Pellegrino] How come? The whole world is clamoring against the risk of a fascist comeback, and you who profess to be fascists are not satisfied? [Boccacci] The question is not whether we are satisfied or not, but rather that no one can join forces with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and be a fascist at the same time. At most, you can be a Freemason -- a full-fledged freemason of the worst kind. Remember that [former Freemason leader] Gelli said of him "he is quite a nice young lad." Since then, the magistrature has rehabilitated the P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge], and Berlusconi has become prime minister. If you put two and two together. We do not want to have anything to do with Freemasons. Let me tell you that I am much more concerned that today, as fascists, we are associated with Berlusconi, than I was concerned when they called us fascists and blamed us for all the evils in the world. [Pellegrino] Let us go back to Fini. [Boccacci] If Fini does not watch his step, if he does not uphold the values of fascism which nourish his broad electoral base, he runs the risk of becoming an empty shell, of losing his most genuine voters, and of having to rely increasingly on the traditionally Christian Democratic voters who have such a good understanding with the P2 members and the Freemasons. Great opportunities will then open up for us to reorganize -- for us who abhor unbridled capitalist liberalism even more than we do communism. [Pellegrino] [MSI member] Pino Rauti started his electoral campaign in the European elections by commemorating Bombacci, the Communist who became a Mussolini supporter and was then executed at Dongo, and who certainly was not a capitalist. [Boccacci] In fact, this is the hub of the question. If Fini pays heed to this kind of demand from the people as he only seems to do when he says that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century, it is one thing. [Pellegrino] Otherwise? [Boccacci] Otherwise a genuine reconstruction of the MSI might take place around Rauti and others like him. [Pellegrino] On what issues, then, will Fini be put to the test? [Boccacci] Broadly speaking, he should be adamant, rather than unconditionally accept Berlusconi's hyperliberalism, and he should relaunch an anti-Zionist policy which is opposed to international big business. I am also thinking in terms of a number of anti-immigration measures, of reclaiming Istria and Dalmatia, of abolishing the Mancino Laws and the Scelba Law, which prohibit the reconstruction of the Fascist Party. This is what the MSI grassroots movement claims and demands. [Pellegrino] So, for the time being, you will remain bystanders. [Boccacci] Not at all. Great opportunities are already opening up for us. Engrossed as he is in his portfolio-hunting and thirst for power, I really do not think that Fini will be capable of displaying the consistency which the grassroots expect from him.
