The impetus to write it was a statement by Ye. T. Gaydar published earlier here that it was possible to save our economy from disintegration only by reducing budget expenditures, in which fat makes up a fourth of them as a minimum. And I wrote that there is much fat in the defense budget, with the principal reasons for its formation being the imperfect practice of developing the defense budget, the absence of open substantiation of expenditures by budget items, and the absence of independent expert examination of the defense budget. All this is the result of a tradition of many years of striving for USSR military superiority at any cost without regard for expenditures. Those shortcomings can be eliminated by developing and implementing a rational system for forming the defense budget. My statement was supported by Professor V. I. Tsymbal, who published the article "Just What Is Happening With the Defense Budget?" on 18 November 1993. The need for developing a system for forming the defense budget also is supported by the content of an article by Yu. A. Ivanov published in SEGODNYA on 19 January 1994. No practical actions to improve development of the defense budget followed after the above articles were published. Realizing that Gaydar and his immediate assistants might not have noticed my article in the fever of the election campaign, I sent a personal letter to Yegor Timurovich through the reception administration of the Russian Federation president and government (Incoming 201967/A13-1 of 4 Nov 93), in which I proposed a number of specific measures for developing and implementing a system for forming the defense budget. Unfortunately, this letter did not reach the addressee, inasmuch as Ye. P. Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian Federation government apparat, limited himself to sending off copies of the letter and article to the ministries of Finance, Economy, and Defense with the request to examine them and give the author an answer. (A. S. Mishin was the executor). There was no request in Arefyev's letter to inform Gaydar of results of the examination. The ministries of Economy and of Defense did not react in any way to this letter, but the Ministry of Finance sent an invitation for an interview on this matter to Tsymbal, B. M. Bashuk, a representative of the International Conversion Fund, and myself. S. S. Kondrashov, who received us, explained that there was no fat of any kind in the defense budget. To the contrary, the Ministry of Defense has a catastrophic shortage of funds. The existing practice of forming the defense budget according to established norms fully suits the Ministry of Finance, and so it categorically objects to the monitoring of draft defense budgets by independent experts and to removing the security classification from materials substantiating the defense budget. All our proposals for developing a rational defense budget were declined. An official Ministry of Finance response has not been received to the aforementioned letter from the Russian Federation government apparat up to the present time. But after repeated reminders and almost two months after the meeting with him, Kondrashov announced that a response had been prepared which stated that the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense will not be able to perform the functions of client of the topic of developing a system for forming the defense budget. That response can attest only to the fact that the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense is not interested in efficient expenditure of funds being allocated for defense, which make up over 18 percent of Russia's budget. Major General (Reserve) S. S. Kondrashov was in charge of financial matters in the Ministry of Defense for many long years, and in our discussion essentially defended the interests not of the Ministry of Finance, but of conservative circles of the military department. The reaction to my letter by associates of the Russian Federation government apparat and of the Ministry of Finance indicates that some of them did not hold the same views as Gaydar and B. G. Fedorov or were not interested in lowering budget expenditures. This example shows what an important role Russian Federation government bureaucrats continue to play in making and implementing important decisions. The CPSU was stripped of power in 1991 and the Soviets basically were dismissed from power in 1993, but the power of the bureaucrats has not weakened--it has strengthened. In the given instance they do not wish to allow monitoring of formation of the defense budget by independent experts and consequently the taxpayers. Under the existing conditions I deem it necessary to publish my version of the plan of action for removing fat from the defense budget. I deem the following steps advisable for a substantial improvement in efficiency of expending funds from the defense budget: 1. State Duma committees for Defense and also for Budget and Taxes should make an offer to the Russian Federation government to develop a package of documents on regulating the process of developing the defense budget. Democratic factions of the Duma could act as initiators of this proposal. Based on the proposal of State Duma committees, the Russian Federation government should charge the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy with carrying out the functions of client for the scientific topic of developing a system for forming the defense budget, and also finance the topic. 2. The topic client is to choose a head executor, which must be a nongovernment organization. 3. Within a month's time, the head executor of the topic is to develop, submit to the client and coordinate with him the following: - draft list of documents necessary for normal functioning of the system of forming the defense budget; - plan and estimate of development of documents for the system of forming the defense budget and other work on the topic; - list of organizations and establishments which are advisable to involve in developing the system of forming the defense budget. 4. Draft documents of the system of forming the defense budget, developed within time periods prescribed by the plan, should be sent through the head executor to all departments and organizations participating in developing the defense budget and developing documents on the system of forming the defense budget. 5. Within the time established by the plan, hold a scientific conference with involvement of all interested organizations, at which discuss draft documents on the system of forming the defense budget. 6. Based on results of discussion at the scientific conference, appropriate developers are to modify documents on the system of forming the defense budget and submit them through the head developer for approval to the client and to the State Duma. 7. To evaluate the efficiency of the system of forming the defense budget in the course of fulfilling the topic, perform calculations for a number of items to substantiate expenditures for them for fiscal year 1994 and compare them with expenditures envisaged for the defense budget for this year. 8. In the State Duma consider the question of establishing a defense budget subcommittee made up of the Committee for Defense or Committee for Budget and Taxes. 9. The Ministry of Defense [and] Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service, with involvement of the head executor of the aforementioned topic, are to prepare proposals to correct the Russian Federation Law on State Secrets of 17 June 1993 (No 5485-1), providing an opportunity for publishing defense budget documents in the mass media, for familiarization of independent experts with them, and for submission of information on Russia's annual military expenditures to the United Nations. The United States of America is rich and well armed also because it learned to spend funds for defense very efficiently. Russia will not become rich until we learn to do this.
