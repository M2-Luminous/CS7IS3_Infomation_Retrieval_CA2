FR941220-0-00088 FR941220-0-00014 The Final Rule applying to all LCA-filing employers includes a 90-workday placement option within a three-year period, beginning with the first work day at any worksite in a new area of intended employment, for an employer who shifts H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to any worksite(s) outside the location listed on the employer's already-certified LCA. The 90-day option would apply separately for each area of intended employment ( e.g., 90 cumulative days for Los Angeles, 90 cumulative days for San Francisco). Under this option, an employer may place H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at such worksite(s)_without filing a new LCA (and thus without meeting the notice, prevailing wage, and actual wage requirements for such area of intended employment)_provided that: 1. No H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant continues to work at a worksite in such area beyond 90 cumulative workdays by H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at all worksites within the area (starting with the first day on which any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant worked at any worksite in the area) and makes no further placement of such worker(s) in such area within the three-year period which began with the first day of placement, and 2. The H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) working in the area is (are) compensated at the required wage rate applicable under the employer's already-certified LCA plus expenses for the placement area of employment at no less than the per diem rate for such area and transportation reimbursement for Federal Government employees as published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 41 CFR part 301 (the Department has used the regulations promulgated by the General Services Administration for Federal employees, as we are unaware of any other universally available source of this information for employers), and 3. Does not place an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at a worksite where there is a strike or lockout in the same occupational classification as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. Of course at any time an employer may file a new LCA covering the new area of intended employment (complying with all LCA requirements, including determination of actual and prevailing wage rates as well as notice to employees). This can be done in advance of the placement or, if such new LCA is filed and certified after placement, the employer can cease payment of per diem and transportation rates. If, at the accumulation of 90 workdays, the employer has H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at any worksite(s) in the new area of intended employment, the employer must have filed and received approval of a new LCA and complied with all requirements for such filing. This 90-workday placement option does not apply to the placement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at any worksite(s) within an area covered by an already-certified LCA filed by the employer. Such worksite(s) would be encompassed within and fully subject to the requirements of that LCA, including prevailing wage and worksite notice(s) (see Â§c.1.b Notification, above, regarding notification at new worksites). The only additional action required of the employer in this circumstance is to post the notice for a period of 10 days at the new worksite.
