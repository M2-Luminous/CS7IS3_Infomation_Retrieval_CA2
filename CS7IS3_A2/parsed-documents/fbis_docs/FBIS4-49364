To the workers at St. Louis, Fort Worth and Boston, where major export items like F-15, F-18 aircraft, F-16 fighters and Patriot missiles are made, closing plants is the least they want from President Clinton. Controlling 57 percent of the global weapons market, the U.S. sold 35 billion U.S. dollars of weapons last year to the world's volatile regions, 10 times greater than Russia and more than 100 times greater than China. "The real scandal at the heart of American foreign policy is that the U.S., the world's leading democracy, has become the world's number one arms dealer," said William Hartung, author of "And Weapons for All". U.S. officials point to the commercial interests in such deals: weapon sales volume in 1993 is about one third of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit during the period, some 150,000 jobs will be lost if arms sales are reduced. A recent study by the New York-based World Policy Institute, however, finds that the preoccupation with the economics of arms trade is one-sided. Arms exports provide "marginal, short-term" gains for the economy. Over the past 10 years, total U.S. arms exports averaged 19 billion dollars a year. During the same time, government loans, grants, cash payments and other subsidies averaged over six billion dollars a year. This figure includes the costs of security assistance programs that support arms exports, U.S. Government involvement in air and trade shows, the 20,000 U.S. Government personnel involved in arms exports and the costs of writing off bad foreign military sales loans. "This seriously undercuts the net gains to the U.S. economy from foreign military sales," the study says. In fiscal 1994, arms export-related subsidies accounted for 43 percent of the entire U.S. foreign aid budget. Once the impacts of arms sales in stimulating arms race and undermining the economic growth in developing countries are taken into account, arms sales may even be a net drain on the U.S. economy, observers say. The International Monetary Fund, in a study released last month, says that if the world arms expenditure is cut by one fifth, the world's consumer market will be 190 billion dollars larger, which is about four times the revenue of global arms market. On defense-related employment, a Congressional Budget Office study in 1992 estimates that a substantial cut in U.S. arms sales to the Middle East will affect less than two percent of all defense workers and less than one in every thousand workers across the country. This is hardly a figure to cause serious damage to the overall economic growth of the U.S., especially when only five states -- Texas, California, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts -- suffer the bulk of defense conversion, observers say. However, despite of the promise to curtail world arms trade, the Clinton administration and congress have repeatedly passed up the moral, political and even economic concerns that such trade may raise, observers say. The Commerce Department has taken a hands-on role in promoting arms exports even as the State Department has opposed an industry proposal to create a new one billion dollars guarantee fund for weapons exports. Although a few deals have been scaled back or withdrawn under the threat of congressional action, the vast majority of 50 to 100 major arms deals made by the U.S. each year sail through congress with little or no scrutiny. "If last year is any indication, America's arms sales addiction is alive and well," said William Hartung. "A change in policy is possible, but it's not going to happen unless the public and congress demand it, loudly and clearly."
