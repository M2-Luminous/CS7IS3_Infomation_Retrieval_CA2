At 1030 this morning, 31 members of the caravan, including the Reverend Lucius Walker, arrived in Santiago de Cuba. Their arrival was welcomed in this way [cheers heard in background] and it couldn't have been any different. For the first time, caravan members are visiting several provinces. According to the Rev. Walker, the group had to be divided. He said that everyone wanted to visit Santiago de Cuba. [Begin Walker recording, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] We had a little revolution among us, and of course we won; therefore, it is our privilege to be here with you. [end recording] Speaking on behalf of Cuba, Politburo member Esteban Lazo Hernandez said: [Begin Lazo recording] We embrace you wholeheartedly and greet you on behalf of all the people of Santiago de Cuba. [end recording] Jose Marti's mausoleum was the first place they visited, but the historical heritage and a cemetery like this have prompted a longer visit. They also toured several parts of the city: Antonio Maceo Revolution Square, then Cespedes Park. A group of citizens who were aware of their visit was waiting for them. [cheers and shouts] At the municipal government building, Mayor (Luis Estruch) welcomed Walker, who received the city's coat of arms on behalf of the group. In the afternoon, the Siboney minifarm and the 26 de Julio school were included in their agenda. This caravan will be in Santiago de Cuba until next Wednesday. For a province with so many things to show, the agenda is rather tight and cannot be extended because of the tiring trip. Members of the caravan said, however, that they had rested sufficiently on the first day to continue.
