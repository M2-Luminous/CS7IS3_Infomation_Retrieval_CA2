On the morning of 12 January, the provincial party committee and the provincial government held a work conference in Shenyang to make overall arrangements for this reform. Yu Junbo, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the organizational department of the provincial party committee, presided over the conference. Wen Shizhen, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of the province, set forth the guiding ideology, principles, tasks, methods, and steps for the reform of the public servants system and the wage system on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government. Wen Shizhen pointed out that the next step of the reform of party and government organizations at the provincial, city, and county levels is devoted to firmly implementing the various programs approved by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. In line with the demands of the central authorities and with the stipulations of the provincial plan on organizational reform, the number of party and government organizations at the provincial level should be reduced from 90 to 65, with their functionaries reduced by about 1,800 persons, or a reduction of 22.6 percent; the number of party and government organizations at the city level should be reduced from 74 on an average to 52 for each city, with functionaries reduced by 24,000 persons, or a reduction of 24.8 percent; and the number of party and government organizations at the county level should be reduced from 53.5 on an average to about 28 for each county, with the functionaries reduced by 5,700 persons, or a reduction of 21.5 percent. The reform of institutions should be carried out in line with respective characteristics according to the forms of removal, incorporation, transfer, and [words indistinct]. Efforts should be made to reduce by 10 to 20 percent the number of the staff of institutions that live off state revenues. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to basically complete the reform of party and government organizations at the city level within two years. With regard to the implementation of the public servants system, Wen Shizhen said, "It should take about two years to basically set up the public servants system throughout the province, while carrying out the reform of party and government organizations and the reform of the wage system in order to bring the personnel management of government at all levels into a new operational mechanism and in order to gradually perfect the management of government personnel." The provincial government organizations will implement the public servants system by three stages and in groups. In the first half of this year, they will complete the installation of positions. By the end of this year, they will complete the transition of existing personnel to public servants and use a new personnel management operational mechanism. By the first half of next year, most cities in the province will set up their public servants system. The wage system reform of party and government organizations, as well as institutions, should be carried out in line with the demand of building the socialist market economic system and with the principles of distribution according to work and linking work remunerations with practical contributions in order to overcome egalitarianism. At the same time, these organizations and institutions should gradually set up their wage system with their own characteristics and set up a normal wage increase system to help form and develop a classified management system and a effective incentive system. Wen Shizhen demanded that in carrying out the reform of the wage system, we should seize the key points, clearly understand and master the stipulations of policies, and be meticulous in organizing implementation in order to basically complete the implementation task for the wage system reform of party and government organizations and institutions in the first half of this year. Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the conference. He stressed, "In line with the demand of the market economy, we should vigorously seize the key point -- changing functions -- in carrying out the reform of labor, employment, and distribution systems." He said that changing the functions of government is the key point of the organizational reform. If the government refuses to change its functions and continues to use its original management modes and forms, it will be unable to bring the relations between the various sectors into better balance, to reduce the number of organizations and staff, and to improve administrative efficiency. Wang Huaiyuan pointed out that the simultaneous reform of labor, employment, and distribution systems will cause grave difficulties and great influence and thus it is a major event having a bearing on the overall political and economic situation of the province. He demanded that all levels of party committees and governments should strengthen organization and leadership, make overall arrangements and plans, and be meticulous in organization so that they can carry out reform in a positive and sound manner.
