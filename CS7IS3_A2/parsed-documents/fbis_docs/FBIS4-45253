FBIS4-45253 "jptdd025__l94005" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 30 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Quiroga Asserts Article in Coca Industrialization Decree Quiroga Asserts Article in Coca Industrialization Decree `Not Ambiguous' PY3005220694 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 30 May 94 PY3005220694 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] According to Minister of Government German Quiroga, coca growers are using the industrialization of the coca leaf as a pretext for freely marketing this product, in many cases with illegal purposes. The coca growers reject the [industrialization] decree because it not only restricts the industrialization of coca leaf in traditional zones--that is in the Yungas zone in La Paz--but also because Article No. 2 states ambiguously that coca leaf is penalized in Bolivia. Minister Quiroga asserts that the article is not ambiguous. [Begin Quiroga recording] Coca leaf is penalized by Law No. 1008. [end recording] According to Law No. 1008 the production of coca leaf is penalized. According to Article No. 8 of this law, there are three regions: The Yungas zone in La Paz is the traditional production zone; the Chapare zone in Cochabamba is the transition surplus production zone; and the illegal production zone entails the whole of Bolivian territory with the exception of the two aforementioned zones. [Begin Quiroga recording] There are coca growers who want to be completely free to transport it from one place to another, to transfer it under the pretext of industrializing it. I told the coca growers that if we are successful with the regulation for industrialization in the Yungas zone, and if we run short of raw materials, then we would take the next step, and immediately authorize its industrialization in Chapare. But they do not accept this, they want everything. [end recording] The coca growers have announced pressure measures if the government does not modify the decree after the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] congress. The government has asserted that there is nothing to modify, as this legal tool is the result of consensus and coinciding points of view.
