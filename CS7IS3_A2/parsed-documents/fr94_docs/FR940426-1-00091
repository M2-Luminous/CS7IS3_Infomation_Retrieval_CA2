FR940426-1-00091 FR940426-1-00008 The auto manufacturers proffered their FLEV proposal to the OTC, which determined that it would not achieve the same level of emission control as the California LEV program. In reaching this conclusion, the OTC emphasized a number of points in its response to comments document. First, under the proposal the FLEV standards would apply two model years later than the OTC&hyph;LEV standards, and would not be fully implemented until two years thereafter. Second, the level of NMOG emissions under the FLEV proposal would be considerably higher than under the OTC&hyph;LEV program. Third, according to the OTC, projections using EPA's MOBILE5 emissions model indicate that in the year 2020, emissions of hydrocarbons under the OTC&hyph;LEV program will be about 30 percent lower than they would be under the FLEV program, due largely to the portion of the fleet under the OTC&hyph;LEV program consisting of cars meeting ULEV and ZEV standards. In sum, the OTC calculates that its LEV program would provide 21 tons per day of VOC reductions and 38 tons per day of NO X reductions in the OTR beyond the FLEV proposal. 22 Fourth, the OTC notes that under the FLEV proposal, the FLEV standards would apply for new car certification, but, until model year 2004, in-use standards would be the same as the federal Tier I standards. This, according to the OTC, may reduce the emissions reductions that would otherwise be predicted from the FLEV program. Fifth, the OTC notes that, since the FLEV proposal is premised on the withdrawal of the now-adopted LEV programs in New York and Massachusetts, as many as eight or nine years of emissions reductions from those programs would be lost under the FLEV proposal. 22 This calculation assumed: (1) ``Maximum'' I/M for under both programs; (2) Federal reformulated gasoline; (3) earlier introduction of the LEV program. It is unclear whether the calculation assumed the ZEV sales mandate under the OTC&hyph;LEV program. In addition, the OTC points out additional benefits of the OTC&hyph;LEV program over the FLEV proposal. These include the expected increase in use of alternative fuels under the OTC&hyph;LEV program, which will reduce dependence on foreign oil and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as the benefits of forcing advanced technology, particularly associated with cars meeting ULEV and ZEV standards. Certain technologies, such as electrically heated catalysts and hydrocarbon traps would apparently not be needed to meet FLEV standards, nor would electric car technology. Also, the OTC believes that technologies such as adoptive transient learning controls, dual oxygen sensors, improved fuel atomization and auxiliary air would not be used commonly for FLEV vehicles. Further, the OTC believes its LEV program would force advances in battery technologies, and potential initiatives such as hydrogen fuel cells and fly wheels. (Of course, to the extent a ZEV sales mandate is not part of the OTC LEV program, ZEV technologies may not be advanced.) EPA seeks comment on the emission control and other benefits of the FLEV program, particularly in comparison to the OTC&hyph;LEV program. In addition, the OTC expressed concerns regarding the enforceability of the FLEV proposal. EPA is likewise concerned about whether such a program could be adopted and enforced. As noted above, it is likely that EPA could not alter Tier 1 standards prior to model year 2004, and therefore could not impose the FLEV standards before that time. Even beginning in model year 2004, EPA adoption of standards comparable to the FLEV standards would have to be supported under the criteria set out in section 202(i) of the Act. As the OTC pointed out, States also cannot adopt or enforce the FLEV standards, because they cannot adopt any new motor vehicle standards (other than the California standards) under the preemption provisions of section 209 of the Act. Section 209(a) prohibits States from adopting or attempting to enforce ``any standard relating to the control of emissions'' from new motor vehicles and also prohibits States from requiring any approval relating to emissions as a condition precedent to initial retail sale, titling, or registration of new vehicles.'' To establish the legal framework for implementing the FLEV program, the manufacturers have relied on the section 302(k) definition of ``emission standard'' (i.e. ``a requirement established by the State or the Administrator''). They argue that the consent decree arrangement does not involve an ``emission standard'' since the standards would not be ``established'' by the State or the Administrator. The applicability of the section 302(k) definition to section 209(a), however, is not clear, since section 209(a) does not use the term ``emission standard'' but rather uses the perhaps broader language ``any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.'' EPA requests comment on whether using the consent decree mechanism to establish the FLEV proposal would adequately avoid a conflict with section 209 and allow States to enforce the FLEV program. The consent decree mechanism raises a set of legal concerns. One such concern is whether all the OTC States could become parties to the consent decree. The auto manufacturers suggest that the OTC States could intervene in the New York or Massachusetts litigation under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They contend that the OTC States' October 29, 1991 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that each State in the OTC would take steps to implement California's LEV program as soon as possible constitutes adequate grounds for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Other concerns are raised regarding the role of the court in a consent decree. The consent decree mechanism would require that the court determine that a decree is an appropriate commitment of the court's limited resources. Under the FLEV proposal, the district court overseeing the consent decree would presumably directly enforce the FLEV standards sua sponte or at the behest of parties to the decree. (The penalties for noncompliance are not clear.) EPA is concerned that supervision of the FLEV program could require substantial resources from the court. Finally, it is not clear how enforcement would work if any auto manufacturers refused to sign the consent decree. EPA requests comment on each of these issues, particularly whether the consent decree mechanism is sufficient for enforcement and on whether the OTC States could intervene in the litigation under section 24(b) to be able to enforce the decree.
