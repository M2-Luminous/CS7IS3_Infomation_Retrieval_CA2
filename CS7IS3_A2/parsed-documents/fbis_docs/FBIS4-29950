The cabinet-level directors meeting agreed to handle the employment issue, which is a common concern of advanced nations from both a macroeconomic policy and structural policy. Structural unemployment cannot be resolved merely by relying on the stimulation of demand based on macroeconomic policies; and a change in the structural situation leading to the creation of jobs by attempting to resolve the problem by structural policies, in disregard of macro policies, cannot be expected. There is significance in the cabinet-level directors statement that emphasizes the synergistic effects of these two policies. The cabinet-level directors meeting confirmed the launching of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 1995 and discussed, from the standpoint of advanced nations, the framework for the next bilateral trade negotiations to include trade and the environment, trade and labor standards, and trade and investment. The meeting also resulted in an agreement to support the membership of South Korea and former East European nations and to intensify affiliations with nations of other spheres such as China and Russia. A regrettable aspect was that Japanese cabinet members were not present for this valuable international economic conference. It might have been permissible to limit attendance to bureaucrats if we were speaking of a common international conference, but since not a single cabinet member attended the cabinet-level conference, we probably cannot say that we were in attendance at the gathering. In comparison with other advanced nations who dispatched several principal economic cabinet members, we must say that Japan's presence was hardly noticeable. This is not an issue of pure formality on the question of whether or not a nation should attend a conference. The problem here is that the situation is reflective of Japan's posture concerning global economic systems. Japan has always been criticized for its passive posture. The recent OECD cabinet-level directors meeting included a request that Japan expand its domestic demand and reduce its current account surpluses. Japan always exercises concern over the intensity of demands lodged with Japan, but it is Japan's option to expand domestic demand and reduce its surpluses. Recently, Japan has outdone itself with respect to such passive postures and has a tendency of isolating itself. At the Uruguay Round of talks where an agreement was reached on trade systems for the post-Cold War period, Japan was expected to take a leading role as foremost benefitting nation, but once the talks were finished, Japan relegated itself to playing the role of the persecuted. At the employment summit held in the United States which was attended by all of the principal economic cabinet members of the participating nations, Japan was represented by only the labor minister, giving the Japanese delegation an inferiority complex. Then, finally, the OECD cabinet-level directors meeting was held. The post-Cold War global economy is being affected by an upheaval of an unprecedented scale. Nations that were in a developing stage not too long ago have acquired manufacturing capabilities of a level equal to those of advanced nations and have launched an offensive against world markets, taking advantage of low labor rates. That situation underlies the unemployment issue in advanced nations. It is of extreme importance to consider the formulation of a new global economic framework without lapsing into protectionism. The respective nations will no doubt listen to any proposals that Japan might have as a nation with the dual position of a foothold in Asia and as an advanced nation. Japan's absence from the global economic system has been too long. Not only is such a stance contrary to Japan's national interests, but runs the risk of posing an obstacle to the balanced management of the world economy.
