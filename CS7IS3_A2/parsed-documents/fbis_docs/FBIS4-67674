State medical and health services director Dr. Faisal Ibrahim said today that 10 patients who tested positive for cholera and a carrier had been detected since the first case was reported on April 6. The victims, aged between seven months and 70 years, are mostly living in housing areas and were found to have consumed food bought from stalls. The state cholera operations room has been opened to monitor developments. Dr. Faisal said health officers were carrying out preventative activities, especially among food hawkers and handlers in Kangar, Kuala Perlis and Arau since investigations revealed that all the victims had consumed food obtained from sources outside their homes.
