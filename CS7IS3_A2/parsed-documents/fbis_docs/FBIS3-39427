Ministerial Council devoted to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not yet arrived to the E.U., said a E.U. spokesman. Asked at a news conference in Brussels by TANJUG's correspondent whether such a meeting would be held, he replied that the E.U. was prepared to undertake adequate steps so as to meet Athens's wish, but that, at least as regards the official aspect, such a request has not come in yet. Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias announced Tuesday [15 February] his country would demand an urgent meeting of the E.U. Ministerial Council to discuss the Bosnia crisis. Papoulias met in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Feverish diplomatic activity in connection with Bosnia was marked Wednesday in Brussels by a testimony of co-chairman of the conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen behind closed doors in the Foreign Affairs and Security Commission of the European Parliament [EP]. According to well-informed sources, Owen has in an optimistically intoned report stated the hope that everything could end without military escalation. If this was to be done, in his view, it was necessary to withdraw the Serb weapons around Sarajevo, parallel with demilitarization of the city. This would immediately be followed by demilitarization of Mostar, as an introduction to a general peace agreement on Bosnia. This agreement, in his view, would be based possibly only partly on the changed plan of the European Union which envisaged transformation of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a union of states of the three warring peoples -- the Serbs, Muslems and Croats. The Serb and Muslem forces clashed around Sarajevo, while Muslems and Croats clashed around Mostar. According to the same source, Owen warned the international community it must take into consideration the factor Russia, but also warn the Serbs that they could not expect unconditional support from Russia. The European Parliament commission, as its president Baron Crespo told TANJUG, accepted Owen's assessments and proposals as the sole realistic basis to attain peace in Bosnia.
