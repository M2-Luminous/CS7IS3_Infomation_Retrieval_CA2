One of the aims of the Black Sea Fleet sailors' training exercise is to provide instruction for their young reinforcements, with 4,500 conscripts from Ukraine among them. The command of the Black Sea Fleet, in the words of Mykola Savchenko, Ukrainian Navy Press Center head, did not coordinate its actions with respect to this training exercise, either with the Navy commander or the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, which contravenes the accord between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents of 17 June 1993. In particular, it contravenes Article 6, in accordance with which the fleet command was to have notified not only the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the president of Ukraine in advance, but also the leadership of Sevastopol and the Crimea.
