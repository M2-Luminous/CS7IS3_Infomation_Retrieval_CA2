"This war is not for power, it is for principles," said Hekmatyar without elaborating. Mestiri and his staff of seven UN personnel, including Sotirios Mousouris, Coordinator for Afghan Humanitarian Assistance, drove to Hekmatyar's Charasiab headquarters 25 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Kabul to sound out the prime minister's views. The UN convoy, which included local and foreign journalists, was blocked temporarily in Charasiab bazaar by banner-waving civilians calling for peace and the resignation of Hekmatyar's rival, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani. "Rabbani's resignation is a must," read the English language banners and placards, which could be taken as a clear statement of Hekmatyar's first political objective. The armed forces of Rabbani and Hekmatyar have been battling each other most recently since January 1, when Hekmatyar joined the ex-communist militias of warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam in a failed coup attempt to topple Rabbani. "We ask for a government elected by the people and not by means of tanks and artillery," Hekmatyar told Mestiri, who doubtless observed the truck-mounted 122mm (5 inch) multi-barrel rocket launchers and D-30 howitzers as he drove to Charasiab. In south and west Kabul the sound of shelling could be heard before noon Sunday, but in general the special ceasefire declared for the duration of Mestiri's visit to Kabul was respected. Mestiri is expected to meet on Monday with Rabbani's strongman, former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and return to Pakistan Tuesday by a special UN flight from Mas'ud's Bagram airbase 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital. Civilians in Kabul have suffered the brunt of the factional fighting there, and are hopeful of positive results from Mestiri's visit, but it would be unrealistic to expect the UN envoy to conjure up a peace formula acceptable to all sides without further sessions of lengthy negotiations.
