The evacuation operation ran without a hitch. All the Belgian Blue Helmets are safe and sound. According to initial information, the evacuation operation was supposed to be conducted by road, but in the end the Blue Helmets opted for an evacuation by air. The possibility of a land evacuation was apparently a decoy. So, for the Belgian troops the Rwandan episode came to an end with the Tuesday evening, when the last C-130 departed for Brussels. Meanwhile, violent fighting is continuing in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. The Rwandan Armed Forces have launched a counterattack, while the Rwandan Patriotic Front is trying to encircle them. Furthermore, more massacres are occurring in Byumba, in northern Kigali.
