The earlier-set discussion date was Friday, February 4. The amnesty declaration was prompted by the adoption of Russia's Constitution on December 12, 1993. According to the basic law, the right to declare amnesty rests with the Duma, the Lower House of the Federal Assembly, parliament in Russia. Drafted by the Russian President's State Management Department, the decree provides for pardoning certain categories of prisoners, World War Two veterans and women included. No faction has unequivocally supported the decree. Yegor Gaydar, the leader of "Russia's Choice," has suggested in an interview with Interfax that amnesty should be carried out in line with specific penal code clauses rather than categories of prisoners. At a news-conference a week ago, the LDP faction's leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy reiterated his faction's call for freeing all political convicts and those jailed for economic mismanagement as of March 1985. "What Russia's president wants to do at this time is to pardon criminals," he stressed. The faction of communists and agrarians intend to press for the release of all those charged for complicity in the events of August 1991 and October 1993.
