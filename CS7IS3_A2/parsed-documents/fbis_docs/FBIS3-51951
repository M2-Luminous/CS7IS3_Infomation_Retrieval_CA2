At least 15,000 public works employees throughout the country participated in the stoppage to demand payment of salaries and overtime, as well as a reclassification of personnel based on an agreement reached last year. Salvador Acuna, secretary general of the ATMOP [Public Works Ministry Workers Association], said other public works departments will join the stoppage if the demands are not met. [Begin Acuna recording] For the time being we can count on 15,000 employees honoring the stoppage. We can add new workers every day with the new departments that have joined us. The Air Transportation Directorate could join us tomorrow, because we have ATMOP directorate board members there. The same goes for the National Land Transportation Directorate, which will join the stoppage today, and the Maritime Transportation Directorate, which could join on Friday. We do not want to inflict major damage, but our demands must be met or we will continue the stoppage indefinitely. [end recording] We have reports from all over the country that employees of public works' branches in all department capitals will implement the measure to support the demands.
