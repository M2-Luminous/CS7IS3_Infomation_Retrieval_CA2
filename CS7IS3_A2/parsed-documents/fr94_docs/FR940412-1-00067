ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations for the carriage of certain bulk solid materials by adding materials carried under Coast Guard Special Permits issued pursuant to this regulation (Special Permits) and other materials contained in the International Maritime Organization Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMO Bulk Solids Code, or ``BC Code''), including coal, to the list of materials permitted under the regulations. The special handling procedures associated with these materials would also be included in the regulations. The proposed revisions would harmonize U.S. regulations with recommended international practice, and eliminate the need to apply for Special Permits, except for newly classified hazardous materials.
