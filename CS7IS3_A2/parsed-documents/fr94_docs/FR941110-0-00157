FR941110-0-00157 FR941110-0-00016 •It is unclear whether mailing time is included in the 90 days and whether an appeal stops the action; and •It is unclear whether there is notice to the public regarding the remedy at the 90th day. Response: Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act stipulate that the Secretary or the State, respectively, must impose a denial of payment for new admissions if the facility is not in compliance 3 months after the date that the facility was noncompliant, regardless of the requirement that is deficient. In answer to the commenter who raised the issue of substantial compliance, we are revising §488.412(c) to require a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last day of the survey. Therefore, if a facility is in substantial compliance, it would not be subject to the mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy, or the denial of payment remedy would be lifted if it had already been imposed. Substantial compliance is discussed in detail earlier in this preamble. The fact that physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than others is an example of facility noncompliance which may not be wholly corrected after the completion of the 6-month continuation of payment period, but which could be considered substantial compliance if corrective action had progressed in accordance with the approved corrective action plan and timetable. With respect to the other points raised by the commenters, §488.330(e) (3) and (4) specify that a facility may appeal the certification of noncompliance leading to the denial of payment remedy; §488.330, paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) specify that, except for civil money penalties, a pending appeal will not stop the action. Mailing time is included within the 3 months because the 3 months constitutes a statutory limit. There are neither statutory nor regulatory public notice requirements with regard to the denial of payment remedy. Comment: A great many individuals and organizations commented upon the requirement at proposed §488.212(b) which specifies that, although deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 are considered deficiencies, remedies or plans of correction are not required as long as corrections are achieved by the 90th day. Commenters' views varied widely as illustrated by the following_ •There should be no deficiency if the scope and severity level is 1; •If no plan of correction is required there is no apparent reason for requiring correction in 90 days; •A follow-up visit should not be required if the scope and severity level is 1; •If deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 are to be treated differently than other deficiencies, then a new term should be used for them, such as findings; •Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should be given to the facility on a separate document and not be disclosable to the public; •Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should receive a plan of correction and be disclosable to the public; •Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should not receive either a plan of correction or a remedy if substantial compliance is achieved; •There is no such thing as an isolated problem. Excusing certain deficiencies as inconsequential sets a disturbing precedent for the health care industry; •All deficiencies must be corrected; •No deficiency should be found unless there is a quality of care issue; •There doesn't appear to be a way for HCFA to track deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 without a follow-up visit; •HCFA should clarify when a citation becomes a ``repeat deficiency.'' Remedies should be imposed in cases of repeated noncompliance only after a facility is found, after three standard surveys, to have furnished substandard care; •A recurrence of a deficiency with a scope and severity level of 1 should be upgraded to a scope and severity level of 2; •The regulation at proposed §488.212(b)(3) should specify continued noncompliance rather than recurrence; •The regulation at proposed §488.212(b)(1) should read ``both the severity level and the scope level are 2'' rather than 1; •The regulation at proposed §488.212(b)(3) should impose a civil monetary penalty and one or more other remedies; •HCFA should provide guidelines regarding what is an acceptable plan of correction; •If a deficiency with a scope and severity level of 1 recurs, HCFA or the State should impose a directed plan of correction or State monitoring; and •The lack of appeal rights on recurring deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 will put the State at risk of increased informal administrative hearings, because of the requirement that remedies be imposed. Response: The issue of deficiencies at a severity and scope level of 1 are discussed under §488.408 of this preamble. We are retaining the definition of deficiency at §488.301. A deficiency is failure to meet a participation requirement. All deficiencies, with the exception of those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, will be displayed on the HCFA&hyph;2567, Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction, and will require a plan of correction to be tracked by the State survey agency. All deficiencies, including those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, will be disclosable to the public. However, these low level deficiencies will not be recorded on the HCFA&hyph;2567 and will not precipitate any enforcement action. We conclude that this approach is reasonable and practical from both the provider's and the consumer's perspective. To react to low level deficiencies with the same degree of concern as to those that are more serious is not rational. We believe that providers and consumers will agree that deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with no more than a potential for minimal harm, and which bear no relationship to poor care or negative resident outcomes should not detract from actionable noncompliance. Comment: Many commenters suggested modifications to the use of the scope and severity scales for selection of remedies at proposed §488.412(c). The following comments and suggestions were made: •Proposed paragraph (c)(3), (now paragraph (b)(3)), should read ``If HCFA or the State determines the existence of substandard care, the State must notify *␣*␣*''; •Expand proposed paragraph (c)(3), to include deficiencies in quality of life, nurse staffing, and resident behavior and facility practices;
