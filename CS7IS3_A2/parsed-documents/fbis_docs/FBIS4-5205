He said the country is economically attractive and full of economic opportunities and that the government has introduced a number of incentives including investment codes and certain tax-free periods to promote foreign investment. Despite its plentiful resources and steady economic growth, the landlocked nation of 17 million people still lags behind for lack of expertise and experience. He specified the agriculture and food processing, textile and garment, hotel and tourism industries, telecommunications, stones and gems, leather industry, mining and hydro energy as the main sectors which are open to Thai businessmen. "Uganda's (economic) performance is outstanding but we could do better with Thai experience and expertise. We would like to invite serious Thai businessmen and manufacturers to invest in our country because of your experience and expertise... The sky is the limit," he said. Uganda was one of the fastest growing African states after its independence from Britain in October 1962. But 10 years later the country plunged into political turmoil with a dictatorial regime and civil war ravaging the country's economy. After the national resistance movement under Yoweri Museveni toppled the dictatorship in 1986, the country embarked on a market-oriented policy. Financial reform, a free-market economy and privatization have helped revive the sagging economy. Since 1991, the average annual growth has stood at 5 per cent and inflation has gone down from 360 per cent to around 3 per cent. About 80 per cent of workers are engaged in agriculture and 96 per cent of the national income comes from coffee production. Kaijuka said Uganda is blessed with a moderate climate and its geographic location in the heart of Africa makes it a good springboard for manufactured goods into other central, eastern and southern African nations. The country, he said, is a member of the 250-million-people Common Market for Eastern, Central and Southern African States (COMESA), which was established last year and includes countries from Ethiopia down to Swaziland. With the expected new membership of South Africa, the COMESA will expand to 300 million people. The trade minister, who stopped in Thailand on his way to Singapore, said his country has adopted a number of incentives including tax-free import of equipment and a tax-free grace period of five years. He said other privileges will be added. The country's currency is also fully convertible and can be exchanged without limit at any time, he said. Kaijuka made a courtesy call on Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan on Tuesday and introduced James Mulwana, who was appointed honorary consul-general of Thailand in Uganda, to the Thai minister. According to Dr Suraphon Siwithe, director of the Foreign Ministry's African Division, two Thai candidates are being proposed by the Industry Association as honorary consul-general of Uganda in Thailand. The names are being submitted to Uganda for final approval and selection. The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1985 and Thailand has assigned its ambassador to Nairobi, Kenya, as envoy to Uganda, while the latter has assigned its high commissioner to New Delhi, India, as ambassador to Thailand.
