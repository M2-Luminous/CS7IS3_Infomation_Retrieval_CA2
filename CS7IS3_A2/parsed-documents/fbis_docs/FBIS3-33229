The Depositors Front has thus requested the urgent intervention of the president for a prompt solution. [Begin Caldera recording] I would like to tell you briefly that the government has not stopped to figure out how much it will cost to solve the Banco Latino problem but how and when can we obtain the funds to solve it. [applause] If the coffers were full and oil receiving a reasonable market price, if we did not have the terrible fiscal deficit, then undoubtedly the government would not have hesitated to assign all the needed funds to solve the problem immediately. There are paths toward a solution, and the most advantageous is the one you have suggested. There is the concerned solidarity of the Legislative Branch, the executive branch, the various public administration organizations, the private sector, and public opinion in general to ensure all paths explored will be truly efficient. We have ruled out the possibility of sensationalist measures that can have an initial impact but will fail to lead to a definitive solution. We agree that we should not consider dissolving the bank, and hopefully it will not come up as an option. [applause] We believe there is a way for the bank to recover, a way for the bank to establish itself once again on healthy, solid, and honest grounds, to be able to save not only the small savings account holders but all depositors who in entrusted their funds to Banco Latino in good faith.
