The new card is in the form of a laminated rectangle and is larger than a credit card. It is made of squared banknote paper overlaid with "security" printing the color of which varies from blue to green when exposed to certain kinds of light. A total of 5,000 cards have already been issued to residents of Hauts-de-Seine since April 1988, when the experiment was begun in Nanterre Prefecture. Issuance of these cards--which was one of the priorities of the Right when it returned to power in 1986--was discontinued by the Socialists after 1988. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua resumed the practice last March, and the residents of Essonne, Moselle, and Mayenne have had identity cards for several weeks. Forty additional departments will be involved this year, and the remainder of the country--including Paris--will follow in 1995. The decree of March 1987 that specified the characteristics of the new card and authorized the creation of a system of computerized manufacture and control took into account the criticism expressed by the National Commission on Computer Science and the Freedoms (CNIL). In particular, the commission ruled out any magnetic scanning that would have made it possible to enter invisible information without the knowledge of the cardholder. Direct access to the system of computerized control was limited by the CNIL to only those services responsible for preparing the cards and for certifying their authenticity, thereby excluding the police and gendarmerie services, who will have access only to the file of cards reported stolen or lost and the file of persons wanted by the law. A Desire to "Start All Over" The commission did, however, authorize fingerprinting--a precaution deemed to be useful in combating usurpations of identity--but only on condition that the fingerprints not be digitized and not be used to create a file. The central computer file will accordingly contain only those data that appear on the card, together with the nature of the civil document that was prepared as a basis for issuing the card. According to Interior Minister Pasqua, the new card represents "a safeguard for the cardholder" and "security for commercial transactions." It is also expected to facilitate identification of persons wanted by the law. To justify making the new card generally available, Pasqua cites the increased incidence of the counterfeiting and forgery of the present paper cards. More than 9,000 such cases were detected in 1992 (out of 3.6 million cards issued) compared to fewer than 6,000 in 1988. He said that no falsification of the new card has been reported in Hauts-de-Seine. The new system is more secure, but it is also more burdensome. "Security is worth a little patience," Pasqua notes. The manufacture of the cards will be centralized at two sites. The first site--at Marne-La-Vallee (Seine-et-Marne Department)--houses the national file for the control of the cards and will be able to produce up to 3 million cards this year; the second site is scheduled to be established in another region of the country. A minimum delay of from eight to 10 days will be necessary between the receipt of a request and the issuance of the card. To prevent fraud, all files will in effect be reviewed by the subprefectures or prefectures, which will give the green light to the production center. In principle, the documents required to establish a card remain unchanged. In order to ensure the security of the data in the computer file, however, the renewal of an old card is treated as a new request and presupposes the same formal procedures. This desire to "start all over" translates into a nuisance for French citizens who were born abroad or both of whose parents were born abroad, of whom a certificate of nationality may be required. Lastly, in order to prevent usurpations of identity, copies of birth certificates (which these criminals have heretofore had sent to them by mail) will be transmitted directly to the prefectures by the municipal governments. The introduction of the new card--and of the computerized files--represents a 400 million franc market for Idmatics, a subsidiary of Thomson-CSF [General Radio Company]. Similar contracts have been signed in the United States, Spain, Peru, and Colombia, and will be signed shortly in Greece. The interior minister is delighted with the French success in this sphere and has made no secret of his new projects: the computerization of drivers' licenses and foreign nationals' residence certificates. The residence certificates could in this way be replaced by "tamper-proof labels" affixed to passports.
