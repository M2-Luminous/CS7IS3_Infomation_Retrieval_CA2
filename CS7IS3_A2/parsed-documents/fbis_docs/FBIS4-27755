We appreciate these invitations, as they have made possible our visit to Vietnam. We have heartfelt impressions of the hospitality and the impeccable welcome extended to our delegation. Our visit was to evaluate the current cooperative situation while sounding out potential areas of cooperation. Now that thousands of Vietnamese can speak German, this is a highly valuable asset needed for our future cooperation. In the relations of development cooperation, we expect that these people will be provided with assistance and favorable conditions so they can surge forward. It is our policy to assist the efforts of developing countries rather than imposing any prototypes, and we wish to see our cooperation coordinate with the cultural and social conditions of each country. The cooperation between our two countries has been reestablished since 1990. The FRG has since reserved some 170 million German marks in aid for Vietnam. In addition, the FRG has made remarkable contributions under the framework of multilaterial cooperation to helping Vietnam. Here I would like to refer to various programs sponsored by EC [European Community], UNDP [United Nations Development Programs], the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank. It can be said that the cooperation between our two countires has been focused on such areas as environmental protection and natural resource protection, and especially the issue of afforestation. Here I would like to refer to the questions of providing assistance for economic and banking reforms and for public admnistration, of encouraging the development of and providing assistance for medium-and small-size enterprises, creating conditions to obtain credit funds to help various enterprises as well as to initiate some vocational training programs. We have helped with perfecting the power transmission network in the central region and with restoring some locomotives. We have also provided assistance in the areas of agriculture and in rural development. It should also be pointed out the significance of the reintegration program under which employment has been created for those Vietnamese returning from Germany. During this visit, we visited two enterprises run by Vietnamese returning from Germany. Since the start of this project in 1993, we have provided assistance to nearly 500 people. We have helped build initial bases and have therefore created nearly 6,000 jobs. We have all agreed that the development of our cooperative relations is moving in the right direction. The Vietnamese side has emphasized and highly appreciated the assistance given by Germany in the area of economic reform. Here I would like to further point out that we have exchanged views with the minister of labor, war invalids, and social welfare over our increased assistance in vocational training; and with the minister of justice over our assistance for the building and expansion of the legislative system. Thus, basically we are ready to further increase our development cooperation. Meanwhile, we expect that in the upcoming period, the two sides will jointly resolve their bilateral issues still left open, that is the debt issue and the signing of a reintegration agreement, etc... The fine progress in Vietnam's economic and political reforms at present will have great significance not only for Vietnam but also for the entire region. The FRG Government is ready to support Vietnam in its efforts to develop its market-oriented and democracy-based economies and a law-governing state.
