FR940216-0-00064 FR940216-0-00010 F. Fungibility EPA has long recognized the importance of maintaining a fungible fuel system, in which complying gasolines can be mixed freely without resulting in mixtures that do not themselves comply with regulatory requirements. Fungibility is essential to smooth, cost-effective operation of fuel distribution systems such as pipelines. The Agency has received numerous comments on the need to maintain fungibility. At the same time, the Agency considers it essential that gasolines certified as reformulated meet all required emission performance levels in the field. In cases where the effects of a given fuel parameter on emissions are non-linear, it is possible for two complying fuels to produce a non-complying fuel when mixed. The complex model contains a number of nonlinear terms, which introduces the possibility that gasolines which comply with this rule's requirements in isolation would not comply if mixed with other complying fuels. EPA has been concerned with this possibility and has undertaken extensive analyses to determine its likelihood and to develop methods to cope with its occurrence. EPA's analyses, which have utilized methods that have been supported by a number of organizations, indicate that the complex model promulgated in today's rule will not create fungibility problems despite its inclusion of nonlinear terms. This analysis is explained in greater detail in Section IV.F of the RIA. G. Future Model Revisions The complex model promulgated in this rulemaking reflects EPA's best understanding of the relationship between fuel characteristics and vehicle emissions. However, EPA expects future research to clarify this relationship. EPA also recognizes that changes in in-use vehicle emission control programs (e.g., I/M programs) will continue to occur and that these changes may alter the relationship between fuel characteristics and in-use emissions. In addition, the Agency is concerned that augmentations to the model through vehicle testing (Section V) may, over time, accumulate to the point that a revised complex model, incorporating the current complex model database and all relevant information gathered since then, would be beneficial. As discussed in Section V, EPA plans to issue revised complex models when the Agency deems that sufficient new information is available to warrant such action. Model revisions will be developed through a formal rulemaking process. H. Complex Model Performance of Simple Model Fuels Fuels qualifying as reformulated under the simple model must meet specified benzene, oxygen, and RVP requirements while also satisfying the toxics performance standard. The RVP requirement differs between VOC control regions, and the requirements and standards also vary depending on whether compliance is being achieved on a per-gallon or averaging basis. In addition, levels of other fuel parameters are only specified under the simple model in terms of deviations from each refiner's baseline fuel. Evaluating the performance of simple model fuels under the complex model is difficult since fuel properties can vary widely. However, it is possible to evaluate a set of fuels that are representative of expected, typical simple model fuels. EPA expects most refiners to pursue compliance on average (for all or part of their product slate) in order to maximize flexibility in day-to-day refinery operations and recoup compliance margins. Given present and projected conditions, EPA also expects that MTBE and ethanol will be the most commonly used oxygenates during Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program. The fuels specified in Tables IV&hyph;4 and IV&hyph;5 below include fuels designed to meet the requirements of the simple model in both VOC control regions and using both oxygenates. The level of olefins, sulfur, E200, and E300 have been set to Clean Air Act baseline levels, while the level of aromatics has been set at the level necessary to comply with the toxics requirements of the simple model. Aromatics levels were assumed to be the same for summer and winter fuels.
