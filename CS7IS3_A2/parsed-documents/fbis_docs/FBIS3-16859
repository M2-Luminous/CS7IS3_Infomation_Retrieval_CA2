"Russia said that certain positive changes have recently occurred in Baghdad actions which testify to its intention to fulfill disarmament aspects of Resolution 687 and long-term control measures of Resolution 715," Russian permanent representative to the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told ITAR-TASS today. In the words of Vorontsov, "the Russian delegation thinks that positive changes in the Iraqi stand should be encouraged". Bearing this in mind, Russia suggested to include in a statement of the Security Council president a provision on positive changes in Iraqi actions. The Russian delegation also voiced the need for the "soonest agreement on the date to begin the fulfilment of long-term monitoring plans and duration of the 'control period' for estimation of its efficiency. "If upon the completion of this period, say six months, Iraqi honest comprehensive fulfilment of obligations is confirmed, Russia will be ready to discuss the lift of oil embargo in accordance with paragraph 22 of Resolution 687". The Russian delegation thinks Iraq should immediately recognize sovereignty and borders of Kuwait.
