Reminding of the agreement reached with the [words indistinct] details of the negotiations, Crvenkovski did not want to comment on the basis for this feeling that "there are possibilities" that things will move from the standstill. Commenting on the proposal for a new name, "Northern Macedonia," that was allegedly made by the American mediator Matthew Nimitz, Crvenkovski said: "In this phase we have as yet not reached any concrete proposals, especially not about the name," but ways are being sought out to continue the dialogue which is in the interest of both sides. It is reported from New York that, depending on the results of the meeting with Vance scheduled for late last night, Minister Crvenkovski may leave for Washington for several meetings. Up until today no progress has been made, stated yesterday in New York the Greek ambassador Zaharakis after the meeting with Cyrus Vance. Zaharakis denied the speculations in the press according to which the U.S. mediator Nimitz presented proposals for the name: "New" or "Northern" Macedonia. Replying to a question Zaharakis said: "Mr. Nimitz has not presented any proposals, he simply participates in the procedure for the exchange of opinion."
