B. Renard, A. A. Chizhov, V. S. Vlasov, and A. M. Rozen; UDC 546.791.6+546.799.4] [Abstract] The purpose of the present work is to provide a simple mathematical description of all known data on the distribution of uranium and plutonium in the PUREX process suitable for optimizing the treatment of spent nuclear fuel (including uranium-plutonium, i.e. systems with high concentrations of plutonium). Virtually all experimental data on the distribution of U(VI) and Pu(IV) aqueous nitrate solutions and 30 percent TBF (tributyl phosphate) in n-paraffins were processed. The data are presented as regressive relationships of distribution coefficients to component concentration. Accuracy is 8 percent. References 11: 5 Russian, 6 Western.
