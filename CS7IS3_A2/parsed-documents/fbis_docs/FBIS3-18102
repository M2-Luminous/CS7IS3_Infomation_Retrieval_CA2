Yeltsin made no more than a passing reference to the amnesty granted by the people's representatives to his adversaries who he had ejected by force from the parliament building last October. But he was clearly aware of which way the political wind has been blowing since the elections and referendum on the Constitution, which he called in December. Yeltsin used some very strong language in connection with the West and seemed determined to build on the success he scored in Sarajevo. Yeltsin believes that the world is going to have to take account of a strong and self-confident Russia. The sometimes large numbers of Russians living in the former Soviet republics -- where they have often become a minority group suffering discrimination at the hands of the ruling elite -- are to be the principal initial point of focus for his policy. The right to intervene, which Yeltsin is loudly claiming is reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev's declared right to intervene in Central and East Europe in order to safeguard orthodox Communist regimes. Yeltsin is even trying to present his ideas as humanitarian intervention in aid of the oppressed and victims of human rights violations. The danger of Yeltsin's stance is that he apparently considers that he can unilaterally decide on the need for such intervention and that other countries must simply accept it. This reasoning will no doubt cause concern in a number of the republics concerned. There are still some 20,000 Russian troops in the Baltic states. In Ukraine too, there is unease at the prospect of Russian interference. By contrast, other republics -- such as Georgia and Tajikistan -- are seeking closer ties with Russia. In the West, Yeltsin's statements will lead to an increasing awareness that the time of a submissive Russia is now past, especially in the area of defense. Yeltsin also issued the threat that the expansion of NATO without Russia's agreement would constitute a threat to world peace. In this respect, Yeltsin is probably not calling for an express right to intervene, but rather something which amounts to the right to veto any proposed NATO enlargement. If Yeltsin's words are understood to be more than an attempt to take the wind out of the sails of the ultranationalist Zhirinovsky, then they represent a degree of danger. In the economic sphere too, Yeltsin seems to want to set a more resolute course which is less in line with the West. His priority is to be the fight against inflation. He confirmed that he would continue with economic reforms. But in the same breath, he also stated that the state must play a more active role in the economy, and that industry must support the reforms and ensure that they are made more bearable for the people. But how can he prevent the government from allocating the massive aid it has promised to state-owned industries and the central bank from financing the deficit by printing more money? This first state of the nation address by Yeltsin is not good news for the West. Ordinary Russians have long since lost all faith in the words of politicians. And it is far from certain that his strong words are strong enough to make the opposition more cooperative.
