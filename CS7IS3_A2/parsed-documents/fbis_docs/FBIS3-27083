"China has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly islands and their adjacent seas," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Following reports that two Chinese prospecting ships were on their way to the Spratlys, Vietnam warned China on Thursday that their presence would violate an agreement to avoid complicating negotiations on the disputed archipelago. Since China and Vietnam normalised relations in 1991, both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violating their sovereignty over the tiny atolls. "It is entirely justifiable and legitimate for Chinese ships to conduct inspection activities on the adjacent seas of the islands," the spokesman said, adding that "the question of violating written agreements between Vietnam and China does not exist." As well as China and Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei all claim at least some of the islands, which are near vital shipping lanes and are believed to lie above substantial oil reserves.
