FBIS4-6034 "dreas074_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 South Korea More Commentary on Withdrawal More Commentary on Withdrawal SK1604065094 SK1604065094 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 16 April on the ROK Government's withdrawal of the demand for an exchange of envoys before the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Aftermath of the Abandonment of the Proposal that Special Envoys Be Exchanged Before U.S.-North Korean Talks." The editorial reports that the exchange of special envoys was "not an idea from which one can expect much." It then writes: "We must be wary of the possibility that U.S.-North Korean talks will proceed toward the direction of turning a blind eye to North Korea's possible possession of one or two nuclear weapons." The editorial continues: "If U.S.-North Korean talks are held as a result of the ROK Government's abandonment of the proposal that special envoys be exchanged before U.S.-North Korean talks, those talks must provide ways to ensure the transparency of the North Korean nuclear issue." It concludes: "We must show North Korea that its efforts toward a military buildup in the post-cold war era will only hasten its own destruction." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Abandonment of the Exchange of Special Envoys and the Reformulation of Policies." The editorial reports that from the beginning the special envoy exchange plan was unrealistic and inefficient and that even if the North and South had exchanged special envoys, those envoys would have merely been busy visiting the North and South. The editorial continues: "The ROK Government must consolidate cooperative relations with the United States and propose North-South dialogue to North Korea, separately from U.S.-North Korean negotiations, to resume the operation of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee to ensure that the North and South pursue mutual inspections and achieve the denuclearization of this region." The editorial continues that the "ROK Government must boldly allow North-South economic cooperation" if North Korea accepts inspections from the International Atomic Energy Agency and special inspections of its two unreported facilities. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Must Lead North Korea to Dialogue." The editorial describes the government's abandonment of the special envoy plan as an "important change" in the policy toward North Korea. The editorial writes that the abandonment of the special envoy plan can serve as an "efficient means to pressure North Korea," adding: "This is because this may warn North Korea that if it rejects reforms and opening up and pursues its nuclear program, its system can be shaken entirely. It is important for us to find means to lead North Korea to beg for dialogue with South Korea." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "North Korea Must Take Corresponding Measures." The editorial first writes that the government's abandonment of the special envoy plan can serve as a "breakthrough in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." It then asks the related government ministries to realize that North Korea's "ultimate goal is to buy time to develop nuclear weapons, rather than merely using the nuclear card in diplomacy." The editorial concludes: "As long as the reason we abandoned the exchange of special envoys is clear, North Korea must take corresponding measures as a matter of course. It must unconditionally receive additional inspections by early May as demanded by the UN Security Council president's statement. It must no longer try to get concessions from the United States and leave South Korea out in the cold."
