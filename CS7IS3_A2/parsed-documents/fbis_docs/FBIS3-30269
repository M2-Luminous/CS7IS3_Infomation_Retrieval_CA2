The rate at which they will grow depends on how much is being invested in this bipolar "generator of the development of every society." In the SFRY, both these activities had full verbal support, and difficulties came about only when money was supposed to be given. It seems that "old habits die hard." There are about 15,000 scientists and researchers (11,000 of them with doctoral degrees) and 150 scientific entities registered in Serbia: About 30 institutes have been founded by the republic, a quarter of which (seven) are under the patronage of Belgrade University. There was a list in the former Yugoslavia with the names of 33,000 scientific workers (of this number, only 4,000-5,000 people could justify holding this title on the basis of OECD standards). At the end of December 1990, it was announced that we do not lag behind the world in the number of researchers, but the difference is seen the moment one counts the number of computers, finds out what one day of a researcher looks like, or establishes the money allocated per scientist. Unlike their colleagues from the European Community, who spend 47 percent of their working hours on research, in our country only every second researcher uses a third of his working hours for research. According to the number of scientific works in natural sciences published in internationally recognized scientific journals, before the war broke out the SFRY was in 48th place out of 172 states. Of the European countries, only Romania, Turkey and Albania were behind us. The situation was even worse in the social sciences: 61st place with only Romania and Albania behind us. One can learn about the situation in science by the numbers of patents granted in the research and development sector of the economy. As a comparison, one should say that in 1986 alone, a single Japanese firm claimed 28,200 patents, a that which the enterprises from the territory of former Yugoslavia (if they joined together again) would be able to reach in 158 years! When the very ambitious federal Law on Financing Scientific and Technological Development was passed last summer, experts immediately saw that everything "remained just on paper" because funds amounting to 0.002 percent of GNP do not suffice even for small, let alone more serious, projects. The embargo and other things have caused scientists to leave the country en masse. According to unofficial data, 17-20 percent of people dealing with science have left the country in the last two years alone. It has been calculated that the "brain drain" alone will reduce the GNP over the past two years by $30 billion. [passage omitted]
