FR940202-1-00006 FR940202-1-00003 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 to continue to require repetitive inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. This action would add a requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature (synch-lock). Installation of the synch-lock would terminate the requirement for repetitive inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. The synch-lock installation would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This AD would also add periodic functional tests of the synch-lock following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. The FAA has determined that these tests are necessary to ensure the integrity of the synch-lock installation and that it is effective in preventing the identified unsafe condition. This determination is based on the fact that the synch-lock is a new design and its reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. Boeing has submitted to the FAA procedures for accomplishment of the synch-lock integrity test described in the airplane maintenance manual. These procedures are accomplished independently of other thrust reverser system tests. Since only limited information is available currently to substantiate the in-service reliability of the synch-lock device, the FAA has established an appropriate functional test interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service. There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 69 of these airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The inspections, adjustments, and functional checks required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 require approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines is estimated to be $60,720, or $880 per airplane. For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines, the FAA estimates that it would take approximately 786 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification proposed by this AD, and 1 work hour to accomplish the proposed functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines is estimated to be $2,986,665, or $43,285 per airplane. There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 30 of these airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The inspections, adjustments, and functional checks required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 require approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines is estimated to be $26,400, or $880 per airplane. For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines, the FAA estimates that it would take approximately 812 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and 1 work hour to accomplish the proposed functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines is estimated to be $1,341,450, or $44,715 per airplane. These total cost figures assume that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The number of required work hours for accomplishing the proposed functional tests, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of those tests proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, those tests for the most part would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional work hours for accomplishment of the functional tests would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal.
