Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party of Moldova, declared "a normal thing happened, the voting expresses the population's will. First of all I consider these elections a general rehearsal for the future parliamentary elections, which will be run in an already unitary republic. Together with agrarians we shall constitute a based parliamentary majority, that will first of all solve the problems of the republic's south and east, adherence to CIS, and amendments to the law on languages. In a civilized state, the language is not taught with the cudgel, but with competent teachers, said the interviewed. Gheorghe Ghimpu, leader of Democratic Party, told BASA: "Those who said long before that the elections will not be democratic were right. I think there have been infringements, frauds. A lesson of yesterday is that Russians have actively participated, while Moldovans were passive. The results of elections can only mean the following: The reaction won in Russia, the reaction also won here. Winners of the elections will federalize the republic, revise the laws on state language, Latin graphology, etc. We have to recognize that Moldovans neither know what is freedom nor want it." Victor Popa, representative of the Reform Party, asserted "results of the elections show that the communist ideology is deeply infiltrated in our mentality. These results do not show at all the balance of forces in the society, but as always, any elections leave room for a triumph of paradoxes. Our electorate has voted the past instead of voting the future." In the opinion of FPCD [Christian Democratic Popular Front] Alliance representative Sergiu Mocanu, "nothing grave happened: communists came back to power." Mocanu thinks the results of elections were influenced by the decree of Snegur on the participation of Dniester population and by the pressure of the executive which forced part of electors vote for agrarians. "We will try to contest the results of elections, both in localities inhabited by Gagaouzians and where Dniestrians voted, where numerous electoral frauds were detected." PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova] representative Dumitru Diacov stated to BASA "results of the elections display the ratio of forces in the society. We must all understand that electors realized well with whom to go. Despite of the arguments and the electoral noise." In Diacov's opinion, the mass voting for "Edinstvo" denotes a disorder in our political life. "Our Parliamentary majority will first of all solve the most urgent problems: the constitution, the Moldovan east and south and will prepare a package of documents to unleash reform," stressed the PDAM representative.
