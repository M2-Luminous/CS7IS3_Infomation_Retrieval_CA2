FBIS4-12958 "drnes073_j_94004" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Interviewed on Jordan Visit, Saudi Talks Interviewed on Jordan Visit, Saudi Talks JN1504110394 Amman SHIHAN in Arabic 16-22 Apr 94 p 12 JN1504110394 Amman SHIHAN Arabic BFN [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, by Taghrid Sa'adah; place and date not given] [Excerpts] [Sa'adah] What is the first item on your agenda during your visit to Jordan? Do you have new proposals, especially after the failure of the Salalah meeting? [Muhammad] Our visit to Jordan is meant to meet with His Majesty King Husayn to brief him on the latest developments in the Yemeni arena. We also want Jordan to continue its role in the military committees and in the dialogue with the political leaders, since Jordan hosted a Yemeni meeting and helped to endorse the accord document in Amman in the presence of all Yemeni parties. This obliges Yemen to brief Jordan's king, government, and people on these developments. The visit is also part of the Arab tour we have made, particularly after the Salalah meeting between the president and his deputy. [passage omitted] [Sa'adah] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is making shuttle tours to Arab capitals. For what purpose and what proposals do you have? [Muhammad] Any party that achieves unity cannot be seeking disunity once again. However, we are now facing a process in which unity and democracy are being buried through the annexation, and ending the existing status, of southeastern regions. The YSP is therefore concerned with rectifying the domestic and foreign situation of the unity state. The YSP's contacts with its brothers and friends abroad is meant to ensure that Yemen will continue to play its natural role, along with its Arab brothers and friends abroad, away from the atmosphere of domestic problems and the results of the Gulf war. This is as far as its responsibility as a partner in government is concerned. As for its responsibility as a party, the YSP is still responsible for part of the Yemeni homeland. The YSP has domestic and foreign contacts and no one can deny or bar this. This is a right for others as well -- the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others. They all travel on visits and have contacts. The tour of 'Ali Salim al-Bid adopted a specific formula. We are for national dialogue and the document which met 70 percent of our demands. We did not propose any view in our tour. However, we had in mind the military developments in Yemen, outlined in a report by the joint Jordanian-Omani military committee which also proposed solutions to this crisis, as well as the fact that we know and others know that the other parties do not want to, and cannot, implement the accord document. Therefore, we are only asking the Arab brothers to contribute toward solving this problem, since we are part of this nation. [passage omitted] [Sa'adah] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid visit Saudi Arabia after signing the document in Amman? [Muhammad] The visit was meant to explain the YSP's position to Saudi officials, after the other party had foiled the Amman meeting and after it had exploded the military situation in Abyan, in cooperation with the Islamic Jihad group. This was also after we made sure that the other party does not want to implement the accord, considering the conditions he set when he signed it. This prompted us to explain our position to besiege any military adventure that any party could think of. Yemeni stability is part of the stability of this region. Our region is rich in resources and the world cares about these resources. What happened during the Gulf war confirms this fact and that any party that disrupts security and stability will not be allowed to do that. [passage omitted] [Sa'adah] It is being said now that oil is one of the reasons for the current crisis and that it is behind your desire to establish a federation. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said that you are seeking to be an oil country. What is your comment? [Muhammad] Oil was a catalyst for unity in the first place because it existed before the unity. Our regions contain oil and we know how much they contain. Therefore, we expedited our efforts for unity. However, the way some people think indicates they had contemplated annexing the southern regions on this basis.
