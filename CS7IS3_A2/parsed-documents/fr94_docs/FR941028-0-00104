FR941028-0-00104 FR941028-0-00010 OHA's proposed rules were published on the same day as OSM proposed related rules defining the AVS, requiring its use in reviewing permit applications to determine whether there are any ownership or control links between applicants and persons in violation, and proposing procedures and standards for an applicant or other person shown in the AVS to challenge ownership and control links shown in the AVS and the status of the violation. 56 FR 45780&hyph;45804 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM also proposed to amend its existing rules governing suspension and rescission of improvidently issued permits. OSM's proposed rules provided a right to review of its decisions to suspend or rescind a permit under the procedures set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1370 through 4.1377. See proposed §773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM's proposed rules also provided a right to review of its written decisions on challenges to ownership and control links and the status of violations shown in the AVS under the procedures set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1380 through 4.1387. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2)(ii), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). OHA received comments on its proposed rules from Texas Utilities Services, Inc. (TU Services), the Joint National Coal Association/American Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). The NCA/AMC comments dealt with both OHA's and OSM's proposed rules. Proposed Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) Withdrawn As part of its September 6, 1991, proposed rulemaking, OHA proposed an amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) at 56 FR 45808 which set forth an element of OSM's prima facie case in proceedings to review the assessment of individual civil penalties. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) complemented proposed rules by OSM at 56 FR 48924, 48929&hyph;30 (Sept. 26, 1991) addressing individual civil penalties. Both TU Services' and NCA/AMC's comments expressed reservations about the proposed amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). By a notice published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1992, OSM withdrew its September 26, 1991, proposed rulemaking. 57 FR 47431 (Oct. 16, 1992). Therefore, OHA hereby withdraws the corresponding proposed amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). Because this proposed rule concerning an element of OSM's prima facie case in individual civil penalty proceedings is withdrawn, no response to the comments concerning it is necessary. As noted above, the NCA/AMC comments address both the proposed OSM rules and the proposed OHA rules ``[b]ecause [their] comments on the proposal by [OHA] are interrelated with [their] concerns about the OSM proposal.'' NCA/AMC's comments that relate to the procedures for administrative review are addressed here. Procedural Due Process NCA/AMC state that although the proposed rules ``purport to establish a comprehensive scheme for administrative review of ownership and control determinations emanating from the AVS, they fall far short of providing the meaningful guarantees that the due process clause requires.'' They fall short, NCA/AMC state, because the procedures do not allow one to challenge the existence of the violation that forms the basis for a permit block under section 510(c). Further, the proposed rules do not provide ``any opportunity for challenging either the status of the violation or the validity of the AVS link prior to the deprivation of the operator's property interest through permit denial, suspension, or revocation, unless the applicant is able to meet the stringent requirements for seeking temporary relief'' contained in proposed 43 CFR 4.1386 (emphasis in original). NCA/AMC state that the ``right to notice and a hearing prior to a governmental deprivation of private property is a cornerstone of American jurisprudence, and is a well-established principle in cases involving the constitutionality of SMCRA provisions'' that the proposed rules fail to recognize. NCA/AMC state that an appeal or challenge to AVS information ``must, of necessity, include the right to a full and fair determination on the merits of the violation in advance of any decision to prohibit mining through the sanctions contained within section 510(c).'' Under the balancing test announced in Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the proposed rules do not afford due process, NCA/AMC argue. A fundamental requirement of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that ``[n]o person shall *␣*␣* be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law'' is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Armstrong v. Manzo , 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). In Mathews v. Eldridge , supra , the U.S. Supreme Court discussed ``the extent to which due process requires an evidentiary hearing prior to the deprivation of some type of property interest even if such a hearing is provided thereafter.'' 424 U.S. at 333. The Court quoted Morrissey v. Brewer , 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972), that ``due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands,'' and then stated: [O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly . [397 U.S.] at 263&hyph;271. Mathews v. Eldridge , supra at 334&hyph;35. In Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Supreme Court decided procedural due process requires that a state grant an evidentiary hearing before suspending or terminating welfare payments to an individual who meets the statutory qualifications for receiving them. ``[T]he crucial factor in this context,'' the Court observed, ``is that termination of aid pending resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an eligible recipient of the very means by which to live while he waits.'' Id . at 264 (emphasis in original). ``[C]ountervailing governmental interests in conserving fiscal and administrative resources *␣*␣* are not overriding in the welfare context,'' the Court stated. Id . at 265&hyph;66. ``[H]owever, *␣*␣* the pre-termination hearing need not take the form of a judicial or quasi-judicial trial,'' the Court commented. Id . at 266. A complete record and a comprehensive opinion are not necessary; an opportunity for the welfare recipient to confront and cross-examine witnesses relied on by the government, and to retain an attorney, however, are necessary. Id . at 267&hyph;270. Also necessary is an impartial decisionmaker, who must ``state the reasons for his determination and indicate the evidence be relied on.'' Id . at 271.
