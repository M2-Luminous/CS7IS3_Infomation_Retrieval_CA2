[Begin de Greiff recording] [Word indistinct] this man's surrender. He came forth and said he surrendered. The Attorney General's Office participated in this process, which is appropriate and in accordance with the law. Urdinola said he wanted to surrender, and the processes involved in the Prosecutor General's charges against him will continue. In his confession, Urdinola said he will calmly and seriously follow legal procedures without anything unusual, as it must be in a civilized society. [end recording] Urdinola Grajales is facing three charges within the Colombian legal system. Prosecutor de Greiff explained: [Begin recording] De Greiff: Drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, and conspiracy. Rodriguez: With the surrender of Urdinola Grajales, do you expect Cali Cartel members to surrender en masse? Who is Jesus Ancizar Porras, who also surrendered today? De Greiff: I have no idea. Nor do I have any idea if Mr. Urdinola belongs to a cartel. That is part of the investigation. General Octavio Vargas, director of the National Police, told me that Mr. Urdinola was accompanied by a man named Jesus Ancizar Porras. My office has no information regarding the latter's activities; that is, illegal activities. The prosecutor handling the case may provide you with more information, but with the restraint the case warrants. Rodriguez: Recently there have been many contradictory views about the way you are implementing the surrender policy [five-second break in reception] how do you feel about it? De Greiff: The country must remember that I do not have sovereign power to implement those provisions because they are dictated by law. The accord was approved by judges and the National Court. Rodriguez: Do you know if the government assured Urdinola he will remain in Palmira Prison? De Greiff: As far as I know--of course this has just happened--there was no agreement or conditions for the surrender of those men. Rodriguez: Do you think this surrender will end the opposing views that have been expressed recently in the government? De Greiff: I think we must set aside the hysteria of this past week on differences between the government and the Prosecutor General's Office and continue ahead with a policy that can--and I stress can--be successful. Rodriguez: Why do you think the government is not allowing Pablo Escobar's five bodyguards to be moved to Itagui Prison? De Greiff: What do I think about it? I do not think the problem of guarding 25, 25 [repeats] criminals or less is something that cannot be controlled and solved. We would be extremely inefficient [words indistinct] if we could not control 25 criminals. [end recording] Regarding the counts of drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, and conspiracy Urdinola is facing, I must tell you that a few days ago the U.S. Justice Department forwarded evidence against Urdinola and (Hernado Angel Garnet) to the Deputy Prosecutor's Office.
