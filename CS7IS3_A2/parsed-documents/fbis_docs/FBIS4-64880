The talks came in the wake of large-scale concerted intervention last week by central banks to prop up the slumping U.S. dollar. "We talked about developments on the forex markets and their implications for monetary policy", said Tietmeyer, who chairs the G-10 governors' committee. "Our discussion was confidential." He added that the committee had not discussed exchange rate targets at their meeting at the Basel headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The governors also talked about the derivatives markets, the growth of which is causing them some worries. "We decided today to make a study, to be completed in April 1995, of all participants on this market," the Bundesbank chief said. He also said the governors were a little more optimistic than previously about the world economy.
