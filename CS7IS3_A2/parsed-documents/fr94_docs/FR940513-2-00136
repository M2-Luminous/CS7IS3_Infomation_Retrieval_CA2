FR940513-2-00136 FR940513-2-00064 [Amendment No. 1 to Directed Service Order No. 1515] Cedar River Railroad Company_Directed Service Order Charles City Railway Lines, Inc AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Amendment to Directed Service Order. SUMMARY: The Charles City Railway Lines, Inc. (CCRY), was shut down by its management effective with the close of business February 24, 1994, due to a lack of operating funds. There are two principal shippers located on the 3.6-mile CCRY line. On March 4, 1994, the Commission issued Directed Service Order No. 1515, authorizing the Cedar River Railroad Company (CRR) to operate the CCRY lines for 60 days under certain terms and conditions contained in that order. The Commission was notified on May 4, 1994, of CRR's willingness to continue that operation. In view of the need for continued rail service over CCRY's lines and CRR's willingness to provide directed service without compensation from the Federal government, this decision grants an extension of the interim service authority to CRR for 180 days. This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. Decided: May 6, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons, and Morgan. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary.
