People Have!' Published in EXPRESS-GAZETTE No. 5, March 1994"] [Text] On behalf of the Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the Federal Assembly's legal administration has filed a claim with the Judiciary Chamber for Information Disputes under the President of the Russian Federation regarding false information contained in the material "What A Life... People Have!" published in EXPRESS-GAZETTE No. 5, March 1994. After reviewing the material, hearing the legal administration's representatives, I.I. Zablotskiy and G.L. Dyakonov, and the representatives of EXPRESS-GAZETTE, S.A. Shibalov and A.S. Ivanov, and studying additional materials supplied by representatives of the parties, the Judiciary Chamber finds that: EXPRESS-GAZETTE in issue No. 5, March 1994 under the rubric "Investigation" published editorial material on the subject of the Provisional Statute on Support of the Activities of Deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, approved by State Duma Decree No. 41-1GD, dated 21 January 1994, and published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on 29 January 1994. Contrary to the content of the Provisional Statute, in the material "What A Life... People Have!" the editors put forward their own untrue and slanderous conjectures and comments regarding material and organizational support for deputies' activities. The disgraceful writing style, and a dense concentration of insulting, untrue, and absurd allegations are evidence that EXPRESS-GAZETTE essentially chose the road of mocking the State Duma deputy corps and humiliating and discrediting elected representatives of the people. During a court hearing EXPRESS-GAZETTE representatives admitted that the material was untrue and biased, but attempted to find an excuse by saying that much of its information and data had allegedly come from other sources. In addition, they said that this is a "young" newspaper and that such writing style was allegedly necessitated by the need "to come into its own" and "win over its competitors." The Judiciary Chamber rejects such arguments. There are no references to other sources in the material. Analysis of submitted supplemental materials showed that there are no verbatim reprints, while many conjectures, insulting hints, and contentions represent EXPRESS-GAZETTE's own "creative work." Also impermissible is the contention that for the sake of gaining a foothold in the newspaper marketplace one may resort to the use of cheap sensations, publication of untrue and insulting materials, and mockery of the institutions of Russian statehood. The Judiciary Chamber, of course, reaffirms the right of the mass media to cover the activities of state bodies truthfully and objectively, which includes criticism. EXPRESS-GAZETTE editors had the opportunity to compare their own perceptions with the previously published Provisional Statute and see proof of elementary ignorance and confusion. Instead, EXPRESS-GAZETTE chose a different road--the road of slander, mockery, and ridicule. The Judiciary Chamber also found that EXPRESS-GAZETTE Editor in Chief A. Kupriyanov deliberately, without good reason, did not show up for the hearing and did not present any explanations regarding the circumstances of origin of this material. Taking the above into account, and guided by Articles 9 and 12 of the Judiciary Chamber Statute, the Judiciary Chamber resolves that: 1. The material "What A Life... People Have!" published in EXPRESS-GAZETTE No. 5, March 1994, shall be deemed untrue and biased. 2. The aforementioned material shall be considered a gross violation of legal and ethical norms aimed at insulting the State Duma deputy corps and discrediting the institution of Russian statehood. 3. It is found that EXPRESS-GAZETTE Editor in Chief A. Kupriyanov grossly violated Part 2 of Article 49 and Article 51 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media." In keeping with Article 12 of the Judiciary Chamber Statute, the chamber recommends that the EXPRESS-GAZETTE founders relieve A. Kupriyanov of his duties as editor in chief. 4. This decision shall be sent to the EXPRESS-GAZETTE editors for publication. 5. The mass media shall be advised that it is impermissible to publish untrue and biased data of sociopolitical interest. [Signed] Judiciary Chamber Chairman A. Vengerov
