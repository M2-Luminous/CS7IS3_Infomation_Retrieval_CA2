FBIS3-48473 "dreas017__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Nissan Plans Auto Parts Center in Mexico OW2001051794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2001051794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [By Atsushi Nakayama] [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jan -- Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. will build an auto parts design and develop center in Mexico. The company intends to begin construction of the center in March, with the aim of completing construction this year. The investment amount is approximately 2 billion yen. Nissan plans to gather at the center about 500 employees in charge of parts design, purchase, and quality control who are now doing business in various places within the country in order to make it a base for providing design and development assistance to about 170 local parts manufacturers with which Nissan has dealings in Mexico. With an eye on the yen's appreciation and the effectuation of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], Nissan intends to further increase local production of parts and to strengthen the competitive power of Nissan cars made in Mexico. Nissan will build the center in Toluca, approximately 50 kilometers west of Mexico City. The center will be constructed on a 90,000-square-meter site adjoining a foundry of Mexico Nissan (headquartered in Mexico City, with Masao Horie as representative), Nissan's local production corporate in the country. In addition to those in charge of parts purchase and quality control, the company intends to transfer to the center 310 people in charge of design who are now doing business at various plants. The company intends to open the center, which will be equipped with design rooms and various test facilities, to all manufacturers dealing with Nissan -- such as local corporations of Nissan-affiliated parts manufacturers as well as locally-capitalized parts manufacturers. Both Nissan and parts manufacturers plan to discuss which parts should be produced in Mexico, and to make efforts to shorten the term for developing parts for exclusive use in locally produced cars. By stopping parts imports from Japan and beginning local production, Nissan intends to establish a procurement system that will not be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. With the effectuation of NAFTA, foreign manufacturers doing business in North America have been forced to further raise the local procurement rate of parts to increase dealings within the NAFTA region. The local procurement rate of parts, which is a condition for exempting finished cars from duties in the NAFTA region, will be 50 percent for four years starting this year, 56 percent for four years starting in 1998, and 62.5 percent after 2002. Although presently Nissan reportedly clears the first condition of 50 percent, for the time being it has no intention of exporting finished cars from Mexico to the United States and Canada. However, there is a possibility the company will begin dividing production at its plants within North America. The company intends to further promote local production of parts in Mexico in an effort to attain the local procurement rate under the NAFTA calculation system and to maintain its competitive power in the price war. Nissan is now producing finished "Sunny" and "AD Van" [name as published] cars as well as engines for "Altima" cars in Mexico. Its plant and equipment investment in Mexico was more than 20 billion yen in 1993. In accordance with its plan to start production of the new "Sunny" car in February next year, Nissan intends to invest approximately 30 billion yen in 1994.
