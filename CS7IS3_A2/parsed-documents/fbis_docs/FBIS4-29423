At a meeting of its supreme council on Monday, the DP decided to take strong action against the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and the government which, it said, have been balking at the parliamentary probe. Spurred by an opposition demand, the National Assembly had invoked its parliamentary right to probe the Sangmudae scam. The opposition party claims that the president of a construction company, Cho Ki-hyon, created a slush fund out of profits he made from a defense contract to move a facility called Sangmudae in Kwangju to the city's outskirts. The DP alleges that part of the fund was eventually funnelled into the ruling party during the 1992 presidential election. In calling for the probe, the opposition party wanted the National Assembly to find out the truth behind the allegations. As a result of Monday's decision, the DP plans to take its case directly to the people by having newspapers publish the facts uncovered so far by the parliamentary investigation and details of the DP's own probe, as well as records of the prosecution's investigation obtained by the party. The opposition party also decided to sue Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Kim Chong-ku, chief of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office, Sin Song-taek, chief judge of the Seoul Criminal District Court, and managers and other officials at 10 branch offices of six banks who refused to release to opposition lawmakers the deposit records of people involved in the alleged scandal. In addition, the party will push for the impeachment of Defense Minister Yi, Chief Judge Sin and Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui. As for impeaching President Kim Yong-sam, the DP will withhold a decision because initiation of the procedure requires the signatures of more than half the National Assembly representatives.
