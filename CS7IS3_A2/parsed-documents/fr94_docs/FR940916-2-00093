FR940916-2-00093 FR940916-2-00078 [Docket No. 50&hyph;458] Entergy Operations, Inc.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;47, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the River Bend Station (RBS), located in West Feliciana Parish. The proposed amendment would provide the licensee the ability to search and determine the location, while at power, of leaking fuel bundles within the reactor core, by modifying Technical Specification (TS) 3.10.2. This modification adds the rod withdrawal limiter notch constraints as one of the items that can be bypassed to allow continuous rod withdrawal, in addition to adding fuel power suppression testing as one of the tests that can be performed while the rod withdrawal limiter is in the bypassed condition. Entergy Operations, Inc. has requested the amendment at this time due to the fact that a small fuel leak was recently identified to exist in the reactor core at RBS. As a result of this leak the licensee has identified an increase in off-gas activity and off-site dose. Although these increases have not exceeded RBS off-site dose limits, the potential exists for further fuel degradation caused by either normal power changes, which are needed to perform various TS surveillance tests, or inadvertent power excursions. Finally, should the leaking fuel bundle continue to degrade, RBS will be forced to de-rate to maintain off-gas activity within TS requirements. This could ultimately result in forcing the plant to shutdown to locate and remove the leaking fuel. Entergy Operations, Inc. has determined that if the location of the fuel leak can be identified, actions could be taken to suppress the leak, and to prevent further degradation. As a result, Entergy Operations, Inc. believes that the circumstances described above meets the requirements for emergency action per 10 CFR 50.91(a)(5). The licensee's request was reviewed by the Commission and was found not to meet the requirements for emergency action as specified in 10 CFR 50.91(a)(5), but it was determined that the licensee's concerns were valid and did merit exigent action as specified in 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6). Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) The request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The event of concern is the rod withdrawal error at power, which is assumed to occur when the highest worth control rod is withdrawn while at a limiting critical power ratio condition. The rod withdrawal limiter provides protection for control rod withdrawal error events. The purpose of the rod withdrawal limiter is to limit control rod withdrawal to preclude a violation of a fuel design limit. Administrative controls for bypassing the rod withdrawal limiter constraints in the rod pattern control system will include; direct control to be maintained and an approved procedure to be used to control the bypassing of individual control rods in the rod pattern control system. A test specific analysis will be performed assuming the rod withdrawal error occurs and a test pattern will be administratively imposed (i.e. controlled by procedure) that precludes any violation of fuel safety limits. Performance of the power suppression testing with rod withdrawal limiter notch constraints bypassed will be more conservative since the bypassed control rod will not be withdrawn past its original pre-test position. The expected test conditions for which the power suppression test will be performed will also be much less than the assumed limiting thermal limit conditions expected by the safety analysis. therefore, the evolution is less severe than that assumed in the safety analysis. If an operator continuously withdraws a previously partially inserted control rod to its original position or beyond, an analysis will show there is no increase in the consequences of a rod withdrawal error of the type described in the basis for Technical Specification 3.10.2. Therefore, the rod pattern control system sequence constraints are not required for this special test, and the operation of the plant will remain as previously analyzed with the response of the plant within the limits of the analyses. (2) The request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Performance of the power suppression testing performed under the proposed change will be more conservative than previously reviewed events since the rod pattern control system bypassed control rod will not be withdrawn past its original pre-test position. Therefore, the power suppression testing evolution is less severe than that assumed in the safety analysis and the response of the plant will remain within previous analysis. The positioning of control rods will be in conformance with applicable safety analysis; the generic rod withdrawal error analysis or with a special analysis, to ensure that the conclusions of the rod withdrawal error analysis remains supported. The maintenance of these analysis limits will be through the use of administrative controls. The use of operational control in lieu of control rod blocks will assure this analysis remains supported. This action is consistent with present allowances in Technical Specification 3.10.2. Therefore the above administrative controls ensure that positioning and movement of bypassed control rods remain within the bounds of the previous analysis. (3) The request does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Technical Specifications currently allow bypassing a single control rod for the purpose of fully withdrawing the control rod to perform the four tests specified in Technical Specification 3.10.2 The margin of safety associated with the bypassing and withdrawal of control rods is established in the Technical Specifications for control rod scram time testing. Also the controls being placed on power suppression testing will assure fuel safety limits are met. Therefore, the margin of safety associated with power suppression testing is enveloped by the margin of safety defined for current control rod testing. Therefore, the analysis, the hardware controls, and the administrative requirements all support and meet the requirements of General Design Criteria 10, Fuel Design Limits are not exceeded; 25, Protection System requirements for Reactivity; and 29, Protection against Anticipated Operational Occurrences. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville Maryland, from 7:30 a.m., to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
