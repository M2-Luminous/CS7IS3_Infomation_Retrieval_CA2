As the defense minister, I wish to say I was very happy with the debate and the fact that all speakers, colleagues from the government, colleagues from the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, and Klose as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] parliamentary group, have acknowledged the importance of the Bundeswehr -- positive, strong and good words about the Bundeswehr. This encourages me; not that we will receive large amounts of funding -- I am not asking for that -- but sufficient funds to implement those things that have received general support here. There is still some work to be done in this respect. The NATO summit...[pauses] I really think this is good; it is good for the Bundeswehr and, incidentally, it is in line with the international security policy situation. What has been said here is correct, in that all of us together must find the strength to implement this, because with words alone I cannot finance a single soldier and I cannot train a single Bundeswehr unit. The summit was a success because it supplied answers to the three decisive tasks we are facing. First, NATO makes no concessions regarding its ability of collective defense. This is also urgently necessary because the security situation in Europe is far from stable. Besides defense of the alliance, NATO also sees the ability to participate in international crisis management as its new core task, which it will resolutely develop further. It is good and correct that the alliance has decided to adapt its armed forces and command structures in order to enable them to fulfil the new tasks. And, Hans-Ulrich Klose, Germany must fully participate in NATO's old and the new tasks in case it jeopardizes NATO's ability to act. This is decisive for the debate here in Germany. Second, reform of NATO and European integration are brought in line with each other. The United States has made its peace with the equal partnership of a united Europe within the alliance. For this, Europe must become strategically able to act. This would ease the burden for America and create the preconditions for a permanent American commitment in and to Europe as affirmed impressively by the American President. This is especially remarkable when one remembers the past controversy over the Eurocorps. There was also a heated debate about this in Germany. There is a great degree of harmony within the alliance concerning its significance as part of NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]. The WEU is being strengthened as the European pillar of the alliance. It will in future be able to rely on the structures and strengths of NATO. However, the alliance will remain the decisive consultative forum on security issues in Europe. In the end, it is NATO that decides whether it is the alliance or the WEU which acts. That is the political price for the WEU being able to use NATO's capacity, that Europe is able to act in terms of security and defense policy and that we avoid the creation of dual structures. Despite my gratification at the SPD support for the policy of eastward expansion, I have to say that when we discuss the WEU and the creation of a European security and defense identity, Mr. Klose, the SPD's position remains self-contradictory. You say the WEU represents a militarization of Europe. There is no question that the WEU will always act on the basis of the UN Charter, but it is a fact that Europe will be able to act militarily only if Germany is fully involved in these tasks, and this is a question which addresses the responsibility of the Social Democrats. No one can take responsibility for Germany by continuing with its previous position, making the WEU, and thus Europe itself, unable to act. Third, NATO has made the stabilization of eastern Europe a joint objective of the highest priority. To this end we need a convincing overall plan of integration and deeper cooperation. I think this enables us to meet the justified expectations of our neighbors. At the same time, we have to develop a partnership of a special quality with Ukraine, and above all with Russia. Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step toward bringing new partners nearer to Western security institutions. It is not a substitute for opening up the alliance, and what was said in Brussels was only achieved after months of effort. It was not planned that way at the outset; in fact, to begin with it was seen as being more of a substitute for membership, and I think we should be happy that this is now the alliance's policy. Just as the chancellor said during his speech to the NATO Council, we are offering all of these countries a Partnership for Peace and at the same time are opening up the prospect of joining NATO. This is a basis on which we can act. [applause]. I supported this plan for months; I am glad that we achieved this result, and German policy as a whole made a very good contribution to this, as did what came from the parliamentary groups, from almost all the parliamentary groups in this House. I am firmly convinced that only in this way will the alliance remain viable, and only in this way can we fulfill the task of establishing security in and for Europe. Stability for peace is no empty formula; that is a great mistake -- rather it is a practical, urgent program, and before the end of this year. There will be no discrimination; everyone can participate, but of course we will differentiate -- we will begin concrete cooperation, concrete measures. These include joint training and exercises, joint planning for peace missions and specific support in the planning of military structures that make NATO membership possible in the first place. I think that so far we have done a great deal. We have concluded with all of our eastern neighbors some military cooperation agreements that we have fleshed out and that we must further fulfill, with the aim of bringing our eastern neighbors closer to western security institutions. The opening of the alliance to our immediate neighbors in the East is in our vital interest. I have always taken the view that one doesn't have to be a strategic genius to grasp that. I have occasionally been surprised how little we worked from a clear analysis of German interests. The frontier of stability and security: unstable to the East of our border, stable on this side. Prosperity on this side, poverty on the other -- that cannot turn out well in the long run, and so Germany's eastern frontier should not remain for long the furthest frontier of NATO and the European Union [EU]. Either we export stability or we will import instability, and nobody formulated it earlier or better than Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who said things will not go well for us in the long run if they go badly for our eastern neighbors in the long run. [applause] For this reason German interests at least are crystal clear, and since we cannot achieve them alone, we must create something like a European solidarity pact. That means that the funds which hitherto have flowed from North to South must now go more from West to East. And there is quite a lot of egoism, also among the southern democracies, whom we helped immediately in the stabilization of their democracries. The south of Europe is also the West, and in comparison with the East they are rich. For this reason German policy must push this process forward. This is not a provocation aimed at anyone. There has been an artificial division of Europe here, and if NATO opens, if the EU opens, then the Europe which belonged together for centuries will grow together again. That is no provocation at all. I wish that some people would accept certain contributions to the debate less defensively and not try to give us a bad conscience. The area of stability in Europe is spreading and does not constitute a provocation toward anyone. In addition it is clear that future EU members can be no less secure than the present members, such as ourselves, who already belong to NATO. It is therefore clear that German interests, vital German interests, coincide with the expectations and legitimate security interests of our neighbors, the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks and others, who want nothing less than to belong to the family of European democracies once again. If there is one thing that has bothered me during the debate, which has lasted over a year now, then it has been the contributions of those who occasionally said with the coldness of iceskating judges: Let's watch these new democracies for a few more years to see if they really qualify for membership, to see whether democracy is really stable enough, the odd election didn't go too well. I don't know if they always go so well here -- and: We don't know what economic developments will be in Poland. I have to tell you that this is an unbelievable attitude, and we ought to remember our own German postwar history. I am firmly convinced that the stabilization of democracy in postwar Germany, the stabilization of our economy, can be put down to ourselves only by half at the most; the rest was based on our early membership of the western alliances, the EU and NATO. And for this reason we Germans should never forget...[indistinct interruption] Yes, of course, the Marshall Plan, that as well, of course, and for this reason Germany as well as others have to contribute to a European solidarity pact, and I repeat that those who comment with the coldness of iceskating judges and observe how well democracy is developing in Poland or Hungary and how painstakingly the market economy is being implemented there -- without the adjective as far as possible -- and then say: Let's see if they qualify for the alliance and the EU -- these people are committing an historic mistake and it is one we cannot afford to make. [applause] There is wide-ranging support among the German public for this policy. Germans feel and know that we cannot under any circumstances pursue a policy which would have to make a choice between Warsaw and Moscow. Some things that have been said in the debate have occasionally bothered me. We would have made a huge mistake if we had allowed such an alternative to be imposed upon us; there is no need for this, it would do no good, neither the need for close, friendly relations between Germany and Russia, nor our desire to develop a relationship with our eastern neighbors which is every bit as close as that with our western neighbors. Stability in Europe, as we all know, and this has clearly emerged during the debate, can only be achieved with and not against Russia, but the space between Germany and Russia should not be forgotten. I think the key elements -- integration and cooperation -- are now in the right balance. This is an irreversible process which the NATO summit has set in train, and NATO has therefore assumed a leading role in the stability of the whole of Europe. Germany must be in a position, as I have just said, to participate in fulfilling all NATO's old and new tasks appropriately. Our partners in the East and West have great expectations for a responsible German policy, which acts resolutely and prudently. The security situation -- and I think we all agreed on this, government and opposition -- at the start of the New Year is confused. It was necessary and correct for NATO to affirm its willingness to make sure that humanitarian aid reaches Sarajevo and the other threatened areas, if necessary using military force. Bosnia shows that we are far from having reached the level of stability that the new Europe needs for its emergence. Some only realized, because of someone like Zhirinovskiy, that the political revolution in Europe is not yet complete. It was at its peak in 1989, but it has not yet come to its end. If one compares it to an earthquake there is no question at all, the lava has neither cooled nor has it stopped flowing. There are not only radical forces who are, for instance, questioning the independence of Ukraine. Therefore it is important that we handle this still difficult security situation in Europe, which has not yet become a completed chapter of history, with extreme care. Germany, as the core country of the EU, bears special responsibility in this respect. We must give the right signals, we must contribute to enabling Europe to act militarily. I think that some people underestimate this, those who see the Bundeswehr, above all, with regard to Germany. We have to see it at least as our contribution to European defense. Without an appropriate German contribution we jeopardize European defense as a whole. It is conceivable that Europe will find itself in a situation where it has to manage crises and conflicts by itself. This is no longer the postwar period when we could pass everything on to be shouldered by the Americans. This became clear at the summit. This is a chance to develop our own identity, and to take on a much greater responsibility, and we must make appropriate arrangements for this. Without a substantial German contribution there will be no common European security and defense policy. Our responsibility regarding security policy decisions goes far beyond the 80 million Germans. Therefore what we do is being carefully watched. In this situation the quality and quantity of Germany's security precautions must not be made dependent on financial considerations alone. This has become evident here too. I have put it as follows: No one would cancel their fire insurance because there has not been a fire for a long time. This prudence of the ordinary people who look after their home should be applied by us also with regard to our home, Germany, and the European home. The Bundeswehr largely determines our ability to be part of an alliance. It is an important factor of European stability, and this must remain so. Thank you very much.
