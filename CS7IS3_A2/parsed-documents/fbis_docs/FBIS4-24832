Fu made the remarks when he took over the CAL presidency from Yuan Hsing-yuan, who resigned earlier to take responsibility for the tragic disaster in Nagoya, Japan in which 264 of the 271 aboard were killed. Fu, 52, said air safety will be CAL's top priority and CAL will also work to provide the best service to passengers. He stressed that stringent safety standards requirements will help ensure air safety. Fu, who first served as a CAL counter clerk in 1966, becomes the first civilian to take the CAL's helm. Fu also took the opportunity to refute reports in the United States media that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will suspend CAL flights to the United States because of the Nagoya crash. Fu said that Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, was misquoted in THE WASHINGTON POST, which reported on the FAA decision. Fu also voiced his discontent over Japanese media reports that have not been confirmed by a Japanese task force investigating the cause of the air crash. Fu said Japanese reports that traces of alcohol had been found in the blood of the pilot and co-pilot of the ill-fated plane were not only unfair to CAL but also a serious violation of international practice. Fu said that he has conveyed his discontent to the special task force in Japan. This is the first time a high-ranking CAL official has openly voiced discontent about Japanese media reports on the disaster. During the change over ceremony Wednesday, Chiang Hung-yi took over the post of CAL chairman from Liu The-min. Chiang, 68, said that his top priority will be to deal with the aftermath of the Nagoya plane crash and to step up air safety.
