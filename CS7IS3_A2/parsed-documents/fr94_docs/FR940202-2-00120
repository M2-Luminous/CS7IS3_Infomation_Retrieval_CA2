FR940202-2-00120 FR940202-2-00071 CATEGORY IB a. If there is no evidence of continued nosocomial transmission, continue the intensive prospective surveillance (as in II&hyph;B&hyph;3, above) for at least 2 months after surveillance was begun. CATEGORY II b. If there is evidence of continued transmission: (1) Conduct an environmental investigation to determine the source(s) of Legionella sp. by collecting water samples from potential sources of aerosolized water, following the methods described in Appendix C and saving and subtyping isolates of Legionella spp. obtained from patients and environment. 227,375&hyph;382,404,406 CATEGORY IB (2) If a source is not identified, continue surveillance for new cases for at least 2 months, and, depending on the scope of the outbreak, decide on either deferring decontamination pending identification of the source(s) of Legionella spp., or proceeding with decontamination of the hospital's water distribution system, with special attention to the specific hospital areas involved in the outbreak. CATEGORY II (3) If a source of infection is identified by epidemiologic and environmental investigation, promptly decontaminate it. 417 CATEGORY IB (a) If the heated-water system is implicated: i. Decontaminate the heated-water system either by superheating (flushing for at least 5 minutes each distal outlet of the system with water at "65 ○C), OR by hyperchlorination (flushing for at least 5 minutes all outlets of the system with water containing "10 mg/L free residual chlorine). 403,408&hyph;410 Post warning signs at each outlet being flushed to prevent scald injury to patients, staff, or visitors. CATEGORY IB ii. Depending on local and state regulations regarding potable-water temperature in public buildings, maintain potable water at the outlet at "50 ○C or <20 ○C, or chlorinate heated water to achieve 1&hyph;2 mg/L free residual chlorine at the tap in hospitals housing patients who are at high risk of acquiring nosocomial legionellosis (e.g., immunocompromised patients). 338,383,393,400&hyph;403 (See appendix B.) CATEGORY II iii. NO RECOMMENDATION for treatment of water with ozone, ultraviolet light, or heavy-metal ions. 344,411,412,414 UNRESOLVED ISSUE iv. Clean hot-water storage tanks and water-heaters to remove accumulated scale and sediment. 346 CATEGORY IB v. Restrict immunocompromised patients from taking showers, and use only sterile water for their oral consumption until Legionella spp. becomes undetectable by culture in the hospital water. 384 CATEGORY II (b) If cooling towers or evaporative condensers are implicated, decontaminate the cooling-tower system using the protocol outlined in Appendix D. 415 CATEGORY IB (4) Assess the efficacy of implemented measures in reducing or eliminating Legionella spp. by collecting specimens for culture at 2-week intervals for 3 months. CATEGORY II (a) If Legionella sp. is not detected in cultures during 3 months of monitoring, collect cultures monthly for another 3 months.
