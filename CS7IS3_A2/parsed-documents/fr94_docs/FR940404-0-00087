The amended regulations are designed to contribute to the safety and security of Bureau institutions by providing more equitable telephone access to the rapidly expanding inmate population. The Bureau of Prisons is faced with an unprecedented increase in population, leading to a substantial overcrowding of Bureau institutions and a considerable strain on already limited resources. On February 10, 1994, the Bureau had 82,426 inmates confined in 73 institutions. These institutions have a total rated capacity of approximately 60,571 inmates. By explicitly authorizing the Warden to limit the maximum length of inmate telephone calls based on institution conditions, such as institution population or usage demand, the amended regulations increase the Bureau's ability to manage this large population by providing greater and more equitable telephone access to inmates. Under the former collect call system, it is very difficult for staff to enforce any time limits on inmate telephone calls. Some inmates are thus able to monopolize telephone use, increasing tensions in an overcrowded inmate population. The ITS, in contrast, can be programmed to terminate a call automatically after the expiration of a certain period of time, ordinarily 15 minutes, so that the telephone will be available for use by another inmate. In addition, it is reasonable to expect that debit-billing will affect the ability of some inmates to continue monopolizing the telephone. By having to pay for their calls directly, these inmates may be unable, or unwilling, to expend the funds to monopolize the telephone. The amended regulations also help Bureau staff to more effectively prevent telephone use by those inmates who have abused their telephone privileges. Under the former system, if an inmate had abused his or her telephone privilege, for example, by using a telephone to engage in criminal activity, and had then undergone an administrative hearing affording limited due process, a Discipline Hearing Officer could restrict the inmate's use of the telephone for a given period of time. However, there was no effective way to enforce that sanction. The Bureau was forced to rely upon staff to observe the inmate using the telephone after the restriction had been imposed. Given the fact that the Bureau incarcerates as many as 2,000 inmates in one institution, and that inmate telephones may be in various locations within the institution, limited staff resources make it very difficult to conduct continuous surveillance of specific inmates with restricted telephone privileges. With the ITS, the Bureau can mechanically block the telephone calls of those inmates on telephone restriction. 4. The amended regulations better assist Bureau staff in detecting and preventing criminal activity facilitated through use of the telephone. The former collect call system is more easily used by inmates to direct criminal activity from prison, such as committing fraud, facilitating drug operations, intimidating witnesses, and managing the fruits of their crimes. Cases have been developed over the years which involve attempts by inmates to defraud members of the public and, in some cases, financial corporations. Examples include credit card fraud, securities fraud, and various forms of insurance and tax fraud. This problem is not unique to the Bureau. In 1989, the telephone industry estimated an annual loss of $150 million from institutional toll fraud, including that which occurs in prisons. Officials from Consolidated Communications, Inc., a long-distance carrier for 25 correctional facilities in Illinois, were quoted by United Press International on July 5, 1993, as stating ``[f]raud is rampant because inmates have found ways to outfox the system that makes them reverse charges on long-distance calls made from prison phones. Bills for up to 20 percent of the long-distance calls are uncollectable.'' The Bureau notes that these losses have prompted the telephone companies and several state and local correctional systems to look at ways to solve the problems associated with the collect call system.
