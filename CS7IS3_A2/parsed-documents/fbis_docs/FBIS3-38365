Mock stressed this on Monday [31 January] in talking to the newly appointed ambassador of Bosnia-Herzegovina to Austria, Hadzo Efendic, who paid his first visit to the foreign minister. Efendic is the first ambassador of his country accredited to Austria. Mock stated that there is certainly no guarantee for a speedy peace. However, as the development has shown, deviating from the aforementioned principles would not bring a solution closer in any way.
