In September last year, this publishing house procured the literary and art work "Smelters" and other books of the northern half of the republic through a dissident academic organisation and reprinted it. Upset by this, the fascist clique reportedly detained Pak Chi-kwan, chief editor of the house, on April 21 on charges of violation of the notorious "National Security Law".
