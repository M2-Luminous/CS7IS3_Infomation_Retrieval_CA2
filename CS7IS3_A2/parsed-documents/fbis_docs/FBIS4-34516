The group's spokesman, Jorge Diaz Reategui, said that after defecting from the Maoist guerrilla organization, the 11 wended their way south with the assistance of international agencies including the United Nations. "First we went to Ecuador and later Brazil and Colombia," said Diaz Reategui, "but those countries did not agree to accept us as refugees." Diaz Reategui said he was a fighter with the group, known as Sendero Luminoso in Spanish, but had only participated in three conflicts. The spokesman said the UN was supporting the former senderos in Argentina. He added that he had been detained by police in Tucuman for 10 days.
