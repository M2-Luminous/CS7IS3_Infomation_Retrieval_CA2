FBIS3-29993 "dreas037_d_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 South Korea Government, Businesses To Develop Semiconductors SK2402005694 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 24 Feb 94 p 9 SK2402005694 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] A total of 50 billion won will be poured into the development of technology pertaining to semiconductor-manufacturing equipment over the next four years starting this year. Of the amount, the government will supply 20 billion won or 40 percent from the Basic Industrial Technology Development Fund. Chip makers such as Samsung, Goldstar and Hyundai will take part in the project along semiconductor equipment manufacturers. They will share costs for the development of technology with chip equipment makers and be obliged to purchase developed products. These steps are featured in a comprehensive plan to groom the semiconductor equipment industry disclosed by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Even though Korea has emerged as the second largest exporter of memory chips, the profitability of its semiconductor industry has rather dropped because of its heavy reliance on imports of chip manufacturing equipment. At present, the localization ratio of semiconductor equipment stands at a mere 12 percent. According to the ministry, there are some 80 chip equipment makers across the country with their capital mostly less than 500 million won each. Because of their weak financial status, they are unable to invest in the development of new equipment. Making matters worse is their high costs for management and financing. Last year, their investment in R&D (research and development) projects accounted for 4 percent of their turnover, compared with the average 8 percent for semiconductor equipment makers in the United States and Japan. Local production of chip equipment amounted to $14.5 million last year, a mere 12 percent of the $12 billion worth demand and a 1.7 percent of semiconductor production worth $851.2 billion. In terms of technology development, Korea is only able to manufacture simple semiconductor equipment used at research institutes, while the United States, Japan and other advanced countries enter the stage of mass-producing next generation products. The ministry said that the expansion in chip equipment production can be covered by local demand because semiconductor makers are increasing their investment in 4M DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and 16M DRAM facilities. Their combined facility investment last year rose 81 percent over 1992 to 2,000 billion won and it is expected to reach 3,000 billion won this year. If the four year-program is carried out as scheduled, local production of semiconductor equipment will amount to $750 million in 1997, the average 36 percent increase a year.
