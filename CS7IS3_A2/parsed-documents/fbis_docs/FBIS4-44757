The report also predicts that the beam waveguide cable will lose its relative importance as a current driving force for market growth in proportion as market focus shifts to shorter communication paths and this should lead to greater demand for optical transmitters, receivers and routing facilities. As predicted by the consultants, beam waveguide cable will shrink from 59 percent of the total market in 1992 to 44 percent in the year 1999, whereas receivers will increase in the same time period from nine to 17 percent since new technologies will facilitate connecting a number of receivers to shared transmitters. Market share for transmitters, in turn, will rise from 24 to 27 percent, for connectors, from six to eight percent and for couplers, from three to four percent. Originally, beam waveguides were installed above all on U.S. long-distance networks. But when expansion of the system was able to be mostly concluded in recent years, beam waveguide installation shifted to international traffic and increasingly to LANs and LAN routing. Up until now the optical communications industry has been dominated by North America, accounting for 48 percent of turnover in 1992. According to the report, there is likely to be a decrease since shipments from Pacific Rim countries can be expected to increase from 21 to 25 percent and from Europe, from 20 to 23 percent. Pressure to compete globally will increasingly move to the center of planning by manufacturers operating internationally. The consultants expect that there will be increased installations of beam waveguide systems. On the other hand they will be curbed by costs that still continue to be comparatively high. A large number of new market participants will be joining the global competition and strategic alliances are likely to attract a sizable share of the international market. As regards the micro-electronic undergirding for optical communications, the analysts proceed on the assumption that opto-electronically integrated circuits, even in the early phase of their development, are likely to be an increasingly attractive emergent and cost-effective alternative to the current status of component engineering, since they will contribute considerably to enhanced system performance. It is highly probable that fiber optic amplifiers will displace expensive electronic regenerators in optical long-distance communications systems.
