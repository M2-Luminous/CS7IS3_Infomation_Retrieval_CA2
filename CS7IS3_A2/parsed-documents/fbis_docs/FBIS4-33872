The first key vote of the Assembly took place last night. Representatives of the blocs who signed the Olivos Pact obtained an important victory -- by 182 votes for and 68 against -- with the approval of the internal regulations. Article 129 of those regulations establish the vote on the 13 points included in Article 2 of Law 23409 declaring the necessity of and opportunity for the reform. The Assembly immediately afterwards started to vote on the 144 articles of the regulations one by one. The process will continue during today's session. On 7 June, the Grand Front bloc announced it will withdraw temporarily from the premises during the voting on Article 129, while Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity] and provincial blocs will stay to vote against the article, even during the article by article voting process. The regulations were approved following eight days of extensive debates, during which nearly 100 convention delegates from the 17 blocs, more than just debating juridical matters, indulged in a marathon of speeches on the legitimacy of the Olivos Pact. Next week the Assembly will begin discussing specific items. The political debate reached a climax yesterday with the speeches of the main bloc leaders (Raul Alfonsin of the UCR, Augusto Alasino of the PJ, Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Grand Front, and Assembly President Eduardo Menem). Senator Menem gave a heated defense of the Olivos Pact, which he characterized as "innovative," and assured the delegates that he feels "even prouder" of having been one of the sponsors of the agreement "between the popular political forces" than to be seated in the Assembly. Former President Raul Alfonsin, using a tone clearly different from the climate of controversy involving the Assembly, preferred to dip into political philosophy to argue in favor of his bloc's position and uphold "Chacho" Alvarez and the Grand Front's "positive attitude," which "grants legitimacy" to the constitutional reform. "Chacho" Alvarez spoke just before Alfonsin. He appealed to the majority of Justicialist and Radical delegates' "common sense" "to open up the package" and thus permit their participation in the process "without insulting our consciences." [passage omitted] The Constituent Assembly will install the 10 commissions established in the set of regulations next week. Five of these commissions will be headed by the PJ, three by the UCR, one by the Grand Front, and one by Modin. [passage omitted]
