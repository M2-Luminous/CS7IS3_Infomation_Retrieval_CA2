This old, and well-tested formula from the days when the Serbs ranted (on TV) about being endangered in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina can again be heard on Radio Television Serbia at prime time under the disguise of "special" political programs. For example, on Tuesday [21 June] (also on Sunday, and particularly on Monday) a special program was broadcast by TV Belgrade: The guests, leaders of the Serbs in "the former, unrecognized Yugoslav republic of Macedonia" [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] seemed to compete in explaining how they had been "denied their collective rights," while at the same time they admitted that they were given their "individual rights" (the right to work, the freedom of speech and expression, the freedom of movement), and that they had no problems there. As in previous (already seen) cases, "decent Macedonians" phoned in to Television Belgrade to express their "support for the right of the Serbian people to decide on their own fate," and to reject simultaneously "the possibility of forming some sort of a Macedonian party in Serbia." Of course, the entire program was dedicated to the same issues: The census in Macedonia is illegal because "no one wants to admit that there are 250,000 of us in Kiro Gligorov's state" (all data reveal that this figure is blown out of proportion at least several times); the census is illegal since "it is aimed against the Serbian national entity"; the census is illegal since it "neglects the rights of the Serbs who are defending their hearths," and so on. Experience tells us that such TV programs have usually been followed by going to war for "the liberation of territories" or for "the defense" of the aforementioned "hearths." The examples of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are too fresh to be easily forgotten. The only question is: Will TV Belgrade (led by Milorad Vucelic] take that one step that separates peace from war, or will it stop after the census is over, along the lines of "let bygones be bygones"? In both cases, the smell of TV gunpowder is very much in evidence.
