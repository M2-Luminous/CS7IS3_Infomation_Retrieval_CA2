[Milewski] Good morning. [Woyciechowski] Poland is a partner of NATO as of yesterday. Half of the Polish people do not understand what that means. [Milewski] Poland has declared its willingness to participate in a program which was proposed at the NATO summit on 10 January and which is called Partnership for Peace. The program was offered to all postcommunist countries, as well to those of the former Soviet bloc. It is an individually oriented program, the contents of which contents will be negotiated and determined with each country separately. [Woyciechowski] You say, "will be negotiated." That means Poland has not negotiated the program yet, in terms of details. [Milewski] Not yet, since all Prime Minister Pawlak did in Brussels yesterday was to officially declare Poland's intention to join the program. [Woyciechowski] Who will negotiate the details -- the Defense Ministry [MON], the Sejm, or the National Security Bureau? Which of these institutions will determine the details? [Milewski] It will be the government, that is beyond any doubt. The most important ministries in the government that will be dealing with it will be MON and the Foreign Ministry. [Woyciechowski] Poland is NATO's third partner -- prior to us, the treaty was signed by Romania and Lithuania, with Estonia signing tomorrow. Did we all sign the same thing [words indistinct]? [Milewski] It is exactly the same thing. It is simply an official intention of a given country to participate in the Partnership. All the texts are exactly the same and the agreements that will be signed between specific countries and NATO -- these will be individually oriented. [Woyciechowski] The document we signed -- is that a very detailed text comprising 100 pages, or perhaps is it half-a-page long? [Milewski] It is just one page. [Woyciechowski] So it is a very general kind of document. [Milewski] Yes, it is a completely general kind of document which only expresses intentions which are in accordance with so-called Western standards regarding democracy in a given country, transparency of military budgets.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the Polish military budget transparent? [Milewski] In my view, it is too transparent.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Too transparent, meaning? [Milewski] Meaning that there are simply no longer any....[pauses] A military budget should be a matter of confidence or secrecy regarding some items, because it is after all the issue of a country's entire defense system. As far as Poland is concerned, both our defense industry, the budget, and various military issues are too public nowadays -- no legal provisions concerning state secrets are being observed. [Woyciechowski] So the devil is in the details, in how specific the treaty will be, I mean the treaty between Poland and NATO. It depends on the size of those military units which we intend to devote to cooperation with NATO. Do we know precisely how big they will be? [Milewski] No, we do not. We are deliberating right now what kind of units should be proposed to NATO within our version of the Partnership for Peace program. It is definitely known that it is the West's intention for Poland to have a greater contribution to UN peace efforts.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Greater than Estonia and Lithuania. Mr. Minister, what is a platoon? How many soldiers are there in a platoon? [Milewski] There are about 30 men in a platoon, if you mean a classic platoon of infantry or mechanized units. [Woyciechowski] You have heard -- just like everyone else -- a statement by a Polish officer who said on television a few days ago that Poland will designate an entire platoon for cooperation with NATO. [Milewski] No, that is a misunderstanding. As far as the long term is concerned, Poland intends to be an equal member of NATO with full rights -- just as we want to be an equal member of the European Union, a member with full rights; our goal is full integration of our country with Western organizations, so as far as the long term is concerned, the entire operational Armed Forces of the Polish Republic will be placed at NATO's disposal in case of a conflict.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this will not be a platoon but many divisions, many armies. What do you mean by the entire operational forces? [Milewski] The entire Polish operational forces currently comprise 11 divisions plus four independent brigades. [Woyciechowski] Is that a great deal compared with our neighbors like Lithuania, Estonia, or Romania? Do we have more than them? [Milewski] We have much more than Lithuania or Estonia -- what we have is within the limits which were granted to us by the Vienna treaties; that is to say, about 250,000 soldiers and officers. [Woyciechowski] When you say long term -- what specific year do you mean? When will it happen? [Milewski] It will happen when the member [as heard] will be a regular member of NATO -- I think it will happen in the next few years, before the year 2000; even Western politicians have been saying that recently. It seems that a period of three to four years should be sufficient to prepare Poland for membership in NATO, which would be with full rights and equal membership. Which does not mean that we are not looking for a political protection shield against increasing dangers from the East much earlier than that date. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us return for a moment to those divisions which we will be able to earmark for cooperation with NATO some day -- this could happen perhaps within three to four years, as you said. What must we do to those divisions and soldiers? Do we have to change their uniforms, machine guns, boots, and everything else, or will these preparations be easier than that? [Milewski] No. All that has to be changed is the command system with regard to the aforementioned divisions and brigades, and also the way of communication among them and with the higher command -- that must also be changed. [Woyciechowski] What does that mean? [Milewski] Communications systems and fire-steering systems must be made uniform, simply.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it mean that military commands will be given in English as of now? Fire! -- will that be in English? [Milewski] Not in the case of commands at the level of a platoon, about which you asked, but commands given at the level of a division will of course have to be in English. [Woyciechowski] That means that Polish generals will be communicating with their British or American colleagues in English? [Milewski] Not just Polish generals, but all Polish officers should speak English, just as is the case with armies of Western, non-English-speaking countries. [Woyciechowski] Newspapers publish a poll today conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center in which Poles are asked the question: In case of a danger to its independence, can Poland rely on Western aid? Fifty-one percent of Poles say absolutely no, 32 percent say yes, and 17 percent -- don't know. Could you answer the question for those 17 percent of Polish people who do not know? So the question is: Can Poland rely on Western aid or not? [Milewski] Poland can rely on Western aid on the condition that Poland can first demonstrate it is capable of making its own defense effort -- then Poland can rely on being provided additional foreign aid. But if Poland does not show any effort on its own and if it was to wait passively for someone to give Poland a protective umbrella as a gift, then in that case, it will not receive the umbrella. [Woyciechowski] So to translate into plain language what you have said here: Poland should defend itself for some days or some weeks, and only then.... [pauses] Is my understanding correct, or did I overdo it? [Milewski] You missed the point. Once the conflict is in progress, then it is too late since such conflicts erupt very suddenly nowadays. In practical terms, the issue is that in a situation where Poland has already joined the Partnership for Peace program, Poland should show its high activity as part of the program; it should demonstrate a real effort toward integration with NATO forces. In that case, we will have a response from the other side. But if all we do is passively wait and just keep asking for shipments of new tanks, new aircraft, and also keep asking for protection, and if we fail to demonstrate the effort I mentioned -- in that case we may not receive aid. After all, there is a simple rule in effect in the West: Help yourself first, and only then will I also [words indistinct] aid to you. [Woyciechowski] Now, the efforts that you have talked about -- do they reflect the political will of the Polish Government and the will of other Polish authorities? Or is this simply money? [Milewski] First, this is a political will.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this will present today? [Milewski] Well, yes, it is declared by all three branches of authority in Poland: by the legislative, executive, and.... [pauses] Well, the judicial authorities are actually not making any statements.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But there is the problem of money. [Milewski] No, an organizational effort must also be made by the entire defense system in Poland, in which, of course, the Army is the most important element. [Woyciechowski] Today the arms industry has announced a four-hour strike. Some factories will be on strike all day. In one of today's dailies, SZTANDAR [MLODYCH], I have found information that one of the things that the unionists are protesting is the fact that the government has recently blocked two major contracts for the sale of tanks; they claim that these two contracts for the sale of Polish tanks abroad would have saved the arms industry in Poland. Is this true? [Milewski] I do not know anything about the government's blocking any contracts of our arms industry. However, I do know that it is very difficult to sell our military equipment abroad because it really is of poorer quality than products available in the West. The advantage that we have is that our products are much cheaper. However, our closest neighbors are somehow more skilled in trade -- they are in the same conditions as we are.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are probably referring to the Czech Republic, are you not? [Milewski] I am referring to the Czech Republic, Hungary. [Woyciechowski] Is it today not so that some countries would be willing to buy Polish tanks and Polish cannons; some countries would like to purchase them because they are not sold by anyone else -- for political reasons -- and we do not want to sell anything like that to those countries because they are under UN sanctions? [Milewski] If a country is under UN sanctions, then we certainly must respect that. [Woyciechowski] And we cannot violate them, even for economic reasons? [Milewski] No, we cannot violate them because in such a case the political as well as material losses that our country would incur would be much greater than any profit derived from such a contract. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us change the subject for a while. Do you think that the prime minister has the right to recall a deputy minister without the consent of the relevant minister? [Milewski] This question should actually be addressed to the prime minister. The prime minister appoints both deputy ministers and general directors in all ministries; that is to say, if we go by the rule that the mode of appointing those officials is the same as the mode of recalling them, then we must say that the prime minister undoubtedly is entitled to recall them. However, the relevant minister should be involved in this process because it is, in fact, he who selects his cooperators. Nevertheless, in exceptional situations, as we know, also such situations are possible -- not only in Poland, but also in the West. [Woyciechowski] Some people believe that in recent days, or in recent weeks, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], one of the coalition partners, wants your scalp -- it wants the scalp of Milewski. It wants you recalled from the post of MON deputy minister. [Milewski] Well, no one has told me about that; no one told me that someone is after my scalp. However, I can sometimes hear the criticism -- which is completely unfounded -- that I allegedly fulfill various functions in various segments of authority, which is said to violate the principle of the division of powers. I would like to say now that this is false, because the principle of division of powers means that different people are related to the legislative branch, different people to the executive branch, and different people to the judicial branch. These powers should not be combined; for example, deputies, who are members of the legislative branch, should not be appointed ministers and deputy ministers. Now, the president's and the prime minister's segments are two segments of the executive branch which should be integrated with each other. Therefore, shortening the distance between the Belvedere establishments and the establishments of the Office of the Council of Ministers is not only possible, but should be recommended. [Woyciechowski] Like a good soldier, you are defending yourself through attack. I have discerned this allusion to the coalition's desire to introduce a minister of SLD to MON. You implied that a deputy should not simultaneously be a deputy minister. What does the situation in MON really look like: Is it going to have a minister proposed by SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], or not? [Milewski] If there are experts who will be able to fulfill various functions -- functions of deputy ministers, general directors, department heads -- then I can see no reason why they should not fulfill them; in MON, and certainly in MON under Piotr Kolodziejczyk, people are selected for reasons other than political-- the main criterion is that of expertise. However, if the only purpose of the operation of introducing new deputy ministers is the limitation of constitutional powers of the minister in his ministry, then this just cannot be accepted. [Woyciechowski] Is it possible, then, that within a month new deputy ministers -- proposed by SLD or PSL -- will come to MON? [Milewski] I find it difficult to make any statement on behalf of the minister, who is on leave; however, as far as I know about the plans that he approved and submitted to us when he was taking over the office of MON head, I can tell you that he will not make any selection based on criteria other than substantive, and that he will not agree that any other -- political or ideological -- criteria be taken into account. The minister accepts exclusively the criterion of expertise. [Woyciechowski] This means that new deputy ministers will come if they are nonpolitical experts. Can we say that? [Milewski] This is what I think I can say on behalf of my superior. However, he has not authorized me to.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The minister is on holiday in the mountains. Do you not like winter in the mountains? Will you be in Warsaw, or will you leave? [Milewski] I like winter in the mountains very much. I was a mountaineer. However, I no longer spend my holiday in the mountains -- not only because I have no time for that, but also because I am already past the age when one can climb mountains. [Woyciechowski] Do you ski? [Milewski] No, I do not. I have never skied; I have always devoted my free time to mountaineering. [Woyciechowski] Now, let us change the subject once again: Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy. What do you think of him? [Milewski] I think that Zhirinovskiy himself is a dangerous character, maybe as dangerous as Hitler. However, the emergence of Zhirinovskiy is the result of a certain climate which has dominated Russia. This climate is dangerous. In a situation of great poverty in everyday life, many people in that country are still being fed by the vision of imperialism, a vision of being the most important country in the world; it is an abstract vision that is contrary to the well-understood interests of the Russian people and other peoples of the Russian Federation. Now, the emergence of Zhirinovskiy has made it obvious to us that such a social trend is dominating in that country. It is a very dangerous trend. Thus, I would say that Zhirinovskiy is actually doing us a favor -- by revealing this trend, the existence of which many Western politicians did not want to believe. Well, we know perfectly well that it is there. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Milewski] Good-bye.
