FR940406-0-00152 FR940406-0-00011 9. A new §86.153&hyph;98 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §86.153&hyph;98 Vehicle and canister preconditioning; refueling test. (a) Vehicle and canister preconditioning . Vehicles and vapor storage canisters shall be preconditioned in accordance with the preconditioning procedures for the supplemental two-diurnal evaporative emissions test specified in §86.132&hyph;96 (a) through (j). For vehicles equipped with non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the canister must be loaded using the method involving butane loading to breakthrough (see §86.132&hyph;96 (j)(1)). If the refueling test procedure is started within 24 hours of the completion of an evaporative emission test on the same vehicle at the same ambient conditions, the fuel tank drain and fill and minimum soak period requirement described in §86.132&hyph;96 (b) and (c) may be omitted from the refueling test procedure. (b) Seal test . The Administrator may choose to omit certain canister load and purge steps, and replace them with a bench purge of the refueling canister(s), in order to verify the adequacy of refueling emission control system seals. Failure of this seal test shall constitute a failure of the refueling emission control test. For integrated systems, this bench purge may be performed after the exhaust testing in order to obtain exhaust emission test results. Non-integrated system seal testing shall be performed using paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) Without the exhaust emission test . The Administrator may conduct the canister preconditioning by purging the canister(s) with at least 1200 canister bed volumes of ambient air (with humidity controlled to 50 # 25 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air) maintained at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm directly following the preconditioning drive described in §86.132&hyph;96 (c) through (e). In this case, the canister loading procedures and the vehicle driving procedures described in §86.132&hyph;96 (f) through (j) and in paragraphs (c) through (d) of this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 minute time requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to time after completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple refueling canisters, each canister shall be purged separately. (2) With the exhaust emission test . The Administrator may conduct the canister preconditioning by purging the canister(s) directly after the exhaust test (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). The canister shall be purged with at least 1200 canister bed volumes of ambient air (with humidity controlled to 50 # 25 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air) maintained at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm. In this case, the vehicle driving procedures described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (d) of this section shall be omitted, and the 10 minute and 60 minute time requirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to time after completion of the bench purge. In the case of multiple refueling canisters, each canister shall be purged separately. (c) Canister purging; integrated systems (1) Vehicles to be tested for exhaust emissions only shall be processed according to §§86.135&hyph;94 through 86.137&hyph;96. Vehicles to be tested for refueling emissions shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in §§86.135&hyph;94 through 86.137&hyph;96, followed by the procedures outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) To provide additional opportunity for canister purge, conduct additional driving on a dynamometer, within one hour of completion of the hot start exhaust test, by operating the test vehicle through one UDDS, a 2 minute idle, two NYCCs, another 2 minute idle, another UDDS, then another 2 minute idle (see §86.115&hyph;78 and Appendix I of this part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be operated according to the specifications of §86.128&hyph;79 during the driving cycles. A cooling fan(s) shall be positioned as described in §86.135&hyph;94(b). (d) Canister purging; non-integrated systems . Within one hour of completion of canister loading to breakthrough, the fuel tank(s) shall be further filled to 95 percent of nominal tank capacity determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter) with the fuel specified in §86.113&hyph;94. During this fueling operation, the refueling emissions canister(s) shall be disconnected. Following completion of refueling, the refueling emissions canister(s) shall be reconnected. Special care shall be taken during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of the fuel system. Vehicle driving to purge the refueling canister(s) shall be performed using either the chassis dynamometer procedure or the test track procedure, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. The Administrator may choose to shorten the vehicle driving for a partial refueling test as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, the required volume of fuel shall be driven out of one tank, the second tank shall be selected as the fuel source, and the required volume of fuel shall be driven out of the second tank. (1) Chassis dynamometer procedure . (i) Vehicle driving on a chassis dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS cycle. Driving in testing performed by the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles as driven in the manufacturer's certification testing. (ii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank fuel capacity (total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual fuel tanks) shall be determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the nearest 0.1 gallon (0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a UDDS cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety. (iii) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from the first tank to the second tank shall occur at the 10 percent volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which this occurs. (iv) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer. The vehicle may be parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if required. (v) During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be positioned as described in §86.135&hyph;94(b). (2) Test track procedure . (i) Vehicle driving on a test track shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel tank capacity has been consumed. Driving performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS cycle. Driving performed by the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles as driven in the manufacturer's certification testing.
