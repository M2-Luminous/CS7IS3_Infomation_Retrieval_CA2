SUMMARY: On November 30, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) rejected the Department of Commerce's redetermination on remand of the final results of the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from Italy (56 FR 31751, July 11, 1991). Federal-Mogul Corp. v. United States, (Slip Op. 93&hyph;225, November 30, 1993) ( Federal-Mogul ). Specifically, the CIT rejected the Department's methodology in the redetermination for calculating the amount of the tax adjustment that was added to United States price. The CIT entered final judgment on the value added tax issue. The results covered the period November 9, 1988, through April 30, 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 10, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph A. Fargo or Richard Rimlinger, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington DC, 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 4, 1993, the CIT in Federal-Mogul Corp. v. United States, (Slip Op. 93&hyph;95), remanded the final results of the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from Italy (56 FR 31751, July 11, 1991) to the Department for the reconsideration of a number of issues. For one of these issues, the Court ordered the Department to determine the exact monetary amount of the value added tax (VAT) paid on each sale in the home market, to make certain that the amount of the VAT adjustment added to the comparable U.S. sale is less than or equal to this amount, and to add the full amount of the VAT in the home market to foreign market value (FMV) without adjustment. On September 1, 1993, the Department submitted to the CIT its redetermination on remand on the VAT and other issues. On November 30, 1993, the CIT ruled upon Commerce's redetermination in Federal-Mogul. In this decision, the CIT rejected the Department's redetermination methodology for calculating the amount of the VAT adjustment added to USP. In its decision in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ( Timken ), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in Federal-Mogul on November 30, 1993, which rejected the Department's redetermination methodology for calculating the amount of the VAT adjustment added to USP, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final results. Pursuant to the decision in Timken, the Department must continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise pending the later of the expiration of the period for appeal or the conclusion of any appeal. Further, absent an appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the Department will amend the final affirmative results of antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from Italy to reflect the change in the VAT adjustment calculation methodology which was ordered by the CIT and direct liquidation in accordance with the amended determination. Dated: February 18, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5035 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
