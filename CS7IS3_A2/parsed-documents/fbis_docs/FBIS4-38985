In accordance with the resolution adopted by the parliament on Wednesday evening, early next week President Leonid Kravchuk is to submit a list of measures which can be used by Ukraine's state bodies in case the Crimean law-makers refuse to abolish legal acts which contradict to the Ukrainian Constitution. The Ukrainian parliamentarians also reconfirmed that their resolution dated 20 May which suspends the decree of the Republic of Crimea on the restoration of the Crimean Constitution dated 6 May 1992 is still in force (This decree stipulates that the relations between Simferopol and Kiev are to be built on the basis of agreements; it fixes the right of the Crimean residents for dual citizenship and for the creation of their own armed formations -- INTERFAX). The parliament has set up the commission on legal policy to work out its proposals on introduction of changes into Ukraine's legislation, which admit "direct abolition of the legal acts of Crimea's Supreme Soviet," within two weeks." IF Note: Kravchuk offered to the parliament to form Ukraine's Constitutional court as soon as possible which will be authorized to abolish all "illegal" decisions of the power bodies of the Republic of Crimea. Kravchuk explained the need of its creation by the restriction of authorities of the Supreme Soviet which, as Kravchuk said, "can only suspend but not abolish illegal acts of this autonomy." Commenting on the resolution adopted by the Ukrainian deputies, observers point out that it testifies to the adherence of the absolute majority of the parliamentarians to political methods to solve the Crimean problems. To this effect experts point to a small probability of a sharp worsening of relations between Kiev and Simferopol before the 26 June presidential elections. According to the leader of the parliamentary delegation at the negotiations with the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Butkevich, "the Ukrainian party must do its utmost it order to halt the negative processes in Crimea." "We must do our utmost in order to accomplish this diplomatically without utilization of force." At the same time observers indicate that the parliament majority did not support the initiative of the pro-Russian oriented parliamentary group Yedinstvo (Unity) which had proposed to ensure the equality of the Ukrainian and Russian languages in a legal way and to consider a possibility of Ukraine's transformation into a federation. It also failed to take into consideration the proposal of the leader of the inter-regional deputies group Leonid Kuchma to grant "a special status" to Crimea. While forecasting further development of events, experts draw attention to the recent statements and restrained position of Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who declared that Ukraine's Defense Ministry has not sent a single soldier to Crimea over the last period of time." Meanwhile, circles close to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov do not rule out possibility that Kravchuk's team can use a tough scenario. As the leader of the presidential apparatus and the Crimean government Viktor Minin asserts, "Kiev maintains a 99-percent readiness to introduce presidential ruling in Crimea." In his interview with INTERFAX Minin declared that the situation on the peninsular "is used for a struggle at the highest political level" in Kiev (in this case Meshkov's spokesman means the wide spread version about Kravchuk's strive to take advantage of the tension around Crimea in order to postpone the presidential elections." As Minin predicts, introduction of a direct ruling in Crimea may lead to a tough confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. "Russia will be forced either "to wash itself" or "to react," he noted and in case President Yeltsin does not undertake any moves then "Mr Zhirinovsky (leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- INTERFAX) and Russian servicemen will urge either tough measures from this power or replacement of power."
