In the suburban areas of Shanghai, China's largest city, farmers engage in collecting stamps and newspapers, taking photographs, dancing, organizing musical bands, and so on. A kind of existence that specialists call "suburban culture" is emerging there. "Suburban culture" in Shanghai is characterized by the combination of modern city culture and traditional Chinese rural culture. Economic development in the rural areas provides it with good support. Two brothers named Du collected various kinds of newspapers years ago. Now, they have collected 15,000 kinds of newspapers, to rank among China's top four newspaper collectors. They have published 5,000 digest stories. They have also finished the first editions of "a collection of masthead calligraphy in national evening newspapers" and "a collection of mastheads dedicated by Mao Zedong". A group of farmer photographers has emerged in Shanghai. Some of their photographs have been sent overseas for exhibition. A village named Maqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai has a long history of lion dancing. After being revised by the new generation of farmer artists, the lion dance has become a new type of folk dance combining gymnastics, dance and movie tricks together. Musical bands are active in the countryside of Shanghai. Some of the folk orchestral music they have adapted or created has been welcomed not only by Shanghainese but also by people in other parts of China attending the Shanghai international art festival. Entertainment equipment like video recorders, pianos, household computers and compact discs, which could only be seen in the houses of rich city dwellers in the past, have made their way into the households of ordinary farmers. Rural farmers now frequently take part in singing and karaoke contests, piano grading concerts and instrumental concerts held in the city. Modern cultural activities initiated in the big cities are spreading from the city districts to the suburbs, to outlying areas, and then to the surrounding country villages. Fifteen "cultural hot points" currently popular in Shanghai districts can all be found in its outlying villages. Experts have pointed out that the "suburban culture" characterized by its combination of traditional Chinese culture and modern urban culture, is a necessary result of China's economic and social development. And it will help to reduce the cultural gap between cities and the countryside.
