ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is proposing revisions in subpart C (Child Labor Reg. No. 3) to provide an exception from the permissible hours and time standards for minors 14 and 15 years of age when employed as attendants in professional sports. The proposed exception limits such employment to outside school hours and to duties customarily performed by typical sports attendants (e.g., batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, etc.). Technical modifications are proposed in the procedure for obtaining occupational variations for 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in Work Experience and Career Exploration Programs. Among other revisions to update these regulations, the Department is also proposing to delete the procedures relating to hazardous occupation determinations in Subpart D (Child Labor Reg. 5), which, for the most part, have been replaced by the notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. DATES: Comments are due on or before July 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, room S3506, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, Attention: J.

Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rules contain no reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511). The information collection requirements contained in §570.35a, which are not modified by this proposal, were previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215&hyph;0121. The general FLSA information collection requirements (including requirements contained in part 570) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the control number 1215&hyph;0017. II. Background The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 14 years for employment in most nonagricultural occupations. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods and under conditions which will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being. These provisions also permit 16- and 17-year- old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, without hours or time limitations, subject to prohibitions on occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous, or detrimental to the health or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, minors 14 and older may be engaged in general employment, subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, in agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with written parental consent or on a farm where the minor's parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be employed outside of school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short season crops for a maximum annual period of eight weeks. The regulations for 14-and 15-year-olds are known as Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in subpart C of 29 CFR Part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: (1) Outside school hours;
