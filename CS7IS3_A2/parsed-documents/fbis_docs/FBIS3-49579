We hail this decision, which we consider an element that strengthens the security of our country, and of the other countries in this part of our continent, in the new circumstances brought about by the changes that have taken place after the elimination of totalitarian regimes in Central and East Europe. Romania is vitally interested in the establishment of a viable system of security on our continent based on the institutions of European dimension that throughout history have proved their capacity to ensure peace and tranquility in Europe. We view the NATO as the major organization capable of ensuring the necessary framework for stability and security in Europe. Romania's relations and cooperation with the countries that are members of the NATO is based both on the historic tradition of Romanian civilization in the European region, as well as on the community of interests and engagements toward the values of democracy and the rule-of-law state that our society regained after the 1989 December revolution. On this occasion, I also deem it necessary to reassert Romania's constant interest in becoming a NATO member, a goal also shared by all important political forces of our country and I declare that we accept the Partnership for Peace also as a preliminary stage in the integration process and a form of many-sided cooperation aimed at the gradual fulfillment of the requirements imposed by the statute of membership of the Alliance, reads the Romanian president's declaration. The basic document established with a view to substantiating the Partnership for Peace has an outstanding importance and sanctions fundamental principles for the relations between partners, among them the engagement to consolidate the democratic processes, the abstention from the use of force or the threat of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any state, respect for existing borders, and the need to settle conflicts solely through peaceful means. The statements also assess that immediate measures will be taken for the competent bodies to examine the documents of the Brussels summit, so that, in the shortest time possible, discussions can start with a view to signing the basic document and proceed to negotiations for concluding other documents that are required by participation in the Partnership for Peace. In conclusion, the Romanian president's statement reads: Romania is ready to assume all responsibility incumbent on it as a participant in the partnership and, in the future, in the Alliance, and it is determined to make a contribution to the joint efforts to ensure stability in the region and in Europe as a whole.
