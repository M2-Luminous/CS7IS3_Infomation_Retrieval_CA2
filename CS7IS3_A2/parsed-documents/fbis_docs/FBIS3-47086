The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) proposed in December 1991 to raise the maximum criminal fine from 5 million yen to more than 100 million yen against firms which violated the Antimonopoly Law by bid-rigging, the sources said. The FTC was planning the revision following U.S. criticism of Japan's bidding system in the Structural Impediments Initiative talks. Nakamura, then deputy chairman of a panel on the Antimonopoly Law in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and other LDP legislators, who had close links to the construction industry, strongly opposed the FTC's plan. Nakamura allegedly received an undeclared donation of 10 million yen in mid-January 1992 from then Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama. The LDP legislators, including Nakamura, stopped resistance to the plan in February 1992, the sources said. The FTC submitted its revision plan on the law raising the maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March 1992 and the LDP panel accepted the plan. A senior member of the LDP panel said the FTC set the amount after frequent contact with Nakamura, and another member said disgraced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru directed the legislators to fix the amount at 100 million yen. Meanwhile, the FTC was investigating a bid-rigging scandal involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture but in May 1992 the commission announced it would not file a criminal complaint and ordered 66 companies to stop alleged unfair business practices. A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest general contractors, reportedly served as head of a "club" of the 66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the prefecture. Industry sources said there was a possibility that the FTC gave up filing criminal complaints in exchange for fixing the maximum fine at 100 million yen. FTC sources deny such a deal. Kiyoyama and other top Kajima executives were arrested last year over the giving of bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi.
