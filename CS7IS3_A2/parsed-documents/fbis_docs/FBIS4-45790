The road to cleaning them up is a long one--indeed, the authorities have only begun to find all the sites. There is a lack of tested methods for dealing with the poisoned inheritance. Mustard gas, Tabun, Clark, phosgene: chemical weapons are a chapter of German history that is still far from being closed. "Munitions dumps in the Federal Republic were not recognized as an environmental problem until the 80's," as Andre Dahn of the BC Berlin Consult GmbH in Berlin recently explained at a professional meeting of the Offenbach environmental instititute. On 13 January 1993 the Federal Republic signed the international chemical weapons convention, which among other things also requires the destruction of chemical weapons. But it is not only wars which left explosive traces in the soil. Over 1,000 Soviet army properties and almost 2,000 posts of the former National People's Army are heavily polluted with all kinds of military discards, such as munitions, kerosene and oil. NATO troop exercise locations which are to be used by civilians can be added to the list. It took a long time for the Federal government to consider the legacy of two world wars. It was the end of 1993 before the Federal Environmental Department in Berlin (UBA) published a study in which sites in Germany suspected of having discarded munitions were included. The list gave 4,336 sites on which discards from munitions production or unsecured storage places for war material could be located. But the experts of the UBA are far from being able to say which materials are polluting the soil and the groundwater and to what degree. "The study is based on researches in archives and thus represents a purely historical and descriptive summary," as Manfred Kurka, expert advisor on suspected toxic waste sites, explains. Some Federal Laender have launched their own initiatives in the meanwhile. In Lower Saxony, for example, an interagency task force set up by the Land government presented an initial survey as early as 1988. In mid-1989 the environmental agency in Hannover began systematic risk evaluation, investigating more than 400 suspected sites so far. The investigation itself involves four steps. Preliminary research provides initial data on the status of a possible munitions dump, including location, use and owners. In checking and documenting, archival materials, contemporary eyewitness reports, aerial photographs and geological conditions are consulted, interpreted and evaluated. Then in the preliminary investigation soil samples are taken and groundwater measurement locations are set up. The last step is the detailed investigation with increased sample density and more precise anaylses. The final result of the investigations is a status report which states the potential risk of a given site. It turns out that in Lower Saxony the suspicion of toxic waste was not confirmed in about half of the sites. The other approximately 200 locations are more or less highly contaminated; further investigations are planned. For five suspicious sites it has been established that must be cleaned up, secured or at least watched. According to Hans- Juergen Rapsch, report leader for discarded munitions in the Lower Saxony department of the environment, the risk evaluation alone has cost the Land DM45 million so far. For the cleanup of particularly problematic sites costs in the hundreds of millions are anticipated. These are amounts which the Land cannot raise alone. "But the Union does not feel responsible for discarded munitions," Rapsch reports regretfully. A discarded munitions financing law drafted by Lower Saxony which had clearly been supported by the Federal Council died in the Bundestag at the beginning of 1993. It provided for the Union participating more in cleanup costs. But financing is not the only problem. The question of how discarded munitions can be cleaned up at all has not yet been answered. Therefore, a model cleanup is to be carried out in Stadtallendorf in Hesse which will be supported by the Federal Research Department. At the site of the largest explosives factory in the Second World War the soil is contaminated with trinitrotoluene (TNT) and production chemicals. The Lurgi Environmental Participation Company GmbH in Frankfurt wants to use its Deconterra process, in which the soil is washed and the toxic concentrate is then burned. But the project, which was started in 1990, is suffering delays. "The soil-washing plant probably cannot be started up until the beginning of 1996," says Birgit Hofmann, press spokeswoman in the Hessian department of the environment. She says that at the moment another hazard evaluation is being carried out for built-up parts of the area and a cleanup plan is being set up. The investigation and evaluation of suspicious sites is to be facilitated by special computer programs. Thus the Industrial Plant Operating Company (IABG) in Ottobrunn has developed a model for the evaluation of hazards posed by military sites and discarded munitions (MAGMA). There is information stored in the data bank about 227 chemicals, particularly those specific to munitions. Both the toxicity of the substances and environmental factors like precipitation, flora and soil type enter into the evaluation. The result of the calculations is a socalled M value between one and ten, which expresses whether the potential hazard is small or a site must be treated urgently. MAGMA has been used so far to investigate suspicious sites on the former property of the western group of Soviet troops. At the moment, according to Hoppe, it is still in the programming phase, but within a few weeks it should be possible to install MAGMA in the computer. Since March of 1993, in a project supported by the Federal Research Department at the former explosives factory at Tanne near Clausthal- Zellerfeld, the IABG has been investigating whether microorganisms can deal with TNT in the soil. The first result of the investigations is that bacteria present in the soil do metabolize TNT, but in the process they form substances which either have not yet been analyzed or are equally poisonous. For most war material the only method so far has been burning. But so far there is only one plant for it. The military science department (WWD) of the Federal army in Munster has been running a two-chamber furnace since 1980 in which so far 75 tons of pure war material have been destroyed. Since the furnace only achieves temperatures up to 1200 degrees C, toxic arsenic is only inadequately bound. Thus a second furnace is planned, construction on which is to being this year, according to Hermann Martens, group leader in the WWD. This furnace is to operate according to the Swiss plasmox procedure. At temperatures up to 1600ï¿½C, which are achieved with the help of an arc light, the arsenic-containing material vitrifies. Toxins are then washed out in such small quantities that according to Martens the slag can be used as a building material.
