Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, added in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the movement is very keen "not to cause the agents issue to explode conditions in the self-rule areas. Thus the Palestinian Authority must arrest those who murdered a Hamas member as soon as possible, bring them to trial, and publish the files for the Palestinian people." Ghawshah was commenting on the incident in which Zahir Salluhah, an element from the military wing of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions in Gaza, was killed. He described it as "a serious incident, and Hamas puts the entire responsibility on the Palestinian Authority's shoulder." He added that "any laxity in pursuing the murderers will mean that Hamas has to return to defending itself." He pointed out that "it has been proved to anyone who cast doubt on Hamas' strength that the huge mass funeral in the Strip last Friday, which Palestinian police commanders had to join, proves that Hamas is very popular among Palestinians." Ghawshah pointed out that "Hamas' strength elements are used against the Zionist occupation, not against the Palestinian people, to which Hamas belongs." Ghawshah revealed the reasons for the decline in armed operations against the occupation forces last month. He said that "Hamas' jihad and resistance plans have decreased since the Palestinian Authority assumed its duties -- which is expected, the aim being to reengage the occupation [forces] through jihad and resistance, taking account of the changes that have taken place on the ground." The official spokesman promised to "step up the jihad and armed operations against occupation forces in a manner that will certainly dash the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's hopes."
