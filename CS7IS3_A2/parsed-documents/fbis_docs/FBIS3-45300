The details of the accord were not immediately available. The signing coincides with the January 17 deadline set by Washington for a bilateral agreement to be reached or for China to face quota cuts of up to 35 percent in textile exports to the United States. The accord will be signed by Chinese foreign trade minister Wu Yi and a U.S. delegation led by Jennifer Hillman, the spokesman told AFP, without elaborating on the nature or duration of the agreement. The US delegation opened talks with the Chinese side here Saturday in a last-ditch attempt to reach a new agreement following the expiry of a previous accord on December 31. Washington threatened the quota cuts to protest against alleged Chinese textile trans-shipments to the United States through third countries -- valued at two billion dollars -- in violation of the previous quota agreement. China, which feels it has been unfairly targetted by Washington, had responded by threatening retaliatory action should the United States go ahead with the unilateral cuts.
