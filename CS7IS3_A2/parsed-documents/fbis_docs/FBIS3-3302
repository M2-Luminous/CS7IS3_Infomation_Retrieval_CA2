In response to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's demand that China must make marked improvement in the field of human rights in order to meet the requirements set forth by President Clinton for extending China's MFN status, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Premier Li Peng, and President Jiang Zemin all explicitly indicated that China resolutely opposes the linkage of the human rights issue with MFN. "China and the United States can discuss their differences on the human rights issue on the basis of equality in order to increase mutual understanding, and no one should exert pressure on the other. China will never accept the U.S. viewpoint on human rights. If the United States rescinds China's MFN status, China will not be the only victim, and the losses incurred by the United States will not be less serious than those by China. China mainly relies on its domestic market, and has a strong ability of self-reliance. The United States will lose a huge market. It is hoped that the United States will properly handle this matter." At the same time, China also detained dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan for a short time before Christopher's arrival, and "invited" them out of Beijing in order to prevent the reoccurrence of private meetings between U.S. officials and Chinese dissidents. This time, China's tough attitude on the human rights issue has deeply perplexed some people overseas. If the United States also responds in a tough manner and flatly denies China's MFN trading status, would both sides suffer losses? This would certainly cause losses to Hong Kong. Did China actually consider these consequences? According to sources in Beijing, the Chinese leaders were not prompted by a sudden impulse to adopt a tough attitude and decide not to stoop to compromise; instead, their response to the U.S. demand was based on careful consideration, and their decision was made after they weighed all the advantages and disadvantages. The critical factor was a secret meeting between a senior American official and Wei Jingsheng. In February, the United States sent Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck to visit Beijing in order to make arrangements for Christopher's visit. This was an official visit, and Shattuck should have respected diplomatic protocol and arranged his schedule and itinerary in coordination with his host. However, Shattuck privately met with Wei Jingsheng and other dissidents without notifying the Chinese Government and consulted the dissidents about whether China's MFN status should be maintained. Some of the dissidents demanded that the United States rescind China's MFN status, while others asked to meet with Christopher. China lodged a protest about this event with the United States, but the U.S. side insisted that its diplomats had the right to meet foreign citizens as they liked. In these circumstances, the Chinese public security authorities summoned Wei Jingsheng and other dissidents in early March, and the purpose was to give a message to the U.S. authorities and Christopher, who would visit China in mid-March, that China was not weak or easy to bully and they must not think that China would kowtow to the United States on the human rights issue in order to keep its MFN status. In view of the action taken by the Chinese public security authorities, it was likely that the United States would once again threaten to rescind China's MFN status, but China was determined to stand firm and not yield. Through its propaganda organs (primarily the left-wing newspapers in Hong Kong), China explicitly indicated: "A country must safeguard its sovereignty and security and guarantee that there is no interference in its internal affairs. Foreign countries must not be allowed to support the trouble-making activities of domestic political dissidents. Moreover, Wei Jingsheng remains a convict on parole, who must abide by the parole rules. If he violates these rules, the Chinese public security authorities certainly have the right to summon him and give warnings to him in accordance with the law. The United States tried to interfere in China's law-enforcement procedures and parole rules, and such behavior violated international law." Furthermore, when meeting with Christopher, Qian Qichen blamed Shattuck for "disregarding China's laws and taking actions of interfering in China's internal affairs" without naming him. Qian said that this "deeply disappointed China." Jiang Zemin also criticized the U.S. official without naming him when talking with Christopher by saying that, in the United States, "some people did not really care about the rights, interests, and well-being of the vast number of Chinese people; instead, they were only concerned about a very small number of people who attempt to subvert the Chinese Government and undermine China's stability. This is in fact a political and legal issue rather than a human rights issue." The remarks uttered by Qian and Jiang made people realize more clearly the essence of the United States' "human rights" diplomacy. According to the sources, although China gave the United States a message that it would not yield on the human rights issue in order to keep its MFN trading status, this did not mean that China does not care about the continuation of MFN status. Instead, according to their assessment of the current domestic and international situation, the Chinese authorities thought that the United States would not recklessly rescind China's MFN status. According to WAISHI DONGTAI [TRENDS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS], an internal newsletter distributed to those cadres engaged in foreign affairs, shortly before Christopher's visit to China, a Chinese diplomat gave a speech at a seminar in the CPC Central Party School and reviewed the Sino-U.S. struggle over the MFN issue in the past. He said: "Not only in China, but also in the international community, a great deal of research has been done on this issue, and all of the researchers reached a common conclusion: MFN status must still be given to China, because the national strength of the United States has substantially declined, and it needs economic cooperation with other countries. On many international issues, the United States can no longer impose its own ideas on its Western allies. For example, in Bosnia and Somalia, the United States ran into snags again and again; even when dealing with affairs in Haiti and the Philippines, the Unites States can no longer continue its club- wielding policy." The diplomat said: First, the recent spy scandal caused a rift in U.S.-Russian relations, and Russia stopped following every instruction dictated by the United States due to domestic pressures; second, there have recently been trade frictions between the United States and Japan, and Japan has seen rising domestic demand for trade equality, even though the United States is using "Super 301" as a heavy weapon to force Japan to open its market; third, Clinton himself has been seriously plagued by the "Whitewatergate affair," and people are watching to see whether he will be forced to step down like Nixon in the "Watergate incident." Therefore, some people are saying that Clinton is being besieged on three sides. If he decides to discontinue China's MFN status, he will certainly be facing opposition from U.S. business circles and will then be "besieged on four sides." On the other hand, through reform and opening over 15 years, China's economy is continuously, rapidly, and stably developing. It primarily relies on its domestic market and has a strong ability of self-reliance. It will be able to withstand the impact of the discontinuation of its MFN trading status in the United States. Moreover, China may join GATT within the year, and, if this comes to pass, MFN will no longer be an issue. Even if the United States does not extend China's MFN status, China will not have to endure the unfavorable effects for a very long time. The comprehensive analysis shows that both the domestic and international situations are favorable to China, and China does not have to soften its principle and position on the human rights issue for the sake of maintaining MFN trading status. Of course, a compromise may still be made on some minor issues so that the other side may find it easier to save face, and this will help solve the problem in the end. All this shows that the Chinese authorities had made good preparations when facing the U.S. challenge this time, and they had full confidence in the final results of their plan. The sources also said: Although China is opposed to linking human rights with MFN, and the differences between the two sides over their approaches to human rights were not narrowed, China still expressed its understanding of the U.S. Government's situation, in which it must give a report on the number of political prisoners to the U.S. Congress. Therefore, without giving up its principles, the Chinese side also made certain concessions in order to make it easier for the Clinton administration to save face. Before leaving Beijing, Christopher said at his news conference that China gave him detailed information about 235 prisoners and agreed to provide information about another 106 Tibetan prisoners in the near future. China also agreed to continue discussions with the International Red Cross about visiting Chinese prisons, and, for the first time, China expressed its willingness to discuss putting an end to its practice of jamming VOA broadcasts to China with the U.S. side. The five- point cooperation agreement reached by the two sides during his visit to China also include a statement signed by the two sides on "the memorandum on products made with prison labor." China also decided to send a trade delegation, the largest one in the past 15 years, to the United States in April to seek U.S. investment for nearly 800 industrial and agricultural projects. The Chinese side maintained that, if Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations can be freed from the interference of the human rights issue, not only China will benefit, but U.S. economic circles will also meet a rare historic opportunity for developing economic and trade cooperation with China.
