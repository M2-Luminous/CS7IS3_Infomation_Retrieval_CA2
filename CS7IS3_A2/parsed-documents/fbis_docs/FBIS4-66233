For 15 years, from the rural areas to the cities, from the coast to the interior, from the non-state-owned economy to the state-owned economy, from micro to macro, and from the economic domain to the scientific and technological, educational, and political domains, the reform has become the main performer in China's social and economic life, and its successes have become the focus of world attention. When we look back on and sum up the basic experiences of the 15 years of reform, we see that China's reform took the path of gradual expansion of the proportion of market regulation and of gradual enhancement of the role of market mechanisms, in broad outline: market orientation and the way of gradual advance. Market Orientation: Reform's Basic Achievement There are many reasons that China's reform was able to obtain universally acknowledged successes; and the reform itself employed the strategy of "market orientation, and the way of gradual advance." In the l5-year reform there were roughly four stages. In the first stage, from the end of 1978 to October 1984, the reform first of all made a breakthrough in the rural areas and obtained successes; in the cities, starting from expansion of the enterprise's right to take the initiative, experiments at selected points in comprhensive and special-item reforms were carried out. In the second stage, from October 1984 to September 1988, the focus of reform shifted from the rural areas to the cities, and reform was launched in a comprehensive way in all domains. In the third stage, from September 1988 to the end of 1991, in the economic domain the environment was brought under control, the order was rectified, and the reform was deepened. The fourth stage, which started at the beginning of 1992, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talk on his inspection of the south as its starting point, and the 14th CPC Congress set the goal of the reform of China's econmic system as the establishment of the socialist market economy system. The pace of reform and opening up to the outside world markedly quickened, and the reform entered a new historical stage. Following the constant deepening and expansion of the reform and opening up to the outside world, profound changes occurred in the pattern and operating mechanisms of China's economic system: --With public ownership as the main part, many economic forms coexisted, including ownership by the whole people, collective, privately operated, individual, and foreign joint venture, and a pattern of joint development was gradually formed. The single ownership structure of the original economic system--a structure that was separated from the level of productive forces--was broken, and township enterprises, "the three kinds of enterprises that were either wholly or partially owned," and the private and individual economies developed swiftly. In 1992, in industrial output value, enterprises owned by the whole people accounted for 48.4 percent, the collective enterprises accounted for 38.2 percent, and the individual, private, and "three kinds" enterprises accounted for 13.4 percent; in retail value of social commodities, the enterprises owned by the whole people accounted for 41.3 percent, the collective enterprises accounted for 27.9 percent, and joint venture, individual, and private enterprises accounted for 30.8 percent. The rapid development of the non-state-owned economy and the non-public economy infused new energy into China's economy. --Based on the principles of separation of government and enterprise and of separation of proprietary rights and management rights, the management mechanisms of state-owned enterprises are being changed and are progressively moving toward the market. Starting with smoothing out the relationship between state and enterprise, and with the implementation of the enterprise's right to take the initiative in production and management, enterprise reform of various forms has been carried out. Ninety-three percent of the industrial and commercial enterprises under whole-people ownership have implemented various forms of the contract management responsibility system, and, in order to promote the rational combination of important production factors, they have formed a number of new-type enterprise groups. For some small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the practice of "rent, transform, or sell" was instituted. In recent years, in order to explore effective forms for implementing public ownership, new-type enterprise systems have been set up, and a large number of enterprises have carried out the reform of instituting varied forms of the stock system. By the end of 1992 there were more than 3,700 stock enterprises in China; at present, 92 of them have been publicly put on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. --With the market primarily determining prices, the commodity market system, which gives full play to the role of market mechanisms, has been initially formed. Now, controls on the greater part of commodity prices have already been loosened, and the proportion of prices fixed by the state is less than 15 plercent of the total amount of agricultural products purchased. In the ex-factory total sales of industrial consumer goods and means of production, the proportions of state-fixed prices are only 10 and 30 percent, respectively. At the same time, the stock exchange, foreign exchange market, labor market, technology market, land market, and other markets for important factors are now being swiftly developed. --The macroeconomic regulation and control system has begun to change from primarily direct administrative control to making indirect regulation and control primary with the comprehensive application of economic and legal measures. The state plan broke away from direct controls, such as fixed quotas, apportioned investment, mandated projects, and apportioned materials; in addition, command planning has been greatly reduced. In industrial production, before 1979 command planning accounted for more than 95 percent of the entire industrial output value, and now it accounts for only 7 percent. The means of production under the state's unified distribution and the one-category commodities under planned purchasing have also been correspondingly reduced. At the same time, the effect of financial policy and monetary policy is becoming larger and larger. With distribution according to work as the main part, a social distribution pattern of various forms of distribution existing side by side is appearing, and a new social security system is being formed. The policy of encouraging some people to become wealthy by honest work before others do so and of appropriately widening the income gap has greatly arouused the enthusiasm of workers. --Opening up to the outside world has become an enormous motive power for promoting domestic reform and developing it; and a new pattern of multilevel, omnidirectional, multiform opening up to the outside world, in which there is the progression "special economic zone--coastal and border open cities--interior," has been formed. By the end of 1993, in China there were 84,000 registered "three kinds of enterprises," $58.7 billion in contracted investment, and $11.2 billion in actual investment. In its foreign trade system, China will, in accordance with international practice and GATT regulations, control imports and exports in order to meet the requirements for expanding economic and technological cooperation abroad and for taking part in international market competition. Opening up to the outside world is not only manifested in attracting foreign capital; what is more important is that it makes reference to foreign advanced technology and successful practices, in order to accelerate the welding of China's market to the international market. The profound changes in economic mechanisms and operating mechanisms have brought enormous changes to China's social and economic life. Over the 15 years of reform, China's GNP has grown at an annual average rate of 9 percent, its overall national strength has increased markedly, and the people's standard of living has risen markedly. In addition, people's ideas and concepts have been liberated from a long period of confinement, and in practice, with the spirit of emancipating the mind and of seeking truth from facts, there is constant exploration and a gradual push toward deeper involvement in reform. Gradual Advance: A Successful Experience Under the premise of already making clear the direction and goal of reform, the movement and method of reform is to gradually move forward, and not to apply "shock treatment" to reach the goal in one bound. In the practice of China's reform, the form that "gradual advance" is manifested in is that the reform of the system is a process of preceding from point to area, i.e., there is a breakthrough at a key point, which then evolves and permeates everything. The specific practice is to first make experiments at selected points and then popularize the results, i.e., when any reform measure appears, first there is an experiment at a certain place or a certain enterprise, and after a result is obtained it is popularized throughout the country. To this end, the state before and after the fact decided on some experimental zones for reform and opening up to the outside world and on some experimental cities, experimental counties, and experimental enterprises for comprehensive reform or single-item reform, which undertake the task of testing each reform. For example, reform first begins in the rural areas and then gradually makes the transition to cities; first begins with the setting up of special economic zones, after which it radiates to the coastal region, and then deeply penetrates the interior region; first begins with developing the township, individual, privately operated, and "three kinds of enterprise" economies, and, after strengthening the roles of market mechanisms in these domains, causes these roles to infiltrate the state-owned economy; and first begins in the microeconomic domain, where the right to take the initiative in production management is expanded, and then promotes reform in the planning, financial, and banking macro-domain. This way of pushing forward reform by gradual advance and infiltration is a creation of the Chinese people, and is also the result of constant exploration in practice. A typical example of the method of "gradual advance" is price reform. In the past price reform was always a difficult problem for some countries, and it was also the first difficult problem that we ran into in our reform. The Chinese government and economic academic circles both saw the importance of price reform, and understood that price marketization was the premise for the full display of the role of market mechanisms and of fair competition between enterprises, and for guiding the optimum deployment of natural resources. However, at the same time they also saw that price reform had to be integrated with the cultivation of the market, and that price reform was a fast variable while market cultivation was a slow variable, and that to demand that a slow variable be adapted to a fast variable was to be divorced from reality. Price reform requires a necessary financial base in order to meet the need for smoothing out various price relations and to ensure that in the process of reform the interests of the broad masses were not harmed. Price reform is also linked to the charateristics of different industries or products; the elastic coefficient of some industrial prices is high, and price controls are relaxed it will be possible to achieve rapidly a market equilibrium. Production in some industries or of some products, first, requires a large investment; second, has a long production or contruction period; and third, has higher technological requirements, and, after price controls are relaxed for a long period of time, there cannot be a market equilibrium and thus there is a trend toward inflation. Precisely because we recognized these characteristics, in our price reform we did not adopt the tactic of relaxing controls at one fell swoop, but rather adopted the policy of positive safety, and, based on the characteristics of different industries and different products, at different periods of time put forward some reform measures. Even if there are still heavy tasks in China's price reform, it may be affirmed that China's price reform has made the transition to a critical period. Why did China's reform adopt the way of gradual advance? The reasons are many-sided. Generally speaking, this reform is China's third revolution, i.e., it will make a fundamental change in the economic system's operating mechanisms. This is an unprecedented creative undertaking, and there is no ready-made model we can copy, so we can only proceed in an orderly way step by step and try to find our way in practice. And the deeper reasons have a many-sided basis. First, the way of gradual advance has its basis in understanding. Reform is an important matter that affects all domains of social life and that touches on every member of society, both basically bringing interests to the people and adjusting to different degrees the relationships of the economy's specific interests and authority. This means that reform must obtain the understanding and support of all quarters of society. For a reform measure, particularly a measure that adjusts the structure of interests, there must be a process of gaining society's understanding. Therfore, before comprehensively promoting a measure, there must first be an experiment, and when it gradually becomes understood by people it can become a conscious action of theirs. Otherwise, in the course of reform there will be numerous difficulties, and contradictions will be intensified, causing all previous efforts to be wasted. Second, the way of gradual advance has a logical basis in the system. All links in the economic system are closely connected, both requiring coordination and forming complete sets, and the accurate selection of breakthrough points, and then the uncoupling of one link at a time, and in the end untying "fast knots." Looking at China's experience, we see that reform often does not start from the most critical, most difficult place, but rather the breakthrough is made at the place where there is a large probability for success and where it is easy to solve technical problems. For example, in enterprise reform, the reform of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is extremely important, but it is very difficult. The reform begins with expanding the right of enterprises to act on their own initiative, and at the same time it vigorously develops the non-state-owned economy, forming outside the state-owned economy a competitive "colony," which puts pressure on the state-owned economy, proomoting the reform of the state-owned economy. It is very difficult to imagine that a process of reform without this kind of gradual advance would find a path to pass through into the state-owned economy. Third, the way of gradual advance is determined by China's complex national condition. China's basic national condition is a large population, a vast area, and an unbalanced economic development; the level of economic development in all places is uneven, and there are also differences in them in the conditions and basis for reform. This determines that reform in each place cannot "quick march," and that it should be recognized that in some places reform will go somewhat faster while in other places it will go somewhat slower. This kind of unbalanced reform, in reality, is a process of conforming to nature and developing by gradual advance. Fourth, the way of gradual advance is also a political requirement. China's reform needs a stable political and social environment; a radical way of reform would be bound to go beyond the capability of society to bear it, causing shocks in society that in the end would harm the reform. China is a large country with a population of more than 1.2 billion, and obtaining stability is an overriding task that must be done. Therefore, the selection of the way of reform must proceed from the question of whether it is advantageous to promoting social stability. New Starting Point of Reform: Establishment of the New System of a Socialist Market Economy China has already decided that the goal of reform is the establishment of the system of socialist market economy. Without the slightest doubt, this is a continuation and development of the past 15-year "market orientation" reform, but it also has pushed China's reform to a higher stage. To establish the system of socialist market economy there must be formed the inherent unity of public ownership and market economy; under the state's active, effective macro-regulation and control, the market mechanisms play a fundamental role in the disposition of natural resources, and are able to bring about an economic system that combines a high standard of efficiency with a high standard of fairness. To establish the system of socialist market economy, first of all we must boldly assimilate and use for reference the successful experiences in the practice of foreign market economies, abiding by the laws of modern economics. This is mainly a case of all commodities and important production factors going on the market, and, in the disposition of natural resources, the market mechanisms play a fundamental role. By making clear the relationship of property rights and making pluralistic the main part of interests, the enterprise will truly become a corporate entity that operates on its own and that is responsible for its own profits and losses, and the main part of market competition. Mainly through economic measures, the government will indirectly regulate and control economic activity; and the unified, open domestic market, with the organic "joints" of the international market, and in accordance with the current international criteria and practice, will carry out economic activity. The socialist market economy must be an integration of public ownership and the market economy; public ownership must adopt basic forms that meet the demands of the market economy and that are achieved through the market economy system. China's basic national condition also determines that, in the market economy, the component parts of the economy are diversified and include state, collective, private, and foreign venture ownership. With public ownership primary, the diversified forms of ownership will coexist for a long time, jointly develop, and compete on an equal basis. Following the development of the market economy, there will be an interpenetration of different owners' properties, more and more mixed ownerships forms will appear, and the specific forms of public ownership will be diversified. Establishing the system of socialist market economy is a piece of complex systems engineering. The main frame of this system has the following aspects: --Establishment of a modern enterprise system with distinct property rights, initiative in operation, responsibility for profits and losses, and competition on an equal basis. Enterprises of all types are not divided by form of ownership. They are all formed legally and recorded in registers, and they have the authority to have real ownership and use of property and to legally dispose of property. For the reform of state-owned enterprises, we must start with smoothing out the relationships of property rights and carrying out the industrial transformation of enterprises in competitive industries, so that they mainly become different types of stockholding companies, for example limited-liability companies or joint-stock limited companies. At the same time, based on market economy laws and the characteristics of different industrial sectors, under the premise of ensuring the increase in value of state-owned property, we must vigorously take the initiative to readjust the industrial distribution structure of state-owned property. --Establishment of a modern market system in which the market regulations are sound, the organization is complete, and the main part's behavior is normal. Controls on the prices of the great majority of commodities and important production factors are to be relaxed, forming a mechanism for deciding prices with the market as primary. This entails formation of an integrated system of markets for commodities and markets for important production factors; elimination of industrial monopolies, regional blockades, and sector divisions; and formation of a unified, open market structure in which there are diversified economic components, diversified economic forms, and multichannels for circulation, and in which domestic and foreign trade are balance, domestic and international markets are linked. The focus of the current stage in market construction are opening up the market for important production factors, smoothing out the prices for important production factors, and ending the "double-track system" in important production factors. --Establishment of macroeconomic control and indirect regulation and control system in which the goal of balance in total volume and optimum structure of the economy is promoted, and in which economic policies and economic levers are the main measures; and the corresponding establihsment of a crack, highly efficient economic regulation and control organizational structure, in which the structure is rational and the duties are clear, and which meets the demands of the market economy. Now, the changes in government functions and the establishment of a macro regulation and control system have been seriously delayed, a situation that has become a serious restraining factor in the construction of the system of socialist market economy; and we must be determined to make breakthroughs in these respects. In the reform's advanced system of financial payment in which payment is made partly in kind and partly in cash, on the basis of a clear demarcation between central and local rights, the standard divided-tax system is to be practiced. There is to be an acceleration of the reform of the banking system by perfecting the central banks' macro-regulation and control mechanisms, and by making an effort to promote the business-like transformation of the commercial banks. There is to be an acceleration of the setting up, with the enterprise taking the initiative in investment as the main part, of an investment system that practices management by category. --Establishment of a social security system in which social insurance for unemployment, for old age, and for medical treatment is the main part. The new-type social security system must integrate social security mechanisms and stimulus mechanisms. Currently, the focus must be on getting a tight grip on establishing a national unified organizational structure for social security management, on formulating a unified policy, and on enhancing management and supervision. There will be separation of government affairs, entailing the setting up of a nonadministrative organization for managing social insurance, and for legally engaging in raising, using, maintaining and increasing the value of the social security fund in order to reduce erosion and waste in the fund. Establishing the system of socialist market economy is a formidable task. In general, China's reform still can only gradually advance in order, and step by step make the transition to this system and it cannot engage in "shock treatment." However, this does not exclude the fact that reform at certain times and under certain conditions, or reform in certain regions can progress more quickly or to a greater degree. It should be seen that "breakthroughs from point to area" were not very different and that at present reform has entered the historical stage of "storming fortifications." We must be determined to break through the contradictions on some deeper levels; if we are not decisive the losses could be larger. Therefore, the point at which "to storm the fortifications" must be accurately selected, an advantageous and opportune time must be selected, action must be adroitly guided according to circumstances, some major reform measures must be pushed forward, and the transition to the system of socialist market economy must be accelerated.
