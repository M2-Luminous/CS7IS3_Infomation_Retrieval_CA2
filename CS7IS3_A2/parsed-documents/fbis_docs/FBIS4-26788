China, the biggest victim of opium in the 19th century, knows best the deadly effect of drugs on a nation as well as a person. It was not until the establishment of New China in 1949 that the world's most populous country achieved total elimination of drug abuse and trafficking as a result of a series of successful campaigns. However, international drug rings using China as a transit route have led the resurgence of drug-related problems in the country in the past few years. Tons of heroin have been intercepted and thousands of traffickers of different nationalities arrested. In the first quarter of this year alone, China cracked more than 4,900 narcotics-related cases, seizing 1,000 kilograms of heroin and 476 kilograms of opium. The nation's horrendous experience with opium has made it the deadliest foe of narcotics, be it heroin, opium or marijuana. And the government's relentless stance on this score enjoys wide support of the people at large. In the face of increasing drug trafficking and abuse, both central and provincial governments have stepped up the fight against such illegal activities. The National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC), the top anti-drug agency, has vowed more than once to deal with the drug-related crimes most sternly. Established in 1990, NNCC was reorganized recently. Headed by Tao Siju, Minister of Public Security, the high-powered commission is composed of 15 senior officials from ministries of Public Security, Civil Affairs, Justice, Finance, Foreign Affairs and the Customs as well as the military. The commission is in charge of stopping drug trafficking, curbing drug abuses and launching anti-narcotics publicity drives. Local authorities, especially those in border areas, have also published drug-control regulations suited to local conditions to combat the crimes. Various campaigns have been launched to mobilize the public to join in the fight. While imposing heavy punishments on narcotics criminals, including the death sentence, central and local governments have also carried out rehabilitation plans, which have weaned thousands of people off drug addiction. To stop any loopholes, the central government has tightened control over chemicals that might be used to process drugs by decreeing that 32 substances cannot be exported without licence. Drug abuse is becoming more and more an international issue which cannot be effectively curbed unless all nations join hands. China has been active all along in the fight against narcotics. Its successful interceptions of cross-border drug trafficking have prevented tons of heroin and opium from being smuggled via China. To wipe out the scourge of narcotics, however, calls for comprehensive international co-operation. The nations should exchange experiences and share information. With concerted and unremitting efforts we will be sure to win this new Opium War.
