FBIS4-64704 "drweu088_q_94012" FBIS-WEU-94-088 Daily Report 1 May 1994 TURKEY Columnist Speculates on Political Crisis Columnist Speculates on Political Crisis TA0505185394 Istanbul MILLIYET in Turkish 1 May 94 p 16 TA0505185394 Istanbul MILLIYET Turkish BFN ["Political Bulletin" column by Derya Sazak: "Inelegant Dealings"] [Text] An early evening at the residence ... Tansu Ciller is quietly listening to the former minister whom she has not seen for quite some time: "We cannot hold the group together if you do not let go of the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party] and form a coalition with ANAP [Motherland Party]. It is uncertain where the dissolution within the TPP [True Path Party] will lead. I am afraid the intervening forces will take power if we do not do anything. The prime minister breaks the silence when the conversation is directed to speculation regarding the army: Ciller's reaction is: "Actually problems will arise if I go." It is interesting... Before the 27 March elections, Mrs. Ciller who said "If we fail the PP [Prosperity Party] will come to power," is trying to communicate the message that the General Staff's Office will not be pleased with the political void that will emerge when she "withdraws" as a result of the pressure on her which is the inevitable result of the economic crisis. Actually, Turkish politics have been led in the wrong direction in recent weeks. Impossible scenarios are envisaged. What is dramatic is that there are democratic writers who talk about an "elegant" 12 March model [an ultimatum from the military and the formation of a nonpartisan government] in their columns and define as "encouraging" those developments which will open the parliament to outside intervention. As if today Turkey is governed by a government which does not enjoy the confidence of the Assembly! As if soldiers are at the door!... As if the sound of marching troops is heard again and a situation exists where a coalition has to be formed hastily with ANAP instead of the SDPP. As if the army submitted or will submit a memorandum! No. A situation which necessitates a takeover by the army is not existent in the country today. And it will not exist tomorrow. Because a new government will emerge from within the parliament if Ciller fails. There are no other alternatives in democracies. Paving the way for a military intervention by conducting searches for an "elegant" nonpartisan approach will mean hindering Turkey from moving in the same circles as first rate democratic countries, downgrading it. Unfortunately, the "intervention" theses of civilians confuse everybody from the businessman to the parliamentarian, from former ministers to the prime minister. Afterward, there are mindless people presenting their formula of "nonpartisan interim government." Unquestionably, there are lots of scenarios discussed in Ankara. However, aren't we overthrowing the democratic regime, which we believe in and defend, by discussing these alternatives and exaggerating our estimates of their feasibility? Whereas, it is possible to point to the failures and successes, without confusing the people. This is the responsibility that falls on the press and on the enlightened people of the country. Looking at the current political upheaval in our country it is possible to envision the following scenarios: Government Without Ciller Overthrowing the TPP-SDPP coalition without one of them withdrawing on its own can be achieved only by a referendum. 226 votes are needed for a referendum. The present coalition cannot be overthrown without these 226 votes. The government falls only if the SDPP withdraws from the coalition or Ciller resigns. As long as Mrs. Ciller is the TPP's leader, transferring the premiership depends on her own will. Otherwise, the way to an "extraordinary congress" is barred to her in view of the TPP regulations regarding changing prime ministers. ANAP-TPP Coalition Yilmaz states that he is ready for all coalition alternatives and is proposing a government without Ciller. It is assumed that if Mrs. Ciller is out of the coalition then she will certainly not continue to be the leader of TPP. Ciller, in turn, knowing that the ANAP-TPP coalition will oust her, is trying to perpetuate the SDPP coalition as long as she can. One of the preliminary conditions for an ANAP-TPP coalition is the dissolution of the present government. Saracoglu's Technocrats Former Central Bank director Rusdu Saracoglu comes to mind first. When Saracoglu's name was uttered at a Young Businessmen's Association meeting with the participation of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, the "rating" of the technocrat model increased. Although Saracoglu denies these speculations, as a precaution, his dossier is being blown out of proportion. Ekrem Ceyhun Incident Ceyhun's pretense at playing the role of an impartial prime minister, at a time when he has completely withdrawn from politics, by writing reports on how to save the country may be the outcome of Cankaya's "half premiership" calculations. Seeing the "capabilities" of the present cadre, Demirel may be thinking "let Tansu withdraw and I will govern the country." Or, Mesut Yilmaz may have thought of Ekrem Ceyhun as a fitting prime minister in case a coalition is formed with the TPP. Ecevit Model Also under discussion is a coalition that will be formed by Democratic Left Party leader Ecevit with the big groups in the Assembly. Cindoruk's indecision and Ecevit's vision of mastering foreign and national policies contributes to his name being put forward as prime minister both by ANAP and by groups in the parliament with common sense. Yes, it becomes more difficult to reach a solution when there are so many alternatives. When thinking of overthrowing Ciller, some people tend to think about undemocratic solutions. Mrs. Ciller will go one day, but it will take us years to reestablish democracy if we end up dissolving the parliament in our search for an "elegant" interim regime. We have watched this movie before. We cannot bear to go through it once more. In the 21st century, it will be a shame to live in a Turkey where the government will pass from hand to hand with coups d'etat.
