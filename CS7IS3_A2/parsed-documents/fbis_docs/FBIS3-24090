Oshchenko: "Energy Crisis Remains Trump Card in Political Dealings"] [Text] On Friday Acting Kray Administration Head Valentin Dubinin, Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov, and Yuriy Ivanov, chief engineer of "Dalenergo," held a joint press conference together with directors of large industrial enterprises concerning the situation in the Primorye [Maritime Territory] power industry. In his introductory statements, Kray Vice-Governor Valentin Dubinin noted that the situation continues to be extremely complicated. By Friday there were 532,000 tonnes of coal in the kray's coal yards, whereas on the same day last year there were 1,191,000 tonnes. Valentin Dubinin said that a sum of 35 billion rubles, which was finally allocated by the government in the form of subsidies following the persistent appeals of Kray Governor Nazdratenko and "Dalenergo" Director Basharov, was already on its way to its destination, the coal workers of Siberia. At the press conference, however, a shocking statement was heard to the effect that the 35 billion-ruble boost would only make it possible for the kray's power system to operate normally for a maximum of 20 days. Meanwhile, a statement issued by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko from Moscow, disseminated last week by the kray administration's press service, said that the billions procured by the governor would make it possible for Primorye [Maritime Territory] residents to make it through the winter in warmth. Nevertheless, "Dalenergo" chief engineer Yuriy Ivanov was not thinking of political gain, but was being straightforward when he said that in the near future it would be necessary to reduce energy consumption by another 3.5 million kw/hr. As you will recall, the industrial enterprises that shut down last week reduced energy consumption by 3 million kw/hr. According to Ivanov, in Vladivostok alone there were more than 60 such enterprises. Ivanov stated that in the coming days the electric power station may begin using coal right off the trucks: only coal transported from the open pits will be burned. This will mean, said the "Dalenergo" chief engineer, that heat and light will shut off in residential districts not according to a schedule for an hour of day, but for 6 - 12 hours, and possibly with no forewarning. If "Dalenergo" does not receive funds to cover its indebtedness from kray enterprises, to include those which belong to the Vladivostok municipality, then "in 10 days our time will run out," Ivanov said. As was explained during the conference, the notorious 35 billion rubles was for coal that had already been burned in the electric power station's furnaces in January. After that coal for Primorye will once again be on credit. Vladivostok mayor Viktor Cherepkov said that the policy of procuring subsidies in Moscow was short-sighted. In the mayor's opinion, these billions would exacerbate, not reduce the problem of indebtedness. Viktor Cherepkov also expressed doubts that Vladivostok, which collects almost half of all taxes in the kray, had a budget deficit, thus signifying planned deficit spending on the part of municipal enterprises, to include PZhETs, enterprises that are part of the heat network, and so on. Meanwhile the "Dalenergo" chief engineer commented on the mayor's statements saying: Such claims would be justified in a situation that was the least bit normal, but not at all under the emergency circumstances that exists today. A VLADIVOSTOK correspondent questioned Cherepkov regarding reports on local television about a statement he supposedly made to the ITAR-TASS agency, alleging that there is a large store of coal in Primorye, and that subsidies were procured from Moscow only to be given to "mafioso structures." In response, Viktor Cherepkov stated it was necessary to address such questions not at him, but at the organization disseminating such reports. At the same time he stressed that the kray's coal fields were more than adequate, but that funds had not been invested in their development, and that the kray's coal industry was dying. "Dalzavod" Chief Engineer Viktor Kalinichenko summed up the contradiction in opinions well when he said that once again the energy crisis is being used like a playing card in the political aims of the opposing sides, the kray and city administrations. In his opinion, it is necessary to find a compromise at all costs. A situation in which tens of thousands of people are essentially out of work, enterprises have come to a standstill, and housing construction has once again started simply does not allow for political intrigue.
