FR940318-0-00190 FR940318-0-00023 Users must observe the limitations on C 4 F 10 acceptability by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity may possibly be of concern are: i. Applications involving confined spaces where egress is difficult, such as in civilian and military transportation applications including aircraft engines, armored vehicles (engine and crew compartments), and ship engines; ii. Applications where public safety or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Explosion and fire protection applications where high suppression or inerting concentrations are required such as processing and pump stations, flammable liquid processing areas, and flammable metal processing areas; iv. Health care facility applications involving impaired populations, such as hospitals and nursing homes where there may be a preference for use of this agent due to the unique concerns within the facility; v. Military mission critical applications which are vital to national security; vi. Other applications where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no other technically feasible alternatives. EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions of this agent by limiting testing of C 4 F 10 to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recovering C 4 F 10 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroying or recycling C 4 F 10 for later use. EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions. (j) IG&hyph;541. IG&hyph;541 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. In the NPRM, this agent was referred to as (Inert Gas Blend) but is now referred to as IG&hyph;541, consistent with NFPA 2001. This agent is a non-reactive, non-halocarbon substance, and thus not carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic; the toxicity and cardiotoxicity tests normally applied to halon substitutes do not apply here. Rather, this agent is a potential asphyxiant, since it is designed to decrease the oxygen to a level at which combustion cannot be supported. This blend is designed to increase breathing rates, thus making the oxygen deficient atmosphere breathable for short periods of time. Data submitted by the manufacturer was peer-reviewed by pulmonary, cardiac, and stroke specialists. All have agreed that the blend does not pose significant risk to the working population and may even pose less risk than does exposure to halocarbon agents. However, to ensure safety, this blend is acceptable under the conditions that the design concentration results in at least 10 percent oxygen and 5 percent carbon dioxide. In addition, if the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere falls below 10 percent, personnel must be evacuated and egress must occur within 30 seconds. Since a fire can be expected to consume oxygen and form decomposition products, personnel should treat any fire situation as an emergency and promptly exit the space. A fire suppression design concentration of 52 percent and 43 percent would result in oxygen levels of 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively. The inerting concentration for this blend is 44 percent for methane/air mixtures and 50 percent for propane/air mixtures. A 50 percent concentration would result in an atmosphere of only 10.5 percent oxygen content, which is at the lower limit of acceptability of this agent. Concerns have been raised about the decibel level of this system upon discharge. The manufacturer has submitted a report indicating the decibel level to be 117 decibels for 3 seconds followed by a decay in noise level over 5 minutes, compared to 130 decibels for a typical halon system. The Time Weighted Average (TWA) of this system is 57 decibels. These levels are in compliance with the OSHA workplace maximum allowed peak of 140 decibels and a maximum Time Weighted Average (TWA) of 90 decibels. This acceptability listing for use of IG&hyph;541 does not apply to any other inert gas system. A manufacturer with a different formulation must prepare a separate SNAP submission to EPA. c. Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. (1) Streaming agents. (a) HBFC&hyph;22B1. HBFC&hyph;22B1 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute in non- residential applications. HBFC&hyph;22B1 is unacceptable for use in residential applications. Extinguishment testing indicates that HBFC&hyph;22B1 can replace Halon 1211 at a ratio of 1.1 by weight, making it a viable substitute for use in hand-held extinguishers. Despite its high ODP of 0.74, this chemical can facilitate the shift away from Halon 1211, which has an even higher ODP of 3.0. However, given the potential market penetration and the high ODP of HBFC&hyph;22B1, widespread use of HBFC&hyph;22B1 in consumer applications was estimated to cause unacceptable damage to the ozone layer and an excessively high number of skin cancer cases and deaths. The total estimated skin cancer cases and fatalities from the use of HBFC&hyph;22B1 as a Halon 1211 replacement in all uses including consumer uses is approximately 30,000 and 600, respectively. In addition to concern about its ODP, use of HBFC&hyph;22B1 in residential applications may present risks of cardiosensitization. To assess this risk, the Agency modeled the peak concentration of HBFC&hyph;22B1 that would be expected if such an extinguishant were used to suppress a kitchen fire and estimated the decline from the peak. Such analysis indicated that peak concentrations of HBFC&hyph;22B1 would exceed 3300 ppm. This is in excess of NFPA ceilings for exposure. In light of the availability of other fire protection agents with lower associated risks, the Agency determined that the risks posed by HBFC&hyph;22B1 were too large to justify widespread use in the consumer sector. Thus, EPA finds HBFC&hyph;22B1 unacceptable for use in residential applications since other viable alternatives exist. Worker exposure may be a concern in small enclosed areas, but in larger areas and outdoors, modeling efforts indicate that HBFC&hyph;22B1 can be used safely. In most realistic fire scenarios, proper procedures should be in place regarding the operation of the extinguisher and workers will be properly trained in fire fighting procedures and ventilation of extinguishment areas can be expected after dispensing the extinguishant.
