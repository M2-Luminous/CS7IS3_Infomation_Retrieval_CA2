FR940506-0-00043 FR940506-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 663 [Docket No. 931249&hyph;3349; ID. # 042694D] Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Adjustment to trip limits; clarifications; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces a change in the trip limit for rockfish taken with set nets in the open access fishery for groundfish in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the coast of California as authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This action is intended to keep landings as close as possible to the open access allocation without causing excessive discards. Clarifications to the management measures for 1994 also are announced. The clarifications do not result in changes to Federal management of the fishery. DATES: Effective May 3, 1994 through December 31, 1994. Comments will be accepted by June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Mr. J. Gary Smith, Acting Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN C15700, Bldg. 1, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Dr. Gary Matlock, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 West Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. Information relevant to this action has been compiled in aggregate form and is available for public review during business hours at the Office of the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) or may be obtained from the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), by writing Pacific Fishery Management Council, Metro Center, suite 420, 2000 SW. First Avenue, Portland, OR 97201. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson (Northwest Region, NMFS) 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140; or Rodney R. McInnis (Southwest Region, NMFS) 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: At its April 4&hyph;8, 1994, meeting in Burlingame, CA, the Council recommended changes to the 1994 groundfish fishery specifications and management measures published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 685, on January 6, 1994. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations, and herein announces the following changes and clarifications for the reasons stated below. A. Change the Open Access Trip Limit for Rockfish Caught With Set Nets The current trip limit for all open access gear except exempted trawl gear is 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) per trip for all rockfish combined, not to exceed 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative in a month. Representatives of the California set net fleet testified that they frequently catch more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) per trip, resulting in significant discards. The Council agreed that the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit could be removed for the set net fishery to minimize discards and disruption of traditional fishing patterns, but the 40,000 pound (18,144 kg) cumulative limit per month must remain in effect. No change was recommended for any other open access gear because these gears have different fishing patterns and the per trip limit is not as likely to cause discards. Data are inadequate at this time to determine landings by the set net fishery or to project whether the open access allocation for rockfish will be reached before the end of the year. The set net fishery is expected to take about 20 percent of the open access allocation of rockfish. The Council agreed that the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit may be inappropriate for this sector of the industry if large levels of discards are occurring, but warned that more severe restrictions will be implemented later in the year if necessary to avoid exceeding the open access allocation. Set nets are legal gear only south of 38 â—‹ N. Latitude.
