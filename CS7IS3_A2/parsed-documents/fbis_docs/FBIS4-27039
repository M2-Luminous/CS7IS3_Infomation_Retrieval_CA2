The agreement between the DPRK and South Korea is "good news," Hata was quoted by local press as saying. The outgoing prime minister said that the summit would also have a good effect on relations between Japan and the DPRK. He indicated that Tokyo will provide the DPRK with economic and technical assistance if the nuclear issue is settled in the forthcoming high-level talks between the DPRK and the U.S. The DPRK and South Korea agreed earlier in the day to hold an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang on July 25-27, followed by a second meeting at a later date, but the location is yet to be decided. In a related development, government sources were quoted as saying that Japan will send a senior Foreign Ministry official to Washington this week to consult with U.S. and South Korean officials ahead of the planned U.S.-DPRK talks in Geneva in early July.
