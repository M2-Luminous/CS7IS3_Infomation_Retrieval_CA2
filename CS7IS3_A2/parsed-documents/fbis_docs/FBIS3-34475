FBIS3-34475 "drnes027_j_94009" FBIS-NES-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Civil Aviation Source Notes Remarks on Seized Plane JN0802220794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 2000 GMT 8 Feb 94 JN0802220794 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] A responsible source at the General Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority has made a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', in which he expressed surprise over the statement made by brother Brigadier General Qasim Tahir, defense minister and member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party, on the Ugandan Boeing 707. He said that the statement is not in harmony with the Civil Aviation Law and the valid rules pertaining to aviation, and does not reflect reality. To explain this, he said the air traffic controller at Sanaa International Airport was surprised by the entry of the plane into Yemeni airspace without obtaining a prior authorization from the competent authorities. The air traffic controller recalled the report of the Air Defense Command, which also stressed that there was no authorization for the entry and landing of that plane. If there had been any prior permit from the competent authorities, the concerned parties at air traffic control and air defense would have been informed [words indistinct] in accordance with the rules of the air transportation valid in our country and the rest of the world. The responsible source at the Civil Aviation Authority asserted that the General Civil Aviation Authorities is the party responsible for issuing such permits in accordance with Article 10 of the Civil Aviation Law. Neither airports nor any other party have the right to grant such permits. In addition to that, and if we consider that the Ugandan plane's travel was in the interest of the war effort of the Armed Forces in the southern and eastern governorates, as stated in the defense minister's statement, the Defense Ministry should have obtained a permit from the General Civil Aviation Authority in accordance with Article 10 of Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of 1993, to which the authority referred in its previous statement. The source also added that the authorization mentioned in the defense minister's statement No. 94/57, Aden, [word indistinct] was not issued by the competent and authorized authority; namely, the Civil Aviation Authority, which does not have any information on the issue. The source denounced the content of the statement made by the defense minister, who said that the measures taken to make the plane land in al-Hudaydah airport is considered a violation of the rules of the national and international aviation. The reverse is true. Organizing aviation is part of the duties assigned to the aviation authority, which it does in accordance with international agreements, particularly with the Chicago agreement on civil aviation. Concluding, the source said: The brother defense minister should not have interfered in the work of the authority that is charged with the organization of aviation rules and should have encouraged the employees of the civil aviation authority, who carried out their duty to defend national sovereignty over the Republic of Yemen's airspace.
