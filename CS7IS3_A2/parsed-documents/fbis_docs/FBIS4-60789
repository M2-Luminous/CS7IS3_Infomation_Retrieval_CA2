Niyazov pointed out that work is under way in connection with the natural gas pipeline, adding that the natural gas will arrive in Turkey within two years and will be used at a much cheaper rate than today. Niyazov said that Turkmenistan wants to name a textile factory under construction in the city of Tedzhen after President Suleyman Demirel. Foreign Minister Cetin said he is happy to see the progress Turkmenistan has made in two years. He pointed out that the brotherly relations between Turkey and Turkmenistan develop with each passing day, adding: Turkey will continue to extend all kinds of help to brotherly Turkmenistan. Cetin recalled that the project to deliver natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe via Turkey is being executed by a consortium composed of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, and Iran. He also said that Turkish businessmen want to build a port in the city of (Turkmenbasi) on the Caspian Sea. During the meeting, which was conducted in a very warm atmosphere, Cetin repeated President Demirel's invitation to President Niyazov to visit Turkey. Cetin presented Niyazov with maps of Turkmenistan printed in Turkey in the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, as well as with a Turkish diplomatic passport. Niyazov kissed the passport and touched it to his forehead, saying he considers Turkey his second motherland. It is reported that Niyazov's visit to Turkey will take place either in late June or early July. Cetin briefly interrupted his contacts in Turkmenistan to visit Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. He was received at Tashkent Airport by Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said Asymov. Cetin was later received by President Islam Karimov. The two men discussed all aspects of the relations between the two countries. On behalf of President Demirel, Cetin invited Karimov to Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Ambassador to Uzbekistan Erdogan Aytun presented his credentials to Karimov. In the afternoon, delegations from the two countries, headed by the respective foreign ministers, held talks. Uzbek Foreign Minister Asymov said his country wants to further develop its economic and political relations with Turkey. He recalled that Turkey was the first country to recognize Uzbekistan and stressed that his people will never forget that. Cetin said Turkey believes that relations between the two countries -- which are relatives, making them closer than friends -- have not developed sufficiently. He pointed out that the volume of trade between the two countries is $225 million. This should be raised to $1 billion, he stressed. The foreign minister stated that Turkey extends all the economic aid it can to Uzbekistan. He explained that the $250-million loan extended by Eximbank and the $245-million sugar and wheat loans are being used. After concluding his contacts in Uzbekistan, Cetin returned to Ashgabat. Tomorrow morning, Cetin will sign a consular agreement and a protocol on solidarity between the foreign ministries of the two countries. He will then return to Turkey.
