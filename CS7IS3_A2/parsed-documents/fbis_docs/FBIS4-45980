The contact was held after North Korea had announced it would allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from New York: [begin recording] Nam: The United States and North Korea had a chief and counselor-level working contact for over an hour early this morning to discuss allowing additional inspections [chuga sachal] and the third round of high-level talks. As the contact was held only a few days after the previous contact on Tuesday and right after the IAEA's announcement of its decision to send an inspection team, a well-informed source said that this implies that a breakthrough will be provided soon through U.S.-North Korea negotiations. The source said that there had been very positive contents in today's working-level contact noting that the United States reiterated its position on the inspection of fuel rods, which was also mentioned in the previous contact, and that North Korea responded to this. During today's working-level contact, the United States urged that additional inspections should be properly conducted and stressed that the schedule of the third-round high-level talks should be discussed in the course of observing the development of inspections. North Korea reportedly demanded to hold the third- round talks as soon as possible since additional inspections and regular inspections [chonggi sachal] will be conducted. The two sides reportedly decided to let the problem concerning inspections of fuel rods be technically solved between the IAEA and North Korea, and to hold another full-scale working-level contact on the third-round talks next week when inspections will be under way.
