As was reported last week, it was the Serbian side that announced a new proposal for a possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue at the foreign minister level. Meanwhile, the media reported a short time ago a secret meeting between Albanian representatives of Kosova and Serbian representatives in the Swiss Embassy in Belgrade. The participants in the meeting in a way denied this report, leaving the Albanian mass media to fight it out with the Serbian mass media. The center of fashion has this time shifted from Prishtina to Tirana. The Democratic Party [PD] newspaper reports a secret meeting between the Albanian Socialists and representatives of Milosevic in Sofia, during an academic seminar on the topic of peace in the Balkans. RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE cites the Belgrade papers POLITIKA and NOVOSTI on this, specifically a statement issued by Keslanin, one of the main leaders of the Serbian Socialist Party. He is quoted as having said, "We reached an understanding with the Albanian Socialists, who are undergoing the consequences of the ruling party's right-wing revanchism dictated from abroad (they have their chairman in prison as the result of a show trial), and in spite of this won the local elections in 54 percent of the communes. This understanding is to continue dialogue and to cooperate in the interests of our two neighboring peoples and of general stability in the Balkans." But what did the Albanian Socialists discuss with the Serbian representatives in Sofia? This question arouses a lot of curiosity even among the ordinary membership of the Socialist Party [PS], while the PS leaders are quite calm and ready to give an answer. Two of the PS leaders, Deputy Chairman Luan Hajdaraga and Bashkim Zeneli, head of foreign relations, are two of the Socialist personalities who have held many meetings with foreign diplomatic representatives in Tirana and who appear to be entrusted with the PS's foreign policy. They did not hesitate to talk to KOHA JONE about the aforementioned meeting. "A PS delegation took part in an academic conference about the problem of peace in the Balkans. At this conference, there were also representatives from 13 other countries, with whom views were exchanged over the situation in the Balkans and the possibility of avoiding a conflict. In this context, our delegation presented our well-known standpoints. As far as we know, these standpoints were reported to the Serbian delegation. This seems to us utterly normal, especially at an academic conference," the Socialist leaders concluded, trying to demonstrate moderation in connection with questions put to them over the Kosova issue. Bashkim Zeneli recalled his article of one year ago, which mentioned the first and last Nano-Rugova meeting in Villa Number Two in Tirana, at which, according to Zeneli, the PS chairman made it clear to Rugova that dialogue is the only means for solving the issue. Likewise according to Zeneli, Rugova agreed with Nano's views. It is also Zeneli and Hajdaraga who a short time ago held a meeting with representatives of the Yugoslav Embassy in Tirana, at which the problem of Kosova was particularly discussed. However, what does the PS think about solving the issue of Kosova? Deputy Chairman Hajdaraga replies: [Bejtja] Mr. Hajdaraga, at a news conference, you called the PD's policy in connection with the Kosova question a failure. Could you be more specific about this conclusion that your party has drawn? [Hajdaraga] If we look back at the PD's attitudes to the national question, there is in general terms a coherence. Tactically, there have been vacillations and coherence has been lacking. Of course, there are differences between strategy and tactics that arise from circumstances and external factors. However, the truth is that the ultimate logic of the tactical plan of action has often not been clear. Specifically, if one talks about the national cause, one talks about unification. This is a long-term platform that will be realized on the basis of a program to which all political forces, large and small and within or outside Albania, will commit themselves. This final goal will be achieved on the basis of a phased and well-studied policy. Unfortunately, we lack a national political platform of this kind. The PS long ago asked for this. The steps that have been taken have been publicized as tactical steps for solving the question of Kosova. It is still not clear what will be demanded. I say this bearing in mind reality, and having visited the field. According to the PS, a formula for a solution will be determined by the will of the people of Kosova and by international conventions, and the solution of the problem will necessarily proceed along the road of dialogue. I wish to underline that the national question cannot be subdivided among political parties or personalities. Especially today, when it seems that a solution is knocking at the door, consultation among all the political forces, large and small, is more than urgent. I even consider a political consensus over this issue to be overdue. A roundtable of Albanian political forces in Kosova and Albania must be proposed as soon as possible, including the two Albanian presidents Rugova and Berisha. In this context, I wish to see that Berisha has recently taken a sensible line. In today's Europe, large and especially conflict-ridden problems are only solved by dialogue, with efforts to respect at the same time national interests and international conventions. We cannot let our national problems be solved outside this spirit and this reality. I can say firmly that our stands on the Kosova issue have been and will be in this spirit. [Bejtja] What are your objections to Rugova's policies? [Hajdaraga] On one hand, I am glad that Rugova is coming down to earth in a new reality. However, on the other hand we think that Rugova, in any talks or negotiations, must necessarily bear in mind the views of other Albanian political forces on both sides of the border, and not reduce his activities in this sphere to meetings with the PD and President Berisha. The national problem is not a question of one or two persons. Even though Rugova has not heeded us, although we are the largest opposition party, we are sincerely open to dialogue with him. We ask for Rugova at the table. This would be to the good of the national cause, today and tomorrow.
