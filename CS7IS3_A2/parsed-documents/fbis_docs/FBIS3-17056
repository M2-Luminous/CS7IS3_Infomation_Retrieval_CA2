Buds Are Swelling, Along With Coup Rumors" -- first paragraph is introduction] [Text] The Moscow political and journalistic worlds are in turmoil: The specter of another putsch is abroad within the Sadovoye beltway. Our correspondent was one of the first to see its real ghost (but is it real?). A late-night phone call got him out of bed during the night of 17 March. The caller was.... In a nutshell, quite an influential and well-informed person with quite a good post in a very important state structure. Without beating around the bush he immediately asked him to turn on the fax machine and take a look at a document. Once our correspondent had read it, he was jolted into wakefulness, and discussion over the phone was out of the question. In short, that same night your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent found himself in the office from which the fax had been sent. We fully retain the spelling and punctuation of the document. Confidential Theory 1 (according to information as of 16 March 1994) Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the previous ones are discarded. According to available information, a group of statesmen -- First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov -- plan to make an attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin, and B. Mikhaylov (chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on the Press. That is what the document says -- Editorial Office) reportedly also belong to the group. There is information that the members of the group do not intend to involve S. Shakhray; as one of them put it in a private conversation, "Shakhray used to be one of our people, but now the little creep is no longer on our side." The overall plan of action to remove B. Yeltsin from power is as follows. Those listed above have already held tentative talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S. Stepashin (defense minister, internal affairs minister, and director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service respectively -- Editorial Office), and by employing various arguments managed to obtain their agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B. Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye. Primakov's (director of the Foreign Intelligence Service -- Editorial Office) inner circle. A pretext for launching the action should be an address by a prominent public figure or an industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons the deterioration of the president's health and his physical inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a television documentary should be shown portraying the president as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. (According to information in the hands of the editorial office, such a program has been prepared at a foreign television company's studios. The instigator is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Association of Commodity Producers. It is also known that law enforcement organs have a copy of this television program.) Then the aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through their allies in the State Duma the constitutional procedure of handing provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin so as to hold emergency presidential elections in the country within the next three months. The chiefs and activists of the Russian Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware of the group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power suits them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu. Luzhkov in the group. According to available reports, the action is scheduled to be carried out in March, or at the latest April of this year. Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic situation and the struggle against crime. The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March -- on that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to make a television address and the documentary was to be shown. V. Chernomyrdin himself left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and then set out for Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the time. The attempt fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev, chief of the "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company, refused to provide television airtime and advised the president's inner circle of the intentions. Immediately afterward, a number of those who were directly or indirectly involved in the action left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M. Kolesnikov for France (he will return on 16 March). S. Stepashin was hospitalized. According to other information, Yu. Skokov's television address and the showing of the documentary did not take place because the instigators of the action decided to postpone them until a later date, doubting whether preparations for the action were complete. A number of the instigators of the action believe that they have not yet formulated their own ideology, so B. Yeltsin should remain in the post of president for the time being. It should be noted that during that same week when the unsuccessful attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin was made and also during the preceding two or three weeks a whole range of politicians, primarily those in opposition to the president, made statements about the need for Boris Yeltsin to resign one way or another and for early presidential elections to be held. One argument in favor of B. Yeltsin's resignation was his inability to function in this post in view of his state of health. Articles in the press on this subject and analyses of possible candidates for the post of president also began to appear in the press. Despite the initial failure, the group of aforementioned statesmen have not given up their plans to depose Boris Yeltsin by using an approximately similar plan of action. Currently, talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the "Gazprom" joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an address similar to the one Yu. Skokov failed to make. Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev postponed his working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour, when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of journalists had already left. The official explanation is the need for reliable control of strategic nuclear forces in the absence from Moscow of Supreme Commander in Chief B. Yeltsin and Chief of General Staff M. Kolesnikov. During the afternoon of 14 March a number of staffers of the Defense Ministry press service tried to circulate via "tame" journalists the story that P. Grachev had stayed on in Moscow to see off B. Yeltsin when he left for Sochi and thus to demonstrate yet again his good relationship with the president. Some career officers in the Defense Ministry and General Staff regard the story regarding control of nuclear forces as "another ridiculous claim" since in normal circumstances there is no need for the defense minister to have constant personal control over these troops. And in an emergency the minister would be unable independently to issue orders to the nuclear forces without the supreme commander in chief and the chief of the General Staff. Moreover, P. Grachev has previously often left Moscow during the absence of both B. Yeltsin and M. Kolesnikov. In late February a secret directive to limit contacts with the press and minimize the number of events involving the participation of representatives of the mass media was circulated at the Defense Ministry. There is information to the effect that on the whole the Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two groups: Boris Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly expressed their commitment to the incumbent president, including P. Grachev and his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the "opposition" represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov and Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. It is noted that in late February-early March a member of the top brass, asked whether M. Kolesnikov might resign, stated in an unofficial conversation that "maybe you can speak with a greater degree of probability about the imminent resignation of P. Grachev, and it is still not clear which of the two (P. Grachev and M. Kolesnikov) feels more confident." According to available information, Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin maintains close ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly does various services to him, his deputies, and relatives. A. Kokoshin and O. Soskovets meet virtually twice or three times a week. On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800, P. Grachev met with V. Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been publicized. However, on 16 March P. Grachev held a press conference at which he categorically denied rumors about the possibility of the military coming to power. P. Grachev stressed that, so long as he is defense minister, "there will be no military dictatorship. The Army is outside politics. The Army will intervene in events in the country only when it sees the start of civil war. The Army will not tolerate civil war." Our Commentary Let us think back to 16 August 1991. A similar document comes into the hands of the editorial office. In prospect there is the signing of the Union Treaty and stability that has more or less emerged in relations between the center and the republics. In the past is the serious -- but not taken seriously enough -- warning by then Foreign Minister Shevardnadze about an impending coup and subsequent dictatorship. Then came the SCSE [State Committee for the State of Emergency]. But let us return to this strange but serious document. Although why is it strange? Theory 1. Events since the release of the Lefortovo prisoners give grounds for believing that stormclouds are indeed gathering over the president. "Friends betray you," Napoleon said. In politics real friends are extremely rare. Yeltsin had only to start planning to go to Sochi on vacation for the long-standing rumors about the president's poor health to begin gathering strength. Let us note that the emphasis has increasingly been placed on "this matter"; Ostensibly Yeltsin is not only quite a drinker, but cannot properly run the country. So he has gone to Sochi for further rehabilitation. Meanwhile in Moscow there is a marked increase in activity and a large-scale militia operation is being held under the code name "Elbrus" to combat crime, primarily organized crime. And on Tuesday, 15 March, as though by arrangement, at a press conference Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin resolutely declares a ruthless war on crime involving all available forces. Internal troop units wearing militia uniform are immediately additionally moved into Moscow, and cadets at Ministry of Internal Affairs educational establishments in the capital also take part in "Elbrus." But even "Elbrus" is not sufficient pretext for concentrating forces in the capital. However, the upcoming 17 March opposition rally devoted to the third anniversary of the all-union referendum on the unity of the Union provides weightier grounds for "considering" the security of Muscovites, especially as the Working Russia members and their supporters were meeting on Teatralnaya Square, not far from the Kremlin, to sing the praises of the late "united and indivisible" state. In general, there were all too many militia in the city that week. Echoing Mr. Yerin, boss of the entire Russian militia, Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko (once again probably a coincidence) suddenly began to speak about a state of emergency in view of the grave economic situation. Admittedly, he later made the proviso that he was referring merely to a state of emergency in the economy and finance. Also probably by accident, the question of an economic state of emergency was discussed during the evening of 14 March at a meeting of the two parliamentary speakers Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. The State Duma chairman told INTERFAX of this. However, the premier expressed his attitude toward the question of a state of emergency only Friday 18 March. He was against a state of emergency. Probably by then the crisis in the economy was over. The rally on Teatralnaya Square also passed off without excesses. Moreover, the document under discussion, so it transpired, was already passing through the hands of extremely influential and respected personalities. Constitutional Court Chairman Valeriy Zorkin, the chairmen of both television companies -- Oleg Poptsov (Russian TV) and Aleksandr Yakovlev ("Ostankino") -- Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's Administration, Federal Counterintelligence Service Director Sergey Stepashin, and a number of other respected people had familiarized themselves with its contents. Clearly sensing that something was wrong, LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who once again was left on the sidelines, dropped a bombshell at a meeting with bankers which also "happened" to coincide with the statements by Yerin and Shumeyko, saying that a repetition of 21 September last year was possible any day now. "All the signs are there, the symptoms are present, the papers and documents are ready, and the troops have long since been moved in for street fighting." The behavior of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who cancelled his visit to the troops of the Leningrad Military District at the last moment, 14 March, is also perfectly explicable against the background of these events. Obviously Grachev had to be in Moscow at all costs at this time. His well known opponent in the Army Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov was returning to the capital 16 March. And, I repeat, an opposition rally was scheduled for 17 March. We think the story of Pavel Grachev's actions is as follows. After the abortive attempt, if the document is to be believed, to oust Yeltsin the defense minister decided not merely "not to oppose" the aforementioned "group of state figures" but also to make his own contribution to the course of events. Neither the president (if the "conspirators" failed) nor the "conspirators" (if they were victorious) would forgive him further fence-sitting like that of October last year. Probably the remark in the document by a member of the top brass forecasting the resignation of Grachev or Kolesnikov has a real foundation. "The Army will intervene in events in the country only when it sees the start of civil war," the military minister hurriedly declared at the press conference hastily convened 16 March. And, let us note, it is also possible to initiate a civil war. For instance, to instigate mass riots which, who knows, could begin at that very rally. And, judging by the mayor's statement, real preparations had been and were being made for them. It is no accident that the main communist leaders were not seen at the rally. We have managed to establish from circles close to one of the special services that steps were taken to ensure that they themselves would not want to take part. The scenario for the state of emergency could have been more or less as follows. The crowd is whipped into a frenzy (the opposition leaders have seemingly become very expert at this) and then at a suitable moment there is an explosion in the midst of the crowd -- then a fight and total mayhem. The OMON [Special-Purpose Militia Detachments] and internal troops positioned nearby move in. Mass riots are guaranteed. Then a state of emergency is declared in Moscow. Meanwhile the president is on vacation in Sochi. He is seriously ill and incapable of leading the country. Under the Constitution power passes to the premier. Nobody knows what the outcome would be of the presidential elections that must follow within three months. They may not take place at all. But for the moment that is all conjecture. What are the facts? The reasons prompting the president's erstwhile supporters to seek methods of removing him from power are as follows, I think. The military-industrial lobby, headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, has long quite openly expressed its dissatisfaction with the president. Yeltsin takes no particular notice of them and is squeezing funding for the military-industrial complex. Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin is facing the clear threat of being left without the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] as a result of its radical reorganization, which may signal the end for this monster. In the very near future, so we are told by sources within the president's apparatus and the State-Legal Administration, the MVD will lose the department's most powerful structure -- the internal troops. It is planned to use them as the basis for setting up a National Guard. On top of this, so we learned from the same sources, in the spirit of the fight against corruption the Moscow Main Internal Affairs Administration may be placed directly under the command of the president. Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov, in the event of the possible removal of Yeltsin from the presidency, would be the first and probably only contender for the post of military minister. Theory 2. The president deliberately instigated the appearance of this "confidential" document in order to strengthen his grip on his team, which is getting out of control, and remove from the game troublesome individuals whom he dislikes. But in both cases the reasons for the disagreements between Yeltsin and the "conspirators" remain as before: They no longer suit each other. Somebody has got to go. But who? Theory 3. It is a blatant forgery. But who is responsible? P.S. Painless prevention of a coup d'etat is possible only when notice is given of it before it begins. It is better to be wrong ahead of time than to reflect on the reasons behind a conspiracy as you count the number of victims after the event.
