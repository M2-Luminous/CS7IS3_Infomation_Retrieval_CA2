The BENIN PRESS AGENCY (ABP-BEN) said on Thursday that the operation, which took place in the high seas, about 20 km off the Cotonou port, was followed by the landing of troops on the beaches of the town. Three warships, two French--the "Rhin" and the "Grandiene"--and one from Benin, the "Patriote", as well as three French Mirage-F1 jet fighters, took part in the operation, the agency said. The planes were moved from the French military base in Abidjan while the troops were brought in from garrisons in the Paris area. No incident was recorded during the operation, in which the French jets destroyed a "target" which was about to attack the warships. The landing of troops on the Cotonou beaches to push back an "enemy" attack ended the second day of the operations. Observers from Niger, Togo, and Nigerian Armed Forces are observing the exercise which started Monday. It will end on Friday.
