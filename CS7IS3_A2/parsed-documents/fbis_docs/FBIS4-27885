"We are deeply concerned about this situation," Chief Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert with the countries involved such as the United States, South Korea and China." A government source said Japan will act in concert with Washington in case the U.S. and China fail to resolve differences over UN sanctions against Pyongyang. "Although we talk with China, too, Japan-U.S. relations are the basis of our policy," the source said. On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the North Korean refusal to let inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of fuel rods removed from a suspect nuclear reactor has made it impossible to verify whether Pyongyang diverted plutonium in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. Hans Blix, the IAEA director general, said in a letter to the UN Security Council that the Vienna-based agency "cannot achieve the overall objective of comprehensive safeguards...namely to provide assurance about the nondiversion of nuclear material."
