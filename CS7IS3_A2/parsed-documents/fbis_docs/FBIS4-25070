FBIS4-25070 "drchi108_u_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-108 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 PRC MEDIA ON TAIWAN AFFAIRS Military Exercises Conducted on `Liberating Taiwan' Military Exercises Conducted on `Liberating Taiwan' HK0406020294 Hong Kong CHENG MING in Chinese No 200, 1 Jun 94 pp 17-18 HK0406020294 Hong Kong CHENG MING Chinese BFN [Article by An Mu (1344 2606): "Military Exercises Targeted at Taiwan"] [Text] Military Exercises Aimed at "Liberating Taiwan" Have Abruptly Increased The relations between the two sides have become tense because of the Qiandao Hu incident. In the previous issue of CHENG MING, I reported that Li Teng-hui's description of the mainland government as "a bandit government" infuriated the mainland high-level military leadership; they were so infuriated that Deng Xiaoping had to come out to calm them down. But this did not remove the tense atmosphere of "liberating Taiwan." In April the mainland armed forces frequently conducted military exercises and the purpose of many of these military exercises was to deal with "contingencies" caused by Taiwan. We can see that although Deng Xiaoping has supreme authority, he is physically weak. Whereas Jiang Zemin, the nominal chairman of the Central Military Commission, has no significant position at all in the military. As a matter of fact, these military exercises had been proposed by hard-liners in the military. This is a trend which merits our attention. The Beijing Military Region's Air Units and Armored Troops Cooperated With Each Other in Combat Exercises Let me relate these large-scale military exercises: Time: From 2 to 5 April. Place: Border areas between Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia, including Yanghe, Xilugahe, and Xibohe. Participating armed forces units: The Beijing Military Region's air units and armored troops. Code of exercises: "Conquest 96." The figure refers to 96 hours, that is, four days. But some people said it indicated the conquest and liberation of the enemy-occupied territory--Taiwan--in 1996. I believe the former is more accurate. Scale of exercises: Two helicopter regiments, one armored division, and one amphibious armored regiment (also called a special armored regiment). The helicopters used were Type-8 and Type-9 Chinese-made helicopters. The missiles launched by these helicopters against the enemy were antitank missiles made after the "HOT [Haut subsonique Optiquement teleguide tire d'un Tube]" pattern, temporarily called "Little Overlord Type-1." These were helicopter-to-ground laser missiles. As learned, their accuracy was over 95 percent, but their accuracy with mobile targets was 70 percent. Zhang Wannian: "Proceed From Actual Combat To Crush Taiwan Independence" Technical experts from the Army Aviation School, the Military Academy of the Second Artillery Corps, and the No. 8641 Factory were invited to watch and draw experience from these military exercises. Liu Huaqing, Zhang Wannian, Zhao Nanqi, Li Laizhu, and Gu Shanqing were present to provide guidance. Zhang Wannian said: In the current military exercises, first, we will examine the armed forces' training quality; second, we have proceeded from the possible outbreak of antiaggressive war in the future and from the actual need to liberate Taiwan and crush Taiwan independence; and third, we will check the quality of new weapons through combat exercises. As learned, the Type-8 helicopters were modeled on the French "Super Wasp" and the Type-9 helicopters were modeled on the French "Dolphin." There are now 200 Type-8 helicopters and 300 Type-9 helicopters in service. From Zhang Wannian's speech, we know that improving the "actual combat" effectiveness is an urgent task of the mainland armed forces. Apart from Taiwan, what other imaginary enemies does the CPC have? Let us take a look at the following military exercises. The Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions Cooperated With Each Other in Combat Exercises Time: From 8 to 12 April. Place: Xiaoqinghe in the north Shandong plains. Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from the Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions. Code of exercises: "Train of the Era," internally called "Spirit of the Era." Scale of exercises: The 87th and 116th Divisions of the 54th Group Army under the Jinan Military Regional Command--two crack infantry units which performed meritorious service during the Korean war; one ground-to-air mobile missile regiment belonging to the 28th Regiment. The Nanjing Military Region dispatched one airborne division and one mechanized division; the airborne division was formed in September last year and some of its officers and soldiers were transferred from the Jinan Military Region's Air Force School; Yun-12 and BHE [preceding three letters published in Roman alphabet]-Type [as published] transportation planes were used to transport airborne troops. Military Exercises Were Conducted Out of Consideration For Changes in the World and Taiwan Situations Zhang Zhen, Li Desheng, Gu Hui, and Zhang Taiji watched these military exercises. Gu Hui made a concluding speech at the end of the exercises, saying: These actual combat exercises were planned according to changes in the world and Taiwan political situations. For a period to come, the main basis for us to strengthen the armed forces buildup and do a good job in combat readiness is the existence of hegemonism, the restoration of Japanese militarism, and the growth of Li Teng-hui's Taiwan independence force. This was quite rare that a Chinese leader had formally mentioned the "restoration of Japanese militarism." This was, possibly, because the Japanese Government said that the CPC was behind North Korea's nuclear threat and a member of the newly formed Tsutomo Hata cabinet denied the massacre in Nanjing. Apart from this, for historical and geographical reasons, Japan is opposed to the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan. All this has put the CPC on the alert. Joint Maneuvers by the Chengdu and Guangzhou Military Regions What is noteworthy is that the "idea of war preparedness" is beginning to spread among the mainland armed forces units. The reappearance of this obsolete slogan indicates the CPC's firmer determination to "liberate Taiwan." The actual combat exercises listed below suggest how the CPC focuses on training which is aimed at "scoring a victory in a new war confrontation." Time: From 25 to 28 April. Place: Jiangkou and Jinjiang in Tongren Prefecture, Guizhou Province; and the lower reaches of the Yuan Jiang, Hunan Province. Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from the Guangzhou and Chengdu Military Regions, which carried out joint air and land offensives. Code of exercises: "Doomsday of the Aircraft Carrier." "The aircraft carrier," reportedly, referred to Taiwan Province. Scale of exercises: The Chengdu Military Region dispatched two mechanized infantry divisions, which, covered by an air force unit, attacked and occupied an enemy position. The Guangzhou Military Region dispatched two infantry divisions, which speedily occupied a "city" in Chenshui in the Yuan Jiang's lower reaches under bombers' attacks. Troops dispatched by the two military regions successfully joined forces. Bombers launched laser-guided bombs at their "targets." This was the first time laser-guided bombs were used. Laser Missiles Were Used For the First Time As learned, these laser missiles can be launched against a target 15 km away and have high precision and a strong striking power. But whether or not the design could meet the requirements of "actual combat" had drawn the military's attention. The Operational Section of the General Staff Department held an on-site meeting to analyze the combat exercises and experts from the Military Equipment Department came to inspect how the weapons were used. Among those present on the scene were Li Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region; Li Jiulong, commander of the Chengdu Military Region; Zhang Xusan, adviser to the Academy of Military Sciences; as well as Li Jijun and He Pengfei from the Central Military Commission Office. Li Xilin made these remarks: The present-day world is not tranquil, hegemonists are acting as international police and are threatening world and regional peace, and Li Teng-hui's Taiwan independence force is becoming increasingly arrogant. To safeguard the motherland's territorial integrity and our socialist construction, to liberate our sacred territory Taiwan, and to realize the motherland's reunification, we must speed up the armed forces' modernization through self-reliance. "The Military Exercises Have Met the First-Rate Standards of Actual Combat" At the conclusion of the military exercises, Li Jijun commended the participating troops on behalf of the Central Military Commission. He said that the military exercises had met the first- rate standards of actual combat; the role of new tactics and new equipment had been brought into play; and the Chinese armed forces' ability to score a victory in the new war confrontation had been demonstrated. These military exercises conducted by the mainland armed forces suggest that the possibility of armed attacks against Taiwan cannot be ruled out. Superficially, the two sides of the strait have conducted more exchanges than in the past, but their relations are fragile and will not withstand a test. It was hard to imagine that an incident in tourism had triggered an anticommunist sentiment on the entire Taiwan island and had also touched off clamors in the mainland military for armed occupation of Taiwan. If Deng Xiaoping cannot control the situation, will this irreconcilable ideological conflict be resolved by military action?
