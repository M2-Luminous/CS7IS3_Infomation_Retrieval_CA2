FBIS4-36344 "drnes110_s_94012" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Iran * Foreign Ministry's Silence Criticized * Foreign Ministry's Silence Criticized 94LA0166C Tehran KEYHAN-E HAVA'I in Persian 20 Apr 94 p 8 94LA0166C Tehran KEYHAN-E HAVA'I Persian CSO [Commentary by Faramarz Qorabaghi] [Text] News Service -- Late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] a report made the rounds among foreign diplomats living in Tehran that the consul of the Dutch Embassy was infected with AIDS. This report was also published in some of the nation's press, but the Foreign Ministry made no comment on the publication to this report. Also, last year we saw the quiet expulsion of a Brazilian diplomat from Tehran, and again the Foreign Ministry chose to remain silent on the subject. The periodic publication of reports of this type shows the necessity for careful hygienic monitoring of the foreign diplomats living in Iran. Although some of the nation's officials believe that it is proper to look the other way on this matter, it must be emphasized that the hygienic monitoring of foreign diplomats is the lawful right of any country, including Iran. Of course, the monitoring procedures must be such that they create maximum confidence for the appropriate officials. The Foreign Ministry can test the foreign diplomats living in Tehran after informing the diplomatic organizations in the other countries and coordinating this with the responsible domestic organizations, in order to ensure their physical health (it is worth mentioning that the fact that the Brazilian Embassy's second secretary and commercial attache was infected with AIDS became known only after he went to one of Tehran's hospitals for emergency treatment). However, the fact that the Foreign Ministry is negligent in its monitoring of foreign diplomats in Tehran, especially the diplomats from non-Muslim countries, is not the only point deserving of criticism. Many other questions also arise. For example, why do officials in the Foreign Ministry think the publication of reports such as the one previously mentioned and providing this information to the public and the media will undermine the Foreign Ministry's relations with foreign countries? The Foreign Ministry's officials are well aware that the media and the press in the Western nations have close ties to the diplomatic organizations in their countries. These ties are not confined to the exchange of information and reports. They even come into play in the incitement of public opinion and propaganda controversies; for example, we have seen repeatedly that some Western governments, before making a hostile political move against Iran, have aroused public opinion against Iran through their media. On the other hand, instances have been seen where first the Western governments have incited the public with litanies against Iran and then their mass media have undertaken a propaganda campaign, even going so far as to slander Iran. In Iran, however, the Foreign Ministry behaves differently towards the media. With regard to the AIDS infection of the Dutch consul, for example, the Foreign Ministry remained silent despite its knowledge of this subject, and unfortunately when the Dutch Embassy lied in its answer to the publication of this report in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Foreign Ministry continued this unbecoming silence. Now, some time later, the truth of the claim made by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been vindicated. Of course, some people may think that reports like this are not worthy of being published in respectable publications and are more characteristic of the sensationalist press. We must emphasize that we do not support the sensationalist press in any way, but one must not shun reporting on events, and "reality" must not be kept from the public. The people and the press are asking: Why, when the Turkish Consulate in Urmia deliberately made fraudulent modifications to the electrical power meter in its consulate building, did Foreign Ministry officials fail to react to this illegal activity and put the seal of silence on their lips, as they have done in other cases? Indifference on the part of Foreign Ministry officials in cases like this is seen by public opinion as implicit acceptance and collaborative silence on the part of the aforementioned officials, and of course the Foreign Ministry does not agree with such an implication. The matter of the expulsion of a Brazilian diplomat from Tehran because he is infected with AIDS is not something that should be kept from public view. In expelling him, the Foreign Ministry has not made a mistake whose disclosure it should fear. When in countries like England even animals are quarantined when entering the country, it is natural that more attention than before should be given to health and hygiene in a country with several tens of millions. Monitoring the hygiene of foreign diplomats in Tehran is a small but very important step in this regard.
