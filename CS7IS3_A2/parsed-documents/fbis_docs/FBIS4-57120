At present, the situation is normal throughout the country with the exception of three capitals. The cabinet chief of the PF Department in Brasilia guarantees that the situation has returned to normal. On 11 May, Jose Roberto da Silva, the cabinet chief of Colonel Wilson Romao who is the Federal Police director general, reported that except for Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Belem [Para State], 30 percent of PF administrative personnel are working normally in the other states. Da Silva added that the issuance of passports is normal nationwide and borders are under control. He explained that the Army was summoned to guarantee the right to move freely of those civil servants who wanted to work. Col. Romao personally requested the Army to step in after PF strikers, who have been out for 54 days, prevented civil servants from entering the Federal Police Department building on 10 and 11 May. Yet, the Army personnel were summoned to Brasilia in the early hours of 11 May by express order of President Itamar Franco. They cordoned off the PF headquarters and were deployed in other places of the city, including the Ministries Esplanade. Army personnel were supported by four helicopters of the Army Special Brigades stationed in Rio de Janeiro. Da Silva said the Army personnel will continue to be deployed in Brasilia, Belem, and Sao Paulo until the end of the strike. Col. Romao was to have held a news conference early this morning, but declined to talk to the press. The Army Communications Center reported that only the PF and Planalto Palace will inform the public about the latest developments in this issue.
