FBIS4-83 "drafr062_c_94027" FBIS-AFR-94-062 Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Homeland Civil Servants Pensions Said Not Guaranteed Homeland Civil Servants Pensions Said Not Guaranteed MB3003193894 Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English 27 Mar 94 p 1 MB3003193894 Johannesburg CITY PRESS English BFN [Report by Desmond Blow] [Text] The pensions for KwaZulu civil servants are assured in South Africa's new constitution, no matter who wins the elections -- but this does not apply to the homelands who took so-called independence: Transkei, Bophuthatswana [Bop]; Ciskei and Venda. Civil servants, police and even politicians who held office in the six homelands that did not take "independence" will be treated in the same manner as those in the central government -- and are in fact part of the same pension scheme. However, this does not apply to the four "independent" states, who ran their own pension funds. This was confirmed to City Press by Deputy Director of Finance Dr Robbie Burton. He quoted Section 212 of the Constitution, which guarantees the pensions of civil servants; section 236 which guarantees civil servants' employment; and section 246 which guarantees the rights and pensions of political office- bearers. Efforts by City Press this week to find out whether the two collapsed bantustans -- Bop and Ciskei -- and Transkei and Venda could pay out their civil servants were unsuccessful. None of the four states were economically viable, and they relied on heavy subsidies from the central government, so it is not known if their pension funds are in a healthy state or not. It appears that the misgivings of striking civil servants that led to the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] stepping into Bop and Ciskei were justified -- but the take-over does not ensure that their civil servants will get their pensions. It will depend on the financial state of these funds. KwaZulu civil servants were assured in 80,000 personal letters this week that their pensions were safe, and Inkatha spokesperson Suzanne Vos blamed the ANC for sowing false insecurity among them. This accusation was echoed by Tony Leon of the Democratic Party [DP], who said: "The ANC created a Frankenstein by unashamedly creating conditions on the ground calculated to topple homeland leaders who do not support it." The ANC vehemently denied this -- and called Leon the DP's "brat who showed his immaturity".
