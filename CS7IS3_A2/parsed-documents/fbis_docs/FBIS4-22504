Tikhonov, general director of the Interural Joint Stock Company and chairman of the Consolidation Party, by Nataliya Kuzina: "Is the Director Now Lord to the Worker? Or What Is He?"] [Text] Call them whatever you wish -- managers, owners, enterprise directors -- but Russia already has representatives of both capital and hired labor. Many are irritated by this. Some are already calling for expropriation. It is just those who are willing to built social partnerships that remain fairly few in number. We propose at least dialogue as a start, with participants expressing the interests of these new classes. Thus, we have L. Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Workers' Party, and A. Tikhonov, general director of the Interural Joint Stock Company and chairman of the Consolidation Party. [Kuzina] More and more often people are demanding not corrections of government policy but change. And the question that everyone has avoided keeps coming up nonetheless: Was it possible for us, without socialist traditions, to force our way into the market? L. Vartazarova: "We should not force our way anywhere at all. But changes were necessary. We cannot deny that in recent years much that is positive has appeared. Thus, enterprising, active people have had the opportunity to realize their capabilities more fully. Government divestment and the appearance of enterprises with various forms of ownership -- the country needs all of this. But current privatization rules and tax and credit policies have provided prospects for development only for speculation capital, and the redistribution of property is taking place to the advantage of a new nomenclature. "The Socialist Workers' Party supports market reform, economic effectiveness and social justice. Today we can and must find a synthesis of socialist and liberal values. "If liberal values such as freedom and democracy were to be combined with justice, solidarity and equal opportunity, a completely new alloy would be produced which would not be characterized by traditional socialist and capitalist concepts. This is the foundation that will enable us to move toward a new model of civilization." [Kuzina] Unfortunately, we cannot retrieve opportunities that we have let pass. We are at the frightening stage of initial accumulation of capital. Is there a place here for theory? L. Vartazarova: "The question is really this: I am looking for justification for doing nothing or I am looking for opportunities to do something. If politicians think about the people they will search for opportunities to realize this synthesis." A. Tikhonov: "There will be no positive changes in reform here as long as one strata of people is involved. After all, it is not the basic mass of the population that has become the experimental field. Entrepreneurs are removed from influencing the economy in the same way. We have something to propose for the country's normal development. "I emphasize the word normal because we cannot ignore the interests of ordinary people. As a practician, I know very well that we could have avoided the barbaric capitalism of the first years. All forms of property could have been activated. The positive qualities of socialism, that collective feeling, could have been relied on for support." [Kuzina] Why do you speak of the feeling of the collective? After all, we are facing the problem of creating a market psychology. A. Tikhonov: "Our reformers decided how this was to be done: turn people out onto the street and then all market mechanisms would immediately become operational. They would not. In the West one could actually fire some of the workers, thereby tightening up the enterprise, and it would begin to function better. But we lived under socialism. "Or, for example, previously I also thought that money could solve all problems. One must add money and like a machine the NTR [Scientific Technical Revolution] would be activated immediately. And what happened...In my enterprise I have the opportunity to sharply increase wages if people demonstrate initiative. But they do not. New people come in. The result is the same. "This is difficult to discuss. But this is the essence of the tragedy -- we come from a socialist society in which initiative was punishable. Our other problem is that we like extremes. No matter how our money experts masquerade as Westerns, our real national character is to cut the raw wound and to keep cutting to the end. And now we really have the forcible detachment of a significant portion of the people from market reform. The alternative would have been the path that Lyudmila Stepanovna speaks of -- creating a moderate program and, supporting each other, moving forward in measured steps. You would find that the psychology would then also change gradually." [Kuzina] Lyudmila Stepanovna, are there tendencies that alarm you in the behavior of our entrepreneurs? L. Vartazarova: "Yes, there are. For example, directors allocate millions for their salaries. They also `dump' responsibility for `social services' on municipalities. As a result there are no vacation tickets for workers, no summer camps for schoolchildren and no nursery schools. However, I must say that in many cases enterprises are forced to act this way because of our government's radical tax policy. "Enterprises do not have adequate assets to support production, let alone to maintain the social sphere. Fortunately, until recently directors and entrepreneurs managed as they could so as not to put people out onto the street. After all, most of them were raised in the `old school' of having responsibility for people. But what will happen next? "Right now I am more concerned about the tendencies in government policies. With all the talk about coming unemployment why are no preparations being made? Where are the new jobs? Where is the system of retraining and requalification?" [Kuzina] An interesting situation is developing: the socialist understands the problems of the entrepreneur and criticizes the government. What should the worker, who one day may be thrown out onto the street, do? L. Vartazarova: "He must learn to defend his rights. Previously, in a socialist state this was not required. In addition, the plant director was under strict controls. Today the gap between the labor collective and the corps of directors keeps growing. If a mass stoppage of enterprises begins it will result in a social explosion. Its first `victims' will probably be the directors of these enterprises as well as the owners of commercial bureaus. The latter have naturally been the `enemy' for a long time. "Trade unions also have no real experience in protecting the interests of workers since during the entire Soviet period their main task was to distribute social benefits. Workers themselves must immediately learn the entire arsenal of methods to protect their own rights. Right now people are more badly off each year and they cannot seem to organize themselves and combine their efforts. While people are unorganized they are easily manipulated. There is one solution - to unify along social groups, according to professional interests. Representatives of labor collectives and trade unions must sit down at the negotiating table with entrepreneurs and directors. They must develop joint demands and present them to the government." A. Tikhonov: "Incidentally, the party of which I am head is not called the `consolidation' party without reason. Its membership includes both entrepreneurs and workers. No one interferes with the other because the main idea of the party is to consider the interests of all levels of society." [Kuzina] "To consider the interests" -- this is not at all an altruistic concept. It will demand some financial sacrifices from you as a property owner. A. Tikhonov: "Your question reminds me of a historical example. We all know that Morozov and Mamoyatov helped the revolution and after its victory were left emptyhanded. Gorkiy explained to them that that is the people's truth. "Personally I would not like a repetition of this. But the main problem is not who must sacrifice how much, but the precise delimitation of who does what, who is responsible for what, what he is paid and what he pays others. Laws determine all of this. It is the duty of the citizen to carry them out. "As for entrepreneurs, despite taxes and the complexities of production the majority of directors of private and state enterprises are not abandoning the problem of the workers. They sympathize with workers completely." L. Vartazarova: "It seems to me that the further success of relations between workers and entrepreneurs will depend on adhering to tradition. Russia followed the philosophy of indifference to profits. Property was always looked upon as a privilege. The entrepreneur had to pay society for this privilege by showing concern for the poor." [Kuzina] No matter how you look at it, the entrepreneur will have to open his purse strings. But there is another path, along which an attempt is made to "tame" the main spokesmen for the interests of workers. Incidentally, the idea that we need "leftist" leaders was clearly heard immediately after the events of 3-4 October. A. Tikhonov: "Personally, I do not share such ideas. But let us examine them in principle...Our society is `leftist' as a whole. It is no accident that many communists were elected to the state duma. But besides them there are many leftists in parliament. For example, there is a large contingent of independent deputies. I studied their composition. They are also basically `leftists'. "So it will not be possible to `tame' everyone. And why do this; if they are leftists this is not so bad. I am familiar with the program of the Socialist Workers' Party. It is not opposed to a multi-level economy with various forms of property. If the government shifts slightly to the left I am sure that the entrepreneur will not be strangled. "At the same time I know very well what communists are and what they are capable of if they are organized. But the extreme `right' is also capable of extremes. This is why we do not need extremes. Society is multifaceted. Let everything exist. But we need a `center' as a civilized solution to the country's crisis. A. Volskiy and A. Vladislavlev worked very hard on this. Despite political competition, they were always centrists and expressed moderate and reasonable views." [Kuzina] The voting block that elected these people did not accumulate the necessary number of votes. Incidentally, your party and the party that is represented by Lyudmila Stepanovna also did not win in the elections. Don't you think that the time for compromise is running out? And that a pre-revolutionary situation is developing in the country? A. Tikhonov: "The failures of centrist forces in the elections resulted from organizational problems to a large degree. Of course, it is necessary to take them into consideration and to analyze them. But this does not mean that centrists do not have a future. I also do not agree that there is a pre-revolutionary condition in the country. The reverse is probably more true - one senses that the population is tired of all conflict. The people have a great need for harmony. This is what they expect from politicians." L. Vartazarova: "Whether there is revolution or not, right now many experts feel that in April a social explosion is possible. It is our common task not to allow this to happen. Right now, when the country is disintegrating, I do not at all care who sits next to me at the negotiating table - the entrepreneur or the Marxist. We must all make haste. It is not the time to look for the ways in which we differ. National harmony is not rhetoric. It is a condition for the survival of Russia as a country."
