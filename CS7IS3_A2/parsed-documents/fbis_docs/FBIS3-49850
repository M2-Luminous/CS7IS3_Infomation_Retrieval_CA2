"The Muslims made certain new demands that are not in accordance with the existing EU proposal. Talks on this subject will resume tomorrow. However, the Serb side is adhering to the existing proposals and insists on them, so the talks depend on whether the Muslim side will accept the EU proposals or not," Koljevic said in an interview for TV Politika. He added that "the Muslims demanded fresh territorial concessions beyond the framework of the EU proposal, that is, the Franco-German proposal which the Serbs had earlier agreed to." "I believe that tomorrow's talks will be decisive. If the Muslim side rejects the EU proposals, the Serbs will present a new platform," Koljevic concluded.
