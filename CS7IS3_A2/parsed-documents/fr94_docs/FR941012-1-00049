FR941012-1-00049 FR941012-1-00010 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Parts 1002, 1160, 1161, 1162, and 1163 [Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 94)] 1 1 Embraces Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 86), Revision of Licensing Application Forms and Corresponding Regulations (Application Forms), notice of proposed rulemaking, 57 FR 37761 (August 20, 1992), supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, 58 FR 48628 (September 17, 1993). Revision Of Application Procedures And Corresponding Regulations AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is proposing revisions to its standard licensing application form (Form OP&hyph;1), amendments to the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1002 and 1160, and elimination of the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1161, 1162, and 1163. The proposed revisions implement the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act (TIRRA), Title II of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act Amendments of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;311 (August 26, 1994), which significantly amended licensing standards for non-household goods motor property carriers, effective January 1, 1995. To accommodate the changes mandated by TIRRA, the Commission also is proposing further modifications to the application procedures and regulations involved in the ongoing Application Forms proceeding. The Commission's decision and final rules adopted in this proceeding will embrace and dispose of issues pending in the Application Forms proceeding. DATES: Comments are due November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments (an original and 15 copies), referring to Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 94), to Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, 1201 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Felder, (202) 927&hyph;6373 or Suzanne Higgins O'Malley, (202) 927&hyph;7597. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In its August 1992 Application Forms notice of proposed rulemaking, the Commission proposed to replace the Form OP&hyph;1 with a series of six transportation mode-specific forms and to adopt corresponding revisions to the agency's licensing regulations. In particular, the proposed motor carrier application forms included expanded safety fitness certification requirements for applicants that were exempt from, or as-yet-unrated under, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) safety regulations. In September 1993, the Commission issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the Application Forms proceeding, announcing its intention to adopt the mode-specific application forms and regulatory changes substantially as proposed, including the expanded safety fitness certifications. At that time, the Commission invited public comment on further revisions to the proposed motor property carrier form to recognize revisions to DOT's hazardous materials commodity classifications and corresponding liability insurance coverage for transporters of those commodities. Legislative Reforms As the agency was preparing to issue a final decision and rules in the Application Forms proceeding, Congress enacted TIRRA, changing the licensing standards and procedures for motor property carriers of commodities other than household goods. Specifically, TIRRA's Sections 207 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10922(b)] and 208 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10923(b)] respectively eliminate the public need/public interest licensing standards for non-household goods motor property common and contract carriers and substitute fitness-based standards. Effective January 1, 1995, the Commission is directed to issue authorities upon a finding that the applicant is in compliance with: (1) The Interstate Commerce Act, Commission regulations, and any safety requirements imposed by the Commission; (2) DOT safety fitness requirements; and (3) Minimum financial responsibility requirements established by the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 10927.
