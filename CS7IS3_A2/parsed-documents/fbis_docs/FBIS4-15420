Speaking at the Defense Collegium in Moscow, he said that for the country's defense capability to be maintained, a minimum of 700,000 new recruits should be inducted into the army and navy. Grachev said the clause in the law on defense that says the number of people in the armed forces is restricted to one percent of the population of Russia should be changed. A million and a half is not an army but a military formation capable of undertaking local combat activity, the minister believes.
