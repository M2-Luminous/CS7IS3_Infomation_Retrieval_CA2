The commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Navy [Rear-Admiral Ali Shamkhani], who is currently in Bandar Abbas, announced the above today and added that Western news agencies' propaganda that Iran is competing with other countries in the region in the purchase of arms and military equipment is false. He said: The arms race Westerners have started in our region is more profitable to them than arms races in other parts of the world. In fact, this is plundering the wealth of the Muslim people of the region. The navy commander also said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has to gain enough strength to protect 2,000 km of its marine border, but it believes it can strengthen its defensive capabilities by relying on its internal strengths and capabilities.
