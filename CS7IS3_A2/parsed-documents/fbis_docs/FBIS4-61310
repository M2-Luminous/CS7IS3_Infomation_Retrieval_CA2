It is devoted to work on a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. According to Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation, Estonia is ready to sign this act and Russia's desire to link this problem with the provision of social guarantees to the Russian military pensioners residing in the republic is the only stumbling block. On the eve of the round Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, met with Estonian President Lennart Meri. The results of the conversation, he believes, give cause for hope that in a prolonged Russian-Estonian "divorce suit dialogue" the parties can find strength and willingness to engage in a search for a compromise to settle the problem. The talks are being held behind closed doors and will last for two days. It is planned that a news conference will be given by the heads of delegations on the results of the talks.
