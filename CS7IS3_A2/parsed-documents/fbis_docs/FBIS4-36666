The Bonsella has been off the port city since Saturday trying to unload its cargo destined for Yemeni hospitals where stocks are rapidly running out, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. Sandro Barana, head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, said they hoped to be able to enter the port on Sunday after obtaining guarantees from rival north and south leaders. The Bonsella had tried on June 7 to enter the port but was prevented by the fighting. The ICRC has been providing aid to both sides in the Yemen's civil war which broke out on May 5 between troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Northern Yemeni gunners killed two and wounded 22 in Aden late Saturday in the latest round of fighting which has seen three ceasefires collapse.
