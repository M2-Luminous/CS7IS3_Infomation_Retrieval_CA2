Salatov by GUDOK correspondent Viktor Peremyshlev: "Maximum Convenience and Service for the Passenger"] [Text] Passenger transportation is continuously in the ministry's field of vision. Three times as many collegium sessions were devoted to it last year alone. Specific measures were outlined, and the railroads were given instructions on improving the organization and quality of passenger services at terminals and on trains. A special government decree on suburban services was issued at the initiative of the MPS [Ministry of Railways]. However, it was noted at the last collegium meeting (December 1993) that the gain expected from the measures outlined was not received. Our correspondent talks with Deputy Minister K. Salatov today about the problems facing the passenger transportation complex and the steps that need to be taken to improve its work. [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, it has been about 3 months since you began studying passenger service problems, and after these 100 days, it is assumed that a report will be made to the public on what you have managed to accomplish. Can we expect somthing such as this from you at the forthcoming collegium at the beginning of April? [Salatov] This period--100 days--is not long enough to be able to introduce radical changes in the work of this complex. Without repeating what has been approved in the collegium meetings, I will note one feature: their decisions were predominantly oriented toward the passengers' interests in many respects. But look at what is taking place on the trains, in the terminals, in our entire area of service. The attitude toward passengers has been callous, and it remains that way. But after all, if a person pays more for a fare than he did before, he should receive more in the form of attention, services, and simply a respectful attitude. [Peremyshlev] Frankly speaking, I did not expect that our conversation would begin in precisely this way. Although not everything is simple here. The same crudeness by the conductor--this is not only a display of bad behavior, but a result of the poor condition of the rolling stock and economic disorders. Today, as an example, a dishonest conductor "has" much more than an honest one--for carrying extra baggage, "stowaways," and other "services." [Salatov] Well, every family has its black sheep. But a conductor's wage is not bad at all--an average of 200,000 rubles, besides the out-of-town assignment and other payments. Add to this the stability of his social position based on the wage agreement. And it is becoming apparent that the problem is not with his economic status, and not even in the peculiarities of his character, although there is reason to think there has been poor personnel selection. Look at the flight attendant on an airplane. She radiates kindness and respect. The flight attendant undergoes testing and takes a special training course. They follow roughly the same procedure on American railroads, by the way. If we tested for occupational suitability and studied personnel selection... I am certain that the human factor comes into action before the economic factor or any other factor. We have become accustomed to boorishness, I believe. But after all, we are standing on the threshold of competition for transport services. There are huge "Icaruses" today at the Kursk and the Kazan terminals. And their invitations guarantee that they will take passengers quickly and comfortably to Ryazan and other cities. And the buses are crowded as well. We are talking about financial losses in the billions. But some trains are half-empty today. The railroads do not want to cut back the amount of traffic. Then they should look for an opportunity to fill up the railcars! We cannot make up for financial losses by rate indexing alone. We have to respect the laws of economics: the relative expenditures can only be reduced by an increase in transport volume. So we have to fight for the passenger. By giving him more comfort. So this year we have set the target of 70 company trains. [Peremyshlev] We have 52 now. [Salatov] Yes. Nearly 200 consists. The company trains differ sharply from the normal trains. They are filled, even though a ticket on them is 1.5 times more expensive. You automatically begin thinking about what the passenger needs. He needs comfort, convenience, and good service. We cannot make 100 percent of the trains company trains, of course. And this is not necessary, either: we have a responsibility to keep trains less expensive. But we have to raise the level of normal trains up to the level of company trains. [Peremyshlev] Should I interpret your words to mean that service is the most important element which can raise passenger transportation to a new level? [Salatov] Absolutely correct. Creating conditions for the passenger which suit him completely. I think this is the key to success. [Peremyshlev] I would like to ask a more specific question: if we find fine people who put their heart into their work, put them in a dilapidated railcar where the heating does not work, the boiler is broken, on a train that is always late, won't this brutalize even the most good-natured person under such conditions? And he will have to hear a great deal that is unpleasant from the passengers as well. [Salatov] A complaint we received recently spoke of just such a situation. In February, we took 184 children on vacation from a special school in Moscow. The railcars had no belts on the generators, and hence there was no light. They are not heated. There was no tea or anything. I asked the railroad that made up the train: how could such a thing happen? This is irresponsible! Of those who prepared these three railcars and those who gave the order to connect them up. And of the conductors as well. Irresponsibility and carelessness--this is the problem of problems today. A sanitary inspector forbids the railcars from being used, but there is a slipshod individual who does not respond to his reprimands and puts a railcar in the train anyway. And such actions cannot be justified by our poverty or any shortages--we are more irresponsible than we are poor. Our attention to the traveler should begin at the cashier's window in the terminal. But why is there no advertisement: "Dear passengers! To ensure your safety, we cannot carry more than 36 kilograms of baggage. Turn the rest over to the baggage car." No, the ministry order on this is read over the terminal radio, at best. [Peremyshlev] So good decisions are being made, but they are not being carried out. One of the reasons you cited was carelessness. What else? [Salatov] You are right, it would be too obvious if everything were explained by this. Passenger problems require constant and continuous attention. But at times we lose sight of them. This inattentiveness stems from the inertia in our thinking: when there was a huge volume of freight being carried, the passenger runs were given credit at their own expense and attention was given to them in accordance with the residual principle, so to speak. Today, when the freight runs have declined, we should turn our attention to passenger services. But the dispatchers still give first attention to the freight trains. Just as before, they are encouraged to let the freight runs pass through first of all. The last collegium meeting approved a new schedule in which priority is given to passenger trains. So the mental reorientation is under way, all the same. [Peremyshlev] You said that decisions were made at the collegium meetings on services for passengers, based mainly on their interests. I had occasion to attend practically all the meetings mentioned, but in the documents presented at them I did not see any results of the sociological study of the phenomenon which is called passenger flow in official language. The migration by people, passengers' preferences, the social status of the average passenger--a million questions arise. But where are the answers? Didn't you reach that point? [Salatov] I cannot agree that we did not reach this point. Obviously, the residual principle is being discussed here as well. There are no services on the railroads which have really devoted study to marketing. Ask the commander of the appropriate service how the passenger flow is studied, and you will hear: it increases or decreases. But they will not say why. They do not know. A department for this has been formed in the Passenger Main Administration. But I personally do not see the amount of work I am describing. In any event, they are not conducting any surveys or studying... [Peremyshlev] Have they postponed it for the future? [Salatov] We are putting off too much until the future. As an example, the railcar problem... In order to provide good service for the passenger, as you noted, a properly equipped railcar is needed. But what can we give the passenger when there aren't enough railcars even for the company trains, which should meet the sectorial standard for a "firm." Deliveries from Germany are being cut back under the slogan of the need to develop domestic passenger railcar manufacturing. At the same time, it is planned to allocate funds from the budget to purchase the Tver railcars for exactly one-third of the target given to the plant. We are trying to help the Tver workers to obtain materials for production, but they also need money to survive. Railroads will continue to be the predominant form of transportation in the future in Russia. And this must be considered the principal social task for railroad workers. And the organs which are obliged to bear this in mind should not tell us: "These are your problems!" The priorities should not simply be declared, but provided for financially. But for the present... The rates are monitored by the state and regulated by it. They do not provide for the sums to obtain railcars. This would require the cost of a fare to be substantially increased, which is simply impossible under current conditions. But how do we provide for quality in passenger services when they are unprofitable and there are no subsidies? It is becoming more and more difficult for us every day to keep our form of transportation the most accessible and widely used. In addition to the rolling stock, there are the tracks, the technical structures, the terminals... Our comrades stopped at the terminal in Washington at one time and could not understand whether it was a terminal or a concert hall: there were exhibits and concerts on the upper floors... You published a good series on the terminals in Moscow. We have to look throughout Russia for what is good and bad and provide the passenger with the maximum amount of service which he needs. I repeat--we must fight for the passenger! [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, are you a realist? [Salatov] Both a realist and an optimist. [Peremyshlev] So much of what has been mentioned today will be done? [Salatov] A great deal has already been done today. And without large capital investments. We have to develop what we have. We have good reserves to carry out the collegium decisions. We have to set ourselves the task of fulfilling them to the maximum extent possible. This is the key to success. We have many ideas. We have to work. I am confident that the forthcoming collegium meeting will take place with this attitude as well. Passenger services are a major aspect of our work. And we all must apply ourselves to it with responsibility.
