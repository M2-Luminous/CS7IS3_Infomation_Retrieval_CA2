In 1993, the number of terror attacks in Lebanon doubled, the number of infiltration attempts increased considerably, and the organizations opposed to the peace process have exhibited a higher motivation to infiltrate into Israel and carry out attacks. The sources say Syria will continue to use Hizballah, as it has in previous years, according to its political needs.
