As the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] revealed the design that will flutter over public buildings for the next five years after the April election, outside condemnation already came in from some quarters. Other parties ventured to express cautious acceptance, while some have yet to comment. In its reaction the Democratic Party [DP] said national symbols such as the flag should be decided by a referendum. DP spokesman Rob Harper said the decision should not be made by the National Party or the African National Congress [ANC], but by all the people of this country. ANC Regional Publicity Chief Yulelani Nguko commended the TEC criteria for the design, but slammed it for having nothing which one can identify with. Mr. Nguko who was speaking in his personal capacity said this may have been the key reason why everybody agreed on it. Minority Front leader Amichand Rajbansi came out in favor of the flag saying it accommodated both majorities as well as minorities.
