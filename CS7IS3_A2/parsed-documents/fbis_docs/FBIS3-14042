[no end quote as published] Chaudhury Sujjat Hussain said that the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] Government had been blaming the Pakistan Muslim League Government for isolating Pakistan internationally but today it had been established that it was not the PML but the PPP Government that brought global isolation to Pakistan. Gauhar Ayub Khan, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, has also condemned the government for withdrawing the resolution and said that the Prime Minister should immediately step down as she had brought an embarrassment to Pakistan, which had no parallel in the history of the country. He said that it was criminal negligence on the part of the government that a fit case of human rights violation of Kashmiri people had been destroyed by the government in Islamabad. Gauhar Ayub Khan appealed to the patriot workers of the PPP to rise against the policies of the government and act being above from the party politics. "I am sure now the whole nation has seen the true face of Benazir Bhutto's government", he added. He announced that the opposition would give its official version about the fiasco on Thursday afternoon. Mian Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, while condemning the withdrawal of the resolution said that it had proved that Benazir government was engaged in patronising and helping out India. "She is not prepared to lose any single opportunity to please India by playing with the national interests of Pakistan, which are no way dear to her," he said in a statement. He said that track record of Benazir government had made it clear that as long she was sitting at the helm of affairs, the security of the country would remain in grave danger. Mian Shahbaz Sharif appealed to the people to stand up against the "pro-India" government. *
