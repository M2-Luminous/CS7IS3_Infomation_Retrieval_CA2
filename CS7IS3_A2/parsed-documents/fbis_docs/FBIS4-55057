This is what has been asserted by its designer in an official police investigation. Here is a report by Mirjam Muzinic: [Begin Muzinic recording] While Italian newspapers have swiftly taken up the story on the confiscation of a vessel ordered in Viareggio for the needs of the Slovene Ministry of Internal Affairs and paid for in Turin, today agencies devote hardly any attention to the event. What is involved is one of the large number of similar cases that our neighbors are used to, colleague journalists (Luca Daldi) from the Viareggio IL TIRENO told us on the telephone. It is known that the order was made by a middleman from Turin, who received 3.2 billion Italian Lire from Slovenia. The vessel is 20 meters long and a little more than 5 meters wide. It is equipped with radar, satellite navigator, depth gauge, night sights, and computer-operated navigation, something that would indicate that what is involved is a military vessel. In the official police investigation, the designer, an eminent expert, (Sergio Sardos), born in (Pula), Croatia, and a long-time Italian citizen, denied this. Due to the bankruptcy process, the respective court has excluded the vessel from the estate fund, and ordered that it should be completed as soon as possible and delivered to the purchaser. All that is needed is the payment of the order, which has obviously stopped at the Italian middleman and is in the hands of the court. According to the IL TIRENO's journalist, a prominent representative of the Slovene Ministry of Internal Affairs is expected to visit Viareggio this afternoon, something that the Ministry's spokesman Bozo Truden denied. Slovenia ordered the vessel in Italy when Igor Bavcar held the post of the minister of internal affairs. It should have been taken over in the middle of last September. [end recording]
