These unexpectedly negative signals came as yesterday's meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ground to a halt when Guo Fengmin, the leader of the Chinese team, told British officials that he was unable to hold further discussions on issues remaining on the table. It is understood that the Chinese negotiating team is waiting for fresh instructions from Beijing on the crucial issue of the handover of military land. The main Chinese objection to Britain's position appears to be China's unwillingness to give the Legislative Council a final say on funding for redevelopment of the military lands, particularly the new naval base. Recent indications of China's willingness to be flexible over the level of government equity injection in the airport project have produced high hopes of a successful outcome for today's one-day airport committee meeting. However, Chinese officials have described these high hopes as "unrealistic". In a newspaper interview published on Wednesday, Lu Ping, the director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that Beijing would be prepared to countenance a level of debt for the airport project higher than the $5bn [billion Hong Kong dollars] level, which had been China's previous bottom line. But Lu was also careful to stress that progress on the airport talks depended on the "attitude" and the "co-operation" of the British -- a point emphasised by Chinese officials last night. British diplomats are also pessimistic about the outcome of today's talks because of the mixed signals coming out of Beijing. Although the outlook for the talks is bleak, neither team is prepared to totally discount the possibility of an agreement. After yesterday's JLG meeting it was suggested that a separate experts' meeting on military lands, which has been held simultaneously with the JLG, could continue over the weekend but no agreement was reached on when it would reconvene. Aside from the problem of Legco's role in funding arrangements for the redevelopment of the military sites, it is understood that disagreement persists over the size of the new naval base to be built at Stonecutters Island. Britain has been insisting that the price for developing a larger naval base at Stonecutters will be a shortfall of funds to refurbish military facilities elsewhere in the territory. China's objections to giving the Legislative Council a primary role in determining the funding for the redevelopment of the sites stems from its insistence that Legco is merely an advisory, colonial body, not a decision-making institution. Britain, however, would find it difficult to accept an agreement which excludes the role of Legco in determining the funding proposals. Nor can it agree that British funds will be used to make up the difference if Legco only agrees to the partial provision of the financing agreement recommended by the JLG. A senior British official said Britain was trying to work out a compromise formula. "You have to have provisions which enable the thing [the fund] to be put into effect. If the Chinese side does not like the way in which the money is made available, then we have to look at other ways. We have to find some wording which does not openly contradict the position of both sides. "Equally, Britain will not accept the obligation to pay if Legco denies the money. Both sides will have to find a phraseology to make sure, from the legal point of view, that neither side's position is compromised unacceptably, otherwise there is obviously no deal," he said. The Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday tried to put a positive slant on the adjournment of the JLG meeting. "We've [been] talking about the future of the defence estate for about seven years. That is an indication of how difficult and complex the issues are," he said. "I think that it's fair to say that both sides have been working extremely hard over the last few weeks to try to put an agreement in place as soon as possible. It is complicated. It is difficult."
