FR940617-2-00099 FR940617-2-00058 7. Turning to the third example outlined by petitioners involving the reporting of shared employees of commonly owned stations in the same radio service in the same market, current data processing technology available to the Commission does not allow for the employment profile of more than one station to be reported on the same Form 395&hyph;B except in cases involving an AM/FM combination. Therefore, if a licensee owns two FM stations or two AM stations in the same market, the licensee should file a separate report for each station, dividing employees between the stations according to their primary duties. If the duties of one or more employees involve work for both stations equally the licensee should file a Form 395&hyph;B for one station with all employees from both stations listed. It should then file a separate Form 395&hyph;B for the other station explaining that the station's employees are reported on the Form 395&hyph;B filed for the licensee's other station in the same market. We expect the licensees of multiple stations in the same market to file the Form 395&hyph;B attributing employees to the stations according to the manner in which the stations operate. IV. Conclusion 8. Accordingly, it is ordered that this Interpretive Ruling is issued, to be effective upon publication in the Federal Register. 3 3 See 5 U.S.C. Section 553(d)(2). 9. It is further ordered that the May 31, 1994, due date for the filing of 1994 Form 395&hyph;B is extended for those affected by this Interpretive Ruling until 30 days after publication of this Interpretive Ruling in the Federal Register. Licensees who have already filed their 1994 Form 395&hyph;B may amend them prior to that date. Federal Communications Commission. Roy J. Stewart, Chief, Mass Media Bureau.
