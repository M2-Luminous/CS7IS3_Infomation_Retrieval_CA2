Rabin was addressing a seminar at the Hebrew University on the subject of the civil service in the time of peace. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] There is no point in negotiating an agreement if after a short time it can be reopened, Rabin said, for if that is the case, there must be serious doubt about the value of any new agreement which will be negotiated in the future. In the wake of the Hebron massacre, the PLO has demanded the stationing of an international force in the territories, the withdrawal of settlers from Hebron, and the wholesale disarming of settlers as conditions for a resumption of the talks, but in Rabin's view, this would mean rewriting the agreements reached in Oslo and more recently in Cairo. This view was echoed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the Knesset this morning, after he appeared before the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee: [Peres] The time, which is evaporating and disappearing, is a crucial one, and I personally believe that the most contributing change to the present situation will be the implementation of the agreement. Instead of opening the agreement, let's better realize it, and then all of us will see that we do not have an agreement about a piece of paper, but we do have an agreement about the new reality. [Katzenell] Also present at the Hebrew University seminar today was Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. He did not agree that the PLO's demands constituted a reopening of signed agreements: [Al-Tibi] At present, 'Arafat and the PLO leadership is committed to the peace process. We are not talking about opening agreements; we are talking about a new circumstance that was created after the massacre. The most important and cardinal point should be security for Palestinian civilians. This issue should be solved as soon as possible for the sake of both parties in order that we will be able to come back to the negotiating table. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 March carries a similar report, noting that al-Tibi added "that we are in the midst of an agreement which, in another five years, will bring about a Palestinian state in all the territories captured in 1967. During this process, Israel must provide answers to the burning security issues of the Palestinians in the territories. Al-Tibi also said that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], as the sovereign power in the territories, failed in the defense of the Palestinian residents."] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin called on the PLO leadership to overcome the pain and anger created by the Hebron massacre and return to the negotiating table quickly. The longer this is delayed, Rabin warned, the more opportunity there will be for Palestinian terrorists or, perhaps, another Jewish madman to exploit the break. [end recording]
