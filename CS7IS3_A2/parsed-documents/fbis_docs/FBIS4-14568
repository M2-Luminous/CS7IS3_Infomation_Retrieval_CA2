Mr. Samoylov has stated that Russia is ready to trade with the traditional partners: Middle East countries, India, China, African, and East European countries. Also, according to him, deliveries have fallen because, beginning in 1991, Russia went over to settlements in cash and stopped the granting of credits to its customer countries. Besides, Russia lost $10 to $15 billion over the UN sanctions against Libya and Iraq. According to him, Russia, unlike the Western countries, received no compensation from the United Nations and the IMF for the economic ties with them that were severed.
