The article printed on Thursday says that materials connected with the crash were handed over by Azerbaijan to the Iranian side. Commenting on this allegation at TRUD's request, the head of the Armenian mission in Moscow said that the Azeri statement "can be explained only by political aims". Iranian, Russian and Armenian commissions are working at the place of the crash, and they have not drawn any conclusion concerning reasons for the crash.
