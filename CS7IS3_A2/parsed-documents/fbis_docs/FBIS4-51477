Li made this remark while meeting with Sherman Lewis, Jr., vice-chairman of Lehman Brothers company of the United States. The company is the fifth U.S. monetary and securities company whose representatives he has met recently, Li said. "We appreciate the positive attitude U.S. monetary and securities companies have taken to cooperate with China," he said. The Chinese Government is sparing no effort to improve the development of China's transport, energy and telecommunications, fields that have lagged behind the country's economic development, and to gradually change the irrational industrial structure, he said. There are various ways to carry out cooperation with foreign countries in these fields, such as through issuing stocks and bonds and through capital loans, Li said. Li added that China has adopted a careful approach to issuing stocks, which is the most difficult means of cooperation. Listed Chinese companies must conform to international standards in order to earn a good reputation in the world monetary market. He expressed his appreciation to Lehman for helping China's Huaneng International Power Development Corporation to be listed in New York. The Huaneng Company is one of the five firms China's State Council has approved to be listed in the U.S., and Lehman Company is the global coordinator and leading manager of Huaneng's equity offering in New York. Lewis said that he has paid five visits to China this year and made extensive contacts in the country while completing background research for the Huaneng listing. The Huaneng Company scored well in management, equipment, technical personnel and efficiency, he said.
