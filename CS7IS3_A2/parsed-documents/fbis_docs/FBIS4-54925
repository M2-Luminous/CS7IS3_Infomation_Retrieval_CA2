"The government has to be given an ultimatum: If it wants to talk, then it should sit at the table and negotiate and fix some dates for things to be solved. If not, then we have to remove those people from the government and replace this government with an interim one," he said. According to Wrzodak, this is the opinion of a few people from factory commissions in Mazowsze region, but the Solidarity National Commission should make a decision. In his opinion, all strikes should be clearly and properly coordinated.
