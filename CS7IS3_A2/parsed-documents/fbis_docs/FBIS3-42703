Should we rejoice? Let us leave in parentheses the fact that the edict of 24 December 1993 was promulgated only on 29 January 1994. Let us note that this event is remarkable by the fact that the government itself finally recognized its debt to the depositors. But it is in just this pleasantness that questions begin and end. And the first one: Why is the sum of compensation (threefold) so laughably small? But it is necessary to find even this money somewhere. Where? If even in a number of oblast and regions there is nothing with which to pay wages. Where did this number "threefold" come from? I would like to pose these and a number of other questions to people who have some connection with the edict. Someone worked on it, which means that someone will implement it. But I was not successful in getting any kind of information on this from either the Central Bank, the Savings Bank, or the Ministry of Finance. Employees of the Central Bank said that "for us this edict is like snow on our heads." The document turned out to be just the same unexpected snow for the Society for Defending the Interests of Bank Depositors (the name of the Society speaks for itself). At their request, deputy V. Mukusev raised the issue of indexing deposits at the Supreme Soviet and the corresponding law was adopted. Then representatives of the Society "passed it by" the Constitutional Court, which recognized the justice of their demand. Now in connection with the president's edict a statement was adopted at the Society's meeting, which states, in part: "The president's edict No 2292 is insulting to us not only because of the miserly nature of the proposed compensation, but also by the means of finding the money, the proposed sale abroad of precious metals and precious stones from the State Reserves of Russia. We state that any processes squandering the wealth of Russia are unacceptable as a source of money for compensating the depositors. Therefore we call upon the RF Federation Council to take control of the State Reserves of precious metals and precious stones. We are ready to show in open discussion that a noninflationary method for restoring the old savings of our co-citizens exists." Using similar slogans, having united with Movement for Social Justice, the Society will picket the central board of Sberbank on 10 February. Society co-chairman Valeriy Akinin considers: "Several variants for resolving this problem exist. There is even similar foreign experience. It's only necessary to want it. A government which will undertake the task of reimbursing the full volume of savings will guarantee itself a minimum of 70 million votes (one for each depositor) in any elections. Elena Sannikova, a member of our Society, has worked out a program for a noninlfationary restoration of the money, and in the near future we will send it to the government." But while the arguments about the forms and size of compensation payments are going on, Sberbank has set about fulfilling the president's edict. Maria Kasatkina, an employee of the Sokolniki Sberbank reported: "Despite the fact that the money promised under the edict has not been transferred to Sberbank's account, we are beginning to pay compensation from the money we have in our own account. First to be compensated will be pensioners and invalids, who will need to have the corresponding cerfication, passport, and savings book. Compensation will be paid to the remaining categories of citizens starting on 1 July. According to the depositor's wish, the money can be moved anywhere, transferred to another account or paid in cash. However, opening non-interest deposit accounts for paying for housing and communal services, which is mentioned in the president's edict and in Sberbank's directive sent to its branches, is not provided for." The Sberbank workers asked me: "Write about this so that people won't get excited, so that there won't be any panic or agitation." Really, what is there to be excited about? In the Sberbank closest to my house, dinnertime was approaching. The bank was empty. Perhaps the time I chose was unfortunate--TV was showing the film "Simply Maria" at the same time.
