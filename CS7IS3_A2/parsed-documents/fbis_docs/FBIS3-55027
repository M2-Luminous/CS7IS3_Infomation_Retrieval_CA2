The ministers discussed Lithuania's rights to buildings of diplomatic missions in Paris, Rome and Moscow. The buildings belonged to Lithuania before 1940, but after Lithuania's annexation by the Soviet Union they passed into the hands of some Soviet organizations. The Lithuanian embassy building in Paris was taken over by the APN news agency, and the Soviet embassy in Italy moved into the building of the Lithuanian embassy in Rome. Lithuania insists on the return of the buildings. The meeting also touched on the question of rooms of the Russian diplomatic mission in Vilnius. It is currently located in an old administrative building, which the Russian diplomats claim to be unsuitable for their work. The situation is complicated because Vilnius did not belong to Lithuania until the country's occupation by the Soviet Union, and so no Soviet embassy existed there. This was the first time the foreign ministries of the two countries discussed the problem of the Lithuanian embassies in Moscow, Paris and Rome and the Russian embassy in Vilnius in their complexity. The Russian side previously refused to consider restoration of the buildings in Paris and Rome to Lithuania. The meeting was "constructive and positive," stated the official press release of the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow. "The parties will draw their final conclusions during future meetings," the officials said. After the talks with Pastukhov, Januska met with Sergey Krylov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, to discuss the relations between Lithuania and Russia, particularly the problems related to the Russian Kaliningrad enclave.
