FR941012-1-00024 FR941012-1-00004 (1) Selection of a discount rate. Possible options include short- or long-term interest rates, private, municipal or Treasury bonds, or some other measure of interest rate. (2) Selection of a method that provides adequate assurance that funds will be available in the event of unexpected closure. (3) Selection of a maximum time period over which costs may be discounted, e.g., 5, 10, 20, or 50 years. (4) Selection of activities that may be appropriate for employing discounting, e.g., post-closure care when the costs and time period for performing this activity may be estimated with reasonable accuracy. (5) Selection of a method that minimizes the potential complexities involved in administering and enforcing a program that allows discounting of costs. Commenters should note that this request for comment is limited to whether discounting should be allowed for MSWLF financial assurance, and is not intended to open for comment other financial assurance regulations. VIII. State Program Approval_Subtitle D Section 4005(c) of RCRA requires that each State adopt and implement a ``permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions'' adequate to assure that each facility that may receive household hazardous waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised MSWLF criteria. Each state must adopt and implement a permit program not later than 18 months after October 9, 1991. EPA is required to ``determine whether each State has developed an adequate program'' pursuant to section 4005(c). EPA plans to propose a State/Tribal implementation rule which will establish adequacy determination requirements and procedures for State subtitle D permit programs, including submission of a MSWLF permit program application. EPA also plans to propose to extend eligibility for subtitle D permit program approval to Indian Tribes. The statute, however, does not require these rules to be in place before EPA assesses the adequacy of any State or Tribal program. As part of these rules, the Agency plans to include procedures for submitting revised applications for State and Tribal program adequacy determinations should a State or Tribe revise its permit program once deemed adequate and the appropriate Regional Administrator determines that a revised application is necessary. Program revision may be necessary when the pertinent Federal statutory or regulatory authority is changed, when State or Tribal statutory or regulatory authority or relevant guidance changes, or when responsibility for the State or Tribal program is shifted within the lead agency or to a new or different State or Tribal agency or agencies. A State or Tribe that receives permit program approval prior to the final promulgation of today's rule and later elects to adopt the financial test and local government guarantee mechanisms should work with its respective Regional EPA office as it proceeds to make changes to its permit program. EPA does not interpret the statute to require that each and every program change a State or Tribe makes will require a revised permit program application. Rather, only certain changes that raise issues warranting a detailed review by EPA and an opportunity for public comment will necessitate a revised application. EPA believes that State and Tribal compliance with today's proposal will, in most cases, not require a revised permit program application, since this rule merely provides additional options for demonstrating financial assurance. Furthermore, States and Tribes that have adopted financial assurance requirements without this local government test and guarantee are not required to take any action and may elect to retain only their current options since this proposal simply expands the number of options available to owners and operators for demonstrating financial assurance. IX. Implementation_Subtitle D As stated above, today's proposal would amend part 258 by adding additional options for corporations to use when demonstrating financial assurance for the costs of closure, post-closure care and clean-up of known releases. States and Tribes will not be required to include these options in their MSWLF programs, since they may choose to establish their own financial assurance programs as long as they meet the financial assurance requirements in Federal criteria. EPA will be able to approve the financial assurance portion of a State or Tribe's program so long as it includes at least one of the options promulgated in October, 1991, or added by today's proposal (if promulgated).
