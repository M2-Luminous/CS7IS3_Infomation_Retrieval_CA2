It is anticipated that the costs to investors associated with this new rule and amendments will be minimal. IV. Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604 for Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and amendments to Rule 12b&hyph;7, 12d1&hyph;2, and Form 8&hyph;A. The analysis notes that the rule and amendments are expected to reduce regulatory costs for small entities. As discussed more fully in the analysis, the new rule and amendments will affect persons that are small entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. The exemptions provided by Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and revisions to Rules 12b&hyph;7, 12d1&hyph;2, and Form 8&hyph;A are expected to decrease the compliance burdens of small entities. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Joseph P. Babits, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. V. Effective Date and Transition Provisions The rule and amendments are effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register , in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act; however, any registrant or broker-dealer may choose to comply with the new rules at any time after publication in the Federal Register . To provide for a smooth transition for use of the new rule and amendments, the following transition provisions will be permitted. First, registrants that have proxy statements relating to a solicitation of debtholders pending with the Commission should contact the registrant's Branch Chief in the Division of Corporation Finance if they intend to rely on the proxy exemption afforded by the rule, so that the staff may stop processing the filing. Second, issuers that have Form 8&hyph;A registration statements for listed debt securities pending with the Commission should continue to follow the current procedures regarding acceleration of effectiveness of Forms 8&hyph;A. As is currently the case, those issuers or the national securities exchange on which the debt securities are to be listed must provide the staff with an acceleration request prior to the desired effective date of the Form 8&hyph;A. The staff will then notify the issuer and the national securities exchange once effectiveness has been granted. VI.
