Particularly when they come from people who are presumably competent in these matters. As has been reported, spokesmen for our Atomic Energy Ministry assured the press that the DPRK does not posesses the requisite quantity of plutonium to develop a nuclear bomb. But the reactor in Yongbyon, in the development of which specialists from the aforementioned ministry were most actively involved, is apparently intended to serve national economic and scientific needs. One deduces from this that neither we nor any other countries have any need to fear that North Korean nuclear bombs will be dropping on our heads. The Atomic Energy Ministry's view was fully confirmed by DPRK ambassador in Moscow Mr. Son Song-pil, who honored the State Duma International Affairs Committee with his presence: "We do not have the technical potential to produce nuclear weapons," he said. Finally, Russian intelligence, as IZVESTIYA wrote recently, also denies that Pyongyang has the technology and capacity to produce nuclear weapons. This is amusing. Amusing because four years ago it said precisely the opposite, the words coming from Vladimir Kryuchkov, USSR KGB chairman at the time. The document that is cited below is a memorandum from Kryuchkov (No. 363-K) to the USSR leadership, dated 22 February 1990 and headed "On the question of the development of nuclear weapons in the DPRK." Here is the full text: "The KGB has been informed by a reliable source that research and development work is actively continuing in the DPRK on nuclear weapons. The North Korean leaders, in particular, Kim Chong-il, who is personally supervising the aforementioned research, are seeking military superiority over South Korea and are also pursuing the goal of joining the states that possess these weapons. "According to available data, the development of the first nuclear device has been completed at the DPRK nuclear research center in Yongbyon, in Pyongan-pukto Province. There are no plans for testing it at the moment in order to conceal from the world public and international monitoring organizations the fact that nuclear weapons are being produced in the DPRK. "The KGB is taking extra steps to check the data. "This is for your information. "KGB Chairman V. Kryuchkov." A brief explanation is required. According to specialists, the device mentioned in Kryuchkov's memorandum is different from an actual nuclear bomb, in the same way, well, as... a woman who has only just woken up differs from one who is about to go out. That is, from the physics viewpoint, the nuclear bomb already exists, but further engineering and design efforts are needed before it takes shape and can be loaded in an aircraft or on a missile; it will have to be dressed in the proper uniform. As world experience has shown, these efforts will take two-three years. But the important thing is that the device requires basically the same amount of plutonium as an operational -- albeit not large -- nuclear bomb. Given that, given the fact that the DPRK already had a device ready in 1990, and testing was only being prevented by certain external reasons, it means that the DPRK had, indeed has the requisite quantity of plutonium. Consequently, both our competent experts and the ambassador are lying. If, of course, you believe Kryuchkov's memorandum. And I think it should be believed. Because despite the fact that relations between the USSR and the DPRK had been strained in recent years and North Korean special services were somewhat suspicious of their colleagues in the socialist camp, organized information channels were functioning. In the first place, because North Korean nuclear scientists would scarcely have managed without the assistance of Soviet nuclear experts and, second, because the DPRK was in the sphere of interests of a whole clutch of KGB departments. The "country of Chuche" was attracting the attention of both the intelligence service -- the DPRK was covered by its 6th department -- and the counterintelligence service -- the document cited above was not prepared by Kryuchkov himself, of course, but by Colonel V.L. Smolnov, who worked in the 16th department of the Second Main Directorate (KGB counterintelligence). Finally, the former KGB also had an Eleventh Department -- the department coordinating the activities of socialist countries' security services. It is now called the international relations service and is part of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Treaty and Law Administration. So despite all the strains in relations with the DPRK, our KGB knew how to arrange things with theirs: We even allowed North Korean special services to work on our territory -- in labor settlements where there were North Korean workers. The point of all this is to show that as well as the aforesaid document there must be other, later intelligence reports in KGB archives on DPRK successes in developing nuclear weapons. At a State Duma sitting Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that he had all the necessary information on the subject. At a meeting at ITAR-TASS Kozyrev expressed fears that North Korea might develop a nuclear bomb in the very near future. Although, according to other sources, what Kozyrev means by "in the very near future" is in five-seven years' time. But one would hope that the minister really does have all the requisite information, including the document I cited. If not (and in our country, given the shambles our archives are in, anything can happen), then I must hasten to report to the minister that in fall 1991 this memorandum by Kryuchkov was stored in the archives of the USSR KGB secretariat, file No. 132, volume four, page 143, marked "Top Secret" 07-07. Finally, the games our competent experts are playing are fascinating in their way, of course. Unless, of course, you consider the possibility that a mad dictator might order North Korean nuclear bombs to start falling on our heads and if you forget that we are dealing with one of the most terrifying totalitarian regimes, which is desperately trying to survive, almost on its own, and is prepared -- as our own history teaches us -- to go to any lengths, even nuclear blackmail, to achieve that. Do we not fear for our children?
