Three projects amounting to P21.7 billion are agro-industrial projects while the remaining program costing P13 billion involves long-term urban sewerage and sanitation. The agro-industrial projects approved are the Metro-Cebu Development Project Phase III (MCDP III), the Lower Agusan Development Project-Irrigation Component (LADP-IC) and the Strategic Industries Development Program (SIDP). These projects are expected to hasten agro-industrialization through investments in the countryside, Socio-economic Planning Secretary and NEDA Director General Cielito Habito said. Funding support will come from loans under the 19th-Yen Credit package of Japan. These will be coursed through the Municipal Development Fund and government financial institutions such as the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines. The P15.9 billion MCDP III will include the construction of a Cebu South Expressway, a south reclamation project, an urban circumferential road and five new distributor roads in Cebu. Habito said the Japanese government was willing to shoulder 80 percent or P6.6 billion of the Cebu South Expressway component. The LADP-IC, costing some P1.09 billion, is planned to give farmers of Butuan City 95 kilometers of irrigation canals, 27 kilometers of new roads and 69 kilometers of drainage canals and on-farm facilities. The SIDP, with P4.5 billion in funds, will modernize the country's shipping sector. The sewerage and sanitation program, meantime, will involve a national policy, strategy and action plan for urban sewerage and sanitation, particularly in urban areas.
