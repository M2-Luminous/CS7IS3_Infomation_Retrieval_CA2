Businesses willing to settle in the rural districts of Floeha, Mittweida, and Zschopau can, for a limited time, make use of the manpower of unemployed scientists and engineers at no cost to themselves. In return, the small and mid-size firms must commit themselves to creating jobs in the region after a given period of time. The project is not without controversy. The Saxon FDP [Free Democratic Party] is afraid of government subsidized competition for research firms in the private sector. Regions near Chemnitz are marked by the decline in the once dominant textile industry. After reunification, only a fraction of the jobs in this area of business could be salvaged. Manufacturing companies are still in short supply. Peter Daetz, Director of the Center for Economic Development and Advanced Training GmbH (CEDAT) in Floeha, made the point that "during the recession, we couldn't get anyone to settle here." Three rural districts of Saxony and the state of Saxony are partners in the non-profit CEDAT, which concerns itself with promoting economic development and a second labor market. In spite of enterprise zones, low real estate prices and development programs, there was no apparent successful influx of people into the structurally weak area. When the Technical University of Chemnitz-Zwichau had to let almost 1,000 scientists and engineers go at the end of 1992, the promoters of economic development got the idea to offer this potential in research and development (R&D) at no cost to regional companies, to those establishing new business enterprises, and to investors from West. The following model served: If a company, at no cost to itself, employs the services of a scientist for one year, it is obligated afterward to create two to three secure jobs in the region. Breach of this commitment results in the threat of contractual penalties. This measure of creating work is financed according to 249h of the Employment Promotion Act. There are currently 150 scientists and engineers available for this undertaking. "Since R&D work is not being done for money, we are not giving any competition to private research companies," Daetz emphasizes. Representatives of Chambers of Industry and Commerce should guard against jobs eluding private companies. The measures are handled institutionally by the Assistance Center of Middle Saxony (ACMS). Members are the CEDAT, the State, the Construction Company of Saxony, the District Savings Bank as well as the municipality of Floeha. Up to now the ACMS has been able to conclude ten contracts with companies, which created 60 secure jobs. By the end of 1994 the number should climb to 200. Without the R&D offer, these companies would never have come to Saxony-- Daetz is certain of that. The FDP of Saxony is not sympathetic to the ACMS also getting government support. Around 10 million German marks are at the disposal of the ACMS for two years.
