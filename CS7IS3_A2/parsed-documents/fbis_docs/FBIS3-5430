An official, queried on the protest lodged Monday, pointed to a weekend statement by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, saying it indicated Singapore was unlikely to yield ground on the issue. Lee had said that foreigners living in Singapore would have to abide by local laws. "These laws are published, they are transparent. Everyone knows about them," he said, according to local news reports. Michael Peter Fay, 18, was sentenced on Thursday to four months jail, six strokes of the cane and fined 3,500 dollars (2,200 US) for spray-painting cars, pelting them with eggs and retaining stolen property. The court-ordered flogging drew immediate criticism from a senior US diplomat here and the American Chamber of Commerce, which said it was "shaken" by the sentence. The Singapore government is expected to issue a formal statement responding to Clinton's announcement that Washington had filed "a strong protest" over the affair. Clinton had said that while he recognised that the Singapore authorities were acting within their jurisdiction, he hoped the caning decision would be reconsidered. "We recognize that they have a certain right to enforce their own criminal laws. But we believe that based on the facts and the treatment of other cases, similar cases, that this punishment is extreme and we hope very much that somehow it will be reconsidered," he said. [passage omitted] Some analysts said Washington's protest may have been poorly timed because Fay, a student at the American school here, is on bail pending appeal to a higher court. The judicial process was therefore still not completed, they said. Lee said Saturday that Singaporeans had been ordered caned for similar offences and that it would be absurd to have separate laws for locals and Americans. There was no reason why "foreigners should be more thin-skinned," he said. Singapore's home affairs ministry said after the subordinate court ruling that the same laws applied to Singaporeans and foreigners. Of the 14 people, between the age of 18 and 21, convicted for vandalism and ordered caned over the last five years, 12 were Singaporeans, it said. A juvenile court will next month sentence a 15-year-old Malaysian who pleaded guilty to two counts of vandalism while a 16-year-old Hong Kong resident will go on trial, also for vandalism, next week.
