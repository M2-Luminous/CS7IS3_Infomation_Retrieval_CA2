The moderate TONG-A ILBO, the conservative CHOSON ILBO, the moderate HANGUK ILBO, and the moderate CHUNGANG ILBO all carry 800-word editorials on page 3, pointing out that the North side's insincere attitude resulted in the lack of results in the 16 March inter-Korean contact. The CHOSON ILBO editorial, in particular, urges the government to come up with a new long-term policy on North Korea, noting that "we have lost the initiative in talks because our North Korean policy has no basis or principle." CHOSON ILBO also carries a 900-word article by reporter An Hui-chang on page 3 which cites the analysis of observers that "North Korea's strategy is to link the issue of allowing additional inspections with the issue of holding the third-round North Korean-U.S. talks, because it believes that assuming a rigid attitude and utilizing the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency as an ace card will result in the United States again acceding to negotiations." Meanwhile, a 1,200 word article by Ku Pon-yong on page 4 in the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN attributes North Korea's "inactive attitude" on the envoy exchange to its concern that this will lead to a rapid improvement in South-North relations, which may then lead to popular unrest in North Korea where "systemic crisis caused by serious economic difficulties" exists. This article also points out that North Korea's insistence on direct negotiations with the United States aims to effect improved relations with the United States while gaining economic aid from it, and also serves to "estrange the ROK from the United States." Chong Pyong-chin's 1,000-word article in the moderate HANGUK ILBO predicts that the voices of hardliners in the South Korean Government will likely increase with the lack of progress in the last inter-Korean working-level contact. The article says people are suspicious that "North Korea and the United States agreed on terms that the public is unaware of before announcing their agreement on 25 February" and that "the United States is conversely using the `North Korean card' against the ROK." The article adds that these reasons were cited by certain sections of the government in their "insistence" on reviewing ROK-U.S. relations. Kang Tae-ho's 1,000-word article in the left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN criticizes both the South and the North for the lack of progress in their working-level contacts. Remarking on the South side's "active and offensive" attitude and the North side's "inactive and defensive" posture in the dialogue, the article points out the South's "undesirable attitude of provoking the North by mentioning the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks." The article anticipates that South and North Korea will also fail to reach agreement in the next contact slated for 19 March, and that South and North Korea will probably enter again into "a phase of harsh confrontation" so that talk of the "uselessness of dialogue" abounds in South Korea, North Korea, and the United States. Reporter An Song-ki of the CHUNGANG ILBO simply argues in a 900-word article on page 5 that North Korea is insisting on the announcement of a joint South-North communique because it intends to "shift the responsibility to South Korea and the United States if the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks fail."
