If an official sits in his chair too long, this will not turn into power. The government does not believe in its officials, and the officials do not believe in the government. Officials who have understood the security of their profession are compelled to think not of the state, but of their own pockets. They solicit bribes and function poorly because even if they did their jobs well, their labors would not be esteemed. They conceal themselves in meetings so the boss will not notice them. In this way they automatically sabotage the work, continuity is lost, production speed drops; this, once again, reflects the material situation of the people. ON SOCIAL POLICY This sector is one in which our government takes pride. It is also true that this sector is one in which our government has not worked out a program. The government is not on top of events in this sector, it lags behind them. The government does not fear the poverty or the hunger of the people, it fears their dissatisfaction. Thus, it acts to please social groups which are potentially dangerous: students, teachers, Russian workers and Russian officials. In Uzbekistan 6 million 770 thousand people are working. Of these, some fifty percent are workers in various sectors, 16.3 percent in industry, and 32 percent, or almost one-third, are in agriculture. This 32 percent are our peasants. Although wages of urban workers and bureaucrats has risen ten times, that of peasants has risen only once. In addition, peasants have not received this wage for three or four months. Whatever their social guarantees are, they are not demanding them. These people do not know what social justice is: when they government speaks about it proudly on television, they do not know what pride it is talking about. ON UZBEKISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY The minister of foreign affairs has been changed three times in the last two years. Has this measure been any good for our foreign policy? Let us take the last minister who was removed for example: In may of 1993 the police or the KGB detained an Uzbek woman at Tashkent airport and beat her up. This woman had been working at the U.S. Embassy. The embassy protested to Uzbekistan's government, but this protest received no answer. To top it off, Uzbekistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to the press, saying that "responsibility for this occurrence must be borne by the embassy itself." This situation made no contribution to either diplomacy or policy. In response to this, the American government expelled a delegation of Uzbek delegates headed by the chairman of the Supreme Council who had been invited to visit the United States from the country, Subsequently, Uzbekistan's government, in order to ingratiate itself with the United States, replaced the foreign minister who had only recently been appointed. In fact, both the minister and the miserable person who had beaten up the woman had followed the orders of the government. These failures in foreign policy were a result of the arbitrary action in domestic policy. When Uzbekistan declared its independence, countries of the world began to view this country with great interest. Uzbekistan has many natural resources, its economic potential is vast, and it is an historical and cultural center. Under these historical circumstances, Uzbekistan needs a strong foreign policy. We need a strong and independent, intelligent, and unified foreign policy. Unfortunately, the government has not, and cannot, follow such a policy because it has destroyed its influence in the world through anti-democratic actions in its domestic policy. Uzbekistan has embassies in four or five countries of the world. Some of the embassies are not able to state their relationship to world events. Uzbekistan's government has not even stated its own position with regard to the countries of the world. Iraq attacked Kuwait. Uzbekistan did not state its view of this aggression. The United States bombed Iraq. Uzbekistan did not say whose side it was on. Armenian occupied Azerbaijan's soil. Uzbekistan did not state its position on this. Half a year ago Uzbekistan's president with a large delegation went to Saudi Arabia, stayed in luxury hotels, and enjoyed themselves, and...returned with nothing -- an agreement which would aid Uzbekistan's economy was not drawn up because Uzbekistan has no opinion and no definite policy on Saudi Arabia. The government, embittered by the failure of this trip, expelled a group of Saudi Arabians who had come to the country. As a consequence, relations between the two countries have been severed. In May of this year our president traveled to Germany. At a request from the Mercedes-Benz company, the German Government received I. Karimov. The German press made fun of this reception: "If you want to see a dictator, do not go to Latin America, come to our own Stuttgart, because Karimov is arriving here tomorrow." Recently President Karimov put 32 tons of Uzbekistan's gold in a French bank, and, for this, he was received as an official guest for the first time in a Western country. But if every foreign journey of Karimov costs 32 tons of gold, we will soon be out of gold. To sum up, Uzbekistan's foreign policy is the mirror image of its domestic policy. Our people have a saying: "If your face is crooked, do not kiss the mirror. We do not have the right to exchange kisses with another country.
