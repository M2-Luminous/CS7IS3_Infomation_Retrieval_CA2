Taking part in them were units of the 201st Russian divisions, subunits of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Russian border troops, a total of about 2,000 personnel. Under the overall leadership of Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, the troops repelled attacks made by a designated opponent towards the town of Kurgan-Tyube then went over onto the attack and expelled the opponent from Tajik territory. The head of the Russian military department gave a high assessment of the combat training and the coordination of the actions of the various units of the peace-keeping forces and specially emphasized that these were planned exercises and not in any way a demonstration of strength or anything similar. Fortunately war, even in training, ends sooner or later and the soldiers who were tired by the temperature of 28 degrees could relax a little. Those who had proved most worthy were presented with orders and medals and the songs introduced pleasant variety into service life. In the afternoon the Defense Minister went to Farkhar [Parkhar], a rayon center in Khatlon Oblast where he was made an honorary citizen yesterday. Pavel Grachev made an unofficial approach towards this a year ago when he ordered an aircraft to be sent there with medicines and doctors in order to halt an epidemic of a very severe form of hepatitis which affected almost half the town's inhabitants. There were gifts this time, too. The local hospital was given 5,000 disposable syringes. Summing up the results of his trip, Pavel Grachev said that the exercises showed that the treaty on the collective security of CIS countries was already operating, although not to the desired extent. He said that this was because the Armies of the majority of the states which had signed this document in Tashkent were still in the stage of being set up. Touching on the stay of Russian troops in Tajikistan, a subject which many find painful, the Defense Minister said that it was better to ensure the country's security on distant frontiers and the most important thing was that Russia did not have the moral right to abandon the 200,000 ethnic Russians living there to their fate.
