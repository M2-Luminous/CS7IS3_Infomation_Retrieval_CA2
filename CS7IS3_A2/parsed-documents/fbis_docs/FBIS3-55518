It says that one month has elapsed since the Russian president signed the edict on the procedure of returning refugees and forced migrants to their permanent places of residence on the territories of the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. According to this edict, the first stage of the return of deported Ingush citizens to their permanent places of residence was due to begin last December. However, the Russian president's edict has not been implemented. The statement says that leaders of the Republic of Ingushetia have often expressed their readiness to sit down at the negotiating table with leaders of North Ossetia. However, the latter have a negative attitude to such statements. The statement also says that those who hamper the implementation of the Russian president's edict will bear full responsibility for the potential consequences of such a policy. This statement is signed by Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev.
