Irregularities in Forest Enterprise Alleged A report on the Hrvatske Sume [Croatian Forests] public enterprise has been removed several times from the Croatian Assembly's daily agenda at the last moment, a fact that leads the Zagreb weekly DANAS to be suspicious about the business operations of the enterprise. In its 29 March issue discussing an unspecified Assembly debate on the enterprise, the weekly observes that: "What happened surprised many--Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ivan Tarnaj tendered his resignation, while the prime minister dramatically came to his defense, refusing to accept the resignation. Although there were rumors that big shots were involved, the resolution of the situation in the enterprise was not completed. The government alloted two additional months for restructuring the management board of the Hrvatske Sume enterprise and investigating once more all the charges against this enterprise." Reports on the investigations carried out by various Assembly commissions and state institutions, such as the Finance Police, cite several questionable areas in the business operations of the enterprise, according to DANAS. The Croatian Government admitted an operating loss of 576,000 German marks [DM], which was most often described by Assembly delegates as a "crime," DANAS states, adding that Vera Stanic, a member of the Assembly commission investigating the work of the Hrvatske Sume enterprise, enumerated specific irregularities, such as illegal foreign currency transactions, violation of a government decision limiting the production of certain wood products, and financial misconduct to the detriment of the enterprise and the state through misrepresentation of income, preferential treatment of private enterprises, and unauthorized felling, trade in, and export of wood. Stanic said that the enterprise's greatest problem is its management and demanded that Minister Tarnaj also be held accountable. Tarnaj defended the work of Hrvatske Sume, saying that the manner of privatization of the forestry sector was at the root of the controversy because "some individuals are trying to keep the best parts for themselves and leave those that are not good to the state." In an interview published in the Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA on 28 March, Stanic charged Hrvatske Sume's "top management" with the "theft" of Croatia's forests. "This is a real catastrophe," she said, "the impermissible devastation of the greatest of Croatian resources." Stanic named individuals in Hrvatske Sume's management who had been indicted by the Public Prosecutor's Office. She also discussed a report issued by the Finance Police on irregularities in Hrvatske Sume's operations, in particular the enterprise's exporting of wood at "incomprehensibly" low prices without the authorization of the Ministry of Trade. Jailed Businessman Threatens To Tell `Truth' on Privatization Sinisa Caktas, a Split businessman who has attempted to buy "almost all the best Dalmatian enterprises" with millions of German marks of "mysterious" origin, is staging a hunger strike during pretrial confinement because he has not received replies to protest letters he had sent to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, several ministers, and President of the Croatian Privatization Fund Ivan Penic, says the 8 April Zagreb weekly GLOBUS. According to GLOBUS, Canic says that he will keep quiet until his trial and then reveal the "truth" about privatization in Croatia. The weekly reports that Caktas is in pretrial detention with his associates Ivo Cecuk and Feri Toth on suspicion of having "misused a position of authority and falsified official documents in the ownership transformation procedure of the Split Mljekara [Dairy] enterprise." Caktas, on the other hand, accuses the Croatian Privatization Fund of selling him the Mljekara enterprise but not permitting him to register it in his own name. He claims that he concluded a contract with the Croatian Privatization Fund for the purchase of 50 percent of Mljekara's shares and is seeking a refund of the 4.5 million German marks he says he paid the fund, plus "large" compensatory damages. GLOBUS notes that the conflict over the dairy enterprise has been going on since September 1993. Shares of Fishing Company Transferred to Privatization Fund By a decision of the management board of the Croatian Privatization Fund [HFP], 46 percent of the shares of the Jadran-Ribolov fishing enterprise, in the amount of DM8,700,000, are being transferred to HFP ownership, reports the 11 April edition of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. The daily notes that the HFP decision, issued to Jadran-Ribolov the previous day, states that not a single one of this block of shares had attracted a buyer when they were offered to the public. According to the general director of Jadran-Ribolov, SLOBODNA DALMAJICA says, a founding meeting of the shareholders' society will be held within the next 10 days. "Small shareholders" hold a total of 43 percent of Jadran-Ribolov stock, and the Split Bank owns the remaining 11 percent. Emigres' Investments in Weapons Factory `Disappear' The 1 April issue of GLOBUS alleges that 400,000 Swiss francs invested by Croatian emigres in the "first Croatian weapons factory" have disappeared. The paper asks: "Was the founding of the TOVO shareholding company intended to be the beginning of the construction of the first Croatian weapons and military equipment factory, or was it just a trick to rob Croatian emigres of thousands of francs?" According to GLOBUS, brochures appeared in Switzerland in 1992 urging Croat emigres to become co-owners in TOVO of Zagreb, the first shareholding company "for the needs of Croats." Emigres who paid for shares of stock in the company have never seen their actual shares and have never received any dividends. All they have are receipts for their payments, says GLOBUS, adding that the TOVO enterprise does not exist, "at least not at the addresses and telephone numbers published in patriotic brochures." GLOBUS lists the names of TOVO's founders, identifying them as members of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ], the party of Franjo Tudjman. "The only success the enterprise has had," GLOBUS states, was the "publication of several issues of MAGNUM magazine," which listed Branimir Glavas, soldier and politician from Osijek, as a member of its editorial staff and several weapons specialists from the Croatian Army's General Staff as permanent assistants.
