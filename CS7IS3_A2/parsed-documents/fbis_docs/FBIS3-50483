During the ceremony to promulgate the new Constitution, President Alberto Fujimori issued a call to all sectors to reach an agreement to boost the Peruvian economy in 1994. The first reaction from the opposition in Congress was one of distrust and skepticism. Some said they would participate in the dialogue without implying agreement, while others categorically rejected the call. [Begin recording] [Congressman Ernesto Gamarra] In view of the fact that Mr. Fujimori has made no signs of wanting a concerted agreement, I cannot believe in his call to a concerted agreement. [Congressman Celso Sotomarino] Ramiro Priale said something that I have always liked: To have a dialogue is not to agree. Any civilized person should want to have a dialogue. [end recording] Regarding educational reform for the next year, which the president also announced, members of the Education Committee made the following comments: [Begin recording] [Gloria Helfer] One cannot think about reform if there is no clear proposal to improve the teachers' situation. [end recording] The minority parties in the Democratic Constituent Congress described Fujimori's request that constitutional reforms be approved by the people as an electoral tactic. The minority parties said they have been working on just that to present jointly their respective proposals. [Begin Henry Pease recording] I want to announce to the country that my faction and I presented the first draft constitutional amendment. It is very simple: to abolish the seventh transitory clause which established that the next legislature will be chosen based on the single-district concept [distrito unico]. [end recording]
