The CP called for a "general amnesty" for all people who committed crimes with a political motive. The cut-off date for such an amnesty should be the date it is announced. On Tuesday, Mr Omar announced that the government intended keeping the December 6, 1993 cut-off date for applications for amnesty from prosecution for offences committed with a political motive. The CP had asked that the cut-off date be extended to include offences committed by rightwingers who set off a series of bomb blasts that killed 19 people shortly before the April elections. The CP sharply criticised Mr Omar for saying opponents and defenders of apartheid would be treated differently. Constitutional affairs spokesmAn Fanie Jacobs said the minister's statement differed to the interpretation of President Nelson Mandela's. He said the CP would approach Mr Mandela again if necessary. The CP said thousands of African National Congress supporters had been given amnesty and release in terms of agreements between the ANC and the National Party and that these had occurred without a public statement of the offences for which amnesty had been granted. "Public hearings in the remaining cases would affect non-anc members or supporters. This process implies an inherent unequal handling of the remaining cases," the cp statement said. The composition of the commission would also reflect the minister's stance on the amnesty issue. The CP said it opposed the establishment of new structures to deal with an amnesty. The December 6 cut-off date had been unilaterally decided upon by the government parties. "In the time between December 6, 1993 and the completion of the elections there were many cases of violence such as the mass murder at Shell House, countrywide killings of policemen and car bombs at Johannesburg, Germiston and Jan Smuts aIrport. "The election is now over and political violence has declined dramatically. It would be unrealistic in the determination of the cut-off date for the amnesty to ignore these facts," the CP said. The party also criticised the appointment of Advocate Arthur Chaskalson as chairman of the Constitutional Court, saying he was an ANC supporter.
