Prior to this meeting, Financial Secretary Macleod announced the financial budget for the new fiscal year. What is noteworthy is that the budget has verified that the Hong Kong Government had a surplus of 15 billion [Hong Kong] dollars last year. In other words, the Hong Kong Government has accumulated a surplus of more than 130 billion dollars this year. We believe that this figure is quite useful for airport experts to discuss capital injections and loans for the new airport at the upcoming airport experts meeting. Many personalities pointed out that since the Hong Kong Government possesses such a huge fund, it absolutely can increase its capital injection into the airport to reduce debts and enable China and Britain to reach an early agreement on the new airport financial arrangements. Reports say that a new airport financial arrangement plan recently submitted to the Chinese side by the Hong Kong Government has suggested increasing the capital injection from 45.3 billion dollars to 60.3 billion dollars, to reduce the loan from 43 billion dollars to 23 billion dollars. However, the amount of this debt is still more than four times the 5-billion-dollar limit set by the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport. Ho Ching-on, member of the Airport Advisory Commission, said that at a time when the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's constitutional structure have broken down, the Chinese side is still willing to reopen an experts group meeting; this indicates that the Chinese side still has sincerity. Therefore the British side should also show its sincerity and make further efforts to reduce the construction cost and increase its capital injection. Legislative Councilor Chim Pui-chung, who represents people in financial circles, pointed out that if the British side still insists saying that the loan for the new airport railway does not fall into the category of "government debt," it will be difficult for the Chinese side to accept it. According to his analysis, on the question of loans--an issue on which China and Britain differ greatly--there is still room for flexible accommodation if the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding are followed. Namely, if the loan exceeds 5 billion dollars, China and Britain should consult to reach an agreement for implementation. But the amount of loan should not be too high and should correspond with the principle of cost benefit. But in Mr. Chim's and Mr. Ho's opinion, now is not the time to thoroughly resolve the above problem, because there are still great differences between the sides and the British side is still playing number games, which has caused difficulties to the talks. Therefore it is still difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement in the near future. In addition, Li Weiting, assistant to the director of the Hong Kong XINHUA Branch, pointed out that the 5-billion-dollar limit can still be discussed by the experts group and that there is also room for flexible handling of land approval. But with the huge surplus, the Hong Kong Government absolutely can inject more capital and follow the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding. He added: The British side has destroyed the foundation for cooperation on the question of constitutional structure; regarding other aspects, it depends on future development. The Chinese side does not wish to see Hong Kong's economy and people's lives seriously affected, but many matters cannot be determined by one side only.
