FR940810-1-00061 FR940810-1-00010 In addition to the requirements under the permanent program rules, OSM proposes adding other provisions for permit review. More detail is necessary when OSM is the regulatory authority in order to provide direction to the permit applicant. Section 903.773(d) would establish specific permit application review procedures. This is necessary to dispose of grossly deficient applications early in processing, to provide a procedure for obtaining additional information, and to indicate the procedure for determinations of completeness. The proposed rule at §903.773(e) would allow OSM to require an applicant to submit supplemental information to ensure compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations other than SMCRA and its implementing regulations. The proposed rule at §903.773(f) would establish, pursuant to 30 CFR 773.15(a)(1), a time period of 60 days from the close of the comment period for the regulatory authority to issue a written decision unless additional time is necessary due to the number of, or complexity of the issues. The proposed rule at §903.773(g) would establish a procedure for ensuring confidentiality of qualified permit application information. Such information would have to be labeled confidential and submitted separately to be reviewed by OSM for withholding from disclosure. In addition, §903.773(g)(1) would require the public notice required by §903.773(d)(3) to identify the type of information considered to be confidential. Finally, §903.773(g)(2) would require OSM to rule on the confidentiality of labeled application information within ten days of the last publication of the notice required under §903.773(d)(3). The proposed rule at §903.774(b) would provide that a revision of the permit that may have the potential to adversely impact the potential for the achievement of reclamation and the post-mining land use shall be considered significant. In addition, the rule provides that WSC shall consider the following factors as well as other relevant factors in determining the significance of a proposed revision: (1) Changes in production or recoverability of the coal resource; (2) The environmental effects; (3) The public interest in the operation, or likely interest in the proposed revision; and (4) Possible adverse impacts from the proposed revision on fish or wildlife, endangered species, bald or golden eagles, or cultural resources. A significant revision would require public notice and would be subject to a formal hearing if one is requested. The proposed rule at §903.774(c) would require that OSM approve or disapprove non-significant permit revisions within a reasonable amount of time. The proposed rule at §903.774(d) would allow 30 days for any person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected by a decision on the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights to submit written comments after publication of the notice required by 30 CFR 774.17(b)(2). The proposed rule at §903.774(e) would allow interested persons and public entities 30 days from the last publication of the notice to submit written comments of objections on an application for significant revision or permit renewal. The permanent program regulations at 30 CFR 779.19(a) give the regulatory authority discretion to require a map that delineates vegetation types in the proposed permit area. The proposed rule at §903.779(b) requires the applicant for a surface mining permit to submit such a map. Similarly, the proposed rule at §903.783(b) requires a vegetation map for underground mining permits. Small Operator Assistance Section 903.795 would establish the same standards for the small operator assistance program (SOAP) as are found in Part 795 of the permanent program rules. OSM expects during its administration of the SOAP in Arizona that Federal funds will be sufficient to provide for authorized services, and does not expect to exercise its option at 30 CFR 795.11(b). That option allows OSM to establish a formula for allocating limited funds to provide the service pursuant to Part 795. OSM will award SOAP contracts to qualified laboratories utilizing a streamlined procurement system that complies with the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Prior to issuing a Request for Proposals, OSM will announce its intention through publication in the Commerce Business Daily. OSM will qualify labs as part of its contracting process. Bonding Section 903.800 establishes the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter J, Bond and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations. The proposed rule at §903.800(b) would require the operator to file an application for release of performance bond no later than 30 days prior to the end of the growing season. In addition, OSM is requesting information pertaining to any bonding requirements which may have been placed on existing surface coal mining operations in Arizona. Performance Standards Section 903.815 through 903.828 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter K. The following changes would be made: Proposed §903.816(b) would require: (1) That the standards for Revegetation success for surface mining activities shall be those specified at 30 CFR 816.116(a)(2), and (2) that the statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be included in the mining and reclamation plan. Proposed §903.817(b) would require: (1) That the standards for revegetation success for underground mining activities shall be those specified in 30 CFR 817.116(a)(2); and (2) that the statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be included in the mining and reclamation plan. Inspection and Enforcement Procedures Sections 903.842, 903.843, 903.845, and 903.846 establish the same provisions as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter L, Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures . No changes to the inspection and enforcement provisions of the permanent program regulations are proposed for the Arizona Federal program. The proposed rules at §§903.842(b) and 903.843(b) would require OSM to furnish to a designated Arizona State agency with jurisdiction over mining, on request, copies of inspection reports and enforcement actions, respectively. Blaster Training and Certification Section 903.955 cross-references 30 CFR Part 955 of the permanent program regulations.
