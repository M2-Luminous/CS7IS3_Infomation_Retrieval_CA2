According to the Termo brokerage firm, one of the main agricultural operators in the Commodities and Futures Exchange, Brazil could increase its revenues from exports of agricultural commodities from $5 billion to $6 billion this year, with an average 60 percent increase in its coffee, soybean, orange juice, and cotton quotations, among others. "With coffee alone, export revenues will increase by $1.2 billion," says Termo director Francisco Arantes. The annual volume of agricultural exports amounts to $10 billion. "The prices of commodities began to increase in March due to the volatile nature of international interest rates, which has benefited Brazil," he adds. Arnim Lore, director for international affairs at the Fonte Bank, says that American exports, as well as exports quoted in dollars, have gained greater competitiveness. "Brazilian exporters in general are gaining momentum," he said. Carlos Langoni, director of the World Economy Center of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said that this is particularly true for those who are exporting to Europe and Asia. According to Angelim Curiel, the Citibank foreign trade director, 80 percent of Brazilian exports are made in dollars. He said: "We are therefore in a similar position to that of U.S. exporters, whose prices will now become more competitive." He added: "In sum, those who export to Europe and Asia will benefit from the dollar decline, as will those who export to the United States, as a result of the greater economic activity." In the case of agricultural commodities, exporters will win with the price increase. Other sectors will be able to sell their products more cheaply in the local currencies (such as Japanese yen or German mark) and increase their income by selling higher volumes. Economist Adroaldo Mouda da Silva, director of Silex Trading, notes that international developments will help Brazilian exporters at this juncture, when the implementation of the real will affect exports because it has established a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. "A form of compensation has taken place," he said. "Brazil will no doubt win a few billion dollars," he added.
