The question being raised, Mr. President, is: What are your views on the international support for this proposal, the holding of an international seminar on Western Sahara? Do you see this peace seminar as an alternative to or as an option for the peace plan, or both? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I would like to thank Algerian national radio's Channel 1 for following up the Saharan process to achieve freedom, self-determination, and national independence for the Saharan people. [passage omitted] The past 21 years were characterized by war and escalation, sometimes with the Spanish and other times with the parties to the Madrid Agreement, and sometimes with the Moroccan Government. This period was also characterized by attempts to achieve a settlement sometimes by direct dialogue and sometimes by dialogue through international organizations. Since the latest development in 1988, an agreement was reached on what has become known as the international UN peace plan on Western Sahara. This peace plan aims at organizing a free and democratic referendum for the Saharan people through which they could express their wishes regarding their destiny. The referendum will be organized and supervised by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. It will ask the Saharan people whether they want independence or whether they want to join the Moroccan kingdom. The voters were defined according to the Spanish census of 1974. [passage omitted] Optimism prevailed in the region and the world. Everybody believed that everything was moving forward and that the UN plan would have a happy ending at the beginning of 1992. However, at that time the Moroccan Government backed down on its commitments and tried, by all means, to hinder the holding of a referendum on the Saharan people's self-determination. The main obstacle erected by the Moroccan Government was an attempt to impose on the Spanish census figures more than 170,000 Moroccans as additional voters. Thus, the Moroccan Government tried to rig the referendum by replacing Saharans with Moroccans in the referendum in order to guarantee that the result would be in its favor and to impose a de facto situation for the occupation of the Western Sahara. Since 1992 the United Nations and we have been trying to overcome the obstacles placed by the Moroccan Government. Undoubtedly, everybody knows that without the compromises put forward by Polisario in order to attain peace and the sacrifices we endured, the UN peace plan would have not been completed and the issue would have not advanced. Everybody knows that for the sake of peace and a peaceful settlement we have accepted that an occupied people will be asked whether they want to be independent or to join the occupying country. It is usual to ask one question: Do you want independence or not? Everybody knows that we have accepted that the referendum will be held with the presence of 65,000 Moroccan soldiers in the Western Sahara. Everybody knows that the referendum may be held with the presence of the Moroccan administration, the Moroccan police, and Moroccan settlers. Everybody also knows that this war machine, which has been forced by Morocco on the Western Sahara since 1975, will not be neutral during the election campaign or during the self-determination referendum. On the contrary, the entire war machine will be mobilized to confront and pressure the Saharan people during the referendum. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you mentioned that the Saharan side has made compromises so that the UN peace plan can be implemented in the Western Sahara. The problem which will arise when the UN peace plan is implemented is the question of voters. Has the question of the voters been resolved yet and is it the only obstacle in the implementation of the peace plan? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] No, the issue has not been resolved. The peace plan states that the Spanish census is to be the basis for vote counting. The Moroccan Government wants to add to the Spanish census 170,000 Moroccans who have nothing to do with the Spanish census or with the Western Sahara. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Will there be a compromise between the Sahara's 1974 census and the Moroccan census? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The UN secretary-general presented a so-called compromise, which consists of five criteria, described as identification criteria. We have no problem with three of them because they are linked with the Spanish census. But we have expressed reservations over two of these criteria because they are the criteria of clan affiliation and of verbal testimony. If we adopt these criteria we will allow the Moroccan Government to bring in people as it wishes. Subsequently, these two criteria would allow the entire Arab Maghreb population or the entire Arab Maghreb to participate in this referendum if we adopted these criteria. [Correspondent] Mr. President, can we go back to the point mentioned earlier. You attended the Madrid seminar on peace and called for an international conference on Western Sahara. Do you have high hopes for this international conference? How do you view international support for holding such a seminar? How do you see the the UN peace plan? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] [passage omitted] In our view, an international seminar at this time and with those parties could overcome the obstacles confronting the peace process. The seminar could be a framework for dialogue to find a solution for the problems hindering implementation of the peace plan. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, the seminar is not an alternative to the peace plan, rather it would facilitate implementation of the peace plan in an attempt to find a solution to the problems confronting it. We have high hopes that the seminar, the initiative, and the call will be received positively by the various parties interested in peace in the Western Sahara. [Correspondent] Mr. President, the United Nations suggested three options for settling the Saharan issue. Since then, nothing new has appeared on the implementation of these three options. What is your position on the three options, and what do see as an alternative to them? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The question of the options was not that of a Security Council resolution, but that of a report which the [UN] secretary-general submitted last March to the Security Council which included these three options. In the end, the Security Council chose the middle option, and this is the Security Council's resolution. This option became clear in that the identification commission should start its fieldwork for registering and sorting the voters in the field and submit its findings to the Security Council in the middle of next July. Some sort of progress has been achieved, and we hope it will develop. We welcomed the commission and started cooperating with it in the field. It opened its offices in the refugee camps; it also opened offices in the occupied territories; it opened offices in neighboring countries and started the registration. We shall submit to the identification commission on 15 May [as heard] the applications on which the voters' names and their identities are recorded. It is expected that this will end at the beginning of June when the identification commission starts its work, that is, the commission, the two parties to the conflict, the OAU, and the two observer countries -- Algeria and Mauritania. Delegations will be formed from all these sides, and will receive the individuals to determine their identity, starting from the applications which we would have submitted on 15 May. [Correspondent] Mr. President, are we to understand that there is progress in connection with determining the identity of the voters, and that the time is close for deciding on this issue? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Yes, we have encouraged the commission, which started its work. This is considered as a new element in the development of the issue in the field. We shall judge the commission's work, its impartiality, and its ability to resolve an existing political problem through technical work between now and the end of its work. In fact, the information available to us is that the commission is now facing problems with the Moroccan Government and that the Moroccan Government is maneuvering over the commission's work and exercising pressure on the commission. We hope that progress will be achieved to bring closer the referendum date through the work which the commission is now carrying out. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago that the Moroccan Government is exerting pressure. There is another kind of pressure which is even worse and which is manifested by the fact that Morocco recently redrew the administrative borders of some Saharan areas and started to sieze more territory and installed governors in these areas. How do you view these developments, which will, of course, hinder the course of peace? Do they mean that Morocco, at least at this stage, does not want peace? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] In fact, all the stands and actions taken by the Moroccan Government since the adoption of the international peace plan contradict the text and the spirit of the UN peace plan. In addition to what I mentioned regarding Morocco adding further lists of Moroccans and its attempts to impose those lists on the United Nations, there are other acts such as the organizing [by Morocco] of legislative and local elections in Western Sahara, the administrative division introduced in Western Sahara by the Moroccan Government at the beginning of this year, and the appointment of Moroccan governors in Saharan regions. This is all happening while the Moroccan Government is required to facilitate the organizing of the referendum on self-determination for the Saharan people to decide on the final destiny of the Western Sahara. All these acts demonstrate that the Kingdom of Morocco so far does not have the political will for a just and permanent peaceful settlement based on the right of the Saharan people to self-determination in accordance with international legitimacy and the UN and OAU resolutions. Furthermore, the Moroccan Government tries to take advantage of the regional and international circumstances in order to evade its obligations and what it agreed to in 1991 in connection with the organizing of a free and democratic self-determination referendum for the Saharan people. [Correspondent] Mr. President, these actions by Morocco and its lack of political will for a settlement of the Saharan problem have caused some Saharan officials to waver between optimism and pessimism, some even went so far as to state that they expect the war to break out again in the Western Sahara. How do you view this? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Of course, as I said, we will do our best not to lose the chance of peace and to see that the UN peace plan -- which is, in fact, a gain for the people of this region including the Moroccan people -- is not destroyed and lost. We are trying to make the peace plan achieve the goal of organizing a referendum in Western Sahara. Of course, we are not on our own; there is the other party, and if there is a common will to achieve this goal, things will improve and progress will be made. But if our will for peace faces a Moroccan will trying to impose the status quo of occupation on Western Sahara, our will for peace will definitely fail and we will be forced into another status quo, that is, going back to war and struggle. Of course we want peace, a peace needed by the Saharan people, the Moroccan people, and the people of the region. The modern world calls for peace and direct dialogue between the parties to conflicts everywhere in the world, and we are following this style and this course, but our will for peace and for a free and democratic dialogue in order to reach a solution based on respect for our people's desire for freedom and independence is equal to nothing else apart from our readiness to defend our legitimate national rights to freedom and self-determination. If we are forced into war again, we will be ready to fight it. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago that the Saharan officials are working for peace. This is proved by the actions of the Saharan officials, led by your excellency, such as the recent visit to Washington where you met with American officials. We know that the United States is a member of the Security Council and, as a superpower, has a say in the Saharan issue. How did you find the American officials? What do they think and what is their stand regarding the Saharan issue? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] It is undoubtedly clear to all that the Saharan issue was not well-known at international level. Furthermore, the Americans listened for a long time only to the Moroccan thesis and argument. However, we noticed that since ratification of the international peace plan [as heard], the U.S. stand has become positive on the whole. The United States will continue (?financing) the international peace plan. The United States did not hesitate to send its officers, soldiers, and officials to Western Saharan at the request of the United Nations. During our visit to the United States, our interlocutors at the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Administration, and all groups with which we had talks showed a considerable level of understanding, particularly when [they realize that] the Saharan request consists in holding a free and democratic referendum through which the Saharan people will say what they want. We found that the Americans were sensitive to this issue and that they well understand our ideas and our request. We can truly say that on the whole the American stand is positive. [Correspondent] Mr. President, one last question. In light of the facts, the new developments, and the current international situation, and according to the information you have about the peace process in Western Sahara, can we say that the settlement of the Saharan problem is going to happen soon or not? ['Abd-al-'Aziz] My wish is that it will happen soon. As far as we are concerned, we must start action on the ground to hold the referendum as soon as possible. I think that this is the wish of the international community, too. The means appropriate to carrying out the referendum has been created, but the Moroccan stand expressed on all occasions and on the ground does not augur well. So far, any actions and any constructive initiatives aimed at proceeding forward on the path of implementing the peace plan and holding the referendum have been met with the conspiracies of the Moroccan Government and its attempts to make initiatives fail. It led to the failure of the Elayoune meeting to settle pending issues, and the New York meeting. All of these initiatives were thwarted by the Moroccan Government. Even now, we still doubt the Moroccan Government's desire for peace and its respect for international law. The Moroccan position leaves us doubting that the referendum will take place very soon. Therefore, we are cautious in our dealings; sometimes we make fresh initiatives and other times we accept compromises. But we have not seen anything in the Moroccan position which is encouraging, nor have we felt that there is a sincere intention on its part. Therefore, seizing the opportunity offered by this interviewed with your radio station, I would like to address the world community with an urgent appeal to all peace- and freedom-loving people to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Moroccan Government to comply with international laws and to implement its commitment under the peace plan on the Saharan people's self-determination.
