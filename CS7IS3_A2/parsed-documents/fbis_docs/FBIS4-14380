Their different positions on the Hamas initiative, however, do not negate the fact that all the factions are "very reproachful" because they were not consulted before that "sensitive" position was taken, although some factions have declined to comment, awaiting "clarifications from Hamas leaders" who will meet with the leaders of the other factions next week. The meeting of the "central command" of the alliance of opposition forces, scheduled to be held on 19 April, was postponed "but that was because Hamas' leaders were unable to make the journey from Amman in view of the circumstances they were experiencing," according to Palestinian sources. The sources told AL-HAYAH that Hamas is targeted by everyone because of its position and the fact that it is the only party operating effectively and aggressively in the territories. Two trends have emerged within the Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo agreement regarding the Hamas "truce." They are basically based on the various factions' positions, nature, and views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the extent of their willingness to accept phased solutions for that conflict. The factions which support the "Palestinian national program" (the 1974 phased program) have supported Hamas' new position and see it as "a positive development in the political thinking." They include the four factions which are PLO members, namely the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by George Habash, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF] led by Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, and the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF] led by Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar (Yusuf al-Miqdah). Those opposed to the new Hamas stance are the factions opposed to phased solutions such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFL-GC] led by Ahmad Jibril, the Arab Liberation Front (Fatah-the Uprising) led by Colonel Abu-Musa, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement led by Fathi al-Shaqaqi. All the factions, however, are unanimous in their "rebuke" for the Hamas leaders for not contacting them before taking that position. DFLP sources said "we would have liked to discuss the matter within the alliance so that we could announce a unified position by the alliance." The DFLP sources told AL-HAYAH that its representative in the alliance Qays al-Samarra'i (Abu-Layla) had suggested to them "in the early consultations before the announcement of the alliance that we would be prepared to adopt the points made regarding the questions of full Israeli withdrawal and the right of self-determination in return for a truce" with the Israelis. They added "Hamas should have discussed the matter within the alliance's central command." DFLP sources stressed that there were "positive points in the main position announced by Hamas in an official statement because it marked the start of a realistic approach to the current developments and introduced a tangible crystallized alternative to the Oslo-Cairo agreements," but the same sources added that the Hamas initiative included three loopholes "of serious political implications." One, they said, was that Hamas appeared to be confining its handling of the Palestinian question to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including its call for a new leadership from the people of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. That is a serious matter, they added, because it ignores the unity of the Palestinians at home and abroad. The second loophole, according to these sources, is that Hamas ignored "the right of self-determination and just talked about Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank." They also pointed out that Hamas "also ignored the refugee problem which is one of the main causes of the Palestinian people. That was the third dangerous point in the position of the brothers in Hamas." The sources reaffirmed the DFLP's rejection of the fact that Hamas was treating the Palestinian question "as if it was a question of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, something we do not accept at all."
