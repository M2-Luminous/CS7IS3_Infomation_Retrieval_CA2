ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Michigan for the purpose of establishing new Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On June 12, 1993 and November 12, 1993 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted VOC rules to the EPA as proposed revisions to Michigan's ozone SIP. These revisions address deficiencies listed in letters dated December 11, 1990 and August 23, 1991 to the State of Michigan commenting on proposed State regulations (addressing the requirement of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (Act) that States correct deficient VOC RACT rules (``fix-up'' requirement)) and the requirement of the Act that States adopt VOC RACT rules where not previously required (``catch-up'' requirement). Further, these revisions address deficiencies in Rules 628 and 629 which were disapproved on December 12, 1993 (58 FR 64678). The rationale for the approval is set forth in this final rule; additional information is available at the address indicated. Elsewhere in this Federal Register , EPA is proposing approval of, and soliciting public comment on, this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments are received on this direct final rule, EPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in the final action on the proposed rule published in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . Unless this final rule is withdrawn, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested SIP revision. DATES: This final rule will be effective November 7, 1994, unless notice is received by October 7, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), EPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. Copies of the SIP revision request and the EPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Douglas Aburano at (312) 353&hyph;6960 before visiting the Region 5 office.) EPA, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas Aburano, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), EPA, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;6960. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Under section 107 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), EPA designated certain areas in each State as not attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. For Michigan, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978) and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). For these areas, section 172(a) of the 1977 Act, required that the State revise its SIP to provide for attaining the primary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than December 31, 1982. 1 1 The 1977 Act's requirements for an approvable SIP are described in a ``General Preamble'' for part D rulemaking published at 44 FR 20372 (April 4, 1979), 44 FR 38583 (July 2, 1979), 44 FR 50371 (August 28, 1979), 44 FR 53761 (September 17, 1979), and 44 FR 67182 (November 23, 1979). Sections 172 (b) and (c) of the 1977 Act require that for stationary sources, an approvable SIP must include legally enforceable requirements reflecting the application of RACT to sources of VOC emissions. For the purpose of assisting State and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared three groups of Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents which each establish the presumptive norm for RACT for a specific source category. In cases where the State adopts rules that are less stringent than in the CTG, the State must justify that those rules are RACT for that source or source category. In partial response to the requirement for VOC RACT rules, the State of Michigan submitted and EPA approved controls representing the application of RACT for certain stationary sources of VOCs covered by the first two groups of CTGs (RACT I_40 CFR 52.1170(c)(16) (45 FR 29790); 40 CFR 52.1170(c)(39) (46 FR 43422); 40 CFR 52.1170(c)(56) (47 FR 32116) and RACT II_40 CFR 52.1170(c)(56) (47 FR 32116)).
