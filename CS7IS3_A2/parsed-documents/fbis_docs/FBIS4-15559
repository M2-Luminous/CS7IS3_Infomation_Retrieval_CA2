He noted that Russia has long-standing political, cultural, and international links with this state. Seven documents will be signed -- the most important being a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. It is worth noting, Kostikov said, that it has been decided to sign these documents in the Moncloa Palace, where the agreement on civil consensus in Spain was once signed. This fact, the press secretary believes, forms a kind of bridge between international actions and our current domestic problems. Vyacheslav Kostikov went on to answer numerous questions from journalists on Russia's international and domestic policy. Explaining the situation within the Russian Federal Assembly Federation Council in connection with the discussion of the question of former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik, the press secretary expressed disappointment at what had happened, but does not think that the Federation Council intended to seek a confrontation with the president. Unfortunately, emotions prevailed, and the Federation Council itself will have to find a way out of this involved situation. Answering a question about State Duma deputies' attitudes toward the signing of NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program, the press secretary noted that our position is to avoid any confrontation between the president and the State Duma on this issue. NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program, Vyacheslav Kostikov believes, presupposes extensive cooperation both in politics and in the military sphere, but one of the most important elements of big-time politics -- the economy -- cannot be hived off. Russia, as is well known, would like to join the G-7. Why not link these problems? If we are being invited to engage in partnership on an equal basis in the political and military spheres, then it would probably be logical to extend this approach to the economy as well. The briefing also touched on the question of G. Burbulis' departure from the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction. Of course, Vyacheslav Kostikov said, it is disappointing that the trailblazers of Russian democracy are leaving "Russia's Choice" -- where the forces of democracy are concentrated. When asked by this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent why the president's instructions on restoring order on the North Caucasus Railroad -- where robbery and theft from trains traveling from Chechnya continue -- are not being fulfilled, the press secretary replied that the question was a fair one, that corresponding instructions had been issued to the Defense Ministry, and that the military should be approached for further explanations.
