As announced before, on 14 February a conference of high-ranking government representatives from various Southeast Asian countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, Vietnam, and other countries, was held in Geneva to discuss the issues relating to boat people, mainly Vietnamese. The conference attendants reported that there are presently some 60,000 Vietnamese boat people currently living in various refugee camps in Hong Kong and some Southeast Asian countries. Most of these people are not considered genuine refugees and will have no choice other than returning to Vietnam. The conference attendants declared that they will not and are not be able to contribute finance to support and provide free health services to these people indefinitely. All refugee camps are planning to close as early as possible before the deadline of late 1995. Regarding repatriation allowance, a boat person returning to Vietnam used to be eligible for a $360 allowance, which has recently been reduced to $240 and will be further reduced. Apart from the allowance reduction, there are two other concrete provisions worth noting. First, the boat people arriving in Hong Kong, Japan, and Southeast Asia after 27 September 1991 will not be eligible for the allowance nor the European Community [EC] program, an assistance program that funds projects of settlement and employment for repatriates. Second, the credit, occupational training, and financial allowance programs of the EC will be terminated in November 1994. The Vietnamese boat people living outside of Vietnam, therefore, should return voluntarily and soon to Vietnam while they are still eligible for assistance from these financial support programs. Dear friends, 60,000 Vietnamese living in overseas refugee camps are related to tens of thousands of families or millions of people all around the country. Therefore, I think that the information released here is important to many people. It is even more important to those who, for some reason, still have the intention to flee illegally from their motherland. In implementing the renovation policy initiated and led by the Communist Party of Vietnam, our people have achieved important progress in the last three years. Many economic goals previously planned to be achieved by the end of 1995 had already been fulfilled at the end of 1993. We have progressed from the stage where many people did not have enough to eat, to being able to resolve the food shortage problem and exporting some 1.4 million tonnes of rice every year. The inflation rate decreased from a three-digit to a two-digit number and came down to 4.4 percent in 1993. More than 700 projects, large and small, of foreign investment with a total capital of over $7 billion are being developed in various socioeconomic sectors all over the country. The living standards of our people, though still not quite satisfactory, have been improved significantly. The social and political stability are well safeguarded. Our developing economy, our stabilized society, and the assistance from the world community, are the key factors to help nearly 20,000 people from various refugee camps return in the last three years, quickly reintegrate into the community, and resettle fairly well. Many of them have become rich. Inherited from our thousand-year-old generous tradition, the merciful Vietnam motherland, the people, and the authorities at all levels always open arms widely for the children, the siblings, and the friends coming back from the wrong. New opportunities and challenges are awaiting each and every citizen of Vietnam. Out of your home, out of work. [sentence as heard] There is no place like your own people's community and your own motherland, would you agree with me? If you are of the same opinion, every one of us, in our own circumstances, should do something to prove our people's love to each other and advance together toward the goals of a prosperous people and a strong country.
