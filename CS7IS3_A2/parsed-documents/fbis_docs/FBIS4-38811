Bezborodov, member of the Russian parliamentarians' group and a deputy chairman of the State Duma's commission on defense and security, said at the meeting with the president of Azerbaijan. This group, which represents the Russian Way parliamentary faction (leader S. Baburin) has been in Azerbaijan for several days and is conducting active work. On the eve of the meeting with the president, the group was received by the parliament chairman, Rasul Guliyev. The group includes members of the clergy, the military, and agrarian economists. Thus, it is not surprising that economic issues were raised as well. In particular, it was said that the economic potential of our countries is not being fully utilized and "as a result, both countries lose." Although not too long ago convoys of "gifts of nature" were being sent to Moscow without encountering any particular obstacles. The guests were also interested in the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan; in this connection the president said that after the disintegration of the Union certain processes affecting people's lives have indeed began. Russia is concerned about Russians living in other countries. "Now the Russians live in most normal conditions," said the head of state. "If some problems do arise in the future, we are capable of dealing with them." It was probably the first time that journalists heard from the mouth of Russian politicians the thesis of the unconditional need for withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan; N. Bezborodov made this statement: "Armenia must withdraw troops from the occupied territories." Russian parliamentarians agree that the mass media seriously distort the situation in the region, "do not deliver objective information, and suppress many things." The deputies assured the president that the detailed information they have received here will be presented to the mass media, to the parliament, and the government of Russia--which, actually, was one of the main purposes of their visit to Azerbaijan.
