Such a serious matter, a juggernaut of world politicians and European ministers, did not deserve to be hurried. For, hurry may lead to grave mistakes that, considering the present situation in Bosnia, would later be impossible to correct. Rumors composed of news from various sources have increased the pressure even more. Russian sources say that the leadership of the Bosnian Serb extremists is no longer trusted, but that they demand confirmation from our authorities. The Russians used high diplomatic channels to inquire whether it was true that Prime Minister Silajdzic and Momcilo Krajisnik agreed to divide Sarajevo, destroy Butmir airport, and build a new airport for each side. Furthermore, we received information that the Serbs came to Geneva with a map on which east Bosnia is just a little bit bigger and nothing more. According to the same sources, Croatia is prepared to relinquish enclaves held by the HVO [Croatian Defense Council], but will not give up Neum. The Serbian-Croatian side arranged that access to the sea be solved via Prevlaka. "Demands of Europe" The European Union, which, it seems, is pretending to hold the key to the decision this time, presented secret demands for "all three sides." The Serbs are required to give 3 to 4 percent of the territory within the framework of the agreement made on the carrier "Invincible," to guarantee full freedom of movement around Sarajevo and the enclaves, to accept the modus vivendi, and to end the siege right away. European ministers said that the inflexible attitude of the Serbs is the main obstacle to peace. The Serbs were also warned that continued bombing of safe areas under UN protection would no longer be tolerated. The Croats were told to grant access to the sea at Prevlaka and Ploce, and to allow using the port on the Neretva River. They were also advised to prepare an alternative in the area of the municipality of Neum that, at Klek, will give access to the sea, so that, in case of the divorce of the Bosnian republics, it will be an access to the sea for the Bosnian republic. Croatia was told that its international recognition would be at stake if it did not comply with this demand. It was also told that economic and trade relations with the European Union would be strained even further if it did not meet the requirements for the implementation of the final agreement. The Bosnian leadership was asked to stop military activities by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia and provocations on the demarcation lines in Sarajevo. The negotiations were exceptionally unorganized this time. They were supposed to begin at 1200, instead of at 1100, but they actually began at 1430. As a matter of fact, our delegation was given the role of an observer. Throughout the day, the cochairmen of the peace process informed it of the progress of negotiations with the other two sides. And at 1800, it was announced that a new Serb-Croat proposal was completed, so Izetbegovic and Silajdzic met with Milosevic, Karadzic, and Krajisnik, in the presence of Owen and Stoltenberg. Then they presented the plan that gives 33.3 percent of the territory. It all sounded like the right road to peace, until they put the map on the table. No one in our delegation expected to see something like that. We expected the one-third of the territory to be tied to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are directly interested in, considering the real situation. That proposal did not comply with any concession we thought necessary. Eastern Bosnia, was not expanded significantly, although that had been promised. The map only showed the connection between Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica. The same happened with west Bosnia. Not a word about returning the territory of Sanski Most, Kljuc, Prijedor.... The access to the sea, as seen by Milosevic and Tudjman, has a very unnatural geographic silhouette. It is about 120 km away from the territory of the Bosnian republic. The road to Prevlaka, whose northern part of the peninsula is supposed to become our harbor, mostly goes along the Croatian-Montenegrin border, through a very difficult terrain, and that solution is more of a worry than the one that solves any problem. The Bosnian state delegation has no intentions of relinquishing Neum, for that territory belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina and it is the only natural access to the sea. Indeed, there are some difficulties, like shallow waters or the fact that there is no harbor there, but no solution is ideal. Neum will be one of the main headaches of European ministers due to the stubbornness of Croatian President Tudjman. According to one proposal, Neum could also be under joint Bosnian-Herzegovinian authority, or, according to another, the United States could undertake to have a two-year administration until the final solution is found. "Diluting the Agreement" We were most disappointed to see some questions that we considered solved opened for discussion again. Those questions concern Brcko and Doboj. After details of the two problems were explained, Silajdzic referred to the proposal as "two steps backward" and accused the Serbs of coming up with a new proposal every time, thus putting back the negotiations. Lord Owen agreed that it was frivolous for "sensible adults" to change solutions on which they had previously agreed. According to the latest proposal, Brcko is cut off from the territory of the Bosnian republic by 12 to 15 km. Milosevic offered guaranteed access and territorial sovereignty at the Sava River. He said one must not allow that the connection between large Serbian territories in western and eastern Bosnia "hang" on a viaduct like a "cherry petal." There was much discussion about Brcko, but no agreement was reached. We insisted on keeping things as we had arranged much earlier. The solution for Doboj is supposed be significantly changed, naturally in favor of Karadzic. There was no agreement about that. We demand free use of the railway station and railway junction, as was previously arranged. Regarding central Bosnia, there were also many changes in Milosevic's geographic vision of Bosnia. The Croatian "intestine in the stomach" of the Bosnian republic was made larger, but Milosevic proposed that Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo, and Prozor belong to us, in order to round up the map of central Bosnia in the shape of a ball, and Serbia would somehow arrange with Croatia about some other concessions that would be acceptable. President Izetbegovic demanded that Novi Travnik and Vitez be assigned to the Bosnian republic. "Serbian Peasant Sarajevo" Sarajevo is still one of the major problems. Karadzic is pushing his proposal on, as he says, "peasant Sarajevo," a parallel city between Rajlovac and Ilidza. He did not accept the two-year UN administration, because he said it would only postpone the undeferrable separation. According to the plan presented at the table, out of 3.2 percent of the area of Sarajevo in the total territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic, 2.3 percent would belong to the Bosnian republic. That includes 90 percent of the city of Sarajevo. We think that the problem of this proposal lies in communications. We want free flow of all communications -- and we offer the same to the Serbian side, in the form of roads and railroads toward the north (Vogosca and Ilijas) -- or the UN administration. Momcilo Krajisnik proposed that the city be divided in the direction east-west on banks of the Miljacka River. Krajisnik "sadly" deduced that the position of Sarajevo was ideal, but upside down, so that it would be really difficult to reach a solution. We repeated our demand for eastern Bosnia, i.e. several territories that would connect Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia (Zepce and Srebrenica to Gorazde, including Visegrad). We were actually not talking about demands, but repeating what was agreed on principle with the European Union. We must only find the way to realize that. Definitely not the one Karadzic wants. In general, the plan is painfully implementable. By agreeing to this solution, we would accept the plan that would resettle about 300,000 people and perhaps another 500,000 would not be able to return to their homes. We refuse to withdraw from any of territories that we are holding. It seems that the entire campaign about peace in Bosnia as a Christmas gift for the Balkans and Europe is premature. However, it will be continued in Brussels, where Milosevic and Tudjman will be pressured by European ministers. Some of our leaders say that we are nevertheless much closer to peace than it seems.
