We should help the budget with our actions." This is the way Aleksander Kwasniewski appealed to the SLD Sejm deputies during the Wednesday [5 January] session of the SLD Deputies Club. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is said to have tried to explain to the PSL's Sejm deputies "how this kind of domestic debt came about and how the budget corresponds to keeping election promises." Most of the opposition Sejm deputies as well as the Union of Labor and some trade unionists who are members of the SLD intend to take a look at the budget draft in the Sejm commissions, even though they basically think it is bad. The Pawlak government's budget draft was the main preoccupation of Sejm deputies in their unofficial talks, especially during sessions of the various parliamentary clubs on Wednesday. But there was not too much fuss about it. The draft, which "fulfills nobody's dreams" but which could not be any other way (as Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister, told his deputies) was perceived with calm before its first reading. "As far as I know, this is a special kind of law, which cannot be rejected at its first reading. It must find its way to the commission," said Jerzy Osiatynski of the Democratic Union [UD], who added that UD cannot approve of this budget because it is an instrument for implementing an economic policy that is different from that of UD. Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, called the draft a budget "of national disaster," and he also said that his party has not yet decided on a course of action, but it does not rule out submitting a motion for rejecting the draft at its first reading. Borowski said during a session of the SLD Sejm Deputies Club that he hopes the PSL "will approve of the draft even though it will not be happy with it." Someone from the audience said at the beginning of the PSL Sejm Deputies Club's session that the budget is not satisfactory because it is not a budget of transformations. According to Janusz Piechocinski, in its statement in the Sejm, the PSL will be asking questions on the meaning behind the budget--and on what it is supposed to lead to--in the context of a four-year term of office by the government. They will also be asking what proportion of election-time promises the budget fulfills. "Borowski will have to respond outright: We will do this and this but not that or that because these will be included in the next budget." "The PSL expects," he added, "that, while presenting the draft in the Sejm, Borowski will make it clear that its shape is a result of necessities, including servicing both the foreign and the domestic debt." While answering questions from SLD members about to what extent the budget is a continuation and to what extent it represents change, Borowski jokingly replied that it is a "new budget to the extent of 3 percent because this is by how much revenues exceed what would have been in a draft submitted by Hanna Suchocka's Cabinet." He said the latter revenues are somewhat "tightened up." Kwasniewski made an appeal to "think positively" about the draft and to reconcile the "harsh economic reality with social expectations." He also said that, on the issue of submitting the budget before the commission, just as during the entire vote on the budget, a strict, clubwide discipline will be enforced in the SLD. Stanislaw Wisniewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, told RZECZPOSPOLITA later that, in that case, he may be absent from the vote. He will not oppose the budget during its first reading, but he does not have great hopes that the commissions will manage to improve it significantly. That is why he will be counting on 30-40 SLD members to support his position during the final vote on the budget. Another deputy chairman, Waclaw Martyniuk, thinks it is just simple "trade union rhetoric," while, regarding the vote, he will... at this point he snapped two of his fingers.
