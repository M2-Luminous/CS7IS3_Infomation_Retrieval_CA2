Having signed the basic program of the Partnership for Peace last week, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said the Lithuanian Army would have to be rearmed, so that it could meet NATO standards. Lithuanian Military Chief of Staff Stasys Knezys told the Baltic News Service that the prospects of standardization in the army were unclear and that no concrete steps had been taken in this respect. According to Mr. Knezys, Lithuania should first of all decide what quality and quantity of armaments and defense systems it needs. Meanwhile NATO officials believe that rearmament should be started with replacing communication systems and not weapons. At present Lithuania is using 10 various (?such) systems, and their adaptation to NATO standards would require huge funds, which the national defense system doesn't possess.
