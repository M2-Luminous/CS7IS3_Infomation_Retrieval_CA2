Officials close to the prime minister claimed that Rabin was furious at Harish, less over the content of his remarks then about the fact that he made them while on an official trip abroad. "The amazing thing is that Harish, who holds many private meetings with Rabin, never expressed any such grievances to the prime minister," one of Rabin's close associates said. Several ministers justified Harish's criticism of Rabin, but insisted that their statements be kept off the record. One of the ministers said that Harish was not the only one who had been offended by boorish remarks from Rabin. Ministers expressed the assessment that Harish's statements came in the wake of an incident between him and the prime minister that took place at a recent cabinet session. When Harish started to leave the meeting, which had gone on for a long time, Rabin asked him where he was going. Harish replied that people were just "chattering away" at the meeting while he had work to do. Rabin got very angry and ordered Harish to stay. "Listen to the idle chatter and do your work later tonight," Rabin told the minister who was forced to stay until the cabinet session was over. In another instance, Rabin questioned the need for a trip abroad by Harish, which greatly annoyed the industry and trade minister. Labor party sources noted that if Harish criticizes the prime minister in such an open and blunt fashion, then Rabin's position as Labor party chairman is indeed very shaky. On the other hand, a minister who supports Rabin said that Harish's remarks should be viewed in the context of the "future primaries" in the Labor party.
