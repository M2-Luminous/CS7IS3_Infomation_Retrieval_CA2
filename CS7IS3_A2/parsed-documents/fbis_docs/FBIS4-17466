Talking to a reporter for INTERFAX-Ukraine in Kiev Saturday, Kravchuk warned against attempts to play up the Defense Ministers' failure to negotiate a solution, in Sebastopol [Sevastopol]. According to Kravchuk, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin agreed in a telephone conversation on Saturday that negotiating teams must prepare appropriate documentation but a political decision will rest with the two presidents. Kravchuk stressed that a decision on the Black Sea Fleet will not be detrimental to the Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean interests and will meet security interests and encourage cooperation. Kiev raised no objections to the use of naval facilities in Sebastopol by the Russian Fleet, and the conclusion of separate agreements on the use of facilities in Ketch and Donuzlava. But, said Kravchuk, Russia cannot have as many as five or six naval facilities in Crimea. With this proviso, there will be no solution to the problem. It had been decided, Kravchuk said, that the Fleet was fifty percent Ukrainian and the whole world knew that Crimea belonged to Ukraine. Kravchuk dismissed as hardly serious Crimean President Meshkov's demand for the withdrawal of the Ukrainian troops from Crimea. The whole world recognized Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine, Kravchuk said. Strangely enough, the Crimean president failed to remember that.
