[Aguirre] It will be based on a platform with clear and specific proposals to resolve the problems the country will face in 1995. We will not resort to personal attacks that are unworthy of the entire political system and especially of those who resort to this ignoble method. We also will not resort to deriding the ideas of our political opponents merely because we do not share all or some of their ideas. We will not even engage in unfavorably judging the national or departmental administration of other parties. It is not by monitoring the past or denying the success of former administrations--including our party's administration--that we will instill faith and optimism in the citizens. [EL PAIS] What would be your first step if you were elected president of the Republic? [Aguirre] I would call on the leaders of all parties, beginning with those of our own party, to form a coalition government and, if possible, a government of national unity. [EL PAIS] What do you understand is a coalition government? [Aguirre] It is a government formed by various parties that jointly establish the basic guidelines for the policies to be implemented, share their responsibilities, and support it, by a majority, in Congress. There is no such coalition government when these basic guidelines are exclusively established by the president of the Republic and his closest aides. There is no coalition government either when the president merely appoints citizens from other parties for both ministerial or autonomous agency posts. [passage omitted] [EL PAIS] Do you agree with the current government's economic policy? If you were elected president, would you continue implementing the same policy? [Aguirre] I agree with its basic guidelines, which are the following: the opening of the economy, regional economic integration, curbing inflation, and reducing the fiscal deficit. I do not share, however, a dogmatic implementation of this policy because I believe dogmatism is bad in all walks of life. Therefore, if I were elected president, I would continue implementing these four basic guidelines, but with the flexibility required to adjust them to dynamic and changing realities. At any rate, I do not hope to conduct a government that will be a repetition of the current one. [EL PAIS] In your opinion, what are the principal problems the next government will have to face? [Aguirre] There are various problems like achieving conditions that will allow our producers and entrepreneurs to successfully compete within the framework of economic integration with our neighbors; implementing an effective decentralization, which will not be achieved by forming new organizations in Montevideo but by promoting new entrepreneurial projects harmoniously distributed throughout our national territory; reforming or updating our education system, adjusting it for our young people's required integration into the labor market; reforming social security, which in no way will violate the rights of existing retirees; defining the state's role and its reform so as to reduce the burden on productive activities; and--without finishing the list of issues to be resolved--implementing an agricultural, livestock, and industrial policy that will favor growth in our country's entire productive sector and create new and effective job openings. [passage omitted] [EL PAIS] Will the constitutional reform be approved? Why are you supporting it? [Aguirre] No doubt it will be approved. Obviously, most citizens agree with this reform. They especially support the so-called "multiparty voting" system. This is an unequivocal wish in the interior of our country. And a recent poll already indicates the resolute support of 66 percent of the voters. As everyone knows, I am supporting this reform with profound conviction because I believe in free voting. For obvious reasons, it does not make any sense for a person who votes for a given party's presidential candidate to not be allowed to vote, if this is the person's idea, for another party's mayoral candidate.
