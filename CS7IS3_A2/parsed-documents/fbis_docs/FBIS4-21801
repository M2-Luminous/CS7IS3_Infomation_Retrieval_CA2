But if the Turkish authorities refuse to come to the negotiating table, if the genocide against the Kurdish population continues, we will continue the struggle,'' Jamal Qadir, a spokesman for the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan [NLFK], said at a press conference in Moscow. This was organized under the title ``Kurds: Fight for Survival'' in conjunction with the Association of CIS Kurds. It was attended by Yuriy Nabiyev, chairman of the association's Political Council. J. Qadir gave specific examples of genocide against the Kurdish nation. Thus two Kurdish villages whose population boycotted the 27 March local elections were bombed and totally wiped out recently in southeastern Turkey. People were killed and wounded. He described as lies and provocation the rumors that the NLFK is training fighters on Armenian territory and also that it was involved in the recent explosion on the Baku subway.
