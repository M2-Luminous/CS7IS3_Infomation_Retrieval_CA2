In a TV panel discussion Sardar Asif dealt at length with the entire spectrum of the foreign policy. He said the American non-papers are not the official stand of the US administration. But during the on-going visit of US Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott both sides will exchange their official stands on the irritants in Pakistan-US relations. He said the US administration desires to bring its relations with Pakistan on the level witnessed by the past. However, there are some difficulties to achieve this objective and these impediments are due to the stand by the US Congress. But the US administration is trying hard to find some way out. "We have got some proposals in this regard which will be discussed with Talbott and both sides will try to shorten their distance on their respective positions." Foreign Minister clarified that the issue of F-16s is in no way linked with Pakistan's nuclear programme. "We had signed a contract with USA for the delivery of 71 F-16s fighter planes." Reiterating Pakistan's stand on nuclear non-proliferation he said we are absolutely against the proliferation of nuclear arms in the region. Pakistan has offered many proposals like five-nations talks on the nuclear issue. "But until and unless India comes out with same spirit nothing will happen unilaterally from Pakistan." Sardar Asif said it is wrong to say that Pakistan failed to achieve its objectives at the UN Commission for Human Rights meeting in Geneva. "The real objectives of the resolution were to reduce Indian repression in held Kashmir, to internationalise the Kashmir issue, focus world attention on the current Kashmir situation and to remove the iron curtain weaved by India around Kashmir." he explained. He said sound ties with Islamic countries are still the major plank of Pakistan's foreign policy. Trade relations with them need further consolidation. He rejected the impression that the present government has ignored the Central Asian Region for further diplomatic initiatives. "Pakistan enjoys sound relations with these republics on all levels. The trouble in Afghanistan is the main hurdle to make further improvement but we we are not disappointed". He hoped peace would return to Afghanistan this year. He said Karakoram highway will be used for trade and railway track will also be laid down on the same route. In Afghanistan, be said the main problem was to end the blockade of food supply to Kabul which was achieved by his two visits to Afghan capital.
