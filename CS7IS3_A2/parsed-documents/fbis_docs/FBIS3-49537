These fees make it difficult for our compatriots in the Western Outlands [border region of Serbia inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians] to maintain contacts with their friends and relatives in Bulgaria and limits their possibilities of visiting our country, which in many cases is for them the only way of obtaining essential goods. The Agency for Bulgarians Abroad proposes that the competent Bulgarian institutions should take steps through diplomatic channels to obtain exemption from the exit fees for Yugoslav citizens of Bulgarian nationality, especially those living in the municipalities near the border and those who have close relatives in Bulgaria.
