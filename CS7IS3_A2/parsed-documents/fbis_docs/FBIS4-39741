Analysts note that this is really a natural step for Yuriy Skokov. Back in 1991 he occupied the post of chairman of the Supreme Economic Council, and then he was secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council. In his book Notes of a President Boris Yeltsin said that "Skokov is really a prime minister in waiting [`tenevoy' premyer-ministr]" and noted the great contribution he made during the August events of 1991. According to the experts, the price Yuriy Vladimirovich would have to pay for the appointment as government head would be the guaranteed passage of the president's draft laws through the State Duma. When you recall that the other day Skokov signed an agreement in cooperation with the major deputies' group "New Regional Policy," which comprises 65 deputies, this would present no big problem. [Mashtakov] The rumors that are rife about Viktor Chernomyrdin's possible resignation as prime minister are improbable for two reasons. In the first place, Viktor Stepanovich has not yet had a major quarrel with anyone. Moreover, if you look at what his immediate subordinates (for example, Andrey Illarionov, head of the premier's analysis group, who resigned in February) have said, Viktor Stepanovich is held in high esteem by Boris Nikolayevich. Second, Chernomyrdin has real political forces behind him. Above all, you have the military-induistrial complex, the fuel and energy complex, and the agro-industrial complex, whose leaders are linked to the premier not only by similar views but also by personal friendship. Yuriy Skokov, who, according to the rumors, is to succeed Chernomyrdin as premier, is a less significant figure on the Russian Olympus. At best what he might have behind him is the support of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary faction.
