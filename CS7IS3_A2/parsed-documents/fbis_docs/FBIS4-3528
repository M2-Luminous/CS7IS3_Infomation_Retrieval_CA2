The conclusion of the committee's lengthy report runs totally counter to Britain's professed desire to improve relations with China Wu Jianmin told a weekly news briefing in Beijing. The report persists in supporting the "erroneous" policy of the British Government on the Hong Kong election issue and its "continued" confrontations with China, Wu said. The report had fully revealed Britain's intention to "prolong its colonial influence in Hong Kong." However China has the resolve and capacity to maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong long after it returns to China in 1997 he said. Wu also discussed the Qiandao Lake accident in which 32 people, including 24 Taiwanese tourists, died on a blazing cruise boat on March 31. He said the mainland side hoped the tragedy would not hinder the further development of exchanges across the Taiwan Straits. The case has been confirmed as murder and three men in their twenties have been arrested. Wu said representatives from the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) are expected to meet next month to discuss ways to protect people and property on both sides. But he did not say where the meeting will be convened. Top figures from ARATS and SEF will also do their utmost to ease the effects of this unfortunate accident, Wu said. He went on to back China's oil deployment efforts in the Nansha Islands and their waters, saying it was entirely within China's sovereignty.
