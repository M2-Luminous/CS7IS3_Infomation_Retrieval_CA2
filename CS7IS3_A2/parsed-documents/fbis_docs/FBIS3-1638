In the period 1-15 February, the province's procuratorial organs arrested a total of 12 economic criminals on the run, thus scoring an initial victory in hunting down fugitives. The provincial procuratorate lists the number of fugitives who were involved in the crimes of accepting and offering bribes at 200. Thanks to long-term efforts, the provincial procuratorial organs have arrrested 100 of them. As the remaining 100 are still on the run, it is impossible to immediately conclude some of the bribery cases. On 1 January this year, the provincial procuratorate issued a circular in which concrete instructions were set forth for local procuratorial organs to step up efforts to hunt down fugitives. Upon receipt of the circular, grass-roots procuratorial organs began to act in line with the circular's instructions on hunting down criminals under their jurisdiction.
