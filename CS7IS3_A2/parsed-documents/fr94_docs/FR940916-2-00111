FR940916-2-00111 FR940916-2-00085 EOI and ESI also request authorization to extend the authorized period for external arrangements to borrow from one or more banks through November 30, 1996 and, in the case of ESI, to increase the commitment thereunder from $90 million to $150 million. Those external arrangements will reduce the amount Entergy has committed to EOI under the EOI Loan Agreement and to ESI under the ESI Loan Agreement. The proposed bank loans would be evidenced through unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15 million for EOI, subject to the above-mentioned increase to $20 million, and up to $150 million for ESI. The notes would be payable by November 30, 1996 and would bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum selected by EOI or ESI from the Prime Rate, the CD Rate, the LIBOR Rate or the Bid Rate. The notes will, under certain circumstances and with the consent of the banks, be prepayable without premium (except in the case of the CD Rate or LIBOR Rate). EOI or ESI might agree to offer the banks a commitment fee not in excess of 3/8 of 1% per annum of the total unused portion of the lines of credit, to maintain balances in accounts with the Local Banks to yield the equivalent of 3/8 of 1%, or a combination of both. Entergy might be required to guarantee the obligations of EOI and ESI to the banks. Authorization for such guarantees through November 30, 1996 also is requested. Neither EOI nor ESI will borrow from banks until EOI and Entergy, or ESI and Entergy, have filed a post-effective amendment with the names of the banks and the terms and conditions of the loans. New England Electric System (70&hyph;8453) New England Electric System (``NEES''), 25 Research Drive Westborough, Massachusetts 01582, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act. NEES proposes to issue and sell short-term promissory notes to banks from time to time from November 1, 1994 to October 31, 1996 up to an aggregate principal amount of $100 million (``Notes''). The Notes will mature in less than one year from the date of issuance. NEES will negotiate with banks the interest costs of such borrowings. The effective interest cost of borrowings from a bank will not exceed the greater of the bank's base or prime lending rate, or the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as the high federal funds rate, plus, in either case, one percent. Certain of such borrowings may be without prepayment privileges. Based on the current base lending rate of 7.25% and an equivalent or lower high federal funds rate, the effective interest costs of such borrowing would not exceed 8.25% per annum. Payment of the Notes prior to maturity will be made on the basis most favorable to NEES, taking into account fixed maturities, interest rates, and any other relevant financial consideration. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
