FR940318-2-00197 FR940318-2-00115 III. Procedures for Expedition The Commission's decision to grant the Service's motion for a settlement conference indicates our interest in and support for measures directed at expediting omnibus rate case proceedings. In line with our decision to pursue parallel settlement/rate case tracks, we are issuing this detailed order so all who anticipate participating in this proceeding will have sufficient time to prepare for the prehearing conference. In this regard, we direct the attention of parties and those who intend to intervene to Commission rule 24(d) (39 CFR 3001.24(d)), which sets forth the matters the presiding officer and participants may consider and resolve at the prehearing conference, including the limitation of issues. All interested persons will have an opportunity to comment, at that time, on the tentative procedural schedule (Attachment B) and on proposed special rules of practice which will be distributed shortly by the presiding officer. Accordingly, participants are expected to appear at the prehearing conference fully prepared to discuss these and any other pertinent matters in detail and to make the necessary scheduling commitments that resolution of these matters will entail. In particular, we note that the Service's request does not contain any proposed changes to the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (DMCS). Further, there is some expectation that the Postal Service may request major changes in the DMCS in the near future. The Postal Service should be prepared to state whether and when it expects to propose major reclassification initiatives applicable to each of the classes of mail, and all participants should be prepared to discuss whether the consideration of proposals for changes in mail classifications in this proceeding will be productive given the pendency of major reclassification initiatives. In addition, to the extent feasible, parties are requested to provide comments on the tentative procedural dates and proposed special rules seven days prior to the prehearing conference. In conformity with the requirement of the Postal Reorganization Act and consistent with our past practice in general rate cases, we are resolved to expedite the conduct of this proceeding. We intend to adhere to the procedural requirements and filing deadlines set forth in our rules of practice and in any special rules of practice subsequently issued.
