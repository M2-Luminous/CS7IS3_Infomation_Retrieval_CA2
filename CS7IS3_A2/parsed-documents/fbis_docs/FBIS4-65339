He observes that the United Nations has not succeeded in resolving the conflict, and that Belgium and France are not regarded as neutral. According to Claes, the United States is in the best position to bring about a cease-fire. "Hence my idea of asking the United States to play a more active role. I am going to talk with George Moose, U.S. deputy secretary for African Affairs, and set the priority of achieving a truce," Claes said. "The United Nations must not be depicted as an institution that can work miracles," Claes added. He also said Belgium may have been naive where Rwanda was concerned. "However, I prefer to be counted among the naive than among the murderers who keep on selling increasingly modern weapons," Claes concluded. The main countries supplying arms to Rwanda are Uganda, South Africa, Egypt, and France.
