FBIS3-27938 "dreas021__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Government Plan Regarding Economic Package Noted OW3001042594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3001042594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Now that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono have agreed on a revision of the political reform bills, the government is expected to announce an economic stimulus package sometime between 2 and 4 February. The ruling parties will hold a meeting of representatives to deal with the question of reducing income and resident taxes -- the topic of most concern to all -- and will also discuss whether to raise the consumption tax rate in return. The outline of the 1994 taxation system reform plan will be finalized 8 February. The Finance Ministry's budget draft for 1994 is expected to be finished 10 February, and to become the government budget draft on 15 February. The government plan is to deal with all pending economic issues by the 11 February Japanese-U.S. summit. The overall economic package is made up primarily of additional public works projects, increased purchase of public-use land in advance, and assistance to housing construction and small and medium businesses. Public investments and loans for these projects are predicted to come to almost 9 trillion yen. Detailed plans will be worked out on them henceforth. The reduction of taxes will probably come in the scale of 6-7 trillion yen as a way of promoting consumption, and it is likely that even if the related bills on the measure are passed in summer, they will become effective retroactive to January. Once the Diet formally enacts the political reform bills, the representatives of coalition parties will enter in-depth discussions on the question of raising the consumption tax as a source of budget revenue. As the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is opposed to the concept, there is bound to be tough negotiations with the Finance Ministry, which insists on specifying the raising of taxes as a revenue resource. After the representatives' meeting, if they decide to entrust the prime minister with making a decision, the prime minister will make a decision on such points as the scale of the tax reductions and the time lag between the reduction of the income and residents tax and the raising of the consumption tax. The government is likely to hold a Cabinet meeting to decide on the overall economic stimulus package some time between 2 and 4 February. It will formulate and submit to the Diet the 1993 supplementary budget to implement the stimulus measures by mid-February. In the meantime, the contents of the 1994 taxation system reform plan will also be finalized, and all ministries and agencies will negotiate with the Finance Ministry on the scale of their budgets, including defense expenses and official development assistance in expenditures. Because of difficult financial conditions, the budget scale will be contained as much as possible, while expenses allocated to public works will be raised to rev up the economy.
