The Czech Army is facing a complex transformation process which involves modernisation of the obsolete military equipment. This should be performed by Czech companies cooperating with foreign suppliers, Baudys said during a discussion-meeting with CTK editors. For this, the Czech companies have sufficient potential but they are lacking sophisticated know-how which is being offered by Israel, he added. The Israeli army has rich experience with modernising the Soviet-made weapons and weapons systems of which it gained a considerable amount after the Arab-Israeli 1967 Six-Day War, Baudys said. The Israeli companies are offering top-quality technology for modernising the Slovak-made T-72 tanks, MiG aircraft, missile systems and sophisticated ammunition. The individual companies will make the final decision after the Defence Ministry presents concrete orders, said Baudys, adding that the projects of modernisation of the Czech Army would be completed by the end of June. The visit of the Czech Defence Ministry delegation to Israel during which the two countries signed an outline memorandum on military cooperation paved the way for cooperation in the military sphere, Baudys said. Israel considers the Czech Republic a reliable and trustworthy partner which is evidenced by the fact that cooperation in such a delicate sphere as military technology usable for civilian purposes as well was supported by the Israeli Defence Ministry and Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli premier and defence minister, Baudys stated.
