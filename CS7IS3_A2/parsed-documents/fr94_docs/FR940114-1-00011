FR940114-1-00011 FR940114-1-00003 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 78 [Docket No. 93&hyph;024&hyph;1] Brucellosis Surveillance; MCI Reactor Prevalence Rates AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are proposing instead to require the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain percentages of cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments would better serve Federal and State animal health officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before February 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;024&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are encouraged to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. M.J. Gilsdorf, National Brucellosis Epidemiologist, Cattle Diseases and Surveillance Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, room 731, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;4918. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching total eradication of the field strain Brucella abortus in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of May 1993, there were only 337 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 32 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the disease. Fewer than 500 new infected herds were identified last year. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Section 78.1 defines the terms used in the regulations. In accordance with ยง78.1, States and areas can be classified as Class Free, Class A, Class B, or Class C. These terms refer to stages of the eradication process as determined by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and State animal health officials. Class Free States and areas are considered to be free of Brucella abortus in all domestic livestock, and Class C States and areas have the highest levels of brucellosis infection. Section 78.1 sets forth the standards States or areas must meet to achieve and maintain each of the classifications. One standard for classification is the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rate. Under the MCI program, slaughtering establishments must collect blood samples from 95 percent of all cows and bulls 2 years of age and older (known as MCI test cattle). The samples are then subjected to an official brucellosis test. Animals that have serologically positive results to the official brucellosis test administered under the MCI program are MCI reactors. The regulations require animal health officials to trace MCI reactors to the farm of origin and conduct an epidemiologic investigation, to evaluate the risk that brucellosis could spread from the farm of origin. Class Free and Class A States and areas must trace at least 90 percent of all MCI reactors to the farm of origin, and Class B and Class C States and areas must trace at least 80 percent to the farm of origin. When required by the results of the epidemiologic investigation, herd blood tests must be conducted or the herds must be confined to the premises under quarantine. Examples of when herd testing or quarantine may not be necessary include cases where epidemiologic investigation reveals the MCI reactor results were not caused by field strains of Brucella , or that the herd has been or will be sent to slaughter. The MCI reactor prevalence rate is the rate of infection in a State or area's cattle population based on the percentage of MCI reactors found in the total number of MCI tested cattle. Under the regulations, Class Free States and areas must maintain a 12-consecutive-month MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed 0.050 percent. For Class A States and areas, the rate must not exceed 0.10 percent, and for Class B States and areas, the rate must not exceed 0.30 percent. Class C States and areas have an MCI reactor prevalence rate that exceeds 0.30 percent. Class Free, Class A, and Class B States and areas that exceed the required percentages may be reclassified to a lower classification. Tests used to identify MCI reactors detect not only serum titers caused by brucellosis infection but also serum titers caused by certain other organisms and by vaccination. As a result of such spurious titers, an estimate of brucellosis prevalence based solely on the MCI reactor prevalence rate in a State or area would overestimate the rate of brucellosis infection. Nevertheless, the MCI reactor data has been helpful to Federal and State animal health officials who use the rates of the individual States and areas to reveal trends and to compare their progress in eradicating brucellosis. When the United States had thousands of infected herds, we did not consider the effect of spurious titers on the States' and areas' MCI reactor prevalence rates to be significant. However, as the level of brucellosis infection in this country has declined, the proportion of spurious titers in the MCI reactor prevalence rates has increased. As a result, in Class Free States and areas, the MCI reactor prevalence rate may consist entirely of spurious titers. Therefore, we no longer believe a State or area's MCI reactor prevalence rate is a good indication of its eradication progress, and we are proposing to eliminate the requirement in the regulations that States and areas meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications.
