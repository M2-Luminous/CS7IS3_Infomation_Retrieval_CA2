Order 80&hyph;2&hyph;69 established the first interim SFFL, and Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;40 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through July 31, 1994. In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning August 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on the year ended March 31, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. By Order 94&hyph;7&hyph;36 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level: Atlantic 1.3099 Latin America 1.3538 Pacific 2.0087 Canada 1.4405 For further information contact: Keith A.
