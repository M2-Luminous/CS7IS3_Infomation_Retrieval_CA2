A Central News Unit report from Beirut cites the Hizballah secretary general, who said yesterday that in continuation of its policies in the Middle East the U.S. Government thinks only of the interests of the regime occupying Jerusalem and how to meet that regime's demands. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah described the visit by a delegation of U.S. Congressmen to Lebanon as an insult to the Lebanese people. The Hizballah secretary general said: The United States attaches importance only to the fate of a few soldiers of the occupying army who disappeared during an attack on Lebanese territory, while it pays no attention to the fate of hundreds of Lebanese who are living under the most difficult of conditions in Zionist prisons.
