Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7-South Operative Group Information Center saying that "overnight and in the early morning hours the aggressor continued his bestial destruction of residential areas in the Maglaj and Tesanj regions, and the free territories of Doboj and Teslic. In addition to this, he is relentlessly attacking the 133 km long defense lines in this area. The chetniks also attacked Tesanj and its outskirts. They attempted infantry breakthroughs in the area of Cerik and Jelicev Gaj, situated in the wider region of Miljanovci, but their attempts were thwarted. Over 100 enemy troops were put out of action in last night's battles on the Teslic-Tesanj defense line, 30 of whom were killed. In addition to this, they [Serbs] shelled civilian targets in the Tesanj region, particularly Mrkotic, Planje, and Radrsa. These attacks and the chetnik devastation are still in progress." He adds that "there was also fierce fighting in the Doboj region. One of the enemy's terrorist-subversion groups infiltrated the area of Mravici, Karusaj, and Matuzici, but it was quickly discovered and destroyed. This morning, the brave members of the 203d Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosna repelled fierce enemy infantry attacks in this area." Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "the bestial shelling of the Bihac and Cazin areas continued overnight. Chetnik howitzers, tanks, Bofors, Zis, mortars [words indistinct] where everything is being systematically destroyed. Fierce shelling and combined artillery and infantry attacks directed at the defenders on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau continued late last night and this morning. Artillery provocations continued on the demarcation lines with the army of the so-called Kladusa autonomy, particularly in the region of (?Trst) in the Cazin Commune. The situation in the Velika Kladusa Commune is best illustrated by Fikret Abdic himself, who two days ago ordered new measures against all those who are not on his side. This is in effect an introduction to a fresh offensive on the free part of Bihac Commune."
