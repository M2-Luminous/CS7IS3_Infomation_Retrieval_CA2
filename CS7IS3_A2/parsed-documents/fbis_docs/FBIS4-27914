Such connections will have the impact of subleasing of so-called telephone circuits. Reductions in long-distance call rates and expansion of business opportunities can be expected on the one hand, while an adverse impact on NTT earnings can be expected on the other hand. The MOPT plans to use the hearings to determine the impact on NTT operations because of the proposed lifting of the existing ban and the necessary relief measures. According to MOPT officials, if the ban is lifted on connections of public and dedicated circuits, "Theoretically, long-distance call rates should drop by about 30 percent." Currently, long-distance call rates using NTT's public and long-distance circuits are 180 yen for three minutes, while the same call using NTT public circuits and long-distance circuits owned by one of the new telegraph and telephone companies would be 120-140 yen. These rate reductions are expected to encourage growth in new ventures such as mail order businesses.
