Discua Elvir arrived late in the afternoon at the Foreign Ministry's "Jose Cecilio del Valle" Building to attend an interview with representatives from the Organization of Northwest Atlantic Fisheries who have filed a complaint against Honduras for the incursion of Honduran-flagged ships in other states' waters. When he arrived at the Foreign Ministry, Gen. Discua Elvir answered the reporters' questions quite politely, but when they asked about the fisheries problem he said: "We have always had problems with unauthorized boats and complaints of illegal fishing." Nevertheless, when asked questions he did not like Gen. Discua Elvir became visibly annoyed, especially when they involved Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, his schoolmate from the sixth graduating class at the "General Francisco Morazan" Military School. Romero was recently recommended by President Carlos Roberto Reina for the post of commander of the Presidential Honor Guard; furthermore, the president himself hinted that Romero would be promoted to general in order to occupy the post. Gen. Discua downplayed the importance of the honor guard chief's appointment, arguing that "he is an officer like any other officer and that such changes are normal. Any Tom, Dick, or Harry could hold the post; it is totally unimportant," he stressed. "I repeat, I do not know what you intend to accomplish with questions like these," he said in an angry voice, thereby casting doubt on Col. Romero's promotion by the National Congress. "If it materializes it will be just another promotion," he said.
