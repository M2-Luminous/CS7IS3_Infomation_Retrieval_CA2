The problem is a U.S. trade policy that insists on establishing numerical targets (or results-oriented policy). Through the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, the United States strongly pressed Japan to increase its share of foreign-made (in actuality, American-made) semiconductors to 20 percent, and somehow that target was achieved. As a result, the United States has sought to apply this approach to all areas. Japan strongly opposed this, resulting in the "breakdown" of the summit talks. After Japan said "no," it was perplexed about how to proceed. Perhaps this was because it was not used to saying no. In any event, a kind of "scapegoat hunt" began. From the United States came the view that the bureaucrats were to blame, and in Japan there was a related trend. While this was going on, Japan-U.S. friction over cellular phones, which had been smoldering since last summer, suddenly flared up. The United States began brandishing the U.S. Omnibus Trade Law's Super 301 clause (the so-called telecommunications clause). And in the end, on 12 March, like Pavlov's dog, Japan swallowed U.S. demands, bringing a "resolution" to the problem. In this course of events, however, there are some important matters that are being half forgotten. First, Japanese bureaucrats are not the only ones who have been strongly opposed to a trade policy based on numerical targets. Last September, a group of Japanese and American economists, centered around an American, Professor Bagwati of Columbia University, issued to Japanese and U.S. leaders a letter strongly opposing a policy of managed trade. Then, this January, there was a declaration to the same effect from a subcommittee, to which I belong, of the Industrial Structure Council, the body that issues the "Unfair Trade Report." And subsequently, a similar declaration was issued by a group of Japanese economists, legal scholars and others. It was in this context that the "breakdown" of the summit talks occurred. To the extent that the United States insisted on a trade policy based on numerical targets, the "breakdown" was a natural outcome and unavoidable. For Japan to have pliantly compromised would clearly have been contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which is the same as the free trade philosophy of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Here it is necessary to thoroughly consider the meaning of the "resolution" to the cellular phone friction. This friction arose directly from the contention that the investment plan of IDO, a private Japanese company, was inadequate for popularizing the Motorola type of cellular phone in Japan. In the evolution of this friction, Japan and the United States had signed an agreement in 1989 whose main purpose was to allocate additional frequencies for the sake of the Motorola-type phone (different from the existing NTT type). The United States now claimed that this agreement had been violated. No matter how much you read this document, however, you'll find nothing written in it other than that the above-mentioned allocation of new frequencies must be based on: transparency, national treatment, equal market access (comparable market access), and non-discriminatory principles. Based on the words "equal market access," the United States contended that, if the same market share as held by the NTT type of phone was not immediately secured for the Motorola type, it would be a violation of the 1989 agreement--a contention that was clearly unreasonable. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (the ministry that bore the brunt of the friction), through consultation with the other related ministries, solidified its policy of immediately bringing a case before GATT should the United States enact sanctions against Japan through Super 301. Fully employing the mass media, it also sought to remove the U.S. misunderstanding. "Please read the agreement calmly," it requested, in what was in actuality almost a scream of grief. On 12 March, however, the two countries signed the document--the "resolution" of this friction. It states that the Japanese Government will take all possible measures to realize the quite unreasonable investment plan that IDO ultimately swallowed. Also, the Japanese Government acknowledged that this series of disputes was "related to" implementing the 1989 agreement. That the agreement could not lead to such a conclusion, however, was the foundation on which everything had been predicated. Thus, in the end, Japan not only swallowed U.S. demands for a trade policy based on numerical targets, but also made a strange promise again. Using this as "unshakable proof," the United States, at the resumption of the economic framework talks, may again try to force Japan to swallow a policy of "numerical targets." Should that happen, how will the new administration respond? It is high time to calmly consider how far the momentum of the irrational "special consideration given to the United States" can be allowed to go. I strongly hope that zJapan will again take a stance firmly based on GATT principles. "The world" is now demanding more than ever that Japan take such a resolute stance. With that in mind, the significance of the 1994 "Unfair Trade Report," which will soon be released, should be recognized anew.
