With this "magic weapon", as Mao proudly put it, the Communist Party conquered the Kuomintang and won the civil war. This time the Chinese used it on Chris Patten, yet whether it still functions as convincingly as it did 50 years ago looks less assured. The most remarkable feature of the latest round of the united-front battle is the winning over of 15 legislators -- a quarter of those who sit under the dome of Hong Kong's legislature. Beijing also claimed the trophy of one former Hong Kong government civil servant, although the names of the most precious -- John Chan, former secretary for education and manpower, and Yeung Kai-yin, former secretary for the treasury -- are still missing. It has been reported that they declined offers to become advisers. As the 1997 handover approaches, the strength of Beijing's united front seems to be growing impressively. Beijing has managed to build a pagoda of a powerbase, which is designed to make every inhabitant happy. While the professions of all these members -- ranging from pig farmer to retired Supreme Court judge -- remain comparable to those in Canterbury Tales, the political message is clear. The district affairs advisers form a grassroots base, a shadow of the Hong Kong government's district boards and regional councils. On top are the Hong Kong affairs advisers, who comprise an impressive number of politicians, businessmen and academics. One stair up from that is the more ambitious Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of 30 Hong Kong members rumoured to be the pool of rising stars from which the potential future chief executive of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) is to be chosen. Apart from these new residents, there are the supposedly more respectable veteran patriots: the Hong Kong deputies of China's National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Not only does this huge institutional structure provide the training ground for the post-1997 power struggle among locals, it also enables Hong Kong people to glimpse the cumbersome bureaucracy of politics in the SAR. The solicitor and NPC deputy Liu Yiu-chu is not the only one to be openly bitter about some former colonial servants, such as Sir S Y Chung, who has jumped the "patriotic" queue to become a Hong Kong affairs adviser. Asked what he could achieve as a Hong Kong affairs adviser, David Chu, an electrical engineer and businessman trained in the United States, complained that much "advice" he offered fell on deaf ears. Henry Fok, a top pro-China Hong Kong tycoon, said humbly that he was too "lazy" to participate in much work. Wu Kang-min described his own performance as "so-so". "The title of Hong Kong affairs adviser was little more than that of a British gong," he said. But a British honour is still not quite the same thing. The Queen is always less generous about giving too many away at one time, knowing that the value will slip if the market is flooded. Many PWC members and Hong Kong affairs advisers, such as Rita Fan and Lau Wong-fat, have never declared their intentions to return their CBEs or OBEs -- although they know it would help their political futures. Commentators might hail China's "tolerance" in appointing a small number of moderates -- notably the legislator Fung Kin-kee, leader of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, and Anthony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point. The objective is clearly to divide the democratic elements in the Legislative Council in order to, as Mao said, "unite the great majority and conquer the tiny minority" -- the "tiny minority" being Martin Lee's United Democrats. Such a divide-and-conquer ploy could indeed turn into a double-edged knife. Liu Yiu-chu has already caused enough division within the troops of the united front. People like Fung and Cheung, with their eyes fixed on the 1995 Legco election cannot afford to behave in too obsequious a manner towards Beijing. That might look offensive to the electorate. The result is they will blow the fresh air of democracy by speaking for Hong Kong's interests in the group. This, in turn, will have an effect upon the others, who might join the race to be seen as outspoken. The Xi Yang case is one example. Tam Yiu-chung's call for a cap on Chinese speculation in Hong Kong's property market is another. And there will be more. Even those who prefer to say what Beijing loves to hear are now giving their future master a dose of trouble. Some PWC members "advised" Beijing to ask civil servants to biao-tai -- declare one's position before 1997 -- but this was dismissed by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. Other proposals to add "objective standards" for returning Hong Kong emigres to re-establish their right of abode have been met with indifference from China. So the united front does not look that united after all. It has still to be seen who is the master at playing the divide-and-conquer game, a pastime that Beijing has always accused Britain of indulging in. At least for the time being, there is every reason to believe the British are enjoying some quiet satisfaction.
