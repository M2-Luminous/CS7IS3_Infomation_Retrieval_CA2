FBIS4-8255 "dreeu070__a94023" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Trade Union Organization Holds First Congress Trade Union Organization Holds First Congress Falbr on Klaus Recommendations AU0904154394 Prague CTK in English 1917 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0904154394 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Richard Falbr, one of the candidates for the chairmanship of the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), described as unacceptable the recommendations concerning the role of the unions, made by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the 1st CMKOS congress earlier today. According to Falbr, Klaus wants the unions to work in basic organizations, and the union associations not to be too active and not to play the role of political parties. Addressing the congress this morning, Klaus said that "the essential meaning of trade unions lies in the relationship of individual union members and their basic trade union organizations on the company level towards employers and towards the management of the company -- that is in the relationship on a micro level." Falbr noted that the situation in basic organizations had been worsening just due to measures pushed through by the government and Parliament. However, Falbr did not specify the measures. Falbr told CTK that the methods of work were exclusively the unions' own matter. He said that Klaus's speech was "smartly composed," but could not conceal the premier's ideas which are, according to Falbr, identical with Margaret Thatcher's negative view of union work.
