How do you evaluate his statements? [Bugar] Who is talking here about ethnic borders? Who wants to establish ethnic borders? Ethnic borders cannot be established in Slovakia, because southern Slovakia is ethnically mixed, inhabited by both Slovaks and Hungarians. What we want to prevent is a further artificial "dilution" of these areas, so that the districts of Dunajska Streda and Komarno are not "tagged" as purely Slovak districts. In this way, the higher territorial entities would be "diluted" in such a way that the Hungarian minority would everywhere constitute fewer than 20 percent of the population. [Toth] There is no doubt that within the Hungarian minority there exists a minority that would welcome ethnic borders. Is the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] prepared to eliminate this factor? [Bugar] If such people exist at all, they are only individuals. It is not a minority or a group, but only individuals who could imagine a different territorial and administrative division and, perhaps, also a completely different government and, maybe, also a different state. There will always be such individuals. What counts, however, is the political will of parliamentary parties. What count are the intentions of representatives of the Hungarian minority, be they politicians or representatives of Csemadok [Hungarian minority's cultural organization] or the Union of Hungarian Pedagogues in Slovakia. So far, I have not encountered anywhere the intention to secede from Slovakia or to create a purely Hungarian region. [Toth] Coexistence Chairman Miklos Duray has said on several occasions, between the lines [medzi recou], that his aim was territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority. He is an individual, but a leader of your coalition partner.... [Bugar] If Mr. Duray understands as "territorial autonomy" the rights that, according to the new territorial and administrative division, will fall due to the other regions, regardless of whether these regions are Slovak or mixed, everything is okay. These are self-administered areas with certain powers. But if he understands by this term territorial autonomy such as exists in South Tyrol, it is a waste of time to speak about it because we know that the political will for this is lacking, both on the Slovak side and on the part of various European institutions (such as, for example, the Council of Europe). The draft principles of the law on the position of ethnic minorities, as signed by both the MKDH and Coexistence deputies, speaks about transferring jurisdiction over education and culture to the regions. If someone speaks about something else, it is only his personal view, even if it is Mr. Duray himself.
