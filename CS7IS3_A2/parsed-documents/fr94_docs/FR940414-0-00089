FR940414-0-00089 FR940414-0-00032 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 93110&hyph;4043; I.D. 040894A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. NMFS is requiring that catches of Atka mackerel in these areas be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the Atka mackerel total allowable catch (TAC) in the Eastern Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea in the BSAI has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), April 9, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(2), the TAC for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 11,454 metric tons. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(9), that TAC for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง675.20(c)(3), and is prohibiting their retention effective from 12 noon A.l.t., April 9, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.
