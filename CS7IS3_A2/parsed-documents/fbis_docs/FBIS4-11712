He underscored the role Europe can play to ensure this protection. These remarks were made in the aftermath of the martyrdom of six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp the day before yesterday, Monday, at the hands of the terrorist undercover units affiliated with the Israeli Army. Brother President Abu-'Ammar also underlined the need to implement UN Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for international protection for the Palestinian people. He held the United States and Russia, cosponsors of the peace process, responsible for providing this protection. Brother leader President Abu-'Ammar described the assassination of the six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp as a new massacre. He added: In this regard, the first possibility that comes to mind is that Rabin might have been well aware of the plans to commit these massacres. He might have chosen to condone them. The second possibility is that these massacres were committed by Israeli Army units without Rabin's prior knowledge. One can derive no comfort from either possibility. This has grave repercussions on the entire peace process, he maintained.
