Romualdas Kozyrovicius said the main stumbling block in the development of economic relations is Russia's failure to ratify an agreement according to which the two countries would reciprocally grant the most favored nation trade status to each other. The agreement was signed in Vilnius last November. The ambassador said a major political problem is that Russia links the ratification with the signing of a package of agreements concerning the Kaliningrad region. Kozyrovicius emphasized that Lithuania still pays double export taxes to Russia which automatically leads to higher retail prices for Lithuanian goods. "This damages the interests of both states," the Lithuanian diplomat said. Commenting on Russia's plans to ratify the treaty after a package of "Kaliningrad agreements" is signed with Lithuania, Kozyrovicius said the fact "causes worry" because no such conditions were made when Lithuanian and Russian premiers signed the treaty in Vilnius. "How can we speak about other agreements with Russia when it changes the terms so rudely." The ambassador said a bilateral agreement on transit is under preparation, but Russia also wants to sign an agreement on military transit. In Kozyrovicius' view, there is no need to sign a military transit agreement because respective agreements would then have to be signed with Belarus, Latvia and even Poland. The ambassador said the best solution for Lithuania would be to adopt a law on transit and to sign an agreement on settlements and payments. But Russia insists on a bilateral military transit treaty, he said. In Kozyrovicius' words, Lithuania is concerned about the increasing concentration of military force in the Kaliningrad region. But the ambassador emphasized that the region rightfully belongs to Russia and Lithuania has no territorial claims. Kozyrovicius said "observing how servicemen move to Kaliningrad from the Baltics, Germany and Russia," Lithuania will continue efforts to demilitarize this Russian enclave.
