(d) The following procedure shall be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this section applying a 16-pound sample. A sample consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample weighs at least eight pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample shall be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements. (e) As used herein, ``U.S. No. 1'', ``mature'', and ``standard pack'', mean the same as defined in the United States Standards for Grades of Peaches (7 CFR 51.1210 through 51.1223); and ``No. 22D standard lug box'' and ``No. 12B standard fruit (peach) box'' mean the same as defined in section 1380.19 (18) of the ``Regulations of the California Department of Food and Agriculture''. ``Well matured'' means a condition distinctly more advanced than ``mature''.
