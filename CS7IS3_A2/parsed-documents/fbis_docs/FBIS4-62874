Sources in Baku refrain from commenting on the reasons of the visit's abolition. The observers say, Aliyev was obliged to postpone his visit because of the aggravation of the internal situation in Azerbaijan. It is due to the adoption by Azerbaijan of the Bishkek protocol and the possible signing of the Moscow agreement on the Karabakh conflict's settlement. In connection with this, the Azeri opposition forces will try to obtain the abolition of the "disgraceful for Azerbaijan" Bishkek protocol during the today's session of the Milli Majlis. Meanwhile, the speaker of Parliament Rasul Guliyev, signed the Bishkek protocol and roused the opposition's range, came out the other day in support of the Milli Majlis dissolution. He said rejecting the Russian peaceful initiative the Parliament is going against the national interests of the Azerbaijani people.
