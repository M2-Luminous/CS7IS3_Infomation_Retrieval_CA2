The first recommendation concerns an amendment to the SNS statutes, which should make it absolutely clear that the SNS is a national party. This would actually represent a return to the SNS statutes in the form in which they existed before Ludovit Cernak's chairmanship. The proposal that only a Slovak be allowed to be party member aroused particular interest. SNS Chairman Jan Slota expressed this in the following terms: "....we have clearly laid down that only a member of the Slovak nation can be member of the SNS." [Olach] No one of a different nationality can join the party? [Slota] Probably not, assuming that the assembly approves the statutes in this form. The SNS is a national party and it is its national character that we must guard first and foremost. We are one of the purest national states, with 85 percent of the people living in Slovakia being Slovaks. [Olach] Will this not be damaging to the party's reputation? [Slota] This will be used as an argument by people who wage a struggle against everything national. When France passed a law enforcing French in a tough way, no one from the Council of Europe protested. [Olach] How do you intend to check the Slovak nationality of your members? [Slota] You are now taking me at my word. When someone says that he is a Slovak, we will believe him. We do not have the staff to investigate those things. [Olach] SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes, who lost to Jan Slota the contest for SNS chairmanship after the post had been vacated by Ludovit Cernak, is more tolerant regarding the requirement for party members to be of Slovak nationality. [Prokes] In no case will there be any nationalist tendencies. We want to uplift the Slovak nation, which does not mean that we are going to suppress anyone. [Olach] However, the fact that only a member of the Slovak nation can join the party limits the rights of other nationalities. [Prokes] This depends on the definition of terms. The proposal for changes to the party statutes refers to members of the Slovak nation and to Slovaks respectively. When a citizen of the Slovak Republic fills in a form in a Western country, it is common for him to write "Slovak" in the "nationality" [last word in English] column. [Olach] Hence, the SNS is not closing its doors to minorities, in your opinion? [Prokes] In my opinion, it is not. [Olach] It thus seems that the demand [that SNS membership be restricted to Slovaks] is aimed more at satisfying the membership base than as a declarative demand aimed at the general public and that no one will be expelled from the SNS because of his non-Slovak nationality. And, indeed, why should he, given the fact that -- according to pre-election polls -- the SNS must fear for its place in parliament (in the last poll it received 4 percent). All the more surprising was the second recommendation of the SNS Central Council to the forthcoming assembly, namely that the SNS enter the elections independently. It was expected that the SNS would form a coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which would automatically guarantee its place in parliament. According to Jan Slota, this decision was not rash but the result of many rounds of talks and many analyses. It should supposedly benefit both the SNS and the HZDS. There is talk about Vladimir Meciar's objections to you on the ground of your excessive nationalist radicalism. [Slota] I raised also this issue in my talks with Vladimir Meciar. He always replied that he did not have any reservations. I realize, however, that a coalition with our party is unacceptable to some HZDS supporters. We have figured out that both the HZDS and we will gain more if we enter the elections on our own. [Olach] Are you not afraid of failing to cross the 5-percent threshold needed to get into the parliament? [Slota] Not in the least. The Slovak spirit is not dead. Developments in southern Slovakia will help us. [Olach] Mr. Slota is alluding here to the prepared bills on [birth and marriage] registers and bilingual signs, which, according to the SNS, are the product of a secret pact with the ethnic Hungarian political parties. Slovaks living in ethnically mixed territories along with citizens of Hungarian nationality are to be the main "target" of the SNS campaign. [Slota] Those 800,000 Slovaks are totally endangered. The state-forming nation must fear on its own territory for its bare existence. The Magyarization continues uninhibited. [Olach] Jan Slota also mentions the argument, heard before, about "Hungarian money from Budapest," for which 60 to 70 percent of the property [in ethnically mixed areas] in the first wave of privatization was privatized. This can supposedly be proven in the pertinent companies. The SNS expects much from its educational policy. According to Jan Slota, the party's idea of tackling the problem of education in southern Slovakia is: "I swear by God, if we gain a fair percentage of the vote, we will resolve this problem in a fundamental way." [Olach] But a solution at the expense of already existing schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction would surely be of no benefit! [Slota] Believe me, we are going to resolve this as a priority and at any price. In every little village in which there is only one little Slovak pupil, this Slovak pupil must be taught in Slovak. [Olach] Well, the SNS is obviously playing the "Hungarian card." But so does the HZDS, which will not be to the benefit of peaceful inter-ethnic relations. It is scarcely imaginable that the two parties will not compete [for the same type of voter]. It seems, however, that something like a little faction of Jozef Prokes is taking shape within the SNS, which supports a coalition with the HZDS. During the vote on the proposal to enter the elections independently, this faction abstained. How does Jozef Prokes, as a member of Vladimir Meciar's shadow cabinet, see the situation? [Prokes] In my opinion, the sum total of votes would be greater if we formed a coalition with the HZDS. [Olach] Everything will be decided at the SNS assembly in Komarno on 4 June. It seems, however, that SNS deputies have already become used to cooperating with the HZDS and some of them, such as Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel, also to posts in the cabinet, even if today it is only a shadow one. They perceive the chance of winning seats in the government as more realistic when the SNS enters the election in tandem with the HZDS.
