Our correspondent in Germany, Jiri Halousek, filed this telephone dispatch. [Begin Halousek recording] [passage omitted] One of the first speakers to address the main gathering in the Franken Halle at the Nueremberg trade fair was Imrich Kruzliak, adviser to the Slovak president. Kruzliak conveyed to the Sudeten Germans' greetings from Slovakia and said that the Sudeten German issue must not be swept under the carpet for political reasons. Afterward, Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther emphasized that Sudeten Germans had to be included, in the spirit of friendship, in future German-Czech relations. At the same time, he gave them an assurance of support by the Bonn-based Federal Government. Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber also voiced support for the Sudeten German Landesmannschaft. He recalled that this year it was precisely 40 years since Bavaria took over the patronage of Sudeten Germans. Edmund Stoiber went on to say that in recent years there has been a comprehensive development of relations between Bavaria and Germany and the Czech Republic. In order to describe them as good, it is apparently still necessary that the Czech Government and parliament open a political dialogue with the elected representatives of the Sudeten German Landesmannschaft. The Bavarian minister-president went on to say that he discussed this issue with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in August last year. At that time he gained the impression that Vaclav Klaus was going to give serious consideration to his proposal. That is why he is supposedly waiting for a signal from the Czech side.
