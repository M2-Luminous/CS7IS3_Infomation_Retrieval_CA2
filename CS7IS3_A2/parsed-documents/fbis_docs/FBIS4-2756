Liu Minxue first briefed the Chinese and foreign reporters on China's trademark development. He said China has seen a sharp rise in the number of valid registered trademarks over the last decade. Registered trademarks topped 410,000 in China by the end of 1993. Among them were 59,466 foreign trademarks, representing a ten-fold increase over 1979. The sharp rise in the number of foreign trademarks in China demonstrates the full confidence that foreign businessmen have in China's protection of intellectual property rights. Answering a reporter's question on the specific regulations and the steps that China has adopted and taken to protect the right to exclusive use of trademarks, Liu Minxue gave the following reply: First, the revised "Trademark Law" and its "Implementation Rules" impose a heavy fine for those who violate the Trademark Law, with the maximum fine as high as 50 percent of the illegal business turnover. The National People's Congress Standing Committee has also adopted the "Supplementary Provisions on Punishing the Crime of the Production and Sale of Fake and Shoddy Goods" and increased from three years to seven years the prison term for those who commit the crime of producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities. Second, to protect the right of exclusive use of trademarks, administrative management organs for industry and commerce, in addition to handling trademark violation cases reported by trademark owners, not only conduct market inspection on a regular basis but also take the initiative in investigating trademark violation cases. Third, both industry and commerce law enforcement departments and justice departments may investigate trademark violation and counterfeit trademark cases. People who feel their rights have been violated may report to administrative management organs for industry and commerce and may file charges against violators at people's courts. Replying to a reporter's question on China's special stipulations on protecting the right of exclusive use of foreign trademarks, Liu Minxue said that as China is one of the member countries of the "Paris Convention on Protecting Industrial Property Rights," it resolutely fulfills obligations as stipulated in the "Paris Convention" and it has effectively implemented the principle of giving foreigners equal treatment as Chinese nationals in the area of trademark protection. China not only protects the registered trademarks of its nationals, it also gives equal treatment to foreigners who register trademarks in China; in short, China protects the right of exclusive use of trademarks according to law. But there is one thing that needs to be explained. According to China's "Trademark Law," foreigners or foreign enterprises should go through an agency designated by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to handle foreign affairs when they apply for trademark registration or when they handle other trademark-related matters in China. When queried by a reporter on the infringement of Microsoft's rights in Shenzhen, Bai Dahua said that relevant departments are now investigating this case and that Shenzhen's Industry and Commerce Management Bureau has meted out punishment regarding the trademark infringement issue. This case does not fall within the scope of the readjustment of the "Trademark Law" as it also touches on other issues in addition to trademark infringement. Asked how the Chinese trademark organs handle the problem of "scrambling for trademark registration," Bai Dahua said as China's "Trademark Mark Law" sets the "first come, first serve" principle, China, therefore, excepting famous trademarks, does not give special protection to trademarks of a general nature. According to the "Paris Convention," special protection is given to famous trademarks that are approved by a trademark registration country or by a competent organ.
