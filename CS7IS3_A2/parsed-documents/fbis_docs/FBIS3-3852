Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told Hong Kong and Macau delegates that he could not understand why construction costs had been so high, even after taking into account high prices for labour and reclamation in Hong Kong. "The construction of the airport is to cost U.S.$20 billion (HK$154.38 billion), a price so expensive it has never been heard of," said Mr Li, a member of the ruling Politburo. "How much of it will be taken away? And who will take this money away?" Mr Li asked the people of Hong Kong to shift their focus towards the development of the economy, instead of worrying about the lack of smooth transition on the political structure. [passage omitted]
