President Kim reaffirmed that a special envoy exchange by South and North Korea and Pyongyang's cooperation in the IAEA nuclear inspections are preconditions for a third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. Kim also stressed that Seoul and Washington should make joint efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem. The third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks cannot be held unless the two Koreas exchange special envoys, an official at Chongwadae [presidential office] quoted Gallucci as saying.
