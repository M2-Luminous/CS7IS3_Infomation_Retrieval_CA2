In fact, (Rosseau) is of the belief that the government's plan to accede to NAFTA can only be seen as destructive to the island's manufacturing sector. Denise Moore has the details: [Begin recording] [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau) says the perception that NAFTA is synonymous with free trade is a mistaken one. He refers to one asymetrical clause, designed to protect American industries which are larger than the entire economies of some Caribbean countries. [(Rosseau)] If we are to join NAFTA now, we are not going to be joining NAFTA under the rules and regulations that those three countries joined NAFTA. And I'm saying that if...[pauses] I'll have to put myself out on a limb here: Assuming that our government is sensitive to the manufacturing industry and assuming that the 40,000 jobs and the $400-odd-million in revenue in exports is important and assuming that we have a place in the future diversity of this economy, then I don't understand why it is we are forcing and we are rushing into NAFTA in a destructive mode. [Moore] The former TTMA president says NAFTA embodies the concepts of protectionism and selective intervention. These are practices, he says, which it seems this government is reluctant to put into place. The manufacturer echoes the concerns of former head of the Institute of International Relations at St. Augustin, Professor (Anthony Brian), when he questions local ability to effectively bargain in the nation's interest. [(Rosseau)] You look at the Venezuela agreement: five years, nonreciprocal trade. But I see some items on that list there, airplane wings, propellors for boats, things that we don't ever dream to get into. Those are the items that have preference for duty-free trade. I look at the list for the Colombian agreement that has just been signed. Again, none of the strength that we have in our exporting products are on that list for duty-free trade. Some are on a phased period, and some are to be negotiated in time. [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau)'s fears appear to be vindicated by Prof. (John Butrick), of York University. Reflecting on the experience of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, Prof. (Butrick) says NAFTA has already gutted the entire manufacturing sector in Ontario. [(Butrick)] It was clear from the beginning why this would happen. Ontario was selling across all of Canada. If you live in BC [British Columbia], and they suddenly say: We're going free trade. Will you continue to buy from Ontario? Or would you go somewhere where it's cheaper? [Moore] Prof. (Butrick) says that the movement toward a competitive world economy will eventually erode national sovereignty. In his brave, new world, sovereignty will be replaced by market forces and nations will become powerless to control their own economies. And senior lecturer in the faculty of social sciences, Patrick Watson, feels this country and Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] should not limit their vision geographically. He feels Europe may offer more possibilities because of its historic ties to the region. All the speakers agree, though, that there is no hurry to join NAFTA, particularly since Latin America offers so many opportunities. [end recording]
