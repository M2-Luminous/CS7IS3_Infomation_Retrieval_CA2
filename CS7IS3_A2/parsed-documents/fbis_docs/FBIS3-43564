While IFP "leaders now seem intent on destroying their only hope of access to the real political game," IFP leader Buthelezi "knows all about the reins of power." But Buthelezi "carries some heavy baggage: in the Freedom Alliance, the infantile idea of a boerestaat [Boer homeland] and harliners within his central committee." "And for months pragmatic IFP leaders have indicated their disapproval of hardliners calling the shots." "In this context the IFP decision to stay out of the election makes some sense. Buthelezi needs time to throw out the baggage and then focus his energy and resources to secure power for the IFP in Natal. Perhaps Buthelezi is serious about staying out of the election. If that is true, he has lost touch with reality." SUNDAY TIMES ANC Violence Myths -- While "opinion polls indicate that violence is the single biggest concern among all South Africans," "the ANC [African National Congress] as the government-in-waiting, has shown such ambivalence towards the question of policing that it has contributed mightily to the growth of lawlessness," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 9 January on page 18 notes. Its response has been "a retreat to mythology. It still clings to the `third-force' theory of a government-orchestrated campaign of destabilisation against it." The editorial considers the ANC logic "faulty," as the police are "largely impotent," stripped of their "dreadful array of powers," "keeping their heads down." The ANC's response has been to "establish its own self-defense units. It has neither the skill nor the discipline to keep them in check. Banditry has consumed places like the East Rand." "Caught between the impotence of the police and the incompetence of the ANC, the criminals and political warlords have flourished." The ANC must "make a decisive break with the past. It must accept the existing police force, defective as it may be, is the nucleus of the force that it will have to use after April 27" and "discipline among ANC members must be enforced." SUNDAY NATION ANC Election List `Mishmash' -- The ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region issued its list of nominees for the provincial legislature and the National Assembly last week, which included "people who are not ANC members or are known not to share the same values with those of the ANC or any of its allied organisations," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 9 January on page 8 notes. "We doubt whether this is a wise move from the ANC leadership. Our understanding of the ANC is that it is an organisation that grew into what it is today by upholding certain values. To uphold these values would then be a prerequisite for anyone wanting to join the ANC, let alone being one of its leaders." Now, it seems "that the ANC first sought to appoint leaders and then hoped that they would imbibe ANC values. This is a recipe for disaster." The "other disturbing feature" is that the ANC "made the list public without informing some of the nominees." "We hope that next week's ANC national list conference will take account of these issues and take the necessary corrective measures before all other things go wrong."
