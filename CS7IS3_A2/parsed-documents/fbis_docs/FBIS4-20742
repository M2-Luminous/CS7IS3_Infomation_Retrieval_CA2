The transportation and shipping network, the construction of connective roads in the country and the shortfalls and achievements in these areas is the topic of this installment of "A Look at the Achievements of the Islamic Revolution," which is an interview with the minister of roads and transport [Akbat Torkan]. Engineer Torkan began by discussing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Roads and Transport. He said: This ministry's responsibility is the shipping and transportation of goods and passengers, which is done by land, sea, and air. The building of infrastructure and investment in infrastructure affairs is really done to create transportation and shipping. We continue this interview below. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your assessment of the success of the officials of the Ministry of Roads and Transport in fulfilling these responsibilities? [Torkan] My assessment includes the performance of this ministry's former officials, such as Martyr Kalantari, Dr. Nezhadhoseynian, and Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya, whose performance was completely positive. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In the First Five-Year Plan, did the Ministry of Roads and Transport reach its goals? [Torkan] Transportation depends on the nation's economy. The more the gross domestic product increases, the more transportation increases. The more a nation develops its exports, the more its transportation increases. These things are connected together like a chain. In my view, the Ministry of Roads and Transport developed successfully during the First Five-Year Plan. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your detailed assessment of this success? [Torkan] The most important thing I must mention with regard to transportation is that its goals and strategies change under the influence of environmental conditions. When you talk about transportation and shipping in Iran in the year 1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989], we had need and demand for transportation. When we talk about transportation and shipping in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] when the Central Asian nations are liberated and have set out to enter international markets, wish to trade with the world and have gotten past their dead end, then there is new demand for transportation and shipping, and following that, based on estimated demand, planning goals are being set for transportation and shipping. With the independence of the Central Asian nations and their membership in the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization], this organization has 10 members instead of just its former three members, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, so that Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and five Central Asian nations have joined this organization. Because these nations have high potential in terms of transportation and shipping and wish to connect with international markets, and the world also wishes to trade with these nations, it appears that the path for travel and transportation and shipping to these countries will be the Islamic Republic of Iran. On the other hand, before the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] the idea of transportation and shipping on the Sea of Mazandaran had no meaning and was very limited. From this year on, however, the idea became quite meaningful and underwent development. Consequently, we are now building new ports on the Sea of Mazandaran. The idea of building new ports in Faridunkenar and Amirabad, of developing the ports of Anzali and Bandar-e Nowshahr and reviving Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz was a goal that was raised in the Ministry of Roads and Transport after these nations in Central Asia became independent, and this ministry has made plans for these ports. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Were these short goals? That is, were they limited to the First Five-Year Plan? [Torkan] These programs were added in the middle of the First Five-Year Plan. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then by this reckoning, the goals of the Ministry of Roads and Transport changed during the First Five-Year Plan. In view of these changes, were you able to make use of existing potentials in such a way as to reach the above goals? [Torkan] Of course, in general I must say that the answer is affirmative. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Could you please discuss what you did in detail? [Torkan] We have four border cities with Turkmenistan, the cities of Sarakhs, Lotfabad, Bajgiran, and Pol. After the Central Asian nations became independent these border points were opened. It likewise became necessary to develop the border at Astara, and consequently roads were built and improved to gain access to these borders. The roads between Mashhad-Sarakhs, Emamqoli-Quchan, and Emamqoli-Darrehgaz are examples of the projects that connect us to the Lotfabad border. They have now been completed and traffic is traveling on them. There is also the Bajgiran-Emamqoli road that is now under construction and is more than 50-percent complete. The construction of the Mashhad-Sarakhs railroad was really proposed after the independence of the Central Asian nations. It is now under construction and we hope this railroad will be complete by the end of the year 1374 [20 March 1976]. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have we had as much road development as this in the rest of the country? [Torkan] These roads that were mentioned are the ones that connect us to Central Asia. In other parts of the country, during the time of Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya a total of 20,000 km of roads was built over a period of eight years, and this figure is quite significant. Also during the tenure of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya, the Bafq-Bandar 'Abbas railroad was put into operation up to the Tazraj station, 190 km from Bandar 'Abbas. We are continuing to work along the route from Tazraj to Bandar 'Abbas, and we hope that this railroad will go into operation in the second half of the year 1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995]. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] We have connected the roads in Central Asia and the Caucasus to the roads in our country via the border points you mentioned. Along with that, have we also been able to develop the nation's other roads? [Torkan] In the process of continuing these same transit roads, one task is connecting Mashhad to the southern shores. Our main road now goes from Mashhad to Torbat-e Heydariyeh, from there to Birjand and then to Zahedan and Iranshahr and Chahbahar, and this road has very high quality in terms of transit. Another road that was completed this year, which we hope to put into operation during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, is a road called Dihuk-Ravar, with which it will no longer be necessary for you to go from Tabas to Na'in and Yazd. You will be able to go from Tabas to Dihuk, and from there to Ravar, and then to Kerman, and then finally to Bandar 'Abbas, and this road has been presented in ECO as one of our transit roads. It is necessary to explain that another valuable task that was accomplished in the time of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya is the part of the road from Yazd to Tabas. Of course, Yazd is now connected to Tabas, but this road goes through the middle of the desert. Another road that exists that has not yet been completed and is under construction is one of our very important desert roads called Jandaq-Mo'aleman, which really finally connects Semnan and Damghan to Na'in, on which you can cross Iran's central plain on an asphalt road. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Despite the development of the roads you mentioned, it still appears that we have a shortage of connective roads in the country. Have you estimated this shortage at all? [Torkan] These shortages will always exist because we need to develop roads everywhere in the country. However, under these conditions one must observe priorities. We need 355 billion tomans to complete the roads now under construction, meaning the roads that have been given to the contractors, while in the Second Five-Year Plan we have 155 billion tomans credit for road construction. We are now at a place where a decision must be made, for we must stretch 155 billion tomans through 355 billion tomans in construction work. We must either advance all the roads some, or delay some and finish some others, and we have chosen the latter. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In developing the nation's road construction, are we faced with a technological problem, in addition to the problem of allocating credits? [Torkan] Fortunately our contractors are quite capable in terms of construction capability. Our contracting capability far exceeds the development credits for road construction. If we do not think about our contractors, these people will be faced with unemployment and stagnation. We now have about 300 contractors in the country, of whom about 20 are major contractors. We must be able to find work outside the country for these 20 major contractors so that the other small contractors in the country will be able to find work and continue to survive. Two projects in Pakistan have now been turned over to Iranian contractors, and they are contractors for the Ministry of Roads and Transport (these two companies are named Stratus and General Mechanic). We have also encouraged several other contractors to go outside the country and seek work, and we are supporting them. Because our contractors participate in international bidding, they have problems that we must solve. We are therefore seeking to create a financial and credit fund with the participation of the Syndicate of Shipping and Transportation Companies, which will support Iranian companies outside the country, grant them loans wherever necessary, and issue them letters of credit. In reality, by supporting contractors, we will be able to bring them into the international market and use their significant engineering capacity to generate revenue for the country. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will we advance to the point where we will also be paying them subsidies? [Torkan] I do not think they will need subsidies, because they are capable in terms of engineering technology and they can compete on international markets at the lowest price. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] If the price is low, yes, but if their costs get so high that they cannot compete, then what will happen? [Torkan] In any case, Iranian contractors can complete a task at half the cost of foreign contractors. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then why can't our contractors win in international bidding? [Torkan] Because we have just begun doing this. Our contractors won the bidding in Pakistan, i.e., we did not believe that we were capable and we have just become aware of our capabilities. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the credits they have announced, we may be able to procure something less than half the credits needed from government resources. To achieve the objective in road building, can we use private sector or foreign resources? [Torkan] We certainly can. We have placed numerous advertisements in domestic and foreign media seeking financial and monetary resources we will be able to use to carry out large projects. We will have to use nongovernment resources to build the freeway from Tehran to the north. With the help of bank credits, we are now building the Qazvin-Zanjan freeway. This freeway must continue from Zanjan to Tabriz and then to the Bazargan border. Turkey also wants to build a freeway from Ankara to our border. This transportation superhighway will be a road for ECO and Central Asia. We are now building the Tehran-Saveh freeway with credits from the nation's banks and from commerce. This year we decided to extend that same freeway to Solfchegan and then from there to Arak. In Khuzestan Province we are also hoping to build roads from Ahvaz to Abadan and from Ahvaz to Andimeshk with war region reconstruction credits. Ultimately, we want this to become a national freeway connecting Tehran to Khorramshahr and Abadan. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] To some extent the nature of domestic participation is clear. What will be the nature of foreign participation in this matter? [Torkan] This can be done in two ways. One is they can make us a loan, which must be at a low price. We will repay the loan with tolls we will collect on the freeway. The other way is that they can do the work on the BOT [Balance of Trade] basis. That is, they themselves will build the road and then operate it for a period of time. After their period of operation ends, they will turn it over to us and leave. We are conducting negotiations now on both procedures. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you think the BOT form of investment will meet needs in Iran? [Torkan] Definitely. Imam Khomeyni Airport, the freeway from Tehran to the north and the Mazandaran coastal road are meeting our needs in this way. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have you proposed these procedures to foreigners? [Torkan] Yes, this has been proposed both to Iranians and foreigners. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] One of the important responsibilities assigned to the Ministry of Roads and Transport came after the expansion of ECO, when the ECO center of transportation and shipping was moved to Iran and Iran became recognized as one of the countries responsible for transportation and shipping for ECO. In view of this, what will the policies of the Ministry of Roads and Transport be? [Torkan] When one speaks of transportation and shipping, it is necessary to divide the subject into various categories, such as transportation and shipping by road, railroad, sea, and air. These must be considered separately. With regard to air transportation and shipping, we are seeking ECO control. As you know, there are routes in the air just as there are routes on land. If these routes have radar coverage, they are like the freeways we have on land. Therefore, the air freeways are air routes with radar coverage. We therefore paid attention to air routes after the triumph of the Islamic revolution, just as we bought aircraft for the Islamic Republic of Iran's airline companies HOMA [Iranian National Airlines] and ASMAN [National Airline Services Company]. Nongovernmental airlines such as Kish Air, Mahan Air, Caspian, and Safiran were established and began doing transportation and shipping work. These are airlines. We have also given attention to air bases. We have built many airports and many are also under construction, but what has not received attention is the matter of air routes. Of course, air routes do not come to mind very much. Most people do not think that roads must also be built in the sky. They think roads do not exist in the sky and that everyone goes wherever he wants to go. The respected Majles deputies and the nation's political and regional officials all want to build airports, but no one wants to build those roads. It is one of our weaknesses, and we are now investing to develop air routes. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What have you done with regard to maritime routes? [Torkan] The Ministry of Roads and Transport's main policy is to develop transportation and shipping on the Sea of Mazandaran. We are now building two ports, Mirabad and Fereydunkenar, which will expand our transportation and shipping capacity on the Sea of Mazandaran. Our problem is that our railroad is on the east side of the Sea of Mazandaran but our main port is on the west side of it. By order of the president of the republic, we are to build docks at Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz in order to connect the railroad to the Sea of Mazandaran. With the development of Bandar-e Torkman we will bring maritime transportation and shipping to our own railroad. Thus, in this way from ports such as Makhach Qel'eh, Astarakhan, Kerasnavask, and Bakuvaktav we will be able to put our railcars on ships, bring them to Bandar-e Torkman and put them on our own rails to go to Bandar 'Abbas. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Is the development of the southern maritime routes also on your agenda? [Torkan] Our ports in the south have good capacity. In Chabahar we have two large commercial ports. One is Martyr Kalantari and the other is Martyr Beheshti. At Jask there is a port, at Bandar 'Abbas are the Martyr Bahonar and Martyr Raja'i ports, we are building a port at Kangan, we are building the Bandar-e Emam port at Bushehr, and finally, the reconstruction of the port at Abadan has been completed and the reconstruction of the port at Khorramshahr is underway, but transportation and shipping and trade are already taking place there. Many small fishing ports have also been built in the southern part of the country. In Sistan va Baluchestan Province since the revolution several ports, including Baris, Ramin, Haftom-e Tir, and Tays have been built. By the end of the year [20 March] we will complete Pasa Bandar, and there is another port at Kalak, where a fishing dock must be built. Of course, since the revolution the ports at Hormoz Island, the multipurpose dock at Qeshm and several old ports at Abu Musa have been rebuilt. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have mentioned the railroads in our country. In the last few years the railroads have tried to separate themselves from the government budget in order to operate as a company, and there are problems in this area. First, tell us what the fate of the railroads will be. Can they manage themselves? Second, tell us your plans for developing the railroads, because the railroad does not currently meet all of the nation's needs. [Torkan] The railroads have already been separated from the government budget. The main task before us is to try in the second half of the year 1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995] to complete the Bafq-Bandar 'Abbas rail line, and then to complete the Mashhad-Sarakhs rail line by the end of the year 1374 [20 March 1996]. We have several bottlenecks in the Tehran area that we need to eliminate. One is Aprin, which is the largest freight unloading facility in south Tehran. Then there are the two rail lines, one that connects Aprin to Maleki, between Tehran and Karaj, and the one that connects Aprin to the Bahram station between Tehran and Varamin. These two lines really make it possible for us to do shipping and transportation between the west and east parts of the country without going through Tehran. Another project, now under way, is to make the Tehran-Qom line, which is a bottleneck in the southern part of the country, into a two-way line. Parts of that will be finished by the end of the year [20 March]. These are tasks that are being implemented. We also have projects in the Second Five-Year Plan. One is the Bafq-Mashhad railroad, and one is the Kerman-Zahedan railroad. The Bafq-Mashhad line will make it possible for us to go from Sarakhs to Mashhad, from Mashhad to Bafq and from Bafq to Bandar 'Abbas. The direct line from the eastern part of the country to Bandar 'Abbas, Kerman, and Zahedan is the bottleneck in the rail connection between Singapore and Paris. The India and Pakistan railroads go to Zahedan, and the European railroads come through Iran to Kerman. When we connect Kerman and Zahedan, this international network will be connected. Several other projects are also being discussed such as the Tehran-Mashhad and Tehran-Esfahan high-speed rail lines. We want to complete this project with nongovernmental investments. We are seeking an investor for these tasks, and we are negotiating with foreign companies in this regard. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Our railroads are quite old and worn-out. Unfortunately, they have become weaker in terms of safety. What is your view concerning this? [Torkan] I do not completely accept this. Our railroads are old, but they are good. They have also been rebuilt in the years since the triumph of the Islamic revolution. For example, the rails have been changed on our Tehran-Mashhad line from Tehran to the other side of Shahrud, which is the Bokran station, and it has new ties. This line is a new line. The line from Tehran to the south has been rebuilt and the rails have been welded together. The parts of the railroad and the rails are no longer separate. The rails have been welded together with new technology and the vibrations and shaking on the train have been reduced along the entire route. Our railroads are a great investment. Although the locomotives are worn out, fortunately, during Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya's tenure, 120 locomotives were purchased from Canada, of which 44 have come into the country so far. God willing, the rest will also come into the country, and the locomotive power in our railroads will be reinforced. Likewise, with the start-up of the rail passenger car production line at Pars Wagon, we are buying these cars and they are being produced for us at full capacity. The passenger cars you now see on our lines are the domestically produced products of Pars Wagon. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Unfortunately the operation of railroads in our country is done with very old technology. Today, such railroads are not used in the world. They have powerful radio communications lines and much more powerful controls. What is your view on this? [Torkan] No, we have these kinds of communications and controls. It is not as you say. We now have electronic controls on the Tehran-Tabriz line. We have remote controls on the Tehran-Yazd line. There are computer controls on the Bafq-Bandar 'Abbas line, and these are among the newest controls in the world. Of course, I agree with what you say about the Tehran-Mashhad line, which is an old line. We have now signed a contract with a foreign company, and with the transfer of the technology to the country, the equipment will be rebuilt from Tehran to Bekran under this contract. We ourselves will rebuild the line from Bekran to Mashhad with equipment we have already built ourselves. One line that is still old and for which we have no plans is the Tehran-Sari-Gorgan line. Of course, this line has old line controls and I also agree with what you say concerning this line. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] There been several railroad accidents recently. In studies that have been done it has become clear that we have had these accidents solely because of the lack of technology. There is also the fact that our rail intersections are on the same level, especially in the major cities such as Tehran. What is your view in this regard? [Torkan] There is a problem, and unfortunately it is reflected in the major media. When a train jumps a rail, we call that an accident. Formerly these incidents were not recorded and the problems were solved at the site itself. Now, however, we send the Accident Investigation Council to study the cause at the site. These things we call accidents and are shown in our monthly statistics are not solely collisions between two trains. We have required the railroads to report on these kinds of accidents with these same details so that we can resolve the defects. Of course, the railroad officials are worried and they do not want these reports to appear in the media. They are asking me not to report these problems on paper, and leave it to them to deal with them themselves, but I do not agree. I believe that these things must be fully reported and investigated by the Accident Investigation Council. One problem we have concerning accidents is that they take place in the cities. If you travel by train on the Tehran-Qa'emshahr-Sari line, you will see that the people have trespassed on the railroad's right-of-way all along the route. Most of the people have made the doors to their homes open facing the railroad, and even in these right-of-way areas and along the rails they have built many homes. These problems cause various accidents, especially involving children. We must therefore prevent accidents by not trespassing on the railroad's right-of-way. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Of course, as you said there are many problems like this in the north, but this problem has also spread now in Iran. As you know we had an accident with a police car and a train, and a train collided with an automobile in Rabat-e Karim. Eyewitnesses say that the traffic control equipment was not working or the control bar did not come down in time. Railroad officials claim that they do not have the budget. My view is that one of the real problems with railroad development is that we must increase railroad safety. [Torkan] We must create an atmosphere in society where they do not trespass on the railroad right-of-way, and whoever does must bear the responsibility for his own blood. We are now widening the railroad right-of-way from Tehran to Saveh. We are now also designing and building bridges and making the lines two-way. The entire route from Tehran to Aprin is being made two-way, and we are protecting the two directions with guard rails, although the people are breaking down these rails and going back and forth, and this struggle continues. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the light administration of the railroads, will this company be able to meet its costs? [Torkan] No, the railroad cannot manage itself at these rates. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are subsidies being paid now to the railroads? [Torkan] Unfortunately the railroad is now eating out of its own pocket. That is, it gets its spare parts from its own warehouses, because the government does not give it foreign exchange. Thus the railroads are using parts without buying parts. They are not restocking the items consumed in the warehouse. This is a great problem and we will have to revise the railroad transportation and shipping costs. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will this revision show up in next year's budget? [Torkan] Of course, this revision has been applied to the railroad company's budget. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the air rates for transportation and shipping? [Torkan] In Europe, air transportation costs $80 per seat per hour, and we now collect $8 per seat per hour. The unregulated lines such as Iran Aerator get $15 per seat per hour. So far, the government has paid subsidies to us so that this year we got 13 billion tomans in subsidies. This subsidy will be eliminated next year, and we will be forced to revise our rates. I think $30 per seat per hour is a suitable rate (the fare is $30 per person to fly from Tehran to Mashhad). [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do the private companies that now operate for $15 make a profit? Are subsidies paid to them? [Torkan] No, they do not make a profit and subsidies are not paid to them. They are now losing money and if we do not change their rates, they will not be able to continue operating next year. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of this, how have you been able to persuade them to provide their services? [Torkan] The Economic Council has decided that we will not increase rates before the end of this year [20 March 1994], and we are observing this decision. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will you also increase the number of aircraft? [Torkan] We will definitely increase the number of aircraft. However, we are still discussing whether to buy the aircraft, lease them, or buy them on a lease-purchase arrangement. We think that in view of the worldwide recession in transportation and shipping, it is not entirely wise for us to pay cash to buy aircraft. We should either lease the aircraft or buy them on a lease-purchase agreement. The aircraft manufacturers are seeking to sell the aircraft. We think they should provide us with low-cost loans to enable us to buy the aircraft from them. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] It is noted that the country needs more airlines and aircraft. We are still short on transportation and shipping during some seasons. Is the private sector volunteering to help in this area? [Torkan] We have given agreements in principle to about 20 private sector companies to enable them to operate air transportation and shipping lines. Of course, if they are unable to operate an airline within six months we will cancel their agreements in principle, but a number of them have begun operating.
