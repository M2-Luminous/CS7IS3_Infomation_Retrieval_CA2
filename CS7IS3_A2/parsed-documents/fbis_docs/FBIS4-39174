A productive conversation about common CIS and CSCE problems took place. The "hot" spots in particular were discussed. Wilhelm Hoeynck noted that in his view the current concept of peacemaking should be amended slightly. For example, he thinks that the concept should reflect the need for the parties in a conflict to agree to the introduction of UN forces and to the conditions for cooperation between observers and the peacekeeping forces; and the procedure for withdrawing troops from the conflict zone should be set out. I. Korotchenya and W. Hoeynck were in mutual understanding on the issue of strengthing links between the CSCE and CIS working bodies and joining efforts in peacemaking activities. The CSCE secretary general was also interested in the CIS situation, prospects, and integrationary policies. Detailed answers were given to these questions.
