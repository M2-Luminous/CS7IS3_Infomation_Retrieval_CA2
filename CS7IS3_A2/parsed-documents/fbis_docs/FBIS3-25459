Could this mean the premature return of the Belgian UN troops? "We have practically returned to square one," said the Cameroonian UN envoy to Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, who seemed rather disheartened on Tuesday [15 February] night when we interviewed him by telephone in Kigali. With MINUAR [UN Mission for the Assistance of Rwanda], he is in charge of ensuring that the peace agreement signed in Arusha in August 1993 is applied. However, the establishment of the transitional institutions provided for in the agreement has already suffered a 45-day delay. This Monday, the swearing-in ceremony had to be canceled once again. The former single party, the MNRD [National Revolutionary Movement for Development], "which subordinated its involvement to that of the Liberal Party [PL]" -- the opposition force now divided into those supporting and those against President Habyarimana, who cannot agree on which of them will have seats [in the institutions] -- "has not lifted its reservations." Consequently, neither the MNRD, nor the president, who supported this reservation, would have come because the PL was not there. Not to mention the fact that the MDR [Republican Democratic Movement] is getting bogged down in the legal procedures" associated with a dispute similar to that dogging the PL. According to Booh Booh, "one of the elements that is complicating matters is the draft version of an official declaration of the parties presented by the MNRD to suspend their conduct during the transition period." The text proposes an amnesty for all those crimes committed up to the signing of the peace agreement "and only to proceed with nominations to the administration, legal authorities, and army on the basis of a consensus. Some objections are already making the rounds, e.g., the draft declaration by the MNRD is not in line with the peace agreement, which provides for the replacement of those individuals who were corrupt, incompetent, or involved in massacres. If a consensus has to be reached each time, then there will no doubt be few changes made," Booh Booh explained. The parties have to state their position on the MNRD proposal on Wednesday. However, there was little hope in Kigali on Tuesday evening. And time marches on. "The resolution that created MINUAR and the resolution adopted on 6 January are quite clear," Booh Booh stressed. "If no progress is made in the application of the Arusha peace plan, then the United Nations will not continue its support. The operation is costing $700,000 per day. This is a serious warning. It is entirely up to the Rwandans whether or not they want to take it seriously."
