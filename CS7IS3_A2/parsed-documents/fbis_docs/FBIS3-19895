"Whoever turns our aliens' legislation -- which is more liberal in Germany than anywhere else -- against us, will get an uncompromising response," he said this evening on the ARD programme "Brennpunkt." Criminal proceedings and aliens' legislation involving deportation and expulsion will have to cover the same ground where possible. The "obstacles to deportation within aliens' legislation" -- which includes "the threat of the death penalty, inhumane treatment or torture" -- must be taken into account. "If there is evidence of this in individual cases, the person cannot be deported," the politician stressed. "Our generous asylum legislation is being turned against us as a host country in an unbearable fashion through violence. Our asylum law must be supplemented by aliens' legislation," he added. Refugees and asylum-seekers could also be deported "provided they have been convicted of a serious offense." Many such offenses have no doubt been committed in the past few days. [passage omitted]
