Answering journalists' question about a possible government reshuffle, Nicolae Vacaroiu said "the results of the activity of some ministers and secretaries of state in this process of transition" would be scrutinized. He opined that the scrutiny "will disclose the way how they fulfill their duties". "The government reshuffle will be to my mind a permanent target of the executive's activity", the Romanian premier added. Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu told on Monday the press accredited to the Victoria Palace the his executive team planned to implement in the first part of the year a set of measures in the financial, monetary, currency and economic fields aiming to recover macro-economic equilibrium. Among them, the Romanian premier mentioned the bankruptcy bill, the public finance bill and the stock exchange bill. The government has considered also drafting decisions aiming to strengthen the discipline of the economic agents. The prime minister said the set of bills was much larger as it targeted not only the economic field but also other fields just as important: science, education, culture, justice, defense. In the context, the premier said that inflation would make "a slight jump" in the first part of the current year. The rate of inflation would be 7-9 percent in the first 3-4 month and then, because of the measures which would have been implemented, the macro-economic stabilization would probably start and the inflation would slow down to 3-5 percent in the second part of the year.
