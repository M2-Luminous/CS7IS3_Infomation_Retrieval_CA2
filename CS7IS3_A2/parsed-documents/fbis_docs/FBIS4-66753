The investment cost of creating these complexes amounts to nearly 525 million pounds. The minister added that this [step] comes within the context of the Industry Ministry's interest in making efforts to increase small industry activity because it is a main foundation for achieving industrial development. Moreover, small industry activity will result in increased utilization of numerous raw minerals and agricultural materials through the creation of small projects to produce a large number of goods. Small industries will also help increase cooperation with medium and big industries, especially in the exchange of components and parts that each of these industries produces. The new complexes will also create nearly 60,000 new work opportunities. Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi further added that each small industry complex will consist of units, each of which can be used to set up a small project. These complexes will be supplied with all basic utilities, such as water, sewerage, electricity, and roads. Each small investor will be able to acquire one or more units, up to a maximum of five units, if he shows that his project requires such a number. Facilities will also be provided when these units are sold to small investors, including application of the installment-payment system and a grace period. Two small industry complexes have already been built, one in the town of 10 Ramadan over an area of 88,000 square meters. It consists of 296 units and it has cost nearly 20 million pounds. The second complex is in the town of Burj al-'Arab, Alexandria Governorate. It has been built over an area of 167,000 square meters; it consists of 410 industrial units; and it has cost nearly 30 million pounds. The minister went on to add that preparations are underway to build new small industry complexes. Engineer 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il, chairman of the Industrial and Mining Projects Executive Agency, has said that a number of projects are under construction in this regard, including a small industry complex in al-Sadat Town over an area of 160,000 square meters. It consists of 384 units and will cost nearly 28 million pounds. Another complex is under construction in the city of Aswan over an area of 54,000 square meters. It will consist of 430 units and will cost 19 million pounds. Engineer Isma'il also said that studies have been completed on plans to build a number of other small industry complexes and that steps are being taken to finance these complexes in preparation for building them. These plans include a small industry complex in al-Matariyah Town, al-Daqahliyah Governorate, over an area of 220,000 square meters. It will consist of 416 units and will cost nearly 40 million pounds. They also include a complex in the industrial town of the city of New Damietta over an area of 62,000 square meters. It will consist of 110 industrial units and will cost nearly 13 million pounds. The plans further include a complex to be built on an area of 127,000 square meters on the east bank of the Nile River at a distance of eight km from Bani Suwayf, consisting of 296 units and costing nearly 32 million pounds; a complex to be built over an area of 150,000 square meters at a distance of 12 km from the new al-Minya Bridge, consisting of 288 units, and costing nearly 34 million pounds; and a complex to be built on the east bank of the Nile River at a distance of 14 km from Asyut Governorate over an area of 143,000 square meters, consisting of 258 units and costing nearly 35 million pounds.
