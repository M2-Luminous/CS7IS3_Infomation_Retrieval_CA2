The method has been used to plant new forests on the dry and highly eroded loess area that stretches across north China. Top soil on the Loess Plateau, which covers several northern provinces, is composed of loose, fine yellow earth powder. Water drains quickly through it and almost no moisture remains in the top soil. Moisture in top soil drops to a low of 4.5 percent during the dry season, a period when trees are supposed to be growing. By using the new method, moisture in top soil has been raised to nine percent, adequate for trees to grow. Scientists have set up three experimental forestation bases in North China, at which a high-molecule compound liquid is sprayed on the surface of soil. The glue-like liquid forms a water-proof layer on the surface of ground, so that rainfall can be diverted and pooled for irrigation. The method provides adequate water for tree growth. Wang Binduan, a professor at the Beijing Forestry University, lead a group of scientists to carry out the experiment. Wang said that his method presents hope for reclaiming eroded dry lands in North China. They have improved the survival rate of young trees in the area to 84-98 percent, a steep rise over the conventional 20 percent. The method is cheap and easy to use, Wang said. Local people have planted over 10,000 ha of trees by using the new method. Most seriously eroded areas along the Yellow River in North China will also adopt the method. Wang said that his group is experimenting with more kinds of trees in various landscapes. He said that it will take a minimum of ten years to form a proper irrigation plan for various types of trees.
