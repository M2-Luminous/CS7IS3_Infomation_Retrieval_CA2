Ministry officials said that the representative office in Sweden changed its name from the Taipei trade, tourism and information office to the Taipei mission in Sweden, while the Taipei Cultural and Economic Institute in Italy was renamed the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. The officials said that the renaming of the two representative offices is a sign that Taiwan's political and economic relations with the two nations have become closer. They said that relations with European nations have been improving steadily, noting that Sweden began to issue visas in Taiwan last year, becoming the first European nation to do so. The renaming of the Italian office also showed that Italy has begun to attach greater importance to its ties with Taiwan, they said.
