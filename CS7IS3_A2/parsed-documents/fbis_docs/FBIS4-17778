This time it is defense sector workers who are picketing. [Correspondent Dmitriy Matyushkin] Once again there are tanks outside the White House, but this time they are only toy ones. As you can see, conversion is fully under way. However, without state support, defense enterprises have fallen into debt. Defense sector workers set up a picket today outside the White House. They were demanding that, taking account of inflation, the debt to defense sector enterprises for fulfilled state orders be settled, that the amount of nontaxable spending on pay be increased, and also that enterprises be compensated for losses relating to conversion. According to the statistics of the defense sector unions, on 1 April, the Ministry of Defense's arrears in paying for state orders was 154 billion rubles. Payment of wages is often delayed for three months. Lastly, the cash-flow problem of defense enterprises has virtually brought whole towns and works to a halt. Representatives of defense industry unions have accused the government primarily of not fulfilling the obligations of an agreement between sectors. In their view, the majority of specific proposals for stabilizing the sector have had no response.
