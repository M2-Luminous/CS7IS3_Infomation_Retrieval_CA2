Now, U.S. businesses see ironies and want to be heard. These companies, ranging from telephone system to airplanes and from paper to bulldozers, argue that MFN conveys no special trade privileges and revoking it will impact America's competitiveness abroad. The White House must decide by June 3 whether to extend MFN to China, a decision that Congress, if it desires, has a chance to overturn. Without MFN, goods from China will be subject to the prohibitive tariffs of the 1930s. "We believe the first to be hurt by a reduction in U.S.-China trade would be American companies and workers," said William Lane, government affairs manager in the Washington office of Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar, which sells heavy earth moving equipment to China, recently announced a joint venture with Shanghai Diesel Engine Co. More than 1,000 of its workers are involved in China-related businesses. As China is engaged in more infrastructure projects, Lane said, "these projects are the natural markets for Caterpillar's products. China would well be our most important market in the next five to 10 years." The Peoria, Illinois-based manufacturer is just one of the many U.S. businesses which have been opposing the stand of the administration and congress to link China's trade with its other behavior like human rights. In fact, China, with the fastest growing economy, is helping to keep U.S. production lines running. The Commerce Department, in a standard analysis, estimates that 160,000 to 180,000 U.S. jobs depend on U.S. trade with China. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) finds the real figure may be larger. In a report released today, NAM said that some 1.3 million Americans work for firms for which the China market is important. "It is fair to say that each of these jobs would be less secure if trade with China were further threatened or eliminated," said NAM, which has just completed a survey of China business among its 12,000 member companies. Another observation of U.S. companies, explained John Hayden, vice president of the Boeing company's Washington office, is that access to the Chinese market is essential to America's efforts to retain industrial leadership. Up to three billion dollars in China's plane orders for Boeing would be at risk if MFN is denied, Hayden said. "In the near term effect, this would give non-U.S. competitors a long term foothold in an important market." In a recent survey of 82 member firms by NAM, the effects of commerce with China on the U.S. and on American firms are expressed in varying tones and cover a number of aspects of U.S. businesses. It contains enthusiastic comments from the Procter and Gamble, producer of bar soaps, shampoos and skin care and which entered the Chinese market in 1988. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company says, "there will never be a start up as big as China." The Gillette Company, a razor blades producer, gets to the heart of the matter best. "Gillette is a global company, and its operations in China make it a stronger company," the company says in a statement. Motorola, a leading provider of wireless communications, semiconductors and advanced electronic systems, underscores the nature of a global company by identifying technology it has developed in China and now uses elsewhere. "A stronger competitor with access to the China market will have a major advantage over firms without comparable access," the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company says. U.S. companies, meanwhile, stress that MFN is really a misnomer since it allows a country's product to enter the U.S. at the same tariff rates as most other countries. With almost all of the more than 130 countries in the world enjoying MFN treatment in trading with the U.S., "MFN, in a fundamental sense, is the minimum requirement of meaningful economic exchanges between two countries," said Jerry Jasinowski, NAM's president. Speaking at a press conference here today, he stressed that unilateral imposition of restraints on trade to convey concerns about other policy has historically been ineffective in achieving changes.
