The survey, based on hearings at about 1,000 major firms in late April, found that about 40 percent, or 10 percent points less than in the previous poll in late January, still feel they are laden down with an excessive workforce. About 50 percent, also 10 percent points less, said they were implementing some kind of labor-cutting program. The results are in line with another finding in the survey that about 50 percent of those polled saw the business climate as bad, down about 10 percent points from the January poll. Employers remain cautious, however, with only 10 percent of firms intending to increase recruitment for the next fiscal year. Thirty percent of those surveyed are planning to skip or reduce the number of recruits, while another 30 percent plan to keep next spring's recruitment at this fiscal year's levels.
