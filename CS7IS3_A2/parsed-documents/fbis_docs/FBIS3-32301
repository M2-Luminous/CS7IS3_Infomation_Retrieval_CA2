Alejandro Noemi leaves his post as top leader of the most important Chilean enterprise exactly 10 days after the scandal affecting Codelco was made public. The first indications of his pending resignation appeared yesterday when the report on the investigation headed by Noemi himself stated that the Codelco executive manager was mainly responsible for the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila. This morning, however, nobody thought Noemi would tender his resignation today. This morning everything seemed normal at Codelco. Executive Vice President Maximo Pacheco was the only one to enter Codelco offices on Huerfanos Street. Outside the building some workers were mopping up the eggs thrown yesterday by a group of pensioners. The calm atmosphere did not last long. The announcement made at 1300 by Interior Minister Enrique Krauss unleashed a storm. [Begin Krauss recording] Today Alejandro Noemi Callejas tendered his resignation as Codelco executive manager. The president of the Republic has decided to accept his resignation even though he will place this information at the disposal of Codelco management, which will make the final decision on the subject. [end recording] From then on the media frenetically searched for the resigning manager and did not find Noemi until 1700 as he arrived home from Cerro Castillo. [Begin recording] [Noemi] I think I have done what I had to do following this disaster. We have completed the investigation and I think it is clear...[changes thought] you saw it and learned about its contents yesterday. Moreover, the necessary measures have been taken. The path to be followed has been defined in order to administer these losses. I do hope the losses will drop. I have done my duty to show my face, as you have seen during these past few days, and there is no point in me remaining at Codelco after this regretful episode. It is very hard to continue at the head of an enterprise... I can no longer show face. [Unidentified reporter] How do you feel having to resign for a mistake you did not make? [Noemi] Such is life. I am very sorry. I am very sad and do not feel as calm as I look. I am very sad, very sorry. It will be very sad to be remembered as manager of this enterprise because of this mistake. [end recording] Noemi added that despite the modernization carried out within Codelco these past four years there is still a lot to be done, and proof of this is the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila. Noemi said that in the future the enterprise must be more agile. He also was asked whether he will receive indemnization. [Begin recording] [Noemi] Yes, I am entitled to it, but I am not going to accept it, not because I feel guilty but rather because I am too hurt to even think about it or think that someone may misinterpret it. Yes, I am entitled to it; it is part of my pay. I believe I have done a good job at Codelco and hope this will be noticed with time. [Reporter] How do you feel about the fact that the other three Codelco managers did accept indemnization? [Noemi] I feel it was a major mistake, a major mistake, and hope they will return it. [end recording] Noemi's resignation should be ratified on 7 February by Codelco management, which also must accept the president of the Republic's proposal that current Finance Under Secretary Jorge Rodriguez head the most important Chilean enterprise for the next 37 days.
