FR941103-1-00010 FR941103-1-00003 The Proposed Special Conditions Accordingly, the FAA proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Hamilton Standard 247F Model propeller with electronic propeller and pitch control system. Considering that electronic propeller and pitch controls introduce potential failures that can result in unsafe conditions, the following special conditions are proposed: (a) Each propeller and pitch control system which relies on electrical and electronic means for normal operation must: (1) Be designed and constructed so that any failure or malfunction of aircraft-supplied power or data will not result in an unacceptable change in propeller pitch setting or prevent continued safe operation of the propeller. (2) Be designed and constructed so that no single failure or malfunction, or probable combination of failures of electrical or electronic components of the propeller control system, result in an unsafe condition. (3) Be tested to its environmental limits including transients (variations) caused by lightning and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) and demonstrate no adverse effects on the control system operation and performance or resultant damage. These tests shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) Lightning strikes, such as multiple-stroke and multiple-burst (ii) Pin-injected tests to appropriate wave forms and levels (iii) HIRF susceptibility tests (4) Be demonstrated by analysis/tests that associated software is designed and implemented to prevent errors that would result in an unacceptable change in propeller pitch or an unsafe condition. (5) Be designed and constructed so that a failure or malfunction of electrical or electronic components in the propeller control system will not prevent safe operation of any remaining propeller that is installed on the aircraft.
