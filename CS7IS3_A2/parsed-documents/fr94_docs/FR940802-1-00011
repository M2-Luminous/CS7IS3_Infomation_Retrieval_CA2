FR940802-1-00011 FR940802-1-00004 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50583I; FRL&hyph;4755&hyph;9] Substituted Triazine Isocyanurate; Revocation of a Significant New Use Rule AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to revoke a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for substituted triazine isocyanurate based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that, for purposes of section 5 of TSCA, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to the environment. DATES: Written comments must be received by EPA by September 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments must be sent in triplicate to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ATTN: OPPT Document Receipt Office (7407), 401 M St., SW., Rm. E&hyph;G99, Washington, DC 20460. Comments that are confidential must be clearly marked confidential business information (CBI). If CBI is claimed, three additional sanitized copies must also be submitted. Nonconfidential versions of comments on this proposed rule will be placed in the rulemaking record and will be available for public inspection. Comments should include the docket control number. The docket control number for the chemical substance in this SNUR is OPPTS&hyph;50583I. Unit III. of this preamble contains additional information on submitting comments containing CBI. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of August 9, 1990 (55 FR 32406), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for substituted triazine isocyanurate. Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is proposing to revoke this SNUR. I. Proposed Revocation EPA is proposing to revoke the significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for substituted triazine isocyanurate under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for the substance, including its PMN number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the revocation of the section 5(e) consent order for the substance, and the CFR citation removed in the regulatory text section of this proposed rule. Further background information for the substance is contained in the rulemaking record referenced in Unit IV. of this preamble. PMN Number P&hyph;86&hyph;66 Chemical name: (generic) Substituted triazine isocyanurate. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of revocation of section 5(e) consent order: December 13, 1993. Basis for revocation of section 5(e) consent order: The order was revoked based on test data submitted under the terms of the consent order. Based on the Agency's analysis of the submitted data, EPA has sufficient information to determine for purposes of TSCA section 5, that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the PMN substance will not present an unreasonable risk to the human health. Accordingly, EPA has determined that further regulation under section 5(e) is not warranted at this time. Toxicity testing results: An acute oral gavage study of rats with a 14&hyph;day observation and neurotoxicity functional observational battery demonstrated a no observed adverse effect level of 1,000 mg/kg and a low observed adverse effect level of 2,000 mg/kg for decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strength. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.9760. II. Objectives and Rationale for Proposed Revocation of the Rule During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this proposed revocation, EPA concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. EPA identified the tests considered necessary to make a reasoned evaluation of the risks posed by the substance to human health. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing which was conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the 5(e) consent order for the substance and determined that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and consequently revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The proposed revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is proposing a revocation of SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. III. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a public version of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. IV. Rulemaking Record The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS&hyph;50583 (P&hyph;86&hyph;66). This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing the rule and includes the test data that formed the basis for this proposal. V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of the rule. Any costs or burdens associated with the rule will also be eliminated when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).

Wayland, Acting Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 721 be amended as follows: PART 721_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 721 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 2604, 2607, and 2625(c). ยง721.9760 [Removed] 2. By removing ยง721.9760.
