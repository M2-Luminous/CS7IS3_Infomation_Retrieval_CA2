Skepticism and criticism for the directions and the methods of the reforms are slowly coming out. "Does President Kim's government has any solid `core-reform-power team' to carry out the reform?" seemed to be the most concerned and realistic questions over Kim and his government. In political language, the `core-reform-power' means President Kim's power-base. President Kim started his presidency with a strong command of leadership, but series of situations which occured recently has caused reason enough to raise questions. Representive You Song-hwan, who belongs to the Democratic faction [President Kim's faction of the Democratic Liberal Party], raised a question about past political involvement of Representive Kim Yun-hwan, who is from the Democratic Justice [DJ] faction of the same party and it triggered the burst of the factional feuds. And, it led the DJ faction to casts the "angry votes" during a bill passing process on the 25th [October]--recommanding the release of National Assembly members, Pak Chol-on and Kim Chong-in was the bill they were trying to pass. In addition, the cabinet is unable to break through the thick wall of the bureaucrats and is vacillating. The opposition party has started to irritate President Kim and his administration not to miss this opportunity. On 28 October, the first day of the National Assembly Hearing against the government on the political affairs, the members of the opposition party concentrated on attacking the ruling party's internal feud. Representive Yim Chae-chong, Democratic Party [DP], accused the Kim's Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] for taking an ambiguous position and ridiculed that the DLP is not a `core-reform-power' of Kim that can lead the reforms, but a political body which has interest only in pursuing its own faction's gains, thus it should be a reform target. Yim's criticism continued and he accued President Kim for keeping unstable coalition with the old establishment ever since the three parties merged. Yim asked "what happened to his [Kim] going into the tiger's den to catch a tiger?" Representive Chang Ki-uk, who also participiated in the attack, made a statement that the bold punishment should be carried out for the DLP, a political party born of the 12 December and the 17 May Coups, members who were connected with the anti-people and anti-democracy actions, and charged for corruptions. Why is the opposition party demanding the ruling party to reorganize the `coer-reform-power,' and making it a political issue? It is obvious that the DP wants to reveal the political limitation of the DLP by irritaing the weakness of President Kim's `three in one' party. But, it is difficult to treat the opposition's attacks merely as a politcal game play because these points are shared by the most of the public. Although the DLP's DJ faction and the Democratic faction do not and will not acknowledge the feud among factions and the hetrogeneity in public. But, the heterogenity and the factional feud of the DLP does exist and it's a real thing, and no one will deny the facts in private. After all, each faction's have their own root, different experiences of history, different evaluations and understandings of the past governments. And the difference of the two factions' appriciation and motive for creating the Kim Yong-sam government is wide apart. The DJ faction's reaction to Representive Yu's "past political involvement" issue clearly showed the fundamwntal difference of the two factions. During the National Assembly's audit and inspection of the government, Representive Yu made a suggestion, "how about the traing institute of government employees invite the persons like Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Choe Hyong-u, Pak Sok-mu, Yi Chol and Kim Yu-hwan as the guest lecturers, who can lecture them contemporary Korean histories from thier vivid experiences and give them the benefit of real history lessons, rather than inviting those scholars who have been educated abroad?" Yu's that suggestion created a big ripple. In other words, Yu is saying that Representive Choe Hyong-u can cover the lecture on the dictatorial military governments and the toture and Representive Kim Yun-hwan could speak on the Yusin government since he has been a member of the Yujonghoe. And the DJ faction's response to that was "how quickly they forget, it hasn't been that long ago they asked for our help to get Kim yong-sam elected. But now, they want to hurt us." The Dmocratic faction's reponse to that is "it's only an individual's private opinion, besides,it's certainly a discussible subjectd." A telephone interview on 26 [October] just before he left the country, Representive Yu responded with "I have mentioned lot more names than what the media printed and that caused the misunderstandings. In fact, in my opinion, the Yusin cannot be 100 percent bad and the regrets and repenting of the past could be a good lessons for the history." At a TV talk show on 23 October, Representive Choe spoke about the "qualification need to become DLP's executive chairman," which also caused a stir. Choe explained that "I was not prepared to give an answer when I was unexpectedly asked about it, so I gave a very basic answer that it must be a person who can be able to lead the reform." But for the DJ and NDR [New Democratic Reperblican] factions have taken it as the Democratic factions act to shake up the Ececutive Chairman Kim Chong-pil's position prior to the May DLP convention. Despite their long co-existance as a part of same political party, the DLP's factional power struggle has hurt the party and its unity and harmony. However, on 27 [October], President Kim invited the DLP key leaders and the members of the special committee for political affairs to Blue House for dinner and that seemed to bring a temporary peace, at least an appearance wise. But, the deep seeded feud will not go away easily--the Blue House is pushing to pass a bill, the Reform Law--the revised law related to political affairs--during the regular National Assembly seesion, but the DLP majority, the DJ faction, considers that as an action to destroy them. Another example for the discord is that recently Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil excluded the chairman of the Planning and Managing Committee, Paek Nam-chi of the Democratic faction, from the DLP high level members meeting. Nevertheless, there is a view agreed by the majority that President Kim will not purposely carry out an action to dismentle the DLP, or the DJ faction to leave the DLP to have its own party before the 15th General Election. The majority believes that President Kim, who knows the nature of the DJ faction better than anyone, will embrace those DJ faction members, who share his political reform direction, and lead the party effectively until the election in 1996. President Kim's more pressing problem is on the fact that his administration has not been able to break through the thick walls of the bureaucrats, who are the front line workers of the government administration. Although the cabinet, which consist of a few from the DJ faction, who were part of the Fifth and Sixth Republics and who knows Kim personally, and some of the Democratic faction members appears to have a united front, they have no clear picture nor understandings of the reform and its directions. So, the cabinet merely maintains the vertical relationship with the president. Thus, the prevailing atmosphere among the bureaucrats are "self protectionism and the peace-at-any price-ism," do best to escape from the corruption probes, and the attitute of "wait and see" towards the new government. In fact, they have a new term saying, "the bureaucrats are here and will be here but the government power can go anytime." The passive ruling party, do-nothing bureaucrats, the directionless cabinet, etc. show how weak the President Kim's power base is. Can President Kim over come these obscles and build a firm foundation for his leadership? There are pleanty of rumors addressing to that subject, such as, the cabinet reshuffle before the year's end and the party leadership changes at the May convention, etc. Also, Presidential pardon of former law maker, So Sok-chae, before the year's end and appoint him to a cabinet post, name the DJ faction's Kim Yun-hwan and Yi Han-tong to cabinet, and who will be replaced, etc. are a part of the rumors. However, these are merely a part of a transitional measure. A long range out look for building a firm foundation for his leadership is likely to be in the plan. In that respect, paying a special attention to the upcoming 1995 elections for the local government legislatures and governers is necessary. Recently, while working on a proposal for the unified, overall election law, the DLP's Special Committee for Political Affairs confirmed its proposition on the 1995 election schedule for the local government system (the elections for legislature members, heads of cities, counties, districts in February; city counsils and representives for the provinces aand governers in May,etc.) All four elections are pushed into 1995, and it also included applying the party nomination system for the basic legislature [kicho uihoe] candidates. If this unifed election law passes, in 1995, President Kim will have the nomination rights to all candidates--for mayors, county and district heads and provincial governers. What an opportunity for Kim Yong-sam to have his people at the every coners of the country! Series of recent appointments of the PK [Pusan/Kyongnam] persons to various government posts, government owned companies, banking industries, etc. are good indications for the direction of nomination process for the local government election candidates. It seems that the ruling party has conducted a survey on the current and propective mayors and provincial governers already. A rumor about Secrtary General of the Blue House, Pak Kwan-yong, is interested in running for the Pusan mayor's seat is another indication how much the weight the ruling party is putting onto the local election. The Blue House is pushing hard for the unified election law to pass before the year's end. The Blue House's reason for pushing it is that since the public demand for the political reforms is very high, government needs not to loose the oppotunity to fullfill the public desire. Also, it is necessary for government to have a time to prepare for a clean election for the local election, which takes place before the general election. If President Kim's priority is on the local election, where he can establish a concrete power base, rather than the the General Election in 1996, passing the unified election law in 1993 is must. In that respect, a remark by a Blue House high official is a meaningful one, he said "there are lots of rumors spreading about the cabinet reshuffle and other affairs to take a place before the year's end, but they are all speculations. The real issue that needs to be done within this year is paasing this Political Reform Law. It will be the beginning of every debate and will be a starting point of everything. The driving force of political power and the directions will appear after the bill.
