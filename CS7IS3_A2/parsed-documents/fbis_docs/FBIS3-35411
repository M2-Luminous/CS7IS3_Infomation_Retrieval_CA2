[Al-Sahhaf] Welcome to you. [Al-Sayyid] Minister, the Security Council says that Iraq has not yet implemented every Security Council resolution relating to the Gulf war. What is your comment on this? [Al-Sahhaf] If we discuss Iraq's implementation of the obligations imposed on it by Resolution 687 accurately, we will notice--even those hostile to Iraq and the Arabs cannot deny this--that Iraq has met most of the obligations imposed on it by this resolution. The other issues do not require practical implementation, but compliance. And Iraq has announced that it complies with them. So talk of Iraq not complying with the Security Council resolutions is inaccurate and has political objectives. The clear answer is that Iraq has honored what is contained in this resolution. Section C of this particular resolution deals with the need for Iraq to get rid of the mass destruction weapons. In this regard, Iraq possesses no such weapons and has no capability to manufacture them. So why keep repeating that Iraq is not complying? The logical answer, no matter what side you are on, is that there are political reasons for maintaining the blockade of Iraq and keeping up the hostile campaign against Iraq. This is primarily because this crisis and this war have goals that are greater than, goals that have nothing to do with what is being alleged, that is, that it is about Kuwait. The foreign parties within the Security Council, chiefly the United States, have political objectives that have nothing to do with the crisis. Now that Iraq has implemented the obligations imposed on it by this resolution, they have started to implement the objectives of their policies in the region. It is no longer an issue of the resolutions in connection with this crisis. We have complied with and honored Iraq's obligations and continue to cooperate in terms of the details relating to all the clauses that require measures under Section C. By accepting Resolution 715, there is nothing left, but the technical details of the long-term monitoring. [Al-Sayyid] Minister, there is a Security Council resolution that calls on Iraq to export limited amounts of its oil to meet its basic needs, such as buying food and medicine. But Iraq refuses to implement this resolution. What is Iraq's justification for refusing to implement this resolution? [Al-Sahhaf] You mean Resolution 706, don't you? [Al-Sayyid] Yes. [Al-Sahhaf] The background of Resolution 706 is that Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan, a special representative of the UN secretary general, has come to Iraq as part of the job of the UN General Secretariat and the UN secretary general to examine the so-called humanitarian situation in Iraq and Kuwait. The team working under Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan carried out studies relating to the serious humanitarian situation resulting from the war that destroyed much of the civilian facilities in the cities and even villages, such as projects for drinking water, sewage, fuel, hospitals, etc. Those people submitted reports giving a realistic picture of the humanitarian situation that became a threat to the lives of millions. In this report--this study--they urged prompt action to enable Iraq to provide the necessary services such as health, water, and sewage. They specified the utilities concerned, including potable water, sewage, and agriculture. The report was sent to New York but instead of responding to Sadruddin Agha Khan's appeal, the Americans and their allies turned the affair into a political game. They referred the whole issue to a resolution adopted in line with the UN Charter's Chapter 7 but still claimed that they were acting in line with humanitarian concerns. Chapter 7 deals with the measures the UN Security Council can adopt to maintain security and peace when a situation threatening world security and peace arises, including issues of nuclear armament and violent strife. They sought to govern humanitarian requests dealing with sewage and hygiene in line with Chapter 7. They said that Iraq could export oil worth $1.6 billion. But they said they wanted to station inspectors inside the Iraqi oil marketing authority. When an oil importer comes to buy, say a Netherlands buyer or the Netherlands Government, the inspectors would take part in the negotiations over the transaction. They could say: Sorry, we will not permit this transaction. Let's suppose the deal is carried through. The contract to sell the oil would go to New York and would be submitted to the sanctions committee, which might not permit the deal. Suppose the sanctions committee agreed, they would want to station inspectors at the loading terminals, for example the deep water al-Bakr Port. We export our oil via the Arab Gulf. They would want to station inspectors at the deep water al-Bakr Port. One inspector might say he won't allow the deal to go through and that he believes the Iraqis are cheating on the quality of the oil. He might ask that a tanker already loaded with oil be unloaded. Let's suppose the tanker leaves the port and the cargo is sold. As soon as the oil is sold, the proceeds will be taken from Iraq and placed in a closed account with the UN secretary general, who is empowered to release funds from it, not Iraq. Let us suppose Iraq accepts this too, it must then submit a list of its needs including potatoes, rice, and sugar to the sanctions committee. The committee would then say it does not approve of so much rice for the Iraqis and would want a smaller quantity. It would make the decisions, not us. Let us suppose they accepted the list of commodities, they would want to appoint overseers [preceding word in English] who would decide where Iraq would buy the rice, say from Thailand. They would want to inspect the rice and state whether they would approve its purchase or not. Let us suppose they approved it, they would put a Security Council stamp on it. Let us suppose they did so, they would then monitor the transporting ship. Suppose we want this shipment to arrive via al-'Aqabah, they would want to station inspectors in al-'Aqabah to see if it is the same rice. They would want to station inspectors on the border and in Baghdad. When the rice reached the outskirts of Baghdad, they would ask to see the warehouses where it was going to be stored. They would see them. They would then ask to be informed where we want to distribute it. We would for example tell them: Babil Governorate. They would go to supervise operations in Babil. Who would be selling it? Say, for example, 11,000 food commodity agents in a governorate of 1.5 million people. They would want to go and watch how those 11,000 agents sell the rice. This resolution was not adopted to ease the Iraqi people's hardships. It was a political resolution designed to provoke. They claim they have given Iraq a chance that Iraq has declined to use. It follows then that the Iraqi Government does not want to feed its people. If you examined the conditions they have set, you would not only reject them, but would lose faith in these people as human beings. The objective is a political one. We told them: Although you turned Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan's report upside down and transformed its humanitarian objective into a colonialist scheme, you must feel that this resolution cannot be implemented. This is because when you drafted it and had it issued by the Security Council, you had a political objective. Because of your erroneous information, you imagined that if you pressured the Iraqis in this manner, they would proclaim their surrender and invite you to colonize them as you wished. This erroneous interpretation of affairs led to the adoption of an ugly resolution that cannot be implemented. We explained that in a clear, calm manner. After that, they sent us UN Assistant Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is from Africa. He told us: We know that this resolution is not applicable in the first place. We asked technical experts and they said the resolution is not applicable. We are prepared to hold talks with you to reach a reasonable formula [words indistinct]. We held three rounds of negotiations in Vienna. We would have reached an agreement each time, but when the UN delegation returned to New York, the U.S. ambassador would find fault with it and say: Why did you do this? How could you agree with the Iraqis on this? No, we do not concur, we have this condition and that one. The talks would then stop, and the United Nations would come later to propose new talks. This we did, and the same story happened, and it happened a third time in Vienna. The talks then stopped. Recently, UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali renewed the idea. An Iraqi delegation went to New York and they discussed the issue. Still, the UN General Assembly delegation had no flexibility, not even half of the flexibility that existed in the Vienna talks. I sent a message to the UN general secretary telling him... [pauses] By then, that is, in the fourth round of talks, we had made major progress with the Special Commission and Ambassador Ekeus. We had agreed that only the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 remained after we accepted Resolution 715 on future monitoring. I said in my message to the UN secretary general that we believe we were very close to the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. This paragraph calls for lifting the embargo on Iraq's exports in general. The paragraph is permanent and better than a temporary one. You know that Resolution 706 is valid for six months and is renewable. So, we propose that we concentrate our efforts on reaching and implementing Paragraph 22, and consequently lifting the embargo on the export of Iraqi oil. I proposed, as an interim formula, that Iraq be allowed to export an amount of oil in accordance with a formula that guarantees the UN's ability to know the amount sold and the price. The UN will take its share for the reparations fund and the rest will go to Iraq to buy [food and medicines]. The agreement was (?public), and we even made this proposal: If some sides claim that we may use this little amount of money to buy things other than food and medicine, then we propose that we buy from the markets of Security Council members. If we buy from the markets of the 15 Security Council members, then nothing will remain hidden. They gave no answer. Now, we are concentrating on reaching Paragraph 22, which is better. [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, you said that part of the Iraqi oil revenues, when exported, will be deposited into the reparation fund. How does Iraq view the issue of compensations, especially of those harmed by the Gulf war? [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq is the biggest victim of the events and the American-Atlantic aggression. When we accepted Resolution 687, and before that the other resolutions, we accepted the principle of compensations in accordance with the rules of international law. This is our position: Compensation in accordance with international law. [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, does Iraq expect the blockade to be partially or completely lifted in the foreseeable future? [Al-Sahhaf] We are working toward complete implementation of Paragraph 22. Logic dictates this. The sound thing to do is to finish work along with the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22 without either party adding any political conditions to this paragraph. The text is very clear. There are requirements that should be met to implement this text. These requirements provide that in accordance with the mission assigned them, envoy Ekeus -- the executive chairman of the Security Council ad hoc committee -- and Hans Blix -- the IAEA director general -- submit a report to the Security Council notifying it that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments outlined in the (?new) section, namely Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. We are now very close to this goal. We will work with the ad hoc committee and the IAEA to work out the technical formulas to start implementing the control programs in accordance with Resolution 715. Consequently, the Security Council will be dutybound to implement Paragraph [word indistinct] [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, another issue that pertains to the ceasefire in the Gulf War is the demarcation of borders between the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait. We would like to know Iraq's justifications for refraining from demarcation of the borders with Kuwait despite the Security Council resolution passed on the issue and despite the fact that an Iraqi representative attended some meetings on the issue under the auspices of the United Nations. [Al-Sahhaf] We have not signed [on the demarcation of borders]. The paragraphs of Resolution 687 require compliance; that is, there is nothing we can do. They went and demarcated the borders in accordance with the Security Council resolutions. They laid down the bases for the demarcation and that is that. Land has been taken from a number of farmers according to the new border line. Iraqi territories and homes were taken from their owners. These people are (?vacating) the area [words indistinct]. There is a difference. When they ask me if I have something that I must get rid of, for instance, they said that we have chemical weapons. We said yes, here they are. They said that these weapons must be destroyed. Alright, they will be destroyed. Regarding the issue you have raised, there is no measure or function left for us to do. They want us to comply. When we agreed on Resolution 687, it meant that we complied. They should not have asked anything more. [Al-Sayyid] What is your view on this issue? [Al-Sahhaf] I have no other comment. We are now discussing the issue as a whole between Iraq and the Security Council. When there is a paragraph that requires a certain measure and agreement is reached on the measure, we do what is required. All paragraphs require compliance, and nothing else. All that they demand of us is compliance. Iraq has done nothing indicating it is not complying. On the contrary: There are very clear examples showing we are complying, such as the farmers and their lands, the people living in the border area and their homes, our problems, and territory. These Iraqis left their land and homes. [Al-Sayyid] There is also the issue of Kuwaiti POW's. Kuwait says that Iraq has been holding more than 600 people since the Iraqi forces entered Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq, through contacts by the Arab League, the United nations, and other world organizations, maintains that it does not hold Kuwaitis. What is your comment on this issue? [Al-Sahhaf] I have no comment. I myself said this at the Arab League and at the United Nations. I stated this fact. There are no Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq. There is absolutely not one Kuwaiti behind bars in Iraq. After the aggression against Iraq stopped, Iraq handed over the POW's it had, be they Kuwaitis, Americans, French, Saudis, or others. We handed them over through the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]. However, there are a number of Kuwaitis who live in iraq. They still live in Iraq. If you travel in Iraq you can see and perhaps meet Kuwaitis who still live in Iraq. There are some Kuwaitis in Iraq. Some of them are called Bidun [Kuwaitis without Kuwaiti nationality], and other Kuwaitis. They still live in Iraq. Some of them have shops or homes and others have relatives or clans in Iraq. [words indistinct] We asked them to register their names with the ICRC, because maybe some of them want to return to Kuwait. Indeed, many of them wish to return to Kuwait. The Kuwaitis said that Iraq has Kuwaiti POW's and detainees. They said that the first list includes 7,000 or 7,400. We said that [words indistinct] and that they are mistaken. After a while, they said no, we are wrong; what you have are 6,000 and something, and they presented a new list. We told them the same thing and repeated that we do not have them; we said that some names were included in the previous list you talked about. They said no; the real number is 5,000 and something. In this way, we have received seven lists through the Red Cross. The number boiled down to 622. Who are they? If you look at their personal files you will find someone named so and so, who is the son of so and so, and who was seen at a supermarket in Kuwait--say in al-Salmiyah area or some other place--and after that nothing is known about him. How could you be so inaccurate as to presume that this person is in Iraq? There is a specific method followed in such cases. There is an internationally recognized method according to which the Red Cross gives out application forms and procedures. So it is a question of missing persons. Didn't they call it Desert Storm? This storm took many people; Iraqis, Kuwaitis, and other human beings. So we are facing a question of missing persons, not prisoners deliberately captured by the Iraqi troops or Iraqi authorities and taken to jail and whom we refuse to release. This is a lie. This is a game usually played in times of crisis to keep the atmosphere tense and keep a standing accusation, so that someone can come to you and tell you: Brother, why are you doing this? This is a natural human reaction. Why keep them? They have families and they are miserable. Thus, an atmosphere of tension against Iraq will remain. This is the whole idea. Look at what they are doing now, for instance. Kuwaiti television signs off with prayers that say: May God return our prisoners to us. In their planes, they write: Do not forget our prisoners, and so on. When they go to a meeting they deliberately start a discussion on the subject so as to create certain feelings and to gain sympathy for political reasons. The fact of the matter is that we have to work to gather information on people who have gone missing and whose whereabouts we should ascertain. They talk and present personal files of 622 or a similar figure. We will present files on about 63,000 missing Iraqis. Sixty-three thousand Iraqis. We will present them through the Red Cross. You know that whenever crises and armed struggles take place, [pauses] ... Even up to today, the Americans are running around looking for the missing in action [previous three words in English] in Vietnam. Do they want by this game to keep.... [sentence incomplete as heard] This is governed by rules that are recognized internationally and are sponsored by the ICRC and we proceed according to these rules. We have received personal files of missing people. Enough lying to people and saying that there are prisoners held by Iraq. There are missing people and we all have to cooperate to learn their whereabouts. Those among the missing people who have files and are accounted for, as the Kuwaitis admit, are 600 or 622 persons. We will present 63,000 Iraqi files to the ICRC. From the first moment we have shown full readiness to cooperate in this regard--and not only with the ICRC--to track down these people, where they are, how, and what happened to them. In short, to search in every possible way. In addition, we have stated that we are ready to cooperate unconditionally with the Arab League. We have received two envoys: Rashid Idris and 'Abdallah Adam before him. We will receive a third envoy, Mayhub al-Mayhubi, Arab League Assistant Secretary General. You brothers in Qatar know that we have welcomed proposals from the Gulf. Do it any way you want. You may set up a committee from all the Gulf countries, except for the Kuwaiti Government. You may set up this committee and bring people from the Kuwaiti parliament, because they do not tell the truth. You may bring people from the Kuwaiti parliament. You will be most welcome to come, see, investigate, and search and we will open all doors for you. They proposed a popular committee, and we said a popular committee is fine and welcome. His Majesty King Hassan has raised the possibility, and we said welcome. Very briefly, usually after conflicts a search is mounted for missing persons, and we cooperate in this regard without any conditions. [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view current developments in the Middle East, particularly the political settlement in the Middle East, and the Declaration of Principles, the Gaza-Jericho agreement between the PLO and Israel, and the political settlement plan between Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and Israel? [Al-Sahhaf] The developments in the Arab region do not inspire optimism because of the actual strategic situation and the imbalance in the international situation which increased foreign domination of the region. The available opportunities for Arab countries to defend their rights and pan-Arab rights are very limited. Therefore, I believe that overall developments do not serve pan-Arab interests. We are not concerned with the other details you mentioned. [Al-Sayyid] Since we are discussing the settlement plan in the Middle East, do you see a role for Iraq in this plan, especially since news agencies recently referred to a plan to resettle a portion of the Palestinians in Arab countries, including Iraq? What is your response to this issue? [Al-Sahhaf] This is nonsense. You know the extent of Zionism's control of the media, news agencies, particularly in the Western world. This is part of the psychological warfare against the Arabs. It is nonsense intended to confuse readers, viewers, and listeners. We are absolutely not and will never be involved in this plan. We worked within the framework of the Arab League and within its sole terms of reference, namely, the Arab summit resolutions. We have nothing else to add. [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view the Gulf Cooperation Council after approximately 3 and 1/2 years since the Gulf events? What is your view of Gulf security? [Al-Sahhaf] In the summer of 1991, more than one statement was made by Iraq affirming that Iraq welcomes any Arab country that is prepared to continue joint Arab action and cooperation to serve the mutual interests and rightful issues for which we all work. This applies to all Arabs and certainly to Iraq's ties with its brothers in the Gulf. We have not changed and will not change regarding this issue. We welcome any relations based on common understanding of safeguarding and promoting our interests and any voluntary agreement by the fraternal Arab countries to serve their interests. Iraq's stance on this issue is very clear. We are happy that Iraq and Qatar have maintained a useful and practical level of fraternal relations. Casual crises do not affect these ties. Ties remain and crises vanish. In fact, this stance is not casual but firm and Iraq will continue to adopt it sincerely and with honest intentions and without discrimination. Brothers experience deep differences and encounter difficult times, but blood never turns into water. The genuine interests among us remain stronger than casual crises. [Al-Sayyid] Concerning the Arab Cooperation Council [ACC] which, in addition to Iraq, includes Jordan, Yemen, and the Arab Republic of Egypt, some coolness has affected the relations among these countries since the Gulf crisis. What about this group? Will these countries resume their cooperation? [Al-Sahhaf] It is difficult to speculate on this now. The actual situation is that the ACC is frozen. It appears to me to be suspended. What things will be like, it is really difficult to speculate on, at least for the near future. Originally it was a good step but the crisis halted it. We will see how things turn out. [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, let us move on now to the future relations between Iraq and its neighbors, particularly Turkey and Iran. Your Excellency, how do you view future relations with these countries? [Al-Sahhaf] We earnestly wish to do what we can to create a climate that will encourage our non-Arab neighbors--Iran and Turkey--to move toward a normalization of relations. This is especially important in the case of Iran following a bloody eight-year war. We are seeking to normalize ties and build a sound foundation that benefits from the lessons learned from the crisis and to create opportunities of stability and cooperation for the Iraqi and Iranian nations in a way that is to their mutual good. We have tried to do this in the past and we are still trying. We are always urging Iran to begin settling certain unresolved issues between us, foremost among them the POW issue and MIA issue and also the retrieval of the remains of such MIA's. We also wish to cooperate in connection with the issue of nonintervention, including crossing the border and infiltrations. We also would like both parties to fulfill certain commitments to each other. For example, the Iranians gave safe haven to a number of Iraqi aircraft. They must now return these planes, both the civilian and military ones. There are several other issues that are ready for settlement if the necessary steps are taken. These would be steps illustrating normal transactions between neighboring countries. During meetings in Karachi and New York, I agreed with Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati to adopt a policy that would lead to the results I have outlined above. This policy would involve an exchange of visits, holding meetings, and beginning a political dialogue. We made the first steps but later the atmosphere became a bit muddled. We hope to resume this effort soon. We might meet in Geneva to begin discussing the POW issue. [Al-Sayyid] Dear viewers, at the end of this interview we express our profound thanks to His Excellency Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Thank you, Minister. We hope your efforts will succeed, God willing. [Al-Sahhaf] You are most welcome.
