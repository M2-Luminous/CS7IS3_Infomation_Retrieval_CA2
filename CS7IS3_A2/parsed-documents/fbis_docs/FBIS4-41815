The Ukrainian side announced this news through the major state dailies. Beginning today, Ukraine's debts to Turkmenistan, which totalled $671.9 million last year, will not be paid by the government -- there are no funds for this in the budget. A part of the payment has been ceded to the Respublika consortium. This consortium was formed by eight companies. The chief founder is 31-year-old Ihor Bakay. The number and composition of the founders changes periodically, depending on the tasks performed by the concern. Earlier, Respublika dealt with the sale of canned food, fish, and beer, enjoying significant success. According to Ihor Bakay, Respublika would have never taken on energy resources if it had not made a bad go of it on the Turkmenistan market. The consortium has not succeeded in settling accounts for supplies to Turkmenistan in time. Since there were hundreds of thousands of dollars involved, Respublika was given an alternative -- to take upon itself the payment of the debt, adjusting its own liabilities to meet this. With Bakay's approval, events began to develop in a fantastic way. Here is Bakay's account of what happened: "Valeriy Ochakov, Turkmenistan's first deputy prime minister, immediately flew to Kiev to meet acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. True, the meeting did not introduce any significant changes in the deal. `The process was activated' only after Turkmenistan had cut off gas supplies. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy immediately flew to Ashgabat to meet with Niyazov. An agreement at the governmental level was signed after a couple of days. It was arranged so that the settling of accounts will be simple -- one-third of the debt ($224 million) will be paid in hard currency; the rest ($447.9 million) will be paid in commodities." Even prior to this agreement, however, trains with products sent by Respublika to pay off the debt were leaving for Turkmenistan on a daily basis. How could this be possible without permission from high-level authorities -- it is difficult to say. In general, this case is typical of the Ukrainian legal mess. Furthermore, Respublika's gas program was given tacit approval by the Cabinet of Ministers. Those trying to oppose their power have been deprived of their cushy jobs. After the settling of accounts began, it became clear that Ukraine is not only sending trinkets to Turkmenistan. To cover the debt, Ukraine has to dispatch 70,000 tonnes of rolled steel, 10,000 tonnes of foundry cast iron, 200,000 tonnes of processed cast iron, 150,000 tonnes of ferroalloys, 50,000 tonnes of scrap ferrous metals, 502,000 tonnes of aluminum, 140,000 tonnes of ammonia, 2,500 KRAZ trucks, 300 LAZ jeeps, 400,000 tonnes of grain, 80,000 tonnes of meat, and 100,000 tonnes of flour. In addition, $1.6-million worth of medicine and $20-million worth of special equipment for the Internal Ministry and other services. The complete list is 10 pages long. True, due to the efforts of officials from the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Finance, some items were removed from the list, including 500,000 tonnes of zinc, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, and expensive scrap nonferrous metals. According to experts, the cost of goods proposed for barter exceeds the sum of debt by several times. It was evaluated that, having only used the credits allotted by the Ukrainian Government for this operation, Respublika will be able to garner profits in the area of $7 million. Moreover, profiting from price differences is also possible. Thus, Respublika will buy gas for $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. According to estimates by leading Ukrainian economists -- between $65 and $101 [per 1,000 cubic meters]. The enterprises that pay three times as much for energy resources will increase prices on their goods, as well. As a result, imports of Turkmen gas by Ukraine can become unprofitable. It is already known how the Ukrainian side behaves under such circumstances. During the latest price incident [not further identified], Yukhim Zvyahilskyy sold out a part of Ukraine's strategic resources. It is not polite, as the saying goes, to look in someone else's pocket. We will add: providing your money is not transferred into that pocket. Taking into account the prospect for future price increases, we have asked Volodymyr Lanovyy, president of the Center of Market Reforms, to comment on the Ukrainian-Turkmen gas deal. He stated: "This is a high-quality swindle. Having signed the agreement with Turkmenistan, Respublika is able to buy hard currency at prices three times lower than usual. In such cases, the exchange rate in Ukraine stands at 13,100 karbovanetses per dollar, while the market exchange rate is around 50,000 karbovanetses. Turkmen gas going to the corporation is 30 percent cheaper -- this money will remain in the corporation's accounts with each payment cycle. Furthermore, enterprises will be given obligatory state orders for the production of commodities for Respublika. In turn, Respublika will sell these commodities for hard currency, but the enterprises will be paid in devaluated karbovanetses. In addition, they will not be paid the full price, but only the production cost. The seller will also be a two-time winner here." Volodymyr Lanovyy is supported in this opinion by Sumin, head of the Ukrainian Union of Lawyers: "With the help of such a structure, the national wealth of Ukraine and Turkmenistan feeds certain Mafia-like structures. Thus, a big difference between purchasing and selling prices is being transferred to foreign accounts. By the way, according to the Ukrainian-Turkmen agreement, the monetary side of the Ukrainian debt should be paid to an appropriate account in the Deutsche Bank." They say that the country which sells its national resources to pay off debts may be declared bankrupt by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The CIS has created an economic court, but, for the time being, this court is successfully idle. Therefore, there are no reasons for being ashamed. The deal will continue. The point is who will become the next exporter -- will this exporter be appointed privately and quietly in governmental cabinets, or at an auction with the largest profit for the country? Maybe, we would be able by this to avoid rumors over fantastic bonuses in gas imports? All the more so since competent sources report: Metals and bed pans are not the only commodities which Ukraine is ready to barter to acquire the desired energy resources. It is simply a pity that the blanket is too short and someone is going to catch a cold.
