He said in an interview with Interfax that Moldova would "be paying for its recent errors for a long time." "Many states' producers are happy to have a stable market for realization of their production. We voluntarily turned away from the Eastern market," the premier remarked. Sangeli emphasized that the current government was energetically working to restore the relations with the eastern neighbors and to enhance the relations with the Western states. "It is very important that the law on investment start working. We have it but we need political stability to make it work. This is essential," Sangeli emphasized. In his opinion, the coming parliamentary elections on February 27 will allow to lay a foundation for stability in the republic. "These are specific decisive elections. The problem is: now or never," Sangeli said. He believes that a political force must come to power which will form the government and resolve other issues: the constitution's adoption, the issue on Transdniestria and the country's territorial integrity. Sangeli is now on holidays due to the fact that he is running for the parliamentary elections from the Agrarian Democratic Party's ticket.
