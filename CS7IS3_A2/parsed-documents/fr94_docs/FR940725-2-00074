FR940725-2-00074 FR940725-2-00045 •Since construction, and although original objectives remain unmet, the scope of this hatchery system's obligations has been substantially expanded to meet: (1) Protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species. (2) Production obligations incurred under the auspices of the U.S./Canada negotiations. (3) The court approved Columbia River Salmon and Steelhead Management Framework Plan. •Regional human population growth has increased demands for consumptive use of salmon at a time when natural production habitat conditions such as instream flow, spawning gravels, streamside vegetation, etc. are at an all time low. •Public pressure on Federal agencies has increased to meet all of these demands while insuring minimal risk to the genetic integrity of naturally spawning populations. In the proposed PEIS, an array of alternatives with a range of artificial vs. natural production strategies will be evaluated pursuant to NEPA. As envisioned, this document will serve as a foundation for planning at the hatchery level and site-specific environmental analysis may be tiered off of this document. Any proposed Federal actions evolving from this evaluation may or may not be a departure from current fish hatchery operating programs. Dated: July 18, 1994.
