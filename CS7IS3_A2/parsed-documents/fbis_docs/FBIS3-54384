In its first day, the proceedings were held this morning in an open session addressed by Higher State Council Ali Kafi, after the conference was opened by Youcef Khatib, chairman of the National Dialogue Commission. This afternoon's proceedings are being held behind closed doors. We will now try to get in touch with our correspondents at the Palais des Nations with the latest developments: [Correspondent] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentlemen, God's peace and mercy be upon you. This afternoon's proceedings come in in two different forms, namely what goes on inside the hall behind closed doors and what goes on behind the scenes, including the unofficial reports which have been circulating about the identity of the next head of state. Things are also happening inside the hall for news conferences where three personalities have turned up so far, and they were the rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission, the leader of the Party of Algerian Renewal, and the leader of HAMAS (Islamic Society Movement). The journalists, who have been kept away from the conference hall, have tried to find out whether the report on the appointment of the next head of state is true. According to rumors, the incumbent will be [former foreign minister] Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The report has not been confirmed or denied by official quarters. However, what is certain is that the text of the draft proposal on the platform for national consensus has been amended on the issue of the head of state who will now be appointed by the Higher Security Council. [passage omitted] The rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission was very reluctant to reply to some questions particularly those relating to the reported appointment of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He only said that replying to such a question would be premature. This afternoon's session was also marked by the news that two other parties, the Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement], have also withdrawn from the conference. Our colleague Mohsin Slimani will clarify the reasons of these withdrawals in the following report: [Slimani] Indeed. The Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS movement, which took part in today's proceedings, have announced their withdrawal from the national conference for different reasons. Nourredine Boukrouh, the leader of the Party of Algerian Renewal, indicated at a news conference that the national conference has lost its credibility in that the participants have found themselves in a position of mere listeners. Boukrouh added that his withdrawal was also due to the fact that the crucial decisions were taken in advance behind the scenes, as he put it. He further said that the head of state was also appointed behind the scenes. Despite its opposition to the way the conference has been organized, the Party of Algerian Renewal said that it considers itself concerned by the real dialogue which he urged the new head of state to open with representatives of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front. In the same context, but for different reasons, HAMAS movement leader Mahfouz Nahnah announced the withdrawal of his party from the conference. However, Mahfouz Nahnah said that his movement is committed to a dialogue in which all the active sides will take part. As regards the political forces, the leader of the Islamic Society Movement held the political parties also responsible for the failure of the national conference, which everybody is talking about now. Likewise, Nahnah held the authorities responsible for that too. On the whole, Mahfouz Nahnah regarded the participation of HAMAS as positive since it enabled him to reiterate the principles of his party and it revealed to him the dimensions of the conference or what he described as some actions [as heard]. The national conference, Nahnah said, is devoid of any political aspect as a result of the decision of the major parties to boycott the conference. He added that he has refused to adopt such an attitude saying: We do not want to be the attendants of any political movement. [passage omitted] Here follows an excerpt from the statement made by Mahfouz Nahnah, leader of HAMAS movement: [Begin Nahnah recording] We hoped, from the beginning, that the dialogue would be national, as I said, and political and not based on groups and associations. The conference could well benefit from these groups and these associations, but we believe that these cannot be the core of the dialogue in the absence of the partners to the dialogue. We also believe that this operation is unlikely to achieve the minimum that would maintain the value of this dialogue. However, we strongly believe that this national conference -- supposedly national and supposedly political -- has now whetted the appetite of those who wanted to join a wider dialogue in the future so as to sow hope, spread compassion, reassure the masses yearning for security and stability, and put Algeria in its rightful place among the peoples and the nations. For the aforementioned reasons, we announce, on behalf of the HAMAS delegation and after taking part for a whole day, our withdrawal from the proceeedings of this conference, and not our withdrawal from an open, broad, comprehensive and in-depth dialogue. [end recording] [Slimani] In the same context, we will now listen to the statement made by Noureddine Boukrouh, leader of the Party of Algerian Renewal: [Begin Boukrouh recording] We are not concerned by the results of this conference, we will not get involved in the work of the committees which have been set up, and we are withdrawing from the conference this evening. We did not want to do it in a sensational way and surprise people. We decided against that and we gave our analysis not in a sensational way because we are people keen on analysis and we are coherent [italicized words in French]. We tried to do it in the best possible way. [end recording]
