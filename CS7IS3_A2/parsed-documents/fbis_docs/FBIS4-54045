KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the report, compiled by the panel of three economists and an industrialist who are serving on the Information and Telecommunications Subcommittee of a government council on deregulation, headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The report says the government "should abolish or review restrictions on participation in the telecommunications and broadcasting fields, because curbs placed by the bureaucracy that forecasts the supply and demand situation contravenes the principles of a market economy." "The government should eliminate a partition between international and domestic telecommunications operators," the report said. At present, international telecommunication operators like KDD and domestic telecommunication operators like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) are barred from moving into each other's turf. The report also says the government should "authorize participation by local telecommunications operators in long-range telecommunication fields by allowing the local concerns to link up their networks with each other." The report featuring these recommendations will be submitted for scrutiny and approval by Posts and Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and other related cabinet ministers at their meeting, slated for Saturday [28 May], government sources said. However, the report cautioned that unusually rapid deregulation in these fields might trigger confusion, urging the government to take precautionary steps to prevent a possible outbreak of chaos. All or some of these recommendations will be included in a package of economic measures to be announced by the government in June. The pacakge is designed to eliminate possible seeds of conflict between the Japanese economy and the international community, the sources said. The report also proposed changing a possible role of the bureaucracy from a regulator to a mediator who would "amend the imbalance between those with ample information and those without, while extending a helping hand to those who suffer disadvantages." Demanding greater emphasis on consumers' interests, the report also recommended creating a "more flexible fee system as well as a system under which the benefits of a lower cost stemming from a more efficacious management could be passed on to beneficiaries." It also proposed the elimination of a law regulating the operators of cable television, saying, "the CATV law that regulates operators' facilities and the contents of their businesses is unnecessary." The panelists are IBM Japan Ltd. Chairman Takeo Shiina, Hitotsubashi University Prof. emeritus Kenichi Imai, Rikkyo University Prof. Masayuki Funada, as well as a noted commentator on economic affairs, Naoki Tanaka.
