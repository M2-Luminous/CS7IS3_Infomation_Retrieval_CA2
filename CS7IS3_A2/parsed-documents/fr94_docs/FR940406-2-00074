FR940406-2-00074 FR940406-2-00046 Program Requirements The program described in this announcement reflects a significant shift by the DCP from the direct provision of personal health services to a responsibility for leadership and coordination of overall efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes. Both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program are conceptualized by the four categories of program activity described under INTRODUCTION in this announcement. The central objective of a Core Capacity Program is to assist the State to establish the basic public health framework for leading and coordinating the efforts of the health care system and other public and private resources to reduce the burden of diabetes. A Core Capacity Program must address all four categories of program activity. An established Core Capacity Program is the foundation on which an Enhanced Program is built. The central objective of an Enhanced Program is to move the State program vigorously into a position from which it can take the lead in ensuring that diabetes-specific, community preventive health services are an integral part of a reformed health system. An Enhanced Program must involve the addition of innovative approaches not employed in the Core Capacity Program to reduce the burden of diabetes. Simple expansion of Core Capacity Program activities does not constitute an Enhanced Program. A recipient of an award for an Enhanced Program may choose to focus its initial enhancement efforts on fewer than all four of the basic categories of program activity. However, at a minimum, the recipient must indicate that activities will be undertaken in the first budget year related to (1) defining the burden of diabetes and (2) coordinating the overall effort to reduce the diabetes burden. It is expected that each Enhanced Program will be fully operational, including all four categories, within four years of the State's initial Enhanced Program award. In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities described under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible for carrying out the activities described under B., below. A. Recipient Activities 1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes through the establishment and maintenance of a State-based surveillance system which focuses on diabetes as a public health problem. 2. Develop new approaches to reduce the burden of diabetes through the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system. 3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes by ensuring the widespread application of accepted standards, policies, and protocols developed for that purpose. These should include protocols designed to prevent or postpone the occurrence of the major complications of diabetes, as well as diabetes-related cardiovascular disease. In addition, they should include protocols to ensure that persons with diabetes improve their efforts to achieve levels of glycemic control consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). 4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the establishment of appropriate linkages with other governmental agencies; private health care providers; academic institutions; community-based organizations; voluntary agencies; health care reimbursement organizations; national organizations representing populations disproportionately burdened by diabetes, such as minorities and the elderly; and others. B. CDC Activities 1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes by providing technical assistance in the development of surveillance and other data systems to measure and characterize the burden of diabetes and its complications. 2. Develop new approaches for reducing the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and technical assistance in, the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system. 3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and by collaborating in the implementation of, accepted standards, policies, and protocols within the existing and evolving health care system. 4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health care system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines, and by facilitating communication among DCPs and with other governmental agencies, private health care providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, voluntary agencies, health care reimbursement organizations, and others, to assist them in ensuring optimal coordination among all components of the public health and health care systems to address the burden of diabetes. Evaluation Criteria (Total 100 Points for Core Capacity Program and 100 Points for Enhanced Program) Applications for Core Capacity Program support will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria: A. Background and Need for the Core Capacity Program The extent to which the need is demonstrated, including adequate documentation of the barriers to diabetes care and education and the degree of experience the applicant has in each of the four areas of program activity (Define, Develop, Implement, and Coordinate).
