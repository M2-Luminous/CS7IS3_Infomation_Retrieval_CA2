Despite the fact that I have not participated in the government commission that has been meeting with the various transportation sectors since 13 January, I accepted with pleasure because I was aware of their willingness to solve the strike today. The meeting with CNT representatives was held in the afternoon and lasted about an hour and one-half. I must say that the talks were very frank and constructive. They explained their view of the transportation sector's main problems; that is, problems involving fuel price hikes and mechanisms dealing with the effective tax exemptions to which cooperatives are entitled in accordance with the country's laws and problems with coupons that were agreed upon back in September and which in some cases have not been distributed. All this, I would say, was communicated by those who work in this important sector with a desire to survive. I also took the opportunity to tell them of the government's wish to consolidate this sector. The transportation sector is vital to Nicaragua's production, passenger and cargo transportation, and collective transportation. The government would like the sector to consolidate with other transportation federations and chambers and for the tax exemption mechanisms to be fine tuned. The government wants the sector to understand the fuel situation, that they must have greater trust in what the government does once the price freeze period expires and when pending coupons are brought up to date, and all other aspects that hinder the smooth operation of this sector. The government also wishes to discuss the in-depth problems involving the new organization throughout this sector and the preparation of a general transportation law, which must be drafted with all sectors involved in transportation. Then the executive branch, President Chamorro, can send this draft bill initiative to the National Assembly for discussion and approval. Following these frank talks, which lasted an hour and one-half, I asked them to end the strike, because we all know of the inherent danger of these situations when people take advantage of circumstances to complicate things even more. In fact, the transportation sector itself is interested in resuming work because they are harming their economic situation. They have entrusted me personally with overseeing and ensuring that the various government commissions working with the transportation sector work smoothly toward the goal we seek, which is that this sector become organized and an in-depth solution to their problems be found. At the end of the meeting they asked to talk with their affiliate members and return later tonight to tell the Nicaraguan people what has been done. I agreed with pleasure, and in light of radio reports that were being broadcast at the time that bore little resemblance to the talks we had held, I also decided to speak to the other transportation sectors, federations, and chambers to explain that we were meeting with a constructive spirit full of goodwill, which will allow the whole sector to work in greater harmony. I also found them to be very receptive toward the idea of working together. I think this is a great step. While in the meeting I received information that the CNT had accepted my request to end the strike. I think this is a very positive step in favor of the transportation sector. The attitude of the commission and other chambers and federations forecasts a very positive working meeting tomorrow or the day after at the latest. This definitely commits the government to working with greater interest in support of the definitive and long-term solutions requested by the CNT in their letter. By beginning February with this strike resolved without regrettable deaths or injuries, the country is taking a very important step on the path to reaffirming dialogue as the fundamental instrument for resolving differences among Nicaraguans and in favor of the reconciliation of Nicaraguans by achieving their unity in a concerted agreement. I am very happy, and now it is the commission members' turn to comment. [Gonzalez] We wish to inform the local and international public, the Nicaraguan people, and the members of our organization throughout the country who are following this news conference of the National Transportation Commission's [CNT] responsible decision to contribute to a solution. We also wish to emphasize this chance to restore confidence between the government and the drivers, a confidence that had clearly deteriorated in relation to the fulfillment of previous agreements. It was decided today, as the result of Minister Lacayo's pledge to the CNT and in response to our proposals, that the agenda items the CNT had been proposing will be revised, adjusted, and discussed at 1500 at the CNT office tomorrow and in a bilateral meeting to be held at 0900 on Thursday as agreed with Minister Lacayo. This decision to suspend the transport strike is our contribution to and a demonstration of our interest in the country's stability. We expect the government to reciprocate by meeting the cooperatives' long-standing expectations. Today we can see the possibility of the drivers' hopes being fulfilled and of our dreams coming true. We have stated our position regarding the government. We are for national stability, agreement, dialogue, and the discussion of problems. We are willing to use every necessary administrative procedure that lends itself to achieving an understanding. We also wish to reiterate firmly, however, that the drivers' contribution to the recovery of trust between themselves and the government will be conditional upon the fulfillment of the government's pledge through Minister Lacayo. As a result, we hereby announce that the general transportation strike has been suspended today and that all delegations in Managua can return to their places of origin, a return that must be guaranteed by the National Police. We also wish to make it clear that a fundamental aspect of these negotiations as part of the climate of understanding is the release of all detainees and no reprisals against the strikers. Minister Lacayo, today we have pledged our word in responsibility. This is a historic chance to aid Nicaragua and to set an example for all sectors. We urge the government to keep its word. Let's not betray this word. We believe this is a chance to create conditions for a greater openness and to increase trust. Thanks. [Reporter] Minister Lacayo, why was your participation necessary in this transportation sector conflict? Can't the other ministers make decisions? My next question is for Roberto Gonzalez of the CNT. What was the subject of your meeting this afternoon with Minister Lacayo? What arrangement did you make? And why this last-minute decision to end a strike that was going strong? [Gonzalez] This morning the CNT presented its position to Minister Lacayo. We found that Minister Lacayo is in favor of discussing this position and of seriously analyzing it to give us a positive answer. That is why the commission believes that this time we will not be left vulnerable. That is why we have informed our people on strike at the national level that the strike is over. [Unidentified speaker] I will expand on that so there is no misinterpretation of your question about what was discussed. We discussed what Minister Lacayo and Roberto have explained. Our position to end the strike came in response to the first sign of goodwill and interest, which in this case came from Minister Lacayo. In the face of this situation, we had an obligation to the people and our sector, which we represent, to find a negotiated solution based on Minister Lacayo's receptive position in favor of a commitment. [Lacayo] [passage omitted] We must admit that during the first years of this government, some transportation permits and operating licenses were granted in response to political pressures brought to bear by the end of the war. We gave taxi operation licenses to demobilized people from the Nicaraguan Resistance as well as to retired Army people, who thus found jobs immediately. We must end that practice so we can move to a higher phase to benefit the entire sector. I think that the ministers have acted in accordance with their responsibilities. [passage omitted] There has been a great deal of distrust in both the transportation sector and -- the ministers have told me this -- among the ministers. Please remember what happened in September. These meetings have taken place in the midst of a strike. This makes negotiations difficult. When this is the framework, the people don't perform as well as they could. I had an edge: I had not participated in the negotiations and I had not met the transportation people. I met them today. Perhaps this made it easier for us to realize that we are closer to an agreement than we had thought and that if the two sides have the will, we will be able to reach an agreement that favors this sector. [Reporter] What will happen to the transportation people still in prison now that the strike is being dismantled? What will happen to the cases that have been initiated against approximately 200 transportation people who were arrested during the strike? What will happen to them? Will the trial proceedings continue? [Lacayo] The people arrested as suspects by the police will be released. No one has been placed at the disposal of a court, so there is no problem in this regard. We think, as we have discussed with the commission, that in the future, if we work in a more harmonious way, we will not find ourselves in this kind of situation. In this regard it is important to state that everyone is interested in making the transportation sector function better. This will get us off to a good start tomorrow. [passage omitted] [Reporter] The strike began with a protest over increased fuel prices. Nicaragua has the highest gasoline prices in Central America. There was also a failure to fulfill the agreements signed in September 1993 and the issue of reorganizing the transportation sector. What did the government promise the transportation sector in response to their requests? [Lacayo] We explained that a reorganization is in the best interest of the government and the transportation sector as well. The reorganization must be established in a general transportation law previously agreed upon by all sectors involved in transportation. We would send the law to the National Assembly, which would reach a final consensus, polish the document, and approve it. Nevertheless, it must be clearly understood that this concerted effort to create a new general transportation law must be a joint effort, and it is very difficult for the government to hold bilateral meetings with one sector and then with another sector, because in the end we get caught up in suspicions on all sides that are only dispelled when all sectors come together at a meeting. I believe the commission members have decided to take a positive step. It is also a positive step on the part of the other federations and chambers, which said this afternoon that they have never closed their doors to anyone for this sort of meeting. All the sectors agree on one issue that could be the starting point for dealing with all these issues, including the fuel issue. As you said, fuel in Nicaragua is definitely the most expensive in Central America, but we must also clearly understand that our economy is the worst in Central America. This is the result of what we all know happened in our country over the past 10, 15, 20, or 100 years, to be more specific. While the other countries can pay their teachers, build medical centers, and construct better highways with taxes generated by their greater economic activity, we in Nicaragua have not had that luck. I hope that someday in the future the taxes we collect will allow us to lower fuel prices, but for the time being there is no other solution, and all Nicaraguans must understand that. We must make an effort to raise our economy's level of production and productivity. I think we will take an important step in that direction this year, and eventually more Nicaraguans will be able to pay their taxes. We will also collect more from the business sector and from the sale of products that contribute to the generation of taxes, such as beer, rum, and cigarettes. Thus we will be able to gradually lower the tax which simply must be imposed on fuel. All countries collect taxes this way. Even in Europe, where there are strong economies, gasoline is sold for up to 25 or 26 cordobas per gallon. The European countries are donors, in Nicaragua's case, and they have often pointed out that although gasoline is cheaper in other countries, it is still relatively cheap in Nicaragua when compared to prices in Europe. We must listen to the donors' points of view and seriously consider them, because they would like to see their aid channeled to more important matters and to the most dispossessed sectors of our society. Thus, in the agreements reached at dawn on Saturday, which the government is committed to maintain, we lowered the price of diesel as much as possible to prices that are quite competitive within Central America. Diesel is used for cargo and passenger transportation and for farm production in general. An effort has also been made to subsidize gasoline for taxis. Taxi drivers will receive coupons per gallon of gasoline for a maximum of six gallons daily, thereby receiving some support from the government. However, gasoline in general and especially super gasoline must be more expensive to discourage the use of taxis and foster the use of mass transportation so the latter will have a greater volume of work. [Reporter] I have questions for both sectors. The first is for the transportation sector. One thing that delayed the possibility of your ending the strike or reaching an agreement was a lack of trust. What makes you believe that you can now reach a satisfactory agreement? Also, have you considered proposing to the government other possible sources of income that would lower government taxes? I would also like the presidency minister to respond to this. In addition, President Chamorro, and specifically [former] Transportation Minister Jaime Icabalceta, said that members of the Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative must decide whether they will use the buses. If not, they should return them, because those buses must be paid for and operated. I would like to know if the government is still concerned about this. I would also like to know, Mr. Minister, what effect this strike will have on your forthcoming meeting with the multilateral financial organizations. [Lacayo] In response to the final part of your question, I would like to say that many things have been said by both sides over the past seven, eight, or nine days. Some news media have even reported things that were never said by either side. But all of that is behind us. What matters now is our current resolve to end the transportation sector problems. Concerning alternative sources of income taxes, I think one source identified not only by a broad segment of the trade sector but by the general public is contraband. We all know that there are people in Nicaragua who bring merchandise into the country in a fraudulent manner. They do not pay the taxes they should pay; they compete unfairly against formally established businesses; and they do not make the required payments to bring their products into the country. We also know there are establishments that ask clients whether or not they want receipts. All merchants who do not provide receipts also harm the transportation sector and the economy in general. The burden must be shared by all. I think it is important for everyone who has the legal obligation to pay taxes to do so we can gradually reduce taxes on certain products, which would be to our advantage. That is what I have to say about alternative sources. As for the international community, I must speak openly. To the extent that the international community sees the Nicaraguan people resolving problems, especially the way in which we have resolved a protest that did not become violent as it did in September and on other occasions, to the extent that we Nicaraguans can show the world that despite our country's infinite problems we are capable of reaching agreements and resolving our problems, to that extent, we will make a favorable impression on the international community. The broad consensus achieved at the National Assembly at the beginning of the year and the fact that the Assembly is functioning with almost all of its 92 deputies has definitely had a very positive impact on the international community. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Watson emphasized that point in spite of criticisms by certain Nicaraguan news media. I believe it makes an impression on the international community when they see that we are approaching the path to democracy. I have no doubt whatsoever that the way in which we resolved the strike and transportation stoppage today will also have a very positive impact, which is good for all Nicaraguans and, why not, for the transportation sector. [Unidentified labor leader] It must be clearly established that we demanded of the government that both sides agree to a truce. This truce, which has been requested and demanded by the transportation sector and various cooperatives for over three years, is precisely the result of the economic difficulties faced by the cooperative movement. Therefore, we believe it is to our advantage to discuss our problems, and we have found the government to be receptive. I believe the fact that the presidency minister has listened to our observations and thoughts about the agenda we presented and discussed this afternoon proves that an understanding may be possible. Therefore, the pledge made by the government through Engineer Lacayo is precisely the offer we discussed today with our entire national directorate. We decided to discuss the work agenda we presented, which includes such issues as fuel, taxes, matters pertaining to Decree 62-93, and matters pertaining to the reorganization of transportation and other important issues. We decided to discuss these points at multilateral meetings, but above all they must be discussed at a bilateral meeting, which in our opinion is also a viable mechanism through which an agreement can be reached.
