"For a long time we have been emphasizing combined operations. Or, more advanced cooperation between the various services could be envisaged," the general said during a meeting with journalists from the Aviation Press Club in Brussels. The Air Force "boss" cited the example of operation "Silver Back" organized in Rwanda to evacuate foreign nationals after the resumption of the civil war there. During such interventions, fighter planes could, according to him, "play an effective role in deterrence, support, fire support, or the protection of ground units." Reiterating that French Jaguar fighter-bombers based in Bangui (central Africa) carried out flights of "intimidation" over Rwanda during the evacuation of foreigners, General Vanhecke wondered about the possibility of deploying units of Belgian F-16's in such cases. The F-16 has a range of up to 3,500 km, even without in-flight refueling, a technique for which all pilots are qualified. The general emphasized that the Air Force has always been in a position to deploy a complete squadron at a maximum notice of 72 hours within the context of the Allied Mobile Force, as was the case when 18 Mirage's were rushed to southeastern Turkey, in early 1991, just before the outbreak of the Gulf War. "This time period could be reduced for a group of six airplanes," he added, noting that the decision to engage combat aircraft had to be made at the "political level," primarily because of the need to negotiate fly-over rights or parking rights in the case of armed humanitarian operations. The defense minister is convinced that these should be joint operations, the chief of staff added, referring to a recent meeting with Mr. Leo Delcroix. Mentioning the possible participation of the Air Force in NATO's "Deny Flight" operation, which enforces the ban on flight through Bosnian airspace and provides air support to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Blue Helmets, the chief of staff said "certain allied countries would probably be pleased to be able to share the burden of this mission with others." He also acknowledged that the Belgian F-16's were currently "handicapped" by the lack of certain equipment, such as electronic countermeasures. However, the French system "Carapace", which is passive in so far as it only detects the radar used in antiaircraft defense systems, is scheduled to arrive in the Belgian Air Force squadrons in early 1995. "If Belgium were called on to participate in operation `Deny Flight,' the Air Force would have to decide whether an active system was essential," the general continued, saying that these pod-mounted systems could be obtained on loan from allies which have them, as could certain precision, laser-guided munitions. According to the chief of staff, the F-16's are "excellent aircraft," flown by pilots who have an "operational level comparable" to that of the allied air forces present in the skies over Bosnia. "Our F-16's can be deployed for all NATO or UN missions for which they are or could be used," he concluded.
