As Virsis said, incidents of this kind are to the benefit of Russia to justify to the world and especially the United States its military interests in Latvia. In addition, Virsis expressed indignation at the performance of the Latvian security service, which did not provide government departments with the necessary information immediately after the incident. Power was reconnected to the damaged high-tension line after the completion of restoration work at 2104 yesterday.
