This fact is being persistently concealed from the people, although I do not think that the people will condemn their president because of this. This information is still unofficial, but if the facts about the signing of the agreement are confirmed, the government's initiative can be understood only if the agreement was signed with Russia's real masters." How did the Armenian authorities react to this report? Levon Zurabyan the president's press secretary described this information as "gibberish and a completely groundless fabrication."
