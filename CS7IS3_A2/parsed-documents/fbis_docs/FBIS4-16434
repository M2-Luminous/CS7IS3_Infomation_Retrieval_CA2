The fact that the bulk of the package of issues considered dealt with the situation in the Republic of Tajikistan and the Transcaucasus shows that the Russian Federation tries to apply all CIS instruments to somehow secure the powers of its troops at flashpoints and share responsibility with ex-Soviet republics". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI believes that "one can view as the main achievements of the summit the establishment of a permanently functioning agency -- a commission for economic union affairs -- at the CIS coordinating consultative committee and the signing of an agreement between Russia and all the CIS countries on a multi-sided free trade area". Referring to remarks by Vladimir Mashits, Russian minister for cooperation, the newspaper points out: "The implementation of this agreement may begin soon". PRAVDA on the CIS summit outcome: "There were no sensations. The only more or less mature undertaking -- the establishment of an economic union underwent development. The establishment of a free trade area will possibly become the first step towards reunification. "Thus, the vector of the movement has been chosen: to recreate the union, an economic one at first, and subsequently a Euro-Asian one." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an interview with Yuriy Meshkov, the first-ever president of the Republic of the Crimea. In response to a question about the Crimean president's view of the future of the Black Sea Fleet and its status, Meshkov said: "The fleet should be Russian, since Ukraine is not in a position to maintain it... I think the Black Sea Fleet has been and remains the guarantor of stability in the Crimea and an important element of the balance of forces in the south European region." TRUD on the birth centenary of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchov: "The transformation era of Khrushchov days created a culture medium which brought forth people who arrived at conclusions about the essence of administrative socialism, its historical prospectlessness and the need to wind up the experiment on its basis and launch a quest for new principles for the life of millions of people". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Khrushchov's birth centenary: "Thousands of innocent people who were subjected to repressions are grateful to Khrushchov for the regained freedom and rehabilitation. "And still, under Khrushchov, we began to be dependent on overseas bread. Prices began to move upwards, and haphazard reorganisations were launched. In such affairs, associates recede into the background, leaving the leader confronted with the social discontent." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an article the writer of which points out that, to his mind, there is still the need for a long, thorough and impartial analysis of everything that was done by Nikita Khrushchov, one of the most distinctive and complex politicians of the 20th century".
