The names of those individuals whose requests to present oral statements are received after the date specified above may not appear on the written agenda. To accommodate as many speakers as possible, the amount of time allocated to each speaker may be less than the amount of time requested. Background On September 20, 1994, the FAA published in the Federal Register a Notice of public meeting regarding the High Density Rule (59 FR 48165). Specifically, the DOT seeks comment on the following key issues: (1) The economic, environmental, competitive, and operational aspects of the High Density Rule at the four airports. (2) The projected air traffic environment. (3) The process for allocating domestic and international slots. (4) Access for small communities at High Density Rule airports. (5) Potential alternatives to the current regulatory scheme at the High Density Rule airports. These issues are intended to help focus public comments on areas that will be useful to the DOT in completing its review of the High Density Rule. The comments at the meetings need not be limited to these issues, and the DOT invites comments on any other aspect of the High Density Rule.
