FR940803-0-00130 FR940803-0-00040 AFE adj = AFE[((0.55 x a x c) + (0.45 x c) + (0.5556 x a) + 0.4487) / ((0.55 x a) + 0.45)] + IW Where: AFE adj = Adjusted average combined fuel economy, rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg. AFE = Average combined fuel economy as calculated in paragraph (c) of this section, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. a = Sales-weight average (rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) of all model type highway fuel economy values (rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg) divided by the sales-weighted average (rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) of all model type city fuel economy values (rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg). The quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. These average fuel economies shall be determined using the methodology of paragraph (c) of this section. c = 0.0022 for the 1986 model year. c = A constant value, fixed by model year. For 1987, the Administrator will specify the c value after the necessary laboratory humidity and test fuel data become available. For 1988 and later model years, the Administrator will specify the c value after the necessary laboratory humidity and test fuel data become available. IW = (9.2917 x 10 ^3 x SF 3IWC x FE 3IWC ) - (3.5123 x 10 ^3 x SF 4ETW x FE 4IWC ) Note: Any calculated value of IW less than zero shall be set equal to zero. SF 3IWC = The 3000 lb. inertia weight class sales divided by total sales. The quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. SF 4ETW = The 4000 lb. equivalent test weight category sales divided by total sales. The quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. FE 4IWC = The sales-weighted average combined fuel economy of all 3000 lb. inertia weight class base levels in the compliance category. Round the result to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. FE 4IWC = The sales-weighted average combined fuel economy of all 4000 lb. inertia weight class base levels in the compliance category. Round the result to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. (f) The Administrator shall calculate and apply additional average fuel economy adjustments if, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Administrator determines that, as a result of test procedure changes not previously considered, such correction is necessary to yield fuel economy test results that are comparable to those obtained under the 1975 test procedures. In making such determinations, the Administrator must find that: (1) A directional change in measured fuel economy of an average vehicle can be predicted from a revision to the test procedures; (2) The magnitude of the change in measured fuel economy for any vehicle or fleet of vehicles caused by a revision to the test procedures is quantifiable from theoretical calculations or best available test data; (3) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not due to eliminating the ability of manufacturers to take advantage of flexibility within the existing test procedures to gain measured improvements in fuel economy which are not the result of actual improvements in the fuel economy of production vehicles; (4) The impact of a change on average fuel economy is not solely due to a greater ability of manufacturers to reflect in average fuel economy those design changes expected to have comparable effects on in-use fuel economy; (5) The test procedure change is required by EPA or is a change initiated by EPA in its laboratory and is not a change implemented solely by a manufacturer in its own laboratory. (g)(1) Alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles must provide equal or greater energy efficiency while operating on alcohol or natural gas as while operating on gasoline or diesel fuel to obtain the CAFE credit determined in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (vi) of this section. The following equation must hold true: E alt /E pet > or = 1 Where: E alt = [FE alt /(NHV alt xD alt )]x10 6 = energy efficiency while operating on alternative fuel rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/million BTU. E pet = [FE pet /(NHV pet xD pet )]x10 6 = energy efficiency while operating on gasoline or diesel (petroleum) fuel rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/million BTU. FE alt is the fuel economy [miles/gallon for liquid fuels or miles/100 standard cubic feet for gaseous fuels] while operated on the alternative fuel as determined in §600.113; FE pet is the fuel economy [miles/gallon] while operated on petroleum fuel (gasoline or diesel) as determined in §600.113; NHV alt is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/lb] of the alternative fuel; NHV pet is the net (lower) heating value [BTU/lb] of the petroleum fuel; D alt is the density [lb/gallon for liquid fuels or lb/100 standard cubic feet for gaseous fuels] of the alternative fuel; D pet is the density [lb/gallon] of the petroleum fuel. (i) The equation must hold true for both the city and highway fuel economy values for each test of each test vehicle. (ii)(A) The net heating value for alcohol fuels shall be determined per ASTM D 240 (Incorporated by reference as specified in §600.011&hyph;93). (B) The density for alcohol fuels shall be determined per ASTM D 1298 (Incorporated by reference as specified in §600.011&hyph;93). (iii) The net heating value and density of gasoline are to be determined by the manufacturer in accordance with §600.113(c).
