Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, describes the character of the meeting: [Begin Stoyanov recording] President Zhelev again stated that integration into European structures is a basic priority of Bulgarian foreign policy. He expressed the hope that Germany will facilitate the ratification of the agreement on Bulgaria's associated membership in the European Union. Klaus Kinkel said that the ratification will probably take place before the elections. In addition he said he would do what he could to help increase German investments in Bulgaria. He pointed out, however, that this also depends on Bulgaria. We must become a more attractive country. President Zhelev again stressed the losses Bulgaria is suffering from the Yugoslav embargo and pointed out that not only economic operations that have been affected, as the road to the West has been closed. Despite the fact that there are no military actions on Bulgarian territory, we are considered a risky state merely because we are located in the Balkans. This is something from which we will perhaps suffer even in the next few years. [end recording]
