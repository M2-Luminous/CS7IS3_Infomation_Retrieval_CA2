Interurban transportation owners are firmly maintaining the strike and have decided to defy de Leon Carpio, who has offered them a 10-percent tariff readjustment on costs of fuel transportation. Some 2.5 million Guatemalans are directly affected today in the Guatemalan capital, where 1,500 buses and 1,100 minibuses that are used in public service are not running. Rudi Maldonado, Urban Bus Transportation Association president, has announced the suspension of night service, adding buses will not provide service on 3 February due to a lack of fuel. Most minibuses are not providing service either due to a lack of gasoline, according to bus owner Cesar Arellano. Most gas stations that operate in the capital have depleted their reserves and have stopped operations, while hundreds of fuel trucks are at a standstill in the Atlantic and Pacific areas in support of the strike. Miguel Angel Luna, president of the National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT), has said the chief of state's decision is "unilateral," because they were not consulted at any moment. According to Luna, the official proposal was rejected by a consensus of the owners of cargo, fuel, cement, and passenger transportation services. He has warned the strike will not be lifted until their demands are met. The increase in the costs of fuel transportation is one of the seven points on their list of demands, he has said. Luna has said when the government announces their demands have been met they will lift the strike. In an effort to overcome the transportation strike, the president announced a 10-percent tariff readjustment in the cost of transporting fuel, but the CNT rejected it. On announcing the readjustment, de Leon said it was the government's final word, and he asked the bus owners to lift the strike immediately or otherwise bear the full weight of the law. [passage omitted] The strike began on 1 February, two days after the referendum in which 43 constitutional reforms were approved by only 400,000 of 3.4 million individuals eligible to vote, while 2.8 million Guatemalans preferred to stay home. To many people this evidences the lack of popular support for de Leon Carpio.
