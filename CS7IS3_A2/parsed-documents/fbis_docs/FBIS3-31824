The United List has lost the unnecessary "crusade" against [Defense Minister] Janez Jansa and will after the unification of the center probably play a role of wealthy utopian communists with ample financial backing. After the completion of the unification, the United List will probably be forced to withdraw gradually from the coalition although the protagonists of unification emphasize that a reshuffle of ministerial departments is not in its background. It is interesting that even [Foreign Minister] Lojze Peterle and the Christian Democrats oppose the Democrats, the Greens, and the Socialists assuming ministerial posts. They believe that the United List should stay in the coalition despite the unification of the center, because, owing to the burden of its past, it is more controllable than the new Liberal Democracy. Objectively speaking, the new party will take the segment of the political spectrum that has hitherto been covered by the United List and at the same time also a proportion of its voters, but it will primarily take ministerial posts. The unification of the center also means the end of trauma for at least some Democrats, who with 9 percent of the votes at the first elections held the most important posts in Slovene politics for two years. The story about the political center also means the end of the utopian idea about philosophers and philanthropists in politics, who used to play the role of bad conscience in the parliamentary democracy and by doing so first killed off the Slovene Democratic Alliance, later Demos, and finally -- people like Rudi Seligo and Tine and Spomenka Hribar -- left the party, but not politics. Some intellectuals in politics even today cannot come to terms with the fact that their vote in parliament counts as much as a vote of a deputy of the Slovene National Party or the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS]. The problems in the unification of the center should, therefore, not be sought merely with the Liberal Democrats, but primarily in the Democratic Party, where some people are not absolutely convinced about the pragmatism of Igor Bavcar and Dimitrij Rupel. Even though Rupel, Bavcar, and Tancig would not relinquish their ministerial posts if "the reformists" left the coalition, the unification of the center is evidently a long-term project -- especially in the light of the local elections, where parties lacking finances or party infrastructure will be condemned to defeat. The emergence of the new Liberal Democracy also means that the ZSMS [the former Socialist Alliance of Youth] faction of Jozef Skoljc and the Democrats with their state-forming pedigree will clash again, but [Prime Minister] Janez Drnovsek obviously does not have much room for maneuver. The left wing is occupied by Milan Kucan, while on the right wing it is not yet quite clear how the conflict, whose main protagonists are brothers Podobnik and Lojze Peterle, will end for the Christian Democracy. Christian Democrat Ivan Oman on one occasion said that the Slovene Christian Democratic Party [SKD] and the SLS will merge only once its leaders have passed away. Of course, in realpolitik not even antagonisms last for ever, and one can thus at least expect a joint appearance of "the anticorruption league" at the local elections if not the actual unification of the SDK and the SLS. The "unprincipled coalition" would do the biggest service to Janez Jansa by pushing him into opposition, as he would then be able to prepare for the looming early elections in peace. There is a belief among the new Liberal Democracy that the prime minister yields to much to the defense minister and "the confessional" part of the coalition. We will soon see whether the new Liberal Democratic bloc is against the right wing or whether, at least as concerns the Democrats, an if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them strategy is lurking in the background. The story about the unification, which will mark the Slovene political scene for a long time, is not merely about who will take what ministerial post but also about who will, through the Liberal Democracy, appoint ministers and form the government. The public opinion polls show that the rating of the parties has not changed much since independence and after all the affairs, with the exception of the United List, whose crisis headquarters have established that they had lost by their wrong policy of antagonizing Jansa, which at the same time weakened the influence of President Milan Kucan, and contributed toward the rising popularity of the defense minister. Janez Drnovsek, who has never concerned himself much with faction struggles, will definitely remain the central figure of the new Liberal Democracy until the elections. Secretly, he is perhaps coveting the post of the president of the state, where he is not without competition even though Milan Kucan has announced on several occasions that he will not run in the forthcoming elections. Beside the SKD and the SLS, which will definitely have advantage at the local elections, personnel is the key problem of the parties that have emerged with the democratic elections, because they cannot cover approximately 300 new communes. Namely, the total membership of some of these parties hardly exceeds the number of local communities, as it primarily consists of pragmatic elites. This is also how the interest in the unification of the center could be interpreted. The times of the proverb "two Slovenes, three parties," are over. Only those who have the money, the electoral base, and above all clear programs for which they are willing to fight until the end will survive on the political scene. "A bloc policy" is in the process of being created in Slovenia and the time of "the Cold War" is nearing, for which some politicians have already lost their nerve before it even starts.
