The Chinese team, which will also include officials of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) -- the manufacturer of S-20 submarine -- was earlier scheduled to arrive here by January 31 for detailed negotiations on the possibility of selling out three units of S-20 to Pakistan. Official sources told `The News' on Thursday: "Now the Chinese team will reach here towards the end of first half of February." The CSSC is offering its on-trial newly-designed S-20 submarines to Pakistan. The cost of three units will be nearly 540 million US dollars. Meanwhile, week-long talks with Swedish team for T-96 have already been completed and detailed negotiations with the visiting French team are currently under way for Agosta 90B submarine which is an ungraded but non-nuclear version of Agosta being manufactured by DCN-I of France. Official sources confirmed that talks for the purchase of submarines are being held only with three countries, France, Sweden and China. These sources say that "though possibility of negotiations with any other country cannot be totally ruled out, at present Pakistan has not invited any other country, except these three, for negotiations on the particular subject." Defence sources told 'The News' that Pakistan wants to sign the contract for the purchase of three submarines as early as possible once the on-going process of pre-contract negotiations with these three countries are completed.
