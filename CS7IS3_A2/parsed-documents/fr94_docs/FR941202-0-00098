FR941202-0-00098 FR941202-0-00010 Appendix A to Part 63_Test Methods * * * * * Method 307_Determination of Emissions From Halogenated Solvent Vapor Cleaning Machines Using a Liquid Level Procedure 1. Applicability and Principle 1.1␣Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of the halogenated solvent emissions from solvent vapor cleaners in the idling mode. 1.2␣Principle. The solvent level in the solvent cleaning machine is measured using inclined liquid level indicators. The change in liquid level corresponds directly to the amount of solvent lost from the solvent cleaning machine. 2. Apparatus Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency. 2.1␣Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. A schematic of the inclined liquid level indicators used in this method is shown in figure 307&hyph;1; two inclined liquid level indicators having 0.05 centimeters divisions or smaller shall be used. The liquid level indicators shall be made of glass, Teflon, or any similar material that will not react with the solvent being used. A 6-inch by 1-inch slope is recommended; however the slope may vary depending on the size and design of the solvent cleaning machine. Note: It is important that the inclined liquid level indicators be constructed with ease of reading in mind. The inclined liquid level indicators should also be mounted so that they can be raised or lowered if necessary to suit the solvent cleaning machine size. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER02DE94.004 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C 2.2␣Horizontal Indicator. Device to check the inclined liquid level indicators orientation relative to horizontal. 2.3␣Velocity Meter. Hotwire and vane anemometers, or other devices capable of measuring the flow rates ranging from 0 to 15.2 meters per minute across the solvent cleaning machine. 3. Procedure 3.1␣Connection of the Inclined Liquid Level Indicator. Connect one of the inclined liquid level indicators to the boiling sump drain and the other inclined liquid level indicator to the immersion sump drain using Teflon tubing and the appropriate fittings. A schematic diagram is shown in figure 307&hyph;2. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER02DE94.005 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C
