But it remains to be decided whether Burma should be invited as "guest of the host country," or "guest of ASEAN," said Suwit Simasakun. "There's still time to think about this. The principle is not to isolate them (the Burmese) but how far they will be involved depends on them," he said. ASEAN officials have long made clear that an invitation to Rangoon would be contingent on progress toward political liberalisation in Burma. Thailand is hosting what will be the 27th annual conference of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Consensus on inviting Burma to the ASEAN foreign ministers' gathering was reached yesterday at a meeting in Bangkok of the grouping's foreign affairs and security officials. The so-called special SOM (Senior Officials' Meeting), continuing through tomorrow, is concentrating on preparations toward the first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the grouping's new mechanism for security dialogue. In the first mention of dates, officials yesterday said the foreign ministers' conference would take place from July 23-24 and would be followed by the first session of the ARF on July 25. The annual Post Ministerial Conference with seven so-called dialogue partners the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and the European Union is set for July 26-27. The six ASEAN member states are inviting these dialogue partners and five others -- China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea -- to attend the ARF. Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem called the ARF a mechanism for solving security problems. Yesterday's meeting endorsed a related idea -- the proposed establishment of a regional peace-keeping centre. But it remains to be decided whether the centre should function as a nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one for exchanging information, said Mr Suwit. The idea of setting up a regional peacekeeping centre surfaced last month in response to the United Nations secretary-general's "Agenda for Peace". Reportedly the brainchild of Indonesian scholar Jusuf Wanandi, of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), the idea will be discussed in depth at an ASEAN-ISIS workshop scheduled in conjunction with the next meeting of senior ASEAN officials in April. The ASEAN officials' meeting yesterday also saw Thailand propose holding a Southeast Asian Ten Nations Conference. The proposal calls for a ministerial-level meeting of the six ASEAN member states, and neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma, said Director-General of East Asia Affairs Department Don Pramatwinai. Yesterday's gathering also discussed outstanding problems in the South China Sea, on the Korean Peninsula, and prospects of setting up a Zone of Peace Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN).
