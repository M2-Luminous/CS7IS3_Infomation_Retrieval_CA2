UN officials late Sunday confirmed that both Bosnian Serb and Moslem forces had sufficiently complied with a NATO ultimatum to remove their artillery units from around the city by 0000 GMT Monday. As a result, they said, there was no immediate need for NATO warplanes to carry out threatened air strikes. General Andre Soubirou, UN commander for Sarajevo, expressed satisfaction that in the 10 days since the NATO ultimatum was issued Bosnian Serb units had handed over 225 weapons to UN control and the mainly Moslem Bosnian army 43. While some weapony does remain within a 20-kilometer (12.5 mile) Sarajevo exclusion zone imposed by NATO, United Nations officers on Sunday minimized its importance. UN troops on Monday will be flown by helicopter to the nine Serb military sites -- out of 41 -- that they had been unable to inspect by the end of the day Sunday because of heavy snow. From first light reconnaissance aircraft will also return to action, and according to Soubirou, "we should have a precise idea of the situation by the end of the morning." At the 10 weapons collection points already established -- eight for the Serbs and two for the Moslems -- armed UN guards have orders to use force to prevent any party from recovering them. NATO air strikes are also possible if UN ground troops holding the weapons come under attack. Monday should also see the arrival outside Sarajevo of a second contingent of the 400 Russian peacekeeping troops whose deployment had been sought by the Serbs in exchange for compliance with the NATO ultimatum. A first contingent has since late Sunday been stationed near Grbavica, where they are to deploy.
