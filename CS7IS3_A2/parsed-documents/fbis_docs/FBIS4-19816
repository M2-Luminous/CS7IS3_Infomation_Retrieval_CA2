This is said in the economic report of the top association from Cologne, published on Wednesday [20 April]. According to the BDI's assessment, in the course of the year domestic demand will not expand to any degree worth mentioning, but expectations of a further speedy improvement in exports are certainly justified. The trend toward a certain increase in stocks, which can be seen everywhere now, supports cautious optimism. Prospects for a strong stimulation of the economic development, however, remain limited. Even if the economic development is favorable, the reduction of unemployment in western and eastern Germany will remain "the outstanding economic policy problem of the next few years," according to the BDI economic report. It is inconceivable that this problem will be overcome without a strong increase in investment, the report says. According to this top industrial association, the growth process in the new laender has accelerated. The increase in domestic demand for industrial goods has improved tangibly and is spreading to an ever larger number of branches.
