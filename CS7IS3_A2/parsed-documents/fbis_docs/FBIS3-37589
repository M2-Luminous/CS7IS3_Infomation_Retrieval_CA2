According to Yuriy Meshkov, this very issue was the main objective of his six day visit to Moscow. "All the necessary agreements were signed," pointed out the Crimean president. "At present the Crimean republic enjoys the most favored nation treatment in its relations with Russia." Mr. Meshkov promised Crimea residents that they would feel the positive results of the Moscow agreements in the very near future. The Crimean president told journalists that a trade and economic representation of the Crimea would be opened in Moscow soon and a representation of the Russian Federation and separate representations of the Krasnodar and Stavropol regions would be opened in Simferopol. Dwelling on the appointment of the Moscow economist, Russia's former Minister of Economy Yevgeniy Saburov, to the post of the prime minister of the Crimea, Meshkov pointed out the following: "Today it would be most advantageous to appoint this very man to the post of prime minister." Saburov cannot hold the state post because he is not a citizen of Ukraine, the leader of the Ukrainian president's service for issues of domestic policy Mr. Mykhalchenko declared in this connection. However, according to the press service of the Council of Ministers of the Crimea, dual citizenship will soon be introduced in the Crimea thus enabling Mr. Saburov, currently director of the Information and Social Technologies Centre under the government of the Russian Federation, to become the prime minister of the Crimea.
