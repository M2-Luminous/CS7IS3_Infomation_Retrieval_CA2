In his words, such an attitude is born out by the government's total neglect for the telecommunications industry. By the end of last year the state-run TV and radio companies owed 67.5 Bn rubles to the telecommunications staff, and since then the figure has risen to 80 Bn rubles. As a result of the chronic debts, as Nazeykin reported, more than 50,000 telecommunications workers have been underpaid for up to 4 months and are now working for free. These facts and proposals on how to offset the debts make up the package of documents addressed to the government by participants in a conference of telecommunications workers on January 21. There has been no response to the package, nor has there been any reaction to the telecommunications staff's warning that programs from Ostankino and other TV centers will be significantly cut.
