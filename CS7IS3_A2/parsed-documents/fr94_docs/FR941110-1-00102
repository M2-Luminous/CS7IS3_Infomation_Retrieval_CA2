FR941110-1-00102 FR941110-1-00011 (c) Until January 1, 1996, a company may also increase or decrease its production allowances by trading with another Party to the Protocol according to the provision under this paragraph of this section. A nation listed in Appendix C to this subpart (Parties to the Montreal Protocol) must agree either to transfer to the person for the current control period some amount of production that the nation is permitted under the Montreal Protocol or to receive from the person for the current control period some amount of production that the person is permitted under this subpart. (1) For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from the principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy in the United States a signed document stating that the appropriate authority within that nation has established or revised production limits for the nation to equal the lesser of the maximum production that the nation is allowed under the Protocol minus the amount transferred, the maximum production that is allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus the amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual national production level for the three years prior to the transfer minus the production allowances transferred. The person must submit to the Administrator a transfer request that includes a true copy of this document and that sets forth the following: (i) The identity and address of the person; (ii) The identity of the Party; (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the person and for the Party; (iv) The chemical type and level of production being transferred; and (v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies. (2) For trades to a Party, a person must submit a transfer request that sets forth the following: (i) The identity and address of the person; (ii) The identity of the Party; (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the person and for the Party; (iv) The chemical type and level of allowable production to be transferred; and (v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies. (3) After receiving a transfer request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator may, at his discretion, consider the following factors in deciding whether to approve such a transfer: (i) Possible creation of economic hardship; (ii) Possible effects on trade; (iii) Potential environmental implications; and (iv) The total amount of unexpended production allowances held by United States entities. (4) The Administrator will issue the person a notice either granting or deducting production allowances and specifying the control period to which the transfer applies, provided that the request meets the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section for trades from Parties and paragraphs (c)(2) of this section for trades to Parties, unless the Administrator has decided to disapprove the trade under paragraph (c)(3) of this section for trades to Parties. For a trade from a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the allowances held by the person to equal the unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart plus the level of allowable production transferred from the Party. For a trade to a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the production limit for the person to equal the lesser of: (i) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or (ii) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the United States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total allowable production allowable for that substance under this subpart minus the amount transferred. The change in allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued. (5) If after one person obtains approval for a trade of allowable production of a controlled substance to a Party, one or more other persons obtain approval for trades involving the same controlled substance and the same control period, the Administrator will issue notices revising the production limits for each of the other persons trading that controlled substance in that control period to equal the lesser of: (i) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or (ii) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the United States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total allowable production for that substance under this subpart multiplied by the amount transferred divided by the total amount transferred by all the other person trading the same controlled substance in the same control period minus the amount transferred by that person. (iii) The Administrator will also issue a notice revising the production limit for each person who previously obtained approval of a trade of that substance in that control period to equal the unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart plus the amount by which the United States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total allowable production under this subpart multiplied by the amount transferred by that person divided by the amount transferred by all of the persons that have traded that controlled substance in that control period. The change in production allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued. (d) Effective January 1, 1996, there will be no trade in production or consumption allowances with Parties to the Protocol for class I controlled substances, except for class I, Group VI, methyl bromide. (e) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class I, Group VI, a person may obtain production allowances for that controlled substance equal to the amount of that controlled substance produced in the United States that was transformed or destroyed within the United States in the cases where production allowances were expended to produce such substance in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. A request for production allowances under this section will be considered a request for consumption allowances under ยง82.10(b) of this subpart. (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class I, Group VI, a person must submit a request for production allowances that includes the following: (i) The identity and address of the person; (ii) The name, quantity, and level of controlled substance transformed or the name, quantity and volume destroyed; (iii) A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of the controlled substance to the person; (iv) A certification that production allowances were expended for the production of the controlled substance; (v) If the controlled substance is transformed, the name, quantity, and verification of the commercial use of the resulting chemical transformed; and
