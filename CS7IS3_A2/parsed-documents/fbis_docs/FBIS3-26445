After the survey, Li Tieying made this conclusion: As an experimental city for the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, Wuhan has the necessary foundation, conditions, and initiative. He hoped that Wuhan would play the Hubei card, the card of the economic belt of the Chang Jiang's middle reaches, and the card of the entire nation, and bring into full play its role as a comprehensive reform experimental city. The State Council survey team arrived in Wuhan on 1 February for a five-day inspection of the city. While in Wuhan, Li Tieying and the survey team members, accompanied by provincial and Wuhan City leaders, inspected the Tianhe airport, the Wuhan Stock Exchange Center, the Wushang Group, the Wuhan Steel and Iron Corporation, and the 7 February Memorial Hall. While in the Tianhe airport, Li Tieying told a comrade in charge that this new airport must have a new mechanism. He wrote an inscription, which reads: A high departure point, a new structure, safety first, management first, and service first. When Li Tieying entered the hall of the Wuhan Stock Exchange Center, warm applause broke out. Li Tieying told a person in charge of the stock exchange center that this center must be managed properly according to international practice. He also held talks with some Wuhan entrepreneurs in the Wuhan Steel and Iron Corporation, during which he solicited their opinions on how to form a modern enterprise system. As early as 1984, the party Central Committee and the State Council selected Wuhan for a comprehensive reform experimental city of the country. This effectively stimulated the city's reform, opening up, and economic development. In December last year, the State Economic Structural Reform Commission formally decided on Wuhan for a new round of comprehensive experimental city reform, approved Wuhan's experimental program on establishing a socialist market economic structure, and set detailed requirements for Wuhan's reform. [passage omitted] Li Tieying and the survey team members were of the opinion that Wuhan's explorations of state enterprise reform, price system reform, and market structural reform had had a certain impact on the entire country. Wuhan comrades have really understood that without reform, there is no way out; only reform will bring about the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the economy. Li Tieying said: Wuhan's reform corresponds with Wuhan's actual conditions, has yielded significant results, created much experience, and enjoys a high reputation in the country. Wuhan's reform has important bearings on reform explorations in hinterland cities. Li Tieying stressed: This year is a crucial year of reform. In line with the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the state has speeded up establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The purpose is to emancipate and develop productive forces and to bring about a fine economic cycle and healthy economic development. Wuhan's development has resulted from reform and opening up. In the new round of reform, there will be plenty of scope and prospects for Wuhan to display its talents. Li Tieying pointed out: A structural transformation is a huge systems engineering project, which requires strengthened party and government leadership in its implementation. The party and government should be the designers of the new structure and the builders as well. The State Economic Structural Reform Commission fully supports Wuhan's reform. Hubei should be used as a stage for Wuhan comrades to act on. [passage omitted] Provincial and Wuhan City leaders including Guan Guangfu, Jia Zhijie, Hui Liangyu, Qian Yunlu, Li Daqiang, Wang Zhongnong, Zhao Baojiang, Li Yuan, Wang Shouhai, and Li Meifang accompanied Li Tieying and the survey team during their tour of Wuhan. Li Tieying and the survey team also listened to reports by provincial and Wuhan City party and government leaders.
