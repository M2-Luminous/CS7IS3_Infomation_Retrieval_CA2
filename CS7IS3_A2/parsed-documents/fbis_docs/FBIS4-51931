Touching on the Nanjing massacre in China caused by the former Japanese Army during the Pacific War, the minister said: "I think that certain reports, such as the one about the Nanjing massacre, are fabricated." That an incumbent cabinet member has openly denied the existence of the Nanjing massacre will not only arouse repulsion from the Chinese Government and others, but will become a controversial issue in Japan. With regard to the Pacific War, Justice Minister Nagano stated: "It is wrong to call it a war of aggression. If you say that the war was launched for the purpose of aggression, that is incorrect. It was started while serious consideration was given to the idea of liberating colonies or liberating the co-prosperity sphere (in greater East Asia). Then, touching on the Nanjing massacre, he added: "I think it was fabricated." In explaining his reasoning why he said this, Minister Nagano stated: "Because I went to Nanjing immediately after the incident." With regard to the Pacific War, (then) Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated last August at the first news conference held after his inauguration: "It is my understanding that it was a war of aggression, and an unjust war." The Nanjing massacre occurred in December 1937 when the former Japanese Army attacked and captured Nanjing, China's capital at that time, massacring a large number of Nanjing residents and prisoners of war. According to a Chinese announcement, "over 300,000 people" were killed. However, some have argued against this organized massacre. Justice Minister Nagano was a graduate of the Military Academy of the former Japanese Army. During the Pacific War, he was sent to combat in China. After the war, he joined the Self-Defense Forces and once acted as Chief of Staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force. As a Diet member from the Liberal Democratic Party, he once remarked at a session of the party's Research Commission on the Constitution: "Some harbor an incorrect view about the history of the Greater East Asia War [Dai-toa senso]. Therefore, we should not adopt a one-sided position in discussing the war."
