An agency official briefing reporters on the monthly report on the state of Japanese economy said the situation is severe and the recession is lagging on. In the report, the EPA simply stated that the state of the economy is "overall sluggish." Asked if the agency is using its gloomiest words possible to describe the situation, the official answered "yes." The EPA pointed out that consumer spending remained lackluster, while the weakness of plant and equipment investment is spreading from manufacturers to the nonmanufacturing sector. The report noted the plodding process of inventory adjustments and said industrial output remains stagnant. The official said business conditions of private enterprises are worsening. He said he can no longer attribute the situation merely to the yen's appreciation, admitting the overall situation is simply "bad." Job offers continued to decline, while the unemployment rate continues to increase, the report said. The EPA said the government is hence currently working to compile another comprehensive pump-priming package to spur the economy, in addition to steady implementation of past stimulation programs. Exports are down with effects of the yen's appreciation gradually appearing and because of an adjustment of the economic growth in China after a heated period, the official said. Meanwhile, implementation of public works spending improved and housing starts were also solid.
