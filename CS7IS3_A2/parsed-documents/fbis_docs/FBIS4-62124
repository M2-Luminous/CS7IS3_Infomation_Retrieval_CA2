ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says "Peace in Europe depends not only on Russia and Germany, but their good relations can help develop a pan- European security system". The newspaper remarks that one of the sensitive issues, concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany, was successfully solved during Yeltsin's visit: the last Russian troops will leave on August 31 from Berlin, as Moscow insisted, and not from Weimar, as Bonn proposed". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reports from Bonn that the two countries "have succeeded in lifting the shadow which weighed down on Russo-German relations lately in connection with the departure of the Russian western army". The newspaper stresses that the second day of the Russian president's visit to Germany witnessed "a special, trustful relationship which has taken shape between the leaders of Russia and Federal Germany". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA stresses that "Yeltsin secured a version of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany which is acceptable to Russia", while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl "was attuned to Moscow's sentiments" Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who accompanies Yeltsin on his trip, said "The results of the first days of the visit are evident. Solutions have been found which suit both countries, and -- most importantly -- a basis has been laid for building a common future". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a banner "Yeltsin has won the battle of Berlin", but admits that Kohl, who was yielding on the Berlin question, proved to be indomitable on another point: the withdrawal of the Russian troops and the units of our Western allies in the anti-Hitler coalition will "proceed separately". The newspaper also mentions shifts in Russia's standpoint on cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance: "Helmut Kohl succeeded in "keeping the honorable guest from Moscow on track for "Partnership for Peace". TRUD reports on the press conference held by the two leaders, which "revealed the scale of their conversations, their efficiency, and their reciprocal movement towards concord". The German side supported Russia's striving for integration, the newspaper says. The Russian president and the federal chancellor stressed that the visit reflected the frank, friendly and trustful character of relations between Russia and Germany. PRAVDA says that "talks between the two politicians confirmed what had been expected: There will be no joint farewell to all the four powers of the anti-Hitler coalition, on which Russia, and especially its military insisted". The newspaper says that no headway was made in solving yet another pressing problem -- the exchange of the cultural values which the sides captured during World War Two. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Yevgeny Yasin, head of the Russian president's analytical centre. The prominent economist proclaimed that Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are at present "the mainstays of political stability in society, which is absolutely needed for reforms to continue". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on the fact that the State Duma refused to give the army its "survival minimum" by turning down the Defence Ministry's request for an addition of 18 trillion roubles to the defence budget. According to the newspaper, the cut in the defence budget will lead to a "further obsolescence of the army's military technical potential, the curbing of restructuring in line with the military reform". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rebuffs Zbigniew Brzezinsky's statement that calls for partnership between Russia and the United States are premature. According to the newspaper, "Partnership is possible and necessary, although it can hardly be comprehensive, simple and smooth at the present stage". The same newspaper carries an interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who stresses the importance of "cooperation of equals" between Russian and his country. The Lithuanian president said that "despite complications, present relations between lithuania and Russia can be characterised as good".
