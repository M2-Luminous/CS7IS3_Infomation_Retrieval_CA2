The talks will last two days. In expert opinion, this regular round of talks will not be easy, because the sides have still not ironed out their differences on the problem of social guarantees to military pensioners (about 11,000), now residing in Estonia, and to members of their families. This problem has always been a stumbling block in Russo-Estonian negotiations. The previous round of talks, which ended in Tallinn on March 2, has not yielded any positive results. The agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops remained unsigned. The sides expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of negotiations. According to Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian delegation, the Estonian side is ready to approve the draft agreement on the complete withdrawal of troops, but would do it only after it gets an exact schedule of the pullout. "The Russian side has such a document," Svirin said, "but it will be handed over to the Estonian side only after it promises to grant all the needed social guarantees to the military pensioners and members of their families, now residing in Estonia." However, the Estonian delegation still objects against the linking of the pullout problem with the question of military pensioners. It moved to discuss the letter separately, but also on condition that it should first get the pullout schedule. It is common knowledge that Russia, without any agreement or schedule, has already withdrawn from Estonia 90 per cent of all its troops and now pledges to repatriate 2,500 remaining officers and men by August 31, 1994. Commenting on the results of the 17th round of talks, Svirin said that the Russian delegation was disturbed by Estonia's deviation from the earlier achieved agreements to renounce mutual claims: Russia is to turn over to Estonia 4,900 military establishments on the territory of the republic, while the latter is not claim any compensation for the caused ecological damage. Moreover, in accordance with an earlier reached agreement, Estonia was to allocate 23 million U.S. dollars for building housing facilities for the Russian troops withdrawn from the republic. The ambassador said that if Estonia backpedaled on these agreements, Russia would be compelled to withdraw the remaining troops according to its own, unilaterally fixed schedule. Speaking on the local television a short while ago, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik said that "Estonia does not want to make any compromises on social guarantees to Russian military pensioners now living in the republic". However, he stressed that he hoped the agreement on the withdrawal of troops, which Estonia was ready to accept a month ago, would be finally initialled.
