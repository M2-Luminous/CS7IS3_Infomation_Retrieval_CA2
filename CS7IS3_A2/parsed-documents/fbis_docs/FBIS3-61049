It is expected that the focus of attention will be on two major issues: How to resolve problems of international peace, and what to do about a request made by a number of Central and Eastern European states for inclusion into the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. In essence, the discussions will boil down to the future of this Alliance in the contemporary world. On this eve of the NATO summit meeting, it would be advantageous to examine the question of the relationship existing between Russia and NATO. However, before we attempt to find an answer to this question, it seems to me that certain remarks are in order. A truly paradoxical situation has come about. Virtually everyone in the West is of the opinion that the NATO Alliance has emerged from the Cold War as the victor. At the same time, in no time in the past has the Alliance faced problems that are so pressing and difficult of resolution as it does now. It is also said that NATO is undergoing its own crisis. This statement of the bloc's crisis situation is all the more surprising, since it came directly on the heels of the explosion of euphoria which in the West was accompanied by the fall of the Berlin Wall, self-dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization, and disintegration of the Soviet Union. Leaders of states and governments of Alliance countries in a London meeting held in the summer of 1990 were triumphant in their welcoming the changes occurring in Europe, even calling them historical. Then suddenly the crisis. What went wrong? The fact is that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in the form which it was at the end of the 1940's, has virtually ceased to exist. The "threat from the East" has disappeared. So has the enemy. The point here is that they were essential to the bloc's organizers not only to set a course of "containment and repulsion" of communism, but more importantly to consolidate the leading role played by the USA in the post-war world. Serving as an instrument of Washington's politics and pulling into this political channel other Western countries was for many years the major function of the bloc. And something else. NATO, after having rid itself of real or imaginary fears concerning a "massed assault from the East," came to face new and this time real dangers. These were the unstable situation in Russia (let us recall how much someone in the West suffered over the parliamentary election results in our country) and in other states which sprang up on the territory of the former USSR; the possibility of uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and, finally, the inter-ethnic and ethnic conflicts occurring on the periphery of the bloc that turned into fierce armed conflicts, such as those in Yugoslavia, Moldova, and the Caucasus. How to react to all these dangers? What could and should NATO do under these conditions? The above questions should be answered at the NATO summit. All of the above bears a direct relationship to Russia. All the more since this raises full-force the question of expansion of NATO's limits by virtue of including a number of Eastern European countries into the organization. One cannot fail to respect the sovereign right of every state of selecting those forms and means of insuring the security it deems most suitable. However, NATO's leading circles are aware of Moscow's negative attitude toward possible forced expansion of the Alliance. This could lead to new problems rather than to the resolution of existing ones. For example, this could disrupt the legally formalized system existing on our continent, primarily the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of strengthening of trust and stability, this would sow new seeds of distrust, which undoubtedly would lead to destabilization of the entire situation. Expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility would directly impinge upon the interests of Russia in the geopolitical, military, and home policy areas. Expansion of the Alliance of the world's largest military bloc would push out its boundaries, which would then be located close to the Russian borders. This would necessitate a fundamental rethinking of all our defensive concepts, restructuring of the Armed Forces, reviewing of the operational configuration of the theater of military operations, developing an additional infrastructure, relocation of large military contingents, and changing of operational plans and the nature of combat training. One can easily imagine that the expansion of NATO's circle of members would be perceived by both the leadership and public of Russia as attempts to set up isolation, creating a "sanitary cordon" at our western borders. One would not be out of line if he were to point out that that could lead to xenophobia in our society and an intensification of the influence of radical-right nationalistic parties and organizations. Incidentally, the above opinion is not solely that of Russians. It is no accident that the influential German newspaper WELT recently wrote that the driving force behind all of NATO's attempts to expand eastward is an intent of erecting another "Iron Curtain" that would constitute a barrier against an unstable neighbor: Russia. NATO's leading circles do understand the nuances of this situation. It appears that the latter are in no hurry to accept new members, in spite of insistent requests made by Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a number of other Eastern European countries. As an alternative, the US President has presented an idea that has come to be known as the "Partnership for Peace." It seems to me that Russia could support this idea, to the extent that it incorporates the security interests of all states without exception. Of course, this partnership should be based on the drafting of universal standards of security applicable to the entire North Atlantic area. A genuine partnership would include priority development of political dialogue, constant consultations, agreement on positions, and, in the future, coordinated actions. Ministers of foreign affairs and defense of NATO countries in their sessions held in the beginning of December affirmed their support of the "Partnership for Peace" plan advanced by Washington. However, the nature of the plan and the methods of its implementation are not yet clear. These problems will obviously be objects of close examination at the forthcoming session of the NATO Council, and it would be very desirable if the participants would take into consideration the Russian point of view relative to the given problem. Of course, the decisions made in Brussels will be discussed by the Presidents of Russia and the United States during their meeting to take place in the next few days. All of the above does not mean that Russia and NATO are separated by an unbridgeable gulf. This was evidenced at the recent meeting of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner. On that occasion, it was pointed out that an objective evaluation of Russia's role relative to the assurance of international security and stability requires that Russia's relationships with the NATO Alliance be accorded priority, with respect to rate of progress, scope, and depth, over relations between the latter and countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Noteworthy in this regard is that there already exists compatibility in a number of fundamental views in military and political concepts held by Russia and NATO member countries. This is a beneficial result of the de-ideologization of international relations on the one hand, and a coincidence of views held by both sides relative to basic problems of security assurance on the other. In this regard, both sides accord political methods a position of priority. The use of military force is looked upon as an exceptional measure, one permissible only in the interests of self-defense and in peacekeeping operations. Both the "new strategic NATO concept" adopted in 1991 and the recently approved "Basic Military Doctrine Principles of the Russian Federation" contain extremely important provisions asserting that neither the North Atlantic Alliance nor Russia will consider any state or coalition to be an enemy. Both documents acknowledge that the limitation and reduction of armaments are in agreement with the national interests of all states and promote strengthening of general security. It may be said that this opens up a real possibility of eliminating the remaining elements of military confrontation in Europe. And the above kind of elements do still exist. Russia is carrying out a deep restructuring of her Armed Forces, has already effected considerable manpower reduction, and intends to proceed in this direction, while the NATO countries are slow in abating their military activity. In a recent session of the bloc's Military Planning Committee, it was pointed out that the last few years have seen a mere 15% reduction in manpower of member countries, while military expenditures still amount to 3.2% of the gross national product. And this in the absence of a real enemy! But this raises another question. If Russia considers expansion of the NATO structure disadvantageous, so to speak, and if the details of the "Partnership for Peace" are still unclear, can there be a solution to the existing situation? It appears that there can be, and, possibly, more than one. For example, one can point to further improvement in the role and significant activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). Even now it unites 38 states, being NATO members on the one hand, and former members of the WPO (Warsaw Pact Organization), including of course the Russian Federation, on the other. Russia participates actively in sessions of the NACC at the level of ministers of foreign affairs, while representatives of her Ministry of Defense take part in the work of various commissions, seminars, and courses, within the framework of this organization. However, the above framework is still limited. The time has obviously come to effect a considerable expansion in this area. There are real possibilities for transforming the NACC into a collective security organization in Europe. This would be associated with diminishing the role of the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), but due to the fact that the work of the CSCE involves a much smaller number of states compared with the NACC, it would be easier to arrive at mutually-acceptable solutions and render the latter more effective and responsive to pressing tasks and requirements related to the situation. One would not be out of line here to point out that the above is understood by all NACC members. Issued at a recent meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was a statement discussing the measures advanced for improving interrelationships within the framework of this organization. The latter has identified for itself the task of continuing and activating consultations related to political problems and problems associated with security assurance and to the development of cooperation in the military area. For example, this served as the purpose for approving a new working plan of dialogue, partnership, and cooperation for 1994. Why the selection of organizations such as North Atlantic Cooperation Council? Why not charge NATO with the function of assuring regional security? The answer is that the NATO Alliance was set up as a specific organization of leading Western countries under definite conditions to accomplish definite goals. But the conditions have changed radically. There can be no doubt that any attempts made to transform NATO will effect virtually no change in its nature. The NATO Alliance is an organization of the past. Occupying its agenda should be not its modernization, but instead a move away from bloc thinking and toward an efficient and effective system of European and international security. The time has obviously come to infuse with vitality the fruitful idea of creating a security system stretching "from Vancouver to Vladivostok," to prepare and implement the necessary machinery. The above are the considerations I would like to share on the eve of the NATO summit relative to a problem as serious as relations between Russia and the NATO Alliance.
