FBIS4-29713 "dreas119_q_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Afghan `War Criminals' Under Investigation Afghan `War Criminals' Under Investigation BK2106052194 Hong Kong AFP in English 0500 GMT 21 Jun 94 BK2106052194 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Sydney, June 21 (AFP) -- Australian security services are investigating the circumstances in which two alleged Afghan war criminals have taken refuge here, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Tuesday. But the minister denied a claim that any deal was done by which the men -- said to be former high-ranking members of Afghan communist leader Najibollah's regime -- were granted entry in exchange for giving information to the security services. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) claimed in a report Monday that at least three members of the regime responsible for many atrocities had been given permanent residence in Australia. The regime's former vice president and a deputy secret service chief were said to be among the war criminals. Members of Australia's Afghan community were threatening to take action against them unless the government responded, the ABC said. Opposition Senator David MacGibbon asked in a parliamentary question Tuesday if it was true the men had gained entry despite a warning from members of the Afghan community to former Immigration Minister Robert Ray in May 1989. MacGibbon described them as being former members of a regime said to have executed one and a half million of its citizens during Afghanistan's civil war. Evans said he took the view that no Australian security agency ever had or ever would knowingly assist the entry of any individual who had been involved in terrorist activities or war crimes. "I am certainly not aware of any deal whatsoever being made with anybody on this matter," he told the Senate. Evans said the allegations were known to the Australian security authorities and were being investigated although the government was not yet fully apprised of the status and other relevant details of the persons in question. The identity of two had been established but nothing was known of the third. Evans said the immigration department was considering an application for refugee status from one and the second had resident status, having entered under the humanitarian program. His visa was issued in New Delhi, India after all normal requirements had been assessed as met, Evans said. But the minister declined to elaborate on MacGibbon's suggestion of security service involvement, saying it was long-standing government policy not to comment on security matters.
