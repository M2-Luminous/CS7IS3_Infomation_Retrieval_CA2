Besides, he said, tax inspections do not keep tabs on incomes of enterprises although there exist in every state rules formulated through long experience under which enterprises volunteer to pay taxes toward the budget. Such a rule, Mr. Shokhin thinks, should also operate in relations between components of the Russian Federation. Said the vice premier: "Therefore we are to amend the legislative acts (laws on banks, enterprises, entrepreneurial activities, and the tax system) in the near future so as to quickly introduce these mechanisms of controlling a market-based economy. To the question from your SEGODNYA correspondent on how this can be done quickly, Aleksandr Shokhin made it understood that this does not mean introducing a command system: There is "an element of emergency, but it is not an emergency in the political sense of the word. This is a normal system for control of a market-based economy, ...an emergency action is warranted by the current situation in the economy and by the fact that the 1994 draft budget forwarded by the government to the Federal Assembly can be turned down." Therefore Mr. Shokhin is inclined to think of the need for a collective approach to bringing the country out of the economic crisis. The vice premier proposed to create for this purpose a "roundtable" bringing together the Russian Federation Government, the State Duma, the Federation Council, and public organizations. He also thought that there should be some corrections made: "Is it worthwhile for us to hasten with privatizing Gazprom-type state enterprises and oil enterprises, using vouchers. It may be better to spare them for a privatization stage where cash is involved." Aleksandr Shokhin thinks that Russia will not be able to bring down inflation and stop the continuing production slump without such a package of measures.
