FR940711-1-00032 FR940711-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 920 Maryland Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Maryland regulatory program (hereinafter the ``Maryland program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment establishes minimum engineering design standards to provide the 1.3 minimum static safety factor for a normal pool with steady state seepage conditions in lieu of engineering tests for small impoundments that are not a safety hazard. The amendment will provide an optional approach to determine the 1.3 minimum static factor for small, non-hazardous impoundments not built of or impounding coal mine waste. The amendment is intended to revise the Maryland program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations. DATES: Written comments must be received by 4:00 p.m., [E.D.T.], August 10, 1994. If requested, a public hearing on the proposed amendment will be held on August 5, 1994. Requests to speak at the hearing must be received by 4:00 p.m., [E.D.T.], on July 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments and requests to speak at the hearing should be mailed or hand delivered to George Rieger, Acting Director, at the address listed below. Any disabled individual who has need for a special accommodation to attend a public hearing should contact the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Copies of the Maryland program, the proposed amendment, a listing of any scheduled public hearings, and all written comments received in response to this document will be available for public review at the addresses listed below during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Each requester may receive one free copy of the proposed amendment by contacting OSM's Harrisburg Field Office. George J. Rieger, Acting Director, Harrisburg Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Harrisburg Transportation Center, Third Floor, Suite 3C, 4th and Market Streets, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17101, Telephone: (717) 782&hyph;4036. Maryland Bureau of Mines, 160 South Water Street, Frostburg, Maryland 21532, Telephone: (301) 689&hyph;4136. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George Rieger, Acting Director, Harrisburg Field Office, Telephone: (717) 782&hyph;4036. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Maryland Program On February 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Maryland program. Background information on the Maryland program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in the February 18, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 7214). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 920.15 and 920.16. II. Description of the Proposed Amendment On June 22, 1993, OSM published a final rule (58 FR 33910) for Maryland program amendment (Administrative Record Numbers MD&hyph;549.00 and MD&hyph;539.16) concerning hydrologic balance, ponds and sediment control measures, and civil penalties. The Director approved the program amendment except for COMAR 08.09.13.24H(3)(c). The intent of proposed 08.09.13.24H(3)(c) was to establish engineering design standards in lieu of engineering tests to ensure a 1.3 minimum safety factor for small non-hazardous impoundments that are not constructed with or impound coal mine waste and not subject to the requirements of 30 CFR 77.216(a). The Director found that COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c) was deficient in two areas. First, the soil strength values used in the stability analysis defined dry density and optimum moisture content values associated with them but did not specify the moisture content of the fill material necessary to achieve the required density through compaction. Secondly, the phreatic surface defined in the analysis did not reflect normal pool conditions under a ``worst case'' scenario. By letters dated May 16, 1994, and June 23, 1994 (Administrative Record Number MD&hyph;569.00), Maryland submitted a program amendment to satisfy OSM's concerns delineated in the June 22, 1993, final rule. The amendment adds COMAR 08.13.09.24h(1)(q) requiring the material used in the construction of the impoundment to have sufficient moisture content to achieve proper compaction. The amendment also revises the stability analysis to support COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c) to represent normal pool conditions under a worst case scenario. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Maryland program. Written Comments
