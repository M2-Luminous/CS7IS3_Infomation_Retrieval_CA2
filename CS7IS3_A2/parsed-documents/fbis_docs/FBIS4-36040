Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, chief of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who was in Washington with a high-level economic delegation to take part in joint sessions of the IMF and the World Bank, announced above. He said: Based on this agreement, all unpaid credits to Iran's government and private institutions will be paid out of credits given to the Islamic Republic of Iran for this purpose. The aforementioned credits exceed $210, and they cover all the commitments that are due in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. Based on the signed agreement, the grace period before repayment begins on these new credits is two years and the repayment period is two years (until the year 2000). The credits lacking insurance will also be repaid based on the same conditions. According to 'Adeli, the delegation from the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Germany, which was responsible for negotiating with a number of German companies, including Siemens, Benz, Grundig, Krupp, Philips, [?Prusag] and others, has also recently been able to reach agreements about extending the repayment of 520 million marks [DM], which lacked Germany's Hermes export insurance. This agreement is separate from the previous DM4 billion agreement recently made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the German bank.
