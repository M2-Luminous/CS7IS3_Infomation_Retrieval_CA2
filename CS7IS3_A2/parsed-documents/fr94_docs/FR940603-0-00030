FR940603-0-00030 FR940603-0-00015 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP Baltimore 94&hyph;003] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulation; Hammerman Area of Gunpowder Falls State Park, Baltimore County, MD AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone for the purpose of the third annual Maryland ``Swim For Life'', at the request of the Maryland ``Swim for Life'' Committee of Baltimore, Maryland. The ``Swim for Life'' event will consist of a two and a one half mile swim to be held at the Hammerman area of Gunpowder Falls State Park, Gunpowder River, Maryland. The swim will start at Hammerman area beach number five, to the Maxwell Point buoy, thence to Oliver Point buoy and thence to Hammerman area beach numbers one and two. This safety zone is necessary to control small craft and recreational vessel traffic, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters from the hazards associated with this swimming event. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation will be effective from 7 a.m. June 18, 1994 to 1 p.m. June 18, 1994 with an alternate date of June 19, 1994, encompassing the same time frame. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore, Custom House, 40 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202&hyph;4022, (410) 962&hyph;2651. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 13, 1994 a notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 17507) requesting comments on this event. As of May 13, 1994, which was the closure of the comment period, no comments were received. Since the Coast Guard wanted to provide the public the opportunity to make comments, insufficient time was left to provide for an effective date 30 days after publication, therefore this regulation will become effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Background and Purpose In November, 1993, an application was received by U.S. Coast Guard Group Baltimore from the Maryland Swim For Life Committee, requesting a safety zone for the ``Swim For Life'' event. This event is to be held in the Hammerman area of Gunpowder Falls State Park, Gunpowder River, Maryland, on June 18, 1994. As part of their application, the ``Swim For Life'' Committee requested the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial traffic during the swimming portion of the event. Discussion of Regulations This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of spectator craft, recreational vessels as well as the swimmers participating in the event, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during the event. Since the Gunpowder River will not be closed for an extended period, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted. This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, project officer for the Captain of the Port, Baltimore, Maryland and Lieutenant Monica Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the Small Entities Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
