"We are facing the final time limit," the tax bureau official said in a brief exchange with reporters after Monday's talks failed. The comment came after the coalition party leaders left the negotiation table without agreeing on the key issue of how to finance the proposed tax cuts of 6 trillion yen. Due to lingering political wrangling over the tax issue, the release of the next year's tax reform outline has already been postponed from Tuesday, as originally scheduled. It is not technically impossible to announce the tax outline on Wednesday, if a consensus is reached at resumed talks Tuesday, the official said. But he added that it has become "very difficult" to do so in view of the likely revisions in the original tax proposal by the Tax Commission, the official said. The commission, an advisory body to the prime minister, recommended in a report presented to him last November linking a tax cut with a tax hike to finance it in a single law. A further delay in outlining the next year's tax reform would affect political and economic schedules that follow, including the government's announcement of Japan's economic growth target for fiscal 1994, formation of the Finance Ministry's draft budget for the year and the Japan-U.S summit in Washington on Friday, the official said.
