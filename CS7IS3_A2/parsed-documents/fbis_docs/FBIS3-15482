Spy Operated Since 1986." [Text] Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent learned yesterday from sources close to Russian counterintelligence some details about the Russian SMM defense concern employee, arrested by the counterintelligence organs, who had passed on secret military information to British special services. It became known in particular that the man suspected of spying since 1986 is Vadim Sintsov, director of an SMM administration. According to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, he was detained with his partner, Mikhaylov. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the detained man, Vadim Sintsov, used to be in charge of an administration in the USSR Defense Industry Ministry. Following the collapse of the ministries catering to defense, he joined the SMM concern as head of one of the directorates for foreign economic cooperation. His former colleagues in the concern characterize Sintsov as an extremely sociable staffer. Besides, according to one of his former colleagues, Sintsov was fluent in English, knew computer technology well, and was brilliantly conversant in the ways of the Russian armaments and military hardware market. Yevgeniy Pershikov, SMM deputy president, in a talk with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent confirmed that the English spy detained by the counterintelligence service had worked for the concern, and was in charge of a directorate for foreign economic relations. He stressed, however, that the SMM concern does not possess any classified materials: "We have not had classified materials for two years; even our first departments have been closed down." Pershikov is confident that even if Sintsov was indeed engaged in spying, he was doing so outside the concern. That the detained man is precisely Vadim Sintsov was neither confirmed nor denied to your correspondent at the Federal Counterintelligence Service press center. A press service officer explained that the English spy case is being investigated by the military procuracy. Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent turned to the head of a directorate of the Security Council apparatus to determine the size of the damage and the nature of the information that Vadim Sintsov had passed on to British special services. The official said that, to his knowledge, Sintsov showed the greatest activity in 1991 to 1993. However, he said, owing to the fact that no important research and development projects were undertaken by the defense sector at that time, British special services used him in secondary roles: military information coming to English intelligence services was checked up on through him. Besides, Sintsov had no access to either materials on the main defense development projects or to the secret provisions of the military doctrine concerning its military-technology section. "The value of information Sintsov passed on to British special services has been artificially overestimated. At any rate, the comparison to Penkovskiy and Tolkachev is exaggeration," the Security Council apparatus official thinks.
