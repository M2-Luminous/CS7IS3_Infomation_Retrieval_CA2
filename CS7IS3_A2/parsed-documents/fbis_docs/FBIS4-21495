The delegations are led by Bulgaria's Deputy Environment Minister Khristo Dalchev and Romania's State Secretary of the Ministry of Waters, Forestry and Environmental Protection Ioan Jelev [name as received]. Projects on an improvement of the technological and technical condition of industrial facilities and the integrated system of environment monitoring and control in the areas of Silistra and Calarasi, Ruse and Giurgiu, and Nikopol and Turnu Magurele were on the agenda. This is the first in a series of working meetings on a joint programme of environmental protection in the Danube area. The European Commission is ready to assist the Bulgarian-Romanian integrated environment programme in the shared section of the River Danube, Mr. Dalchev said. He has received a letter from Mr. Alan Mayhew, head of a working group with the commission, who welcomes the memorandum signed in Giurgiu on December 27, 1993 by the Bulgarian and the Romanian environment ministers. Mr. Mayhew was expressly informed of the Ruse meeting of the mixed commission and believes that it would be useful for the sides to agree on a way in which the process of bilateral cooperation would be facilitated with the help of the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme. Mr. Mayhew suggests future trilateral meetings between representatives of Bulgaria, Romania and the Commission. Mr. Dalchev said that he was not only inspired with hope by this first EU reaction to the memorandum but was also confident of positive results in the future.
