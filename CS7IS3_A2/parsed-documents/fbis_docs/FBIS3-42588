This will require money. And a lot of it. The share of capital investment in Russian nonferrous metallurgy comprises about 4 percent of the total investment in industry, while the proportional capital intensity of producing a tonne of various metals fluctuates between 800,000 and 1.2 million rubles [R]. This is greater than the same value abroad, because we use poorer raw materials, place enterprises in undeveloped regions with difficult access, and so on. Besides, nonferrous metallurgy (especially its ore base) also is a high-inertia sector, where the investment cycle stretches up to 16 years (up to 10 years abroad). The need to develop nonferrous metallurgy under the extremely difficult conditions of a transition to market relations assumes the following investment policy priorities (see diagram) [diagram not reproduced]: --increasing investment in the development of the raw material base, including greater investment in nonferrous metallurgy reprocessing, since scrap and waste are important components of the raw material balance; --increasing the share of new construction in the total volume of investment; --increasing investment in the development of nonferrous metallurgy in the Far North, Siberian, and Urals regions; --stabilizing the share of investment (at the level of at least 50 percent) for reconstruction and technical modernization of nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, while at the same time increasing the share of capital investment going into creating competitive products and increasing the environmental safety of production. The chronic shortage of capital investment in the development of nonferrous metallurgy over the past 10 years and the diminished share of investment into the raw material base (from 40-45 percent in the 1970's to 35 percent in the beginning of 1990's) have brought this base into a critical condition. Development of new deposits is being delayed; anticipatory construction has been sharply curtailed; construction in progress has been suspended on number of objects. Taking into account the raw material orientation of nonferrous metallurgy, for which the strengthening of the ore base is possible mainly through construction of new mining and processing enterprises (frequently based on mineral deposits located in sparsely populated areas of Siberia and the Far East), the share of the raw material component in the total investment must be increased to 45-50 percent. The Federal Program of Development of the Raw Material Base for Nonferrous Metallurgy for 1993-1995 envisaged investing R4.9 billion (in 1991 prices) in the development of priority objects of the ore base. The disintegration of the USSR, which has led to a disruption of production ties in nonferrous metallurgy, has created extreme difficulties in keeping many Russian metallurgical enterprises supplied with raw materials that were traditionally mined in other republics of the former Union. This requires new construction of not only mining but also of some metallurgical capacities in order to organize production of items whose manufacture in Russia had been limited. Reconstruction and technical modernization of enterprises along the entire production chain in nonferrous metallurgy and reduction of ecological hazards of this production remain an important direction of investment policy. The share of this part in the total investment must be preserved at the level of 52 percent. It is envisaged that the bulk of capital investment (more than 70 percent) is to be used in the base raw material subsectors--aluminum, copper, lead and zinc, and tungsten and molybdenum. This reflects the existing ratios of industrial construction and is necessitated both by the large scale of these productions and by their high efficiency, as well as the fact that these subsectors' enterprises (especially mining) are located predominantly in regions that have difficult access and are not well developed, and where capital intensity of production is 2.5-3.5 times higher than that in the European part of Russia. Implementation of the measures envisaged by the draft Federal Program of Technical Modernization and Development of Russian Metallurgy (1993-2000) will require capital investment in the amount of R14.9518 billion (in 1991 prices) and $3.2052 billion (see diagram) [diagram not reproduced]. It is envisaged that investment will come from enterprises (stockholders), private capital, budget financing, and foreign capital. In carrying out the privatization program, capital from issuing stock should become the main source of financing. A potential volume of investment from this source is estimated at the level of 30-33 percent of the total volume of investment in 1993-1995. In the future, as more nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are denationalized, the share of stockholder capital may increase to 60-70 percent. The sphere that may attract private capital, which should account for 3-5 percent, includes nonferrous metallurgy reprocessing, certain metalworking productions, and development of rich mineral deposits with insignificant content of ores. Investment from attracting foreign investors money and creating on this basis transnational-type companies is estimated to account for 5 percent. It should be emphasized that development of such a sector as nonferrous metallurgy, which operates in objectively difficult conditions necessitated by proximity to natural resources, cannot and should not evolve without state protectionism--budget financing. The share of state money in the investment in nonferrous metallurgy development is envisaged at the level of 25-27 percent, which corresponds to foreign practices where state subsidies comprise about 25 percent of the total investment volume. Implementation of measures envisaged in the federal program will ensure a more balanced and effective development of nonferrous metallurgy as a whole, liquidating disproportion between the main segments of the production chain, progressive changes in terms of enterprise location and product nomenclature, less dependence on importing raw materials and components, and increased effectiveness in export operations. It is expected that annual savings by the year 2000 will amount to more than R890 billion, including R270 billion from setting up production that will replace imports, and about R60 billion from increased effectiveness of imports. A return on capital investment is expected in seven years.
