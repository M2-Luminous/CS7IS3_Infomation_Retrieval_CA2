About 40 percent of the total population of Macedonia are ethnic Albanians (the official figure is 21 percent). 2. Ever since it gained its independence, this state has been operating as an ethnic state of only the Macedonian (Slavo-Macedonian) people in all segments of decisionmaking, both in the highest state institutions and in other institutions of the economy, culture, media, etc. 3. Albanian deputies are outnumbered and outvoted in the parliament of Macedonia since there is no consensual decisionmaking. This resulted in the approval of the Constitution and of many laws that placed the Albanian population in a discriminatory position, especially in the fields of education, culture, privatization of capital, the media, the status of citizens, etc. The government is completely centralized and concentrated into central organs while, in reality, there is no local government. 5. In cities in which Albanians are the majority population, the administration intentionally complicates the procedures for getting simple documents. A person has to wait for weeks to get a birth certificate. 6. The law on citizenship in Macedonia proclaimed about 100,000 Albanians as stateless persons, through no fault of their own, by applying the condition of 15 years of uninterrupted residence in the country as a basic condition for citizenship. 7. The last elections were discriminatory. For example, the electoral constituency of an Albanian deputy had an average of 8,000 voters while the constituency of a Macedonian deputy had 4,000 voters. Now they are intending to hold new elections with only cosmetic changes of the same laws. 8. Albanians are not allowed to have their mother tongue as the language of instruction in higher education, while only 2.8 percent of the Albanians are studying in Macedonian universities, where Macedonian is the language of instruction. 9. The structures of the central and local government and of the judiciary are ethnically pure or have token Albanians, while more than 300 Albanian lawyers in Macedonia are looking for work. 10. An Albanian party (the Party for Democratic Prosperity) took part in the coalition government with five ministers out of a desire to contribute to correcting the situation, but it was determined that the Republic of Macedonia just used them as window dressing for the international community. This failure caused serious problems for the party and it split into two parts. This radicalism is to the advantage of all. 11. The present government blames the lack of changes on the Macedonian radicalism of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian Unity] party (the ethnic Macedonian party). But the government did not mobilize the resources under its control to change the anti-Albanian attitude. 12. The present government blames the previous government for fact that Albanians are not included in the government structures, but this does not explain why the new areas which are being established in this country, such as diplomacy, continue to be set up on a single-nationality basis. Many findings have been presented in the reports of various international and governmental associations, including the report to the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which was held in mid-February of this year. Therefore, we think that it is a juridical, moral, and humanitarian necessity for this issue to be considered as one of the primary issues for the maintenance of peace and security in the region. The People's Democratic Party believes that conditions should be set for the admission of Macedonia to the CSCE; that is, the FYROM Government should be obliged to enter into principled political discussions with the Albanian side through the intermediary of the CSCE, for the purpose of creating constitutional-juridical conditions for the achievement of real ethnic equality in the FYROM", says the Position Statement of the Leadership of the People's Democratic Party which was sent to the Ministerial Council of the CSCE in Prague.
