What will be at stake in the second round will be the Socialists' ability to win an absolute majority in Parliament, something which the Free Democrats see as undesirable, Kuncze said. He was happy to see extremists squeezed out of Parliament. SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that an agreement between the four liberal parties (SZDSZ, Federation of Young Democrats, Entrepreneurs' Party, Agrarian Association) means candidates will withdraw from the second round in one another's favour in 13 constituencies. In reply to a question, Peto ruled out talks on mutual withdrawals with the MDF.
