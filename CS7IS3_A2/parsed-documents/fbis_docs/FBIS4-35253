Describing any move to lift the arms embargo as a blow to peace, Clinton stressed that the United States has to work in harmony with its allies to end the war in that country. According to political observers, President Clinton's views have brought to light the conflicting approaches of U.S. officials on the fighting in Bosnia. The political observers are convinced that the reason for their conflicting approaches is that they care more about their country's vital interests in the Balkans than the fate of Bosnia's Islamic people. The U.S. Administration has disclosed in the past that the United States does not wish to intervene in the Balkan region because it does not have vital interests in that part of the world. However, it moved to support the Islamic people in Bosnia to create vital interests for itself when the fighting spread in that country. Obviously, Washington was aware that the Serbs are Russia's traditional allies. It was also aware that the Croat people sided with Germany. Therefore, Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most appropriate door to the Balkan region. However, the United States was unable to effectively support the Bosnian people. Consequently, it tried to support them only through propaganda statements, without moving to seriously intervene in the war. Clinton's disclosures indicate that the White House officials do not wish to help Bosnia's people regain their country. Instead, they prefer to deceive them to create the conditions they need to strengthen Washington's position in that country. They also prefer to maintain their special relations with Britain, Russia, and France. Understanding why Clinton has ignored the U.S. Senate's ostentatious wish to have the arms embargo on Bosnia's Islamic people lifted will be easier when all that is considered. Furthermore, it has become obvious that Washington does not want Bosnia's Islamic people to defend themselves against the merciless Serbian attacks.
