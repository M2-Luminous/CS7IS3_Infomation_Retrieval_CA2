This in turn has generated great tensions that endanger the necessary unity of Sandinists, tensions that could clearly lead to a breakup having disastrous consequences for members, the party, and the country. Such a rupture would only reaffirm the current party chiefs' inability to exercise leadership strong enough to unite members despite their diversity, a revolutionary trait. It would lead the FSLN into the same situation in which all parties that have existed throughout our political history have found themselves and with the same faults and ills. The course of internal discussion alarms us as a faction, just as it alarms all Sandinists. Two phenomena that both support and complement one another lie at the root of these confrontations: 1--First of all, bossism has gradually taken root in Sandinism, replacing the old collective leadership and attempting to deny any new leadership. This is antidemocratic by definition and in no way able to support necessary changes within the party, particularly those having to do with the deepening of party democracy. 2--In addition, one faction within Sandinism opposes renewal, deems violent methods valid, defended "the ticket" at the First Congress, continues to support democratic centralism--however obsolete--and provides the fundamental mainstay of bossism. Discredit and exclusion have been the favorite methods of such comrades, and anyone who does not think as they do is considered a traitor to the Sandinist cause. The latest verbal attacks from members of the faction are aimed precisely at vetoing any renewal of the party and the alternative of a new party and national leadership. The approach constitutes an attack on the necessary unity of Sandinism, which depends upon the following: 1) that personal aspirations within the party are valid for all members, not just part of them; 2) that bossism has been extremely detrimental throughout the history of Nicaragua, for which reason we must banish it from the FSLN; 3) that diversity of Sandinist thought is the basis of its revolutionary principles; and 4) that transparent, high-minded methods are absolutely necessary and irreplaceable. We Sandinists for the National Program reaffirm once more our commitment to renewal and the democratization of the FSLN. Consequently, we clearly condemn the verbal attacks launched against the Sandinist bench and Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We are issuing an urgent appeal to maintain debate within the confines of decency, on a high plain, and with respect for personal dignity and ideas. Sandinists for the National Coordinating Commission Program Francisco de Asis Fernandez, Oscar Tellez, Raul Venerio, Julio Lopez Miranda, Gloria Gabuardi, Orlando Castillo, Antenor Ferrey, Alfredo Alaniz, Carlos Molina Oliu, and Augusto Montealegre.
