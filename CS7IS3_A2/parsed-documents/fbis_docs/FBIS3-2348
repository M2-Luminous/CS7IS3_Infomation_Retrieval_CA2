So far, 19 counties of the province have used aerial seeding on 64,667 hectares, and have seen trees grown on 29,300 hectares, including 15 large stretches of forest each with an area of 667 hectares. With vast areas of arid land and deserts, Gansu only has a forest cover of 3.9 percent, far from the national average of 13.63 percent. Local governments have worked out regulations and set up more than 30 permanent stations for tree management and protection work in areas to conduct regular aerial seeding, in a bid to guarantee the success of the aerial seeding. Aerial seeding, which is said to be cheaper than manual afforestation, has not only helped grow more trees for Gansu, but also helped reduce soil erosion by 80 percent, said local officials, adding that they will grow more trees on more land by way of aerial seeding in the coming years.
