Mr Churin said he will discuss the issue with the Vietnamese Government during his short visit to Vietnam early next month. He said he has asked the Intellectual Property Department to draw up a structure of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, China, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. Cooperation between countries of the region is needed because trade between them will expand, and the problems of violation of patents, copyrights and trademarks need to be tackled. As a first step, Thailand is expected to cooperate with each country bilaterally before expanding operations across the region. Thailand can help Vietnam in patent registration procedures, in which the Thai side is more experienced. The other countries will have the same or different cooperation agreements depending on their respective economies. Concerning local protection of copyright works, Mr Churin said the Government may apply the Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly Act of 1979, which requests that tapes, compact discs and videotape producers submit costs of production to the Internal Trade Department for use as a basis for considering whether producers have taken advantage of consumers. Mr Churin said the Economic Crime Investigation Division has reported that the crackdown on infringement of copyright works in February increased 27 percent from January, and 21,043 pieces of illegal copyright works were seized. The Singapore-based representative of the Motion Picture Exports Association of America, who recently visited Thailand, reported that violations of copyright laws were fewer in the first two months of the year.
