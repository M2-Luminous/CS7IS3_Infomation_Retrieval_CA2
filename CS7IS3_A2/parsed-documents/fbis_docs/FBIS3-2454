Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Li Luye, the spokesman, said that the second session of the CPPCC Eighth National Committee to be opened tomorrow will be convened at a time when the country witnesses a robust economic development, political stability, unity of all nationalities and social progress. Reviewing the work of the National Committee over the past year, Li said that CPPCC has played an important role in promoting exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, steps toward the reunification of China. Answering a question on the ongoing anti-corruption drive in China, Li said that CPPCC has spared no effort to support and participate in the anticorruption drive launched by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council. Members of the CPPCC National Committee formed six groups, which conducted corruption-related investigations together with relevant departments of the State Council, the spokesman said. Zhao Weizhi, deputy secretary-general of the National Committee, answered a question about revision of the CPPCC Constitution. Revision of the existing Constitution, which was adopted in 1982, is being guided by the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and aims at its convergence with the amended Constitution of the People's Republic of China, he said.
