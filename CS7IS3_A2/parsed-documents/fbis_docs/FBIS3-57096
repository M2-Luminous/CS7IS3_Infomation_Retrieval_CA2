Lawmakers decided to examine at 14:00 the draft of a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia. As Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced, a report would be made by Sergey Lavrov, a deputy foreign minister since the First Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin had not returned from Yugoslavia yet. Lawmaker Vyacheslav Marychev (St. Petersburg, the Liberal Democratic Party) requested debates on the resumption of the TV feature entitled "Parliamentary Hour." His request was met. Marychev criticized media, above all TV, for their coverage of Duma discussions. At LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's demand, the Duma will return to the issue on the make-up of the parliamentary committee on geo-politics. It is the only committee whose composition has not been endorsed by the Duma so far. Most legislators are displeased with the fact that of the 13 committee members, 9 are LDP officials. Lawmakers disapproved a motion to elect a fifth vice-speaker from among the members, elected in one-mandate constituencies.
