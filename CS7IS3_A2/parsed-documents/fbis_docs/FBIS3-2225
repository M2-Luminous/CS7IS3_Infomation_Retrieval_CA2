Shattuck also warned that the action taken by the Chinese authorities over the past few days had cast a pall over Secretary of State Warren Christopher's forthcoming visit to China. It was on the same day that Shattuck released his statement that the Chinese authorities detained two more former Beijing student movement leaders, namely, Zhai Weimin and Ma Shaofang. An informed source in Beijing revealed that Zhai Weimin, a student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was detained by the police yesterday afternoon and his whereabouts are unknown. Another student leader, Ma Shaofang, was stopped and detained by the police in Tianjin, enroute Beijing, and then sent back to Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province under escort. A friend of Zhai Weimin said Zhai, who came to Beijing from his home province, Henan, was picked up by some policemen near the Qinghua University campus in Beijing's Haidian District around 1440 yesterday. His whereabouts are still not known. His friend estimates that there are two possibilities: Like the case of Wang Dan some days ago, Zhai Weimin may be released in a couple of days after being warned by the police; or he may be sent back to his home province of Henan under escort. AFP quoted a friend of Zhai as saying that the incident took place when the 26-year-old Zhai was walking with a child along a street near Qinghua University. A red Volkswagen Santana suddenly arrived and four policemen got out of the car and picked him up. Meanwhile, according to one of Ma Shaofang's friends, Ma originally planned to arrive in Beijing on 3 March from his home province of Jiangsu but he has not yet shown up in Beijing. A phone call from Ma's family yesterday said he had been stopped and detained by the Jiangsu provincial police a few days ago in Tianjin on his way to Beijing and he had been brought back to Nanjing by the police. What is going to happen to him is still unknown. Zhai Weimin and Ma Shaofang are the 12th and 13th dissidents detained by the authorities in Beijing and Shanghai over the past four days. Some of the detained dissidents have been released, among whom are Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan. Wei Jingsheng met with Shattuck, a senior U.S. State Department official who was visiting China to make preparations for Christopher's China mission. But, while Shattuck was still in China, Wei Jingsheng was detained for 24 hours and then released. The official XINHUA News Agency yesterday released a statement saying that Wei Jingsheng was summoned by the police according to the law because of his violation of parole regulations. An informed source from the Beijing Municipality Public Security Bureau said the few democratic activists' being summoned for interrogation over the past few days had little link with the convening of the National People's Congress session and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee session but, rather, is related to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to China later this week. The authorities concerned intend to warn democratic activists not to "speak carelessly" during Christopher's visit to Beijing. [passage omitted] The dissidents who were taken away by the police over the past four days are Zhai Weimin, Ma Shaofang, Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, Xu Wenli, Bao Ge, Yang Zhou, Yang Jingheng, Dai Xuezhong, Ma Wei, and Gong Xingnan. It has been confirmed that Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, Xu Wenli, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou are among those who have already been released after detention.
