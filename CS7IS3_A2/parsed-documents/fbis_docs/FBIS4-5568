He condemned this as another premeditated act of treachery to expand overseas the present-day North-South confrontation which they have carried into extremes and thereby create a more serious national antagonism and impair the ever growing prestige of the DPRK and the might of its singlehearted unity. At "the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly" on March 30 the South Korean authorities reportedly brought up the "human rights" of the DPRK's lumbermen and impudently blared that "a fact-finding team" would be sent to Russia. They went so far as to say that they would induce the DPRK's lumbermen to "defect" to South Korea, getting them recognized as "refugees" through the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The statement says: It is clear to anyone that such "human rights problem" as the South Korean authorities described has never existed and can never exist for our lumbermen. Under our anthropocentric socialist system the human rights of the people from all walks of life are fully ensured legally and institutionally. Our lumbermen too are guaranteed a free and happy life like in the homeland, though they are working in an alien land. Each of them enjoys a true political life and adequate material and cultural life. They live a stable life, engaged in normal production activities pursuant to our labour law and the law of the Russian Federation. This notwithstanding, the South Korean ruling quarters are insolent enough to mock at and provoke the dignity and human rights of our workers. This impudent behavior is a shameless interference in the internal affairs of our republic and a criminal act that cannot be permitted under the international law. Unjustifiable and unpardonable is the insidious attempt of the South Korean authorities to create a new national discord and aggravate the North-South confrontation by inventing the "human rights problem" of our lumbermen at a time when the national concord must be promoted by transcending the difference in idea, ideology and system and an independent and peaceful reunification of the country be accelerated through the great unity of the whole nation. If the South Korean authorities send "a fact-finding team" to do harm to our workers who are engaged in creative production activities in an alien land for the socialist motherland, or launch into an unjustifiable "defection work" among them, we will decisively counter it. And we will never tolerate any country or international organization joining the South Korean authorities in their criminal intrigues. Should any other country or international organization join the South Korean authorities in their reckless act, it would extremely complicate things and entail irretrievable, grave consequences would. [sentence as received] In case some of our lumbermen now in the far eastern region should disappear in the days ahead, we will consider that the responsibility entirely rests with the South Korean authorities and that they kidnapped our workers, motivated by their sinister political purpose, and will immediately take a decisive countermeasure.
