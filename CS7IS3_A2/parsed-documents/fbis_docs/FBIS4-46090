FBIS4-46090 "jptnd013___94002" JPRS-TND-94-013 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 30 May 1994 AFRICA SOUTH AFRICA Draft Document on Arms Industry Released Draft Document on Arms Industry Released MB3005170794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1602 GMT 30 May 94 MB3005170794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 30 SAPA -- A draft document approved by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as the basis for a national policy for the defence industry was released in Johannesburg on Monday. The draft policy was produced by the TEC's sub-council on defence and approved by the TEC in April as the basis for the government's defence industry policy. The document says that because the defence industry is one of the country's major assets "it would not be in the national interest to totally discard it". However, the new defence industry policy should be seen within broader political and moral considerations as part of the general industrial policy for manufacturing in South Africa. The draft document calls for retention of some of the defence industry's capabilities for military and security application, but also proposes diversification and conversion to meet civilian market needs. A diversification council has been recommended to encourage this. According to the proposals, no new industry establishment, through state funding, should be undertaken where capabilities already exist in the public or private sector. Central to the new defence policy is the retention of research and development spending at the current level of R[rand]420 million a year. Unless the expenditure is maintained the industry will lose its technological edge and much of its design and development capabilities, the working document states. A joint management system has been recommended for technology development and to co-ordinate long-term planning of all military research and development. The draft proposals say the state should encourage industry to invest in defence research and development. Turning to an arms trade policy, the proposal includes the development by the Defence Ministry and the approval by a parliamentary defence sub-committee of guidelines regarding customers of conventional armaments. A list of recipient countries should be approved by a cabinet committee. Armaments should be sold only to recognised governments and not to guerrilla or other movements, the document proposes. It also says South Africa should refrain from trading in weapons of mass destruction, while the present system of arms trade control should be rationalised. The Defence Ministry should control all arms exports and imports and related technology transfers on behalf of the government. Wherever possible, South Africa should reveal the type of products it sells and who its clients are by contributing to the United Nations conventional arms registers --provided trading partners approve of such disclosures. According to the proposals, South Africa should no longer strive for complete self-sufficiency in arms, as this is neither affordable nor necessary. In certain areas the policy should be to purchase overseas, in others to procure on a competitive basis, while in strategic areas limited self-sufficiency should be maintained. Turning to the acquisition of defence systems, equipment and services, the working group recommended the Defence Ministry should be responsible for planning and budgeting for the SA [South African] National Defence Force. Certain regulatory and policy-making functions currently performed by Armscor should also be handled by the ministry. The draft also proposes greater transparency and accountability to parliament, the public and to the auditor-general. Speaking at a news briefing in a Johannesburg hotel, Dr Andre Buys, the convenor of the TEC working group that produced the proposals, stressed the document was merely a draft. It was being submitted to an open, public debate where it should be considered in terms of South Africa's security, socio-economic and industrial policy requirements. This was a move away from past policy-making behind closed doors, he said. "We are inviting criticism and debate in the spirit of democracy," Dr Buys said.
