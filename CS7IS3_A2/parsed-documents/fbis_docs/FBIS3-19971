After a three-hour meeting, Kurt Schelter, state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry, said on Wednesday [23 March] evening that organizations replacing the banned PKK should be monitored and prevented with all suitable means. Prosecution of the perpetrators is to concentrate on PKK ringleaders; demonstrations and marches are to be documented in detail; and proceedings for determining membership in a terrorist organization are to be instituted. In addition, labor exchange bureaus and trade supervisory authorities should search for people working illegally in order to deprive the PKK of its areas of retreat, Schelter said. All vandals should be deported, if possible. The laender interior minister called on the Federal Government to ask Ankara to make sure that those deported do not face death penalties, torture, or inhuman treatment. The laender governed by the Social Democratic Party spoke out for halting German arms supplies to Turkey. Bavaria demanded a broader definition of breach of the public peace. This offense should also be laid down as a compelling reason for deportation in the law regarding foreigners.
