Speaking after the meeting of the National Council this morning, President Kliridhis said that the Greek Cypriot side should not celebrate about the Butrus-Ghali report because a report is not a solution of the Cyprus issue. However, he described the UN secretary general's position -- that efforts to solve the Cyprus issue have gone on for years but have not produced results because the Turkish side does not have the political will -- as very positive. President Kliridhis said that during the National Council meeting today, there was a very good discussion which will continue Wednesday [8 June] after the political parties discuss the whole issue in their respective committees. The president said that during the meeting, he made suggestions to the parties and then a discussion followed. He said that before we go to Athens for discussions, we will decide what line we will follow, but we will not announce any decisions that we make here. Asked when the political leadership will go to Athens for talks, the president said the trip would take place after the 12 June elections for European Parliament. It should be noted that immediately following the National Council meeting, the president received Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis, whom he briefed about the Council's meeting. The National Council meeting was attended by Ioannis Matsis and Alekos Markidhis on behalf of the Democratic Rally [DISI], Dhimitrios Khristofias and Andreas Khristou on behalf of AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People], Spiros Kiprianou and Tasos Papadhopoulos on behalf of DIKO [Democratic Party], and Vasos Lissaridhis and Takis Khatzidhimistriou on behalf of EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]. The meeting was also attended by House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, and Ioannis Kasoulidhis, deputy minister to President Pandelis Kouros and government spokesman.
