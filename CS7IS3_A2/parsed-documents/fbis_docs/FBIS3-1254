It is equally important to change one's mentality and act in accordance with the concepts of democracy. It is important to admit that others too have the capacity to think like them (members of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]). Jose Massinga says he has not observed any change in Frelimo. "Their heads are still full of communist concepts and they still think they are the only thinking human beings in this country," he said. A clear example of this was observed during the "multiparty" talks when the Frelimo government showed its usual arrogance. [passage omitted] Jose Chicuara Massinga was a Frelimo militant from the first days of its founding, in 1962, until 1981 when he was arrested together with a number of officers from the Mozambique Armed Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, accused of being a CIA agent. Asked to give his version of events, Massinga denied having at any time spied for the CIA. After the investigations it was noted that none of the prisoners had links with South Africa, hence the CIA story was invented to implicate Dr. Massinga, who had American friends working in Mozambique. "They made it a big story, since they controlled all the news media, and the system then did not allow a person to defend himself," he said. Jose Massinga said: "The inconsistency lies in the fact that the people who accused me of being a CIA agent survive, along with their regime, partly because of the money from the United States, which owns the CIA that `tormented' them. It is, therefore, correct to ask who the CIA agent is: me or them?" Massinga said that, after making up this story, Frelimo confiscated all his property, notably his house, car, and clothes. He is currently living with his niece, who gave him a room, while he is waiting for his confiscated property to be returned.
