They contain specific information on the current state of our environment. They cite data on the amount of harmful substances discharged into the atmosphere, the pollution of soil and drinking water sources, and the radiation situation. The compilation of these reports is painstaking work performed every year by environmental experts and specialists. The Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources recently published the latest State Report for 1992. In the preface to it, Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan acknowledges that the state of the environment in Russia as a whole is unsatisfactory: The atmosphere, water, and soil are still being heavily polluted with gaseous, liquid, and solid waste from industry and consumers alike. Moreover, as one should expect, the general slump in output has not led to a similar reduction in pollution, as enterprises in crisis have begun to cut environmental protection costs. Thus the economic situation in the country is aggravating the environmental situation. The facts cited in this document are not for those of a nervous disposition. The volume of polluting substances discharged into the atmosphere from stationary sources in Russia alone amounts to 28.2 million tonnes. Highly toxic cyanides, arsenic, fluorides, and heavy metal oxides are spewed from these "volcanoes." Their emissions exceed the maximum permissible concentration in the air basin of 171 cities. In Chita, Taganrog, Lipetsk, Bratsk, and Ulyanovsk -- in fact, a total of 44 industrial centers in Russia -- the atmospheric pollution index has reached a level dangerous to the health of millions of people. With one-quarter of the world's fresh water resources concentrated in Lake Baykal, we are contriving to pollute these crystal-clear waters with toxins from outmoded pulp and paper combines. The fabled lake's own mechanism of biological self-purification is on the brink of collapse. What then can one say about ordinary reservoirs? In 1992, 39 percent of all untreated sewage flowing into Russia's rivers was discharged into the Volga basin alone. Due to economic difficulties, the use of pesticides in agriculture fell from 150,000 tonnes in the eighties to 100,000 tonnes in 1992. But supporters of the green movement have no cause to celebrate. Russia uses tens, if not hundreds of different types of toxic chemicals banned in the countries where they are produced, but with a market here because of their low price. They are extremely toxic. Moreover, these toxins have the ability to accumulate in the soil for long periods of time. Analysis shows that soil in Moscow Oblast and Irkutsk Oblast still contains DDT, banned many years ago. We will not try to explain what all these "curies" and other units for measuring radiation levels mean. For the majority of people, these scientific terms mean nothing, but their lives are no easier for all that. As of January 1993, the territory polluted with radioactive nuclides from Chernobyl -- cesium-137 averaging one to five "curies" per square kilometer -- includes 16 oblasts and Mordovia. A total of 21,861,000 people currently live there, mainly villagers. By law, they are all due state benefits and compensation. But who will guarantee that even these few "curies" will not affect the health of future generations? Once again, it seems, we are going to rely on the Russian "maybe." Wait and see. But will we live to see? Analysis of the information in the State Report allows us to draw the uncomfortable conclusion that all these negative ecological factors put together have led to a serious deterioration in the environment in the main regions where tens of millions of Russians live. Living there is dangerous, and turning a blind eye is criminal. No assurances and entreaties that everything will be better in the future arouse enthusiasm in anyone anymore. We need a long-term, single-minded program of action. From this point of view, we would like to assess the constructiveness of the Russian Presidential Edict "On the State Strategy of the Russian Federation To Protect the Environment and Ensure Steady Development," published in February this year. Is there, for example, any real foundation to the government directive to approve within two months a plan of action to protect the environment in 1994-95? The basic principles of the strategy, in the drafting of which the Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources and the Russian Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety took part, provide for the environmentally sound location and development of industrial and agricultural enterprises; sustainable and rational use of natural resources; protection of the environment in areas of human habitation; the restoration of shattered ecosystems; the utilization of waste; and other urgent measures conducive to improvement of the environment in Russia. The time given to implement the edict is extremely short. There is much to do. Sources of pollution in environmental "hotspots" -- areas where it is simply dangerous to live -- should be eliminated first and foremost. The state must make all the necessary budgetary allocations. There is no alternative when the nation's health is at stake. It is up to the state to call those directly responsible for environmental damage strictly to account. Anyone who breaks the Russian Law on Protection of the Environment must be made to pay. With the transition to market relations, sources of investment in national environmental safety are broadening considerably. The taxpayer is not obliged to pay for someone else's economic mistakes. This also applies to the agro-industrial complex. Any producer -- however vital his product may be -- must be placed in the situation where, because of the risk of being ruined, it is to his disadvantage to engage in economic operations which pollute rivers, soil, or atmosphere. If the environment suffers, do not expect any return. This principle must become mandatory for all. Sometimes, however, this return is within arm's reach. Let us take a specific example. Any poultry plant, apart from anything else, is a major "supplier" of extremely valuable organic fertilizer. With mineral fertilizers expensive and in short supply, it is perfectly realistic to develop the technology of biothermal processing of the droppings, thereby setting up production of poudrette, fertility grains. Progressive private farms are already successfully selling the surplus of this valuable product to farms and kitchen gardens both here and abroad at a considerable profit. At present, however, toxic waste from big state poultry plants continues to pollute underground springs and rivers, for which fines are paid amidst cries of being on the brink of closure because of the high price of mixed feed. The economic principle must form the basis of the mechanism for the use of natural resources in our country. It is naive to assume that the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources is solely responsible for instilling order in this respect. It certainly is not a departmental matter: It is a matter of state. The time for debates and discussions on the methods and approaches to deciding upon a strategy of national environmental salvation is long gone. It is time to act! There is a scientific term: Survival. It concerns all living beings, man included. People, like any other creature on this planet, need clean air, unpolluted water, and good soil -- a source of food. Russia's citizens have a constitutional right to a decent environment. This must not be forgotten in the face of future generations.
