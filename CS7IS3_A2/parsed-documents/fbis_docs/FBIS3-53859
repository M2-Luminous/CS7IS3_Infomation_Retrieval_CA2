In light of the atmosphere of hope and optimism which has begun to prevail in the country, the General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC] would like to extend its warmest congratulations to the lofty Yemeni masses on the occasion of the signing, in heroic Aden today, of a document of pledge and accord to build a modern Yemeni state by parties to the Political Forces Dialogue. The GPC considers this step a crowning of the sincere national efforts to put a decisive end to the political crisis and its regrettable repercussions, which have negatively reflected on the lives of the citizens and harmed the homeland's interests and stability. Hence, the GPC's General Committee welcomes the positive results that have been achieved and stresses its adherence to the contents of the Document of Pledge and Accord. It, along with all the forces of goodwill in the country, hopes that this approved national step will be the beginning of a translation and achievement of all the aspirations of our people. These aspirations include maintaining the unity of the homeland and reinforcing the pluralistic democratic experiment; building the modern Yemeni state--the state of law and order--as well as the constitutional institutions founded on justice, democracy, and respect for human rights; entrenching the bases of local government which are based on administrative and financial decentralization; seeking to alleviate the suffering of the citizens and securing their daily life requirements; and achieving a cultural awakening in modern Yemen. Moreover, the GPC also expresses its deep appreciation for the Political Forces Dialogue Committee for its extensive efforts and the formidable difficulties it faced to achieve this document, which is an obligating pledge or (?contract) for everyone. It is a document that should be adhered to and put into practice by everyone to shoulder his responsibility to achieve what is contained in this document as far as implementation mechanisms and timetables are concerned. The GPC continues to be loyal to Yemen and its people and is concerned about unity, democracy, and national accord. It has been guided by wisdom and patience in order to remove all the dangers and challenges facing this homeland. Moreover, throughout the crisis, the GPC's stands have been marked by national responsibility, good sense, and self-restraint. It strongly refused to be drawn into the perils of escalation which harms the homeland and its unity, the democratic formula, and the citizens' interests. Hence, the GPC announces that it will not hesitate to exert every effort and join hands with all those who are concerned about Yemen--the Yemen of unity and democracy--in order to triumph for the issues of the homeland and the people, to practically implement all agreements, and to move our homeland toward a better and prosperous future in fulfillment of all our people's aspirations and ambitions of progress, growth, and prosperity under the banner of unity, democracy, and peace. Issued by the GPC's General Committee.
