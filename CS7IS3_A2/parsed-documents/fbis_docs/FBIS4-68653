It is necessary to introduce the status of PERSONS EQUATED TO CITIZENS of Russia in order to ensure that this responsibility be discharged. Individuals who are deprived of an opportunity to become citizens of their country of residence or do not wish to do so for a particular reason, but who in view of circumstances have not applied to become citizens of Russia, should enjoy the protection and patronage of Russia and the rights of citizens of Russia, except for the right to participate in elections to organs of state power, the right to a proportion of privatized property in Russia, and probably certain other rights. The status of persons equated to citizens shall cease automatically once citizenship arrangements are made (the person opts for a particular citizenship). (...) 2. First of all, it is necessary to strive to sign agreements on dual citizenship with all states-former republics of the USSR. In the event of becoming dual citizens, the Law on Protection of Russian Citizens and Persons Equated to Them Abroad would apply to this category of persons. However, the patronage of Russia should apply to a broader community of people, that is, those who have become citizens of the new state and who do not have an opportunity to obtain a second, Russian citizenship. Direct legal protection and other protection for such people will be quite justifiably viewed as interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. In this case, Russia can only proceed from the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and see to it that human rights are upheld in all countries regardless of a person's cultural or ethnic affiliation, origin, and citizenship. (...) Russia must look for a way to provide economic support for both the Russian-language educational system in the new foreign countries and the development of the cultural life of the Russian-speaking population. To this end, provisions should be made for preferential procedures for receiving education at the colleges of Russia (citizens and equivalent individuals should receive an education in Russia on the same terms as citizens permanently residing in Russia). It is necessary to develop a program for scientific and cultural exchanges and training in production, as well as a program for investment in the educational system abroad. (...) Russia should also facilitate the self-organization of the Russian-speaking population by encouraging, for example, the creation of national-cultural societies, supporting the creation of economic structures affiliated with such societies, and granting customs or other preferences to such structures. In this case, the "titular" population would also be interested in the preservation and development of such enterprises and, consequently, in support for the Russian-speaking population. 3. Joint ventures in which the Russian-speaking population would become the main partner from the side of the new states must become a particularly important form of support for the Russian-speaking population abroad. It would be necessary to invest state funds in such enterprises, including the property of Russia abroad, and to provide incentives for capital investment by nonstate enterprises of Russia. The creation of trilateral companies in which enterprises from the traditional foreign countries would appear as the third side could be the least painful path. It is also possible to support joint Russian-foreign enterprises, whose cofounders from the traditional foreign countries (for example, France) would create mixed companies in the new foreign countries (for example, French-Estonian companies). Protection of the Russian population is not provided by way of economic pressure or blockades of countries behaving in an uncivilized manner but rather by way of developing cooperation that provides an incentive for the proper attitude of the government toward the Russian-speaking community. 4. The above points have referred solely to the Russian-speaking population. However, it is necessary to also support the same measures for the ethnic groups of residents of Russia that have preserved their national originality, for example, Chechens in Kazakhstan. Germans, Meskhetian Turks, and Crimean Tatars--ethnic groups whose destiny has been associated with the forced resettlement of the 1940's--should also be supported. In carrying out this program it is necessary to take into account the fact that a large number of people coming from the new foreign countries whose national and cultural interests are not satisfied reside on the territory of Russia. Improvements in the area of upholding the rights of ethnic minorities in Russia should be an integral part of the program of support for the Russian-speaking population abroad. This approach will testify to the sincerity of Russia and will deflect the charges that Russia is exploiting the slogan of upholding human rights for political purposes.
