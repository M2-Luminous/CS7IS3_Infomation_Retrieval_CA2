Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and foreign minister of Romania, accompanied the guest to Otopeni airport. Before his departure, the Israeli guest granted an exclusive interview to our correspondents Nicu Popescu and Ion Marinescu. [Begin Peres recording] In the three days of talks, one of the issues approached was bilateral relations between Romania and Israel, and the other issue was relations with the Palestinians. As far as bilateral relations are concerned, we are on the right path. There is an increase in economic activities and cultural and scientific relations and there are technological exchanges between our countries. We held talks with the foreign minister, the prime minister, and the president of your country in a very nice atmosphere. We have the impression that we are on the right path. Romania has a very important investment in Israel -- namely, the people who left Romania for Israel but without divorcing their feelings from Romania. They feel very strong about it. We will build a new strong bilateral relationship. As far as the Crans Montana Forum conference is concerned, there were 350 delegates from abroad, but what is more important was the presence of over 700 correspondents in this rather impressive palace. I think it was an important congress. I think Bucharest was interesting. The issues discussed have exceeded your own nation and these issues are not part of the Black Sea, but of the Balkans. I met many interesting and acknowledgeable people. Then there was the meeting with Mr. 'Arafat, where we tried to solve the different points in our discussions and clarify relations between the PLO and Israel. We tried to create the right atmosphere. The tradition of Romanian diplomacy that has been mediating in the Middle East has been felt now, too. In general, it was a very useful meeting. As you know, Mr. 'Arafat felt at home here and I believe this will accelerate the pace of negotiations toward a positive final result. I am grateful to the Romanian Government for the attention granted to me. We had a working lunch today with the prime minister and the foreign minister that was completely kosher and held in a very good atmosphere and I hope we will continue to work together.
