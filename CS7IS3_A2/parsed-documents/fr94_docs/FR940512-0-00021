ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Panamanian Transactions Regulations to include a statement of licensing policy indicating that specific licenses may be issued authorizing the release of blocked Government of Panama funds at the request of that government to satisfy settlements, final judgments and arbitral awards with respect to claims of U.S. persons arising prior to April 5, 1990.

Background Executive Order 12710 of April 5, 1990, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 282, terminated the national emergency declared on April 8, 1988, with respect to Panama, and lifted sanctions imposed against the Noriega regime. Pursuant to section 207(a)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1706(a)(2), however, the order continued the blocking of certain Government of Panama assets in the United States, with the understanding of the Government of Panama, to facilitate resolution of claims of U.S. persons. To foster the resolution of U.S. persons' claims against the Government of Panama arising prior to the April 5, 1990 lifting date, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury (``FAC''), is amending the Panamanian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 565 (the ``Regulations'') to include a statement of licensing policy announcing that the release of blocked Government of Panama assets may be licensed at the request of that government to satisfy settlements, final judgments and arbitral awards in favor of U.S. persons, where the claims arose prior to April 5, 1990. In addition, FAC will accept license applications from U.S. persons seeking judicial orders of attachment against blocked Government of Panama assets in satisfaction of final judgments entered in favor of the applicants with respect to such claims against the Government of Panama, provided such applications are submitted no later that June 15, 1994. The term ``Government of Panama'' for these purposes is defined in §565.303 of the Regulations, including appendix A to part 565. Note: Procedures for specific license applications are set forth in §565.801 of the Regulations. Unlicensed transfers of blocked Government of Panama assets, including transfers pursuant to judicial order, are prohibited and are null and void as provided in §§565.201 and 565.204. Violations of this part are punishable by criminal and civil penalties as provided in §§565.701 through 565.705. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply. List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 565 Panama, Blocking of assets, Foreign claims, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transfer of assets. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 565 is amended as follows: PART 565_PANAMANIAN TRANSACTIONS REGULATIONS 1.

Subpart E__Licenses, Authorizations and Statements of Licensing Policy 2. Section 565.512 is added to subpart E to read as follows: §565.512 Licensing policy with respect to blocked Government of Panama Assets. (a) Licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis authorizing the release of blocked Government of Panama assets at the request of that government to satisfy settlements, final judgments and arbitral awards with respect to claims of U.S. persons arising prior to April 5, 1990.

(2) If the licensed proceedings result in a final judicial order of attachment against the blocked assets, a certified copy of that order must be submitted to the Licensing Division of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Specific licenses may be issued on the basis of such orders authorizing release of blocked Government of Panama funds deemed in the attachment order to be subject to attachment to satisfy the applicant's final judgment.
