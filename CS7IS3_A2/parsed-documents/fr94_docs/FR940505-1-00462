FR940505-1-00462 FR940505-1-00012 (d)(1) For the purposes of certification and recall testing, evaporative hydrocarbon emissions shall not exceed the applicable federal heavy-duty engine evaporative emissions standards described in 40 CFR part 86. (2) Manufacturers' applications for certification shall include test results or an engineering evaluation demonstrating compliance with the inherently low evaporative emission requirements of §88.311&hyph;93(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2) of this chapter. Diurnal emission levels shall be adjusted to reflect corresponding results for a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank volume. This demonstration may be based on a diurnal temperature excursion of 65 ○F to 105 ○F and California certification fuel rather than the EPA conditions and test fuel. (e) Test procedures. (1) The exhaust emission standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section refer to the exhaust emissions collected under the conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Assembly line testing procedures are those set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart K, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. (2) The evaporative standards set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section refer to the evaporative emissions collected under the conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart M, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. (f) Test fuels. All certification, assembly line, and recall testing performed on vehicles and engines covered under this section shall use the fuels provided for by California as found in the California regulations. Testing performed to demonstrate compliance with the inherently low evaporative emission requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section may, as an alternative, be conducted with fuels meeting the federal specifications of 40 CFR part 86. Assembly line and recall testing shall use the same type of fuel as used in certification testing. (g) Recall program. (1) Engines certified to the standards set forth in this section shall be subject to the recall provisions described in this paragraph. For purposes of recall testing under this section, the term ``engine'' includes all emissions control systems. (2) The recall provisions for light-duty vehicles contained in §52.2962(e) shall apply to engines subject to the provisions of this paragraph as well, with appropriate references to applicable standards and test procedures, except that: (i) Engines shall be selected by EPA for purposes of recall testing from the vehicle population of the entire state rather than only from areas subject to enhanced inspection and maintenance testing; and (ii) The provisions of §52.2965 shall also apply. (h) Fleet averaging program. (1) General applicability. The requirements of this program apply to all heavy-duty vehicles of over 19,500 pounds GVWR that are registered in California. (2) Effective January 1, 2000, any person who owns one or more heavy-duty vehicles of over 19,500 pounds GVWR that are registered in California shall submit the following information on each of these affected fleet vehicles to EPA by January 31st of every calendar year. The submittal shall reflect the owner's affected fleet as it existed on January 1st of the same calendar year. Owners may combine their affected vehicles with those of other vehicle owners for the purposes of this program. Required information per affected vehicle: (i) Vehicle license number; (ii) Engine model year; (iii) Engine identification number; and (iv) GVWR. (3)(i) The results of the following Fleet Average Emissions (FAE) calculations contained in Tables 2966&hyph;1 and 2966&hyph;2 shall be submitted concurrently with the per vehicle information specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section; separate calculations shall be performed, and results submitted, for affected vehicles of GVWR between 19,501&hyph;33,000 pounds and for affected vehicles of over 33,000 pounds GVWR:
