Butrus-Ghali's decision was undoubtedly dictated by the problems of providing a new contingent of troops for UNPROFOR in Bosnia. The United Nations could not find additional troops from other countries, so that the Security Council openly stressed that it was forced to accept Ankara's offer. That is the excuse by which the United Nations, the Security Council, and Butrus-Ghali have tried to justify their action in view of all the criticism from throughout the world, and particularly from the Balkans, at the Turks being sent to a region where they were masters and governors for more than 500 years. The UN Security Council's decision, lacking any subtlety of historical memory, is becoming more and more the object of serious analysis and criticism by many NATO member-states, among which Greece, of course, takes the lead. Nevertheless, come what may, some 2,700 Turkish soldiers are getting ready to set off for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Askers [Turkish soldiers] are again on the road to Bosnia. How, with what, in which way, how capable are they in military terms [as published]? From what is known, UNPROFOR intends to deploy exclusively engineering units of the Turkish Army in Bosnia, in the first place for logistical support, but also for more difficult engineering works in order to fix communications. Since the task involves activities in the conflict zone, the Turkish troops will have to have protection, of course, if the war continues. Whether that protection will be given by NATO war planes, or their own forces, will be seen very soon, as soon as the Turkish troops and their equipment arrive in Bosnia. How capable are the Turkish engineers, and other soldiers, of carrying out UNPROFOR assignments, given the terrain of former Bosnia-Herzegovina? The answer lies in the picture of the contemporary Turkish army, its equipment and armament, the doctrine of its deployment, the concept of development, membership in NATO, the historic role of the army in the development of modern Turkey.... The second greatest military power in NATO, after the United States, is the Turkish Army, numbering some 480,000 soldiers (390,000 recruits, service lasts 15 months). In terms of status in Turkish society, the army members are an elite class, which since 1960 has intervened three times to suppress riots, or rather to attain power. It is an army that, until the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, policed one third of the border between NATO and the former Soviet Union, that is, some 400 kilometers of the only direct border with the former Soviet Union, except in Norway. That was a task of the 3d Turkish Army, being actually the most powerful operational-strategic Turkish armed force. After the demise of the Warsaw Pact, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkey relocated its armies, so that now the most powerful 1st Army is concentrated on the border toward Greece and the islands in the Aegean. The American military is still present in that country, and every year Ankara is given great economic and military aid, because of its role on the southern wing of NATO. There are 26 large U.S. and NATO military bases on Turkish territory, in addition to several dozens of smaller military compounds. The most important is certainly the great air force base in Incirlik, including warehouses for logistical support in (Iskendrun?) and (Yumurtalik?). In that base the planes equipped with nuclear weapons are stationed. In (Chigly?), near Ismir, there is another U.S. air-force base, and, in addition, the U.S. planes are using the airports in (Pirinchlic?), Ankara, and (Eshishecher?). The ships of the U.S. Navy are using almost all the Turkish ports and shipyards. The ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet are anchored very frequently in the port of Iskenderun in the Mediterranean. There are very important radio-locating [as published] stations in Synop and Pyrinchyluk, while 14 Nage [not further specified] stations of the NATO anti-aircraft defense system are positioned throughout Turkish territory . Being so tightly bound with the NATO and the United States, Turkey is trying to overpower the Kurds in the southeast of the country, and to obtain a more prominent place on the international stage. During the Gulf War against Iraq, Ankara allowed the Allies to use Turkish territory -- airports and navy ports, as well as the entire border belt toward Iraq itself. Later, Turkey was financially rewarded by the West for its support, so it is a state that receives the most military aid from NATO. True, some NATO member-states sometimes give their outdated arms and equipment to Turkey for free, but still, the Turkish Army is today one of the most powerful armies in Europe -- 4,835 tanks, 3,000 infantry armored vehicles and transporters, 4,550 cannons of various calibers, 1,870 anti-aircraft cannons, 2,100 mortars. The ground forces have their own aviation, numbering 269 aircraft and 538 helicopters, the air forces involve 60,000 people and 539 combat aircraft, 126 of which are F-16's, 137 F-5's, as well as 155 F-4's, while the navy numbers 50,000 people, 15 submarines, 11 destroyers, eight frigates, 16 missile craft, including its own naval air force.... There was a time, 20 years ago, when the Turkish armament industry was incapable of manufacturing even a simple piston aircraft for amateur flying clubs. Today, Turkey manufactures U.S. F-16 fighters, the latest electronics, and missiles. As for the engineering equipment, the Turkish soldiers deployed within UNPROFOR in Bosnia will have various types of engineering vehicles, based on the old M-47 U.S. tanks (German version), as well as Bailey pontoons. Since the UNPROFOR units are a multinational force, it will be interesting to see how the Turkish troops function under the command of foreign officers. All in all, the UN decision, not very wise from the political point of view, will place the Turkish soldiers in much temptation. It seems as though the problem with the Kurds is not enough of a problem for Ankara. Or is this all about the old dreams of coming back to the Balkans?
