French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said: "We not accept that United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR), whose impartiality cannot be doubted, are taken hostage or are targeted." French peacekeepers guarding an arms depot near the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo have been surrounded by Bosnian Serbs, demanding that heavy weapons be handed over to them. The Serbs have also mined the entrances to three other arms depots in the Sarajevo area. On Thursday the UN Security Council warned there would be "serious consequences" if peacekeepers were harmed in Bosnia and demanded that "all parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serb party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of movement and refrain from any further actions which could threaten the safety of UNPROFOR personnel." Duque also said there was no new information on 11 volunteers of the French humanitarian group Premiere urgence (First Aid) whose convoy of relief aid for Sarajevo was halted last Friday. Premiere urgence says the 11 are being held in a Bosnian Serb barracks near Pale. "We are pursuing our efforts to obtain details and secure their release," Duque said.
