This time he said he would make every effort not to dissolve Congress, which caused commotion in congressional circles. As a way of showing how "sorry" he was, Wasmosy sent two notes to Congress explaining his remarks and "renewing" his confidence in Congress. He expressed profound indignation and vexation over what had been published in the morning newspapers. His "justification," however, has not prevented harsh criticism from both opposition and official blocs, which termed his attitude as "dangerous" for democracy. The president's remark that he would do everything possible to not dissolve Congress provoked a shower of criticism from legislators of several blocs. This compelled the chief of state to clarify his remarks. He sent a note in which he renews his "confidence" in Congress. The president's new and controversial remarks were published by the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Despite an attempt to "apologize" to Congress, he was unable to prevent an overall rebuke from opposition and official blocs for his remarks, which were termed as an attack on democracy. Wasmosy's "justification" note arrived at Congress at noon. He expresses his vexation over the Argentine newspaper report that he would do everything possible to avoid dissolving Congress. Hugo Saguier Caballero, secretary general of the Presidency, handed the official note to Senate President Evelio Fernandez Arevalos and Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas. Wasmosy's note states: "I am extremely vexed over the information that appeared in the newspapers today which indicates that I will do everything to avoid dissolving Congress." The note adds: "Unfortunately, the article does not honestly convey my thoughts. No one can presuppose that I intend violating express constitutional clauses." Wasmosy emphasizes: "I deem it necessary to emphasis my decision to use all my efforts to prevent situations that could harbor the idea of violating the Constitution." The note concludes: "I believe it is neccessary for me to address these lines to you with the sole intention of renewing my confidence and my hope of good governing through the rectitude and honor of the members of Congress."
