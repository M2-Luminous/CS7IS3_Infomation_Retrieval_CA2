The Yalta Town Council takes upon itself an obligation not to allow the installation, deployment, maintenance, or storage of nuclear weapons or other radioactive materials on its territory. The transit or transportation of nuclear components, including the arrival of ships with nuclear weapons on board to the port, is forbidden. It was decided to establish efficient control over adherence to the nuclear-free status. The statement was sent to Ukraine's Supreme Council, to the Crimean Supreme Council, and to the committee of the International Secretariat ``The Movement of Local Authorities in Nuclear-Free Zones'' (Manchester, Great Britain). The deputies turned to local organs of power of the Black Sea Region with a proposal to support their statement.
