The president released some unprecedented details on the Shining Path leader's arrest, explaining the release of Luis Alberto Arana Franco, which has prompted a scandal in Peru. Fujimori said Arana Franco, logistics chief for the Maoist group, was released in compliance with the Repentance Law approved in August 1992 because he provided some clues to police that led to Guzman's arrest in September the same year. Arana was arrested in June 1992 and two months later, when the law was approved, he decided to seek refuge under the law, which reduces the sentence of a terrorist who cooperates in capturing the heads of his organization. The Peruvian president reported that Arana Franco betrayed Zenon Vargas, Shining Path national coordinator, and Maritza Garrido-Lecca, and Juan Inchaustegui, who were in charge of Guzman's personal safety. After following Garrido-Lecca and Inchaustegui, police concluded that the couple was hiding an "important" Shining Path leader in their home, and raided the house without imagining that the top leader could be found inside. Fujimori said that Arana Franco's decision "must serve as an example for those who want to reorganize their lives instead of earning a long prison sentence," and added that the released collaborator is being protected and his identity has been changed. The Peruvian president also confirmed that in the past two months, the Peruvian courts have released several Shining Path terrorists "for lack of evidence" and asked the Supreme Court to "thoroughly" investigate these cases. He also categorically rejected reports that his government has released some terrorists as a result of negotiations with arrested Shining Path leaders, and said such rumors "are in bad faith and biased." The political opposition has said it will ask Congress to call the justice and defense ministers to explain why those Shining Path terrorists were released. Most government officials have reported, however, that the petition will be rejected because it intends to "politicize" the problem and to blame the government for those cases "that are the exclusive responsibility of the courts."
