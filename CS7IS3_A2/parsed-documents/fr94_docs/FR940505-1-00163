FR940505-1-00163 FR940505-1-00012 The third point of special concern is the effect that emission standards for locomotives could have on interstate commerce and on international commerce at ports. A substantial portion of the freight and people moved by railroads in California is on trips beginning and/or ending outside of the state. This fact raises two issues. The first is that much freight never has to enter California and would avoid the state if it saved money. The movement of that freight supplies jobs not only in the railroads, but also to tugboat operators, port operators, truckers and shippers in California. It also supplies revenue to the state. EPA is concerned that this FIP not affect California's economy unnecessarily. Another concern is the effect that a patchwork of state locomotive regulations across the nation will have on interstate commerce. Depending on the treatment of remanufactured locomotives under this FIP and the national rule, such a patchwork could come to exist (see discussion of remanufactured engines). It would be exceedingly difficult for railroads that must cross multiple state lines to comply with multiple state emission levels. If a train had to proceed through several states with differing emission standards, either the locomotive(s) would have to meet the lowest state emission standard for the entire trip or the railroad company would be forced to change locomotives at state boundaries. Facilities for such changes do not exist. Even if such facilities were to exist, the process of changing locomotives at state borders would add significantly to operational costs and shipping times and could also result in increased idle emissions. For these reasons, safety regulations regarding locomotives and trains have historically been national. Lack of cohesive, uniform national regulations for locomotives could be expected to disrupt interstate commerce. An additional complication exists in the form of the different promulgation deadlines required for the FIP, California's SIP, the national locomotive rulemaking and California's locomotive regulatory efforts. The FIP proposed today is not scheduled to be finalized until February of 1995. Meanwhile California will develop State Implementation Plans which must show attainment in the relevant areas and EPA will propose a national locomotive program. Additionally, CARB will submit a recommendation to the California legislature on a state rule for locomotives and will begin work on a regulation. EPA is required by statute to promulgate a final national rule for the control of locomotive emissions by November 15, 1995. Since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, EPA has scheduled its investigative, research, contracting and rulemaking efforts towards meeting this November 15, 1995 deadline. Because this rulemaking is the first of its kind for locomotives, EPA has a full schedule of technical and operational issues to address. Many of these issues are not fully resolved at this time. Therefore, in describing the effects of a national rulemaking on California FIP areas in terms of emission reductions, EPA must base its estimates on a draft of its proposed national rulemaking that has not been fully developed. EPA stresses that the proposed national rulemaking described here, for purposes of estimating emission reductions in the California FIP areas, is preliminary and may be modified in the NPRM for the national locomotive rulemaking that EPA expects to propose in November of 1994. A final additional issue exists regarding the level of emission reductions appropriate for California, the South Coast and the nation as a whole. South Coast authorities have indicated that they would like to see a 90 percent reduction in rail emissions in the South Coast. CARB has indicated that an 80 percent reduction statewide would be appropriate. EPA, as described below, is considering reductions on the order of 65 percent to 70 percent for the nation, phased in over several years. EPA is also proposing today substantially larger reductions, and a more swift implementation schedule, for the South Coast. Trying to fit different national, state and local needs together is difficult in the best of circumstances. When the potential economic and environmental costs of inappropriate requirements are as significant as they are here, it is much more difficult. EPA's proposed locomotive FIP regulations are described below in three parts. The proposed regulations for freshly manufactured locomotives are the same as those EPA intends to propose in November for the national locomotive program. For remanufactured locomotives, EPA is considering two options. The first is a national program for such engines which requires that existing locomotives meet a significant reduction and that locomotives complying with national standards meet those standards throughout their full operating lives. The second is a California-only program with the same requirements. Under that option, California could replace such a California-only program with more stringent requirements if it finds such requirements are appropriate. The final part of this proposal is a fleet averaging standard program for the South Coast only. (b) Freshly Manufactured Locomotives. This section describes EPA's current thinking regarding its planned November 1994 proposal for regulation of new locomotives and engines used in locomotives nationally. As described above, EPA is still analyzing data in preparation for that rule and hopes that it will receive additional useful data in response to this NPRM. At this time, EPA intends to propose that freshly manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines built between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004, be required to meet a NO X emission standard no higher than 7.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA is carefully studying the possibility of lower standards, and is asking for comment on a NO X standard as low as 5.0 g/bhp-hr. Estimates of emission rates from in-service locomotives range from 13.5 to 12.0 g/bhp-hr. This requirement represents approximately a 42 percent to 48 percent reduction in NO X emissions from uncontrolled levels.
