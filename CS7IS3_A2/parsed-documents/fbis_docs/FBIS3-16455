He is 41 years old. He was born in the settlement of Dangara in Kulyab Oblast. He began his working life as an electrician at a creamery. He served in the Army for three years. He graduated as an economist from the Tajik State University. He was elected chairman of the trade union and later director at his local sovkhoz, the sovkhoz named for V.I. Lenin. During the civil war in 1992 he was one of the organizers of the Kulyab antifundamentalist resistance. He led the Kulyab Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. On 19 November 1992, he was elected chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Council. [Lenskiy] Esteemed Emomili Sharipovich, it has been over a year now since the people of Tajikistan, under the leadership of their lawfully elected government, managed to bring the civil war to an end and embark on the path of a peaceful life. How do you assess the political situation in the Republic today and how is the constitutional process, which your speech at the December session of the Supreme Council launched, developing? [Rakhmonov] The political situation in the Republic today is relatively stable if you compare it with what was happening a year ago, when the civil war ended. The unhealthy passions in society are dying down. There is, however, a rise in the crime rate. Some 25,000 crimes have been committed in the Republic over the year. Three out of every four remain unsolved. Furthermore, this situation is typical today not just of Tajikistan, but of all the CIS countries. Although, to be honest, the recognition of this fact offers scant comfort. A constitutional commission is at work right now. Work on a new draft constitution is proceeding successfully. A nationwide discussion of the document in planned for June. After the adoption of the fundamental law, there will be elections to a new parliament and possibly an election for president of the republic. The question of the presidency must be resolved at the same time as the adoption of the constitution. New political forces are coming to the fore -- the People's Party and the Party of Economic and Democratic Transformations, which have applied for registration to the Republic's Justice Ministry. But at the moment the largest parties in terms of numbers and social weight are still the Communist Party and the Youth League of Tajikistan. We have agreed to political dialogue with representatives of the antigovernment opposition. The talks are due to take place in Moscow, with the Russian and UN representatives taking part. [Lenskiy] On what terms is Russia prepared to create a single ruble zone with Tajikistan? [Rakhmonov] Russia has not presented us with any impossible conditions. Talks are being held on the usual topics -- traditional mutual trade relations. First of all ,we must restore Tajik cotton shipments to Russia to their former volume. It must be stated with regret that annual cotton production has halved now. It is also necessary to consider increasing the proportion of Russian capital in our Republic's economy. I am talking about the flotation of enterprises originally built using Russian technology, enterprises such as the "Vostokredmet" Association, or the Rogunskaya Hydroelectric Power Station, currently under construction. New forms for organizing production units via international flotation are perfectly acceptable in these circumstances. [Lenskiy] The CIS Collective Peacemaking Forces [CPF] have been performing their duties in the Republic at the Tajik Government's invitation for six months now. What is your assessment of their activity? [Rakhmonov] The role of the CPF should not be overestimated or underestimated. It would be naive to suppose that their introduction into the Republic's territory would immediately bring border violations to an end. Our enemies across the Pyandzha have regrettably not abandoned their intentions. However, they now face greater obstacles to the realization of their criminal schemes. The CPF have become a firm barrier along the Tajik-Afghan border, which is 1,300 km long. With Russia's assistance we are taking measures to resolve the problem by political means. I have in mind the forthcoming dialogue with opposition representatives, due to take place in Moscow. I have repeatedly noted that such a dialogue is necessary. The only condition was the need to define the potential parties to the talks. I did not want to sit at the same table as people who are under investigation for committing crimes against their own people. We want a peaceable, constructive discussion with those people who are genuinely interested in improving the situation in Tajikistan and who are ready to put their ambitions aside for the sake of the people's well-being. [Lenskiy] Instability is the main cause of the suitcase mentality among the Slavs. What could be done, in your view, to stop the migration of the Russian-speaking population? [Rakhmonov] Yes, the exodus of the Russian-speaking population is continuing, unfortunately. Even though we are making every effort to hold on to specialists and indeed people who are simply second- and third-generation citizens of Tajikistan. Through the press I have appealed to those who have left to return home. The conditions for this do exist. Hostilities on the republic's territory have ceased. The government is now trying to resolve the problem of protecting the interests and guaranteeing the rights of the nonindigenous population. Under the Tajik-Russian Treaty signed in May 1993 it is planned to open a Slavic university in Tajikistan. The only problem is resources, which we lack at the moment. [Lenskiy] What about dual citizenship? [Rakhmonov] Well, it is too soon to talk about that at the moment.... [Lenskiy] Sooner or later Tajikistan's defense capability will become your internal affair. How is the formation of the National Army proceeding? [Rakhmonov] We believe that a sovereign Republic must have its own Armed Forces. In this regard we are being helped by Russia and other fraternal CIS Republics. We have created a Defense Ministry here and we have subunits of special-purpose troops and internal troops. But only the initial, preparatory stage in the creation of the People's Army of Tajikistan has been completed. An air force helicopter squadron has been formed, a training brigade is being formed, and a military school is being organized in Khudzhand along the lines of the Suvorov School. The Sangak Safarov Military College is already in operation. [Lenskiy] It is exactly a year since the legendary Sangak died. How do you assess his personality and activity today? [Rakhmonov] I have deep respect for the memory of the chairman of the People's Front of Tajikistan. May he rest in peace. Sangak Safarov accomplished a great deed for his people and in that sense his name now stands among those of the people's heroes of Tajikistan. I now derive strength for my work from our people among whom, I believe, there are quite a few outstanding individuals like Sangak. [Lenskiy] Recently Tajikistan was shaken by the assassination of M. Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, who hailed from the Pamirs. What effect could this have on the situation in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast? [Rakhmonov] Quite recently, even before the tragic event, I flew to Khorog where I took part in a discussion of topical problems. The plan is to allocate to the oblast a long-term preferential credit totaling 22 billion rubles. The state budget is also financing the rebuilding of roads, bridges, and other facilities which have been wrecked. We are trying to speed up the commissioning of small-scale hydroelectric power stations in the Pamirs. The civil war brought the construction of the Kulyab-Kalaykhum highway to a halt. It is meant for the transport of economic freight to the Pamirs. Furthermore, this road is capable of functioning all year round. Ten km of asphalt still has to be laid in the mountains. I understand that some people do not like good relations with Gornyy Badakhshan. They would prefer confrontation with the Republic's government. This is confirmed by the provocative murder of Moyensho Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the government, by enemies of the Tajik people. The Prosecutor's Office has established that this was the handiwork of the Mullah Kasym gang, which is inspired to acts of terror and violence by Said Abdullo Nuri, head of the so-called "government in exile." That is how they are "preparing" for talks. But despite the provocateurs' plans, the population of the autonomous oblast is opposed to separatism.
