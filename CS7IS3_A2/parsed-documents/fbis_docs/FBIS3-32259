The decision was announced following the failure of more than six months of talks with Finance and Labor Ministry officials. Ardon said the government contended that it could not comply with the agreement due to a lack of budget funds. Ardon added that the government failed to comply with five points of the agreement: the problem of underemployment of professionals, wage scales, establishment of a promotion list based on seniority, promotions by academic level or degree and/or positions occupied, and discussion and approval of a salary increase for 1993.
