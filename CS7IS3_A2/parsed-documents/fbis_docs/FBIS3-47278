Upon receiving the birthday table amid blessings of all people that day, the old woman and her family, relatives and villagers expressed boundless thanks and reverence for the dear leader who bestowed deep benevolence on her, caring for the birthday of an unknown old woman who has lived an ordinary life. Born into a poor peasant family in a mountainous village in Changjin County, South Hamgyong Province, on January 6, 1894, she managed to eke out a living by doing farming. She could not learn abc, without her proper full name. It was not until Korea was liberated in 1945 that she could live a worthy and happy life as master of the country. The number of people who enjoy longevity is on a steady increase thanks to the popular health policy in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
