The threat to assassinated President John F. Kennedy's sister emerged after phone calls between suspicious Protestant extremists were intercepted. In one taped conversation they discussed action against targets in the south and in particular "that American bitch in Dublin." The latest threat comes amid fears of a new Loyalist terror campaign in the south. Mrs Kennedy Smith, 66, was appointed by President Clinton in March last year. U.S. diplomat Dennis Sanberg said at the Dublin Embassy: ``There is a lunatic fringe and precautions are being taken. The ambassador certainly appreciates the delicacy of the security situation. ``She, more than anyone, is aware of the dangers because of her family.'' The presence of the Kennedy clan earlier this year at the successful appeal of freed Guildford Four member Paul Hill against a murder conviction angered the Loyalist community. Hill is married to Mrs Kennedy Smith's niece Courtney. Loyalist extremists accuse her of persuading the American government to back the Republic's growing "interference" in Ulster affairs. But Mr Sanberg stressed: "The ambassador has reached out to the Unionists at a political level and was instrumental in arranging for James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist Party leader, to see Vice- President Al Gore." The British and Irish governments yesterday discussed joint action against terrorists. MI5, RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special Branch and Army Intelligence have completed a hit-list of around 200 "players." They will be rounded up when the Cabinet reintroduces internment. But last night Irish advisers appeared reluctant to carry out a simultaneous sweep south of the border. They apparently want to wait until the IRA formally rejects the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.
