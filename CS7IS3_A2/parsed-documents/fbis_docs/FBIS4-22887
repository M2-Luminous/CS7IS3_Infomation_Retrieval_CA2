Yakutin; UDC 632.4:633.854.78] [Abstract] In the past few years, the new disease stem brown-spot, which is caused by the fungus Phomopsis (Diaporthe) helianthi), has been appearing on sunflowers in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. The disease has been referred to by various names, including sunflower phomopsis in the Western literature. Sunflower stem brown-spot was first detected in Russia in the Stavropol Kray in 1990. Foci of the disease have since been recorded in the other regions of the Stavropol and Krasnodar krays, Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, and Rostov Oblast of the Central Caucasus and in three oblasts in the Central Chernozem region. Mycological and phytopathological analyses of specimens of brown-spot-infected sunflower stems collected throughout the affected regions confirmed Ph. helianthi, which was first identified as the cause of sunflower stem canker in Yugoslavia in 1981 and first detected in the former USSR in 1985, to be the causative agent. Studies have shown that one of the reasons for the appearance of stem brown-spot now is the fact that infected seed material from affected regions of the former USSR are still being used. Further spread of the disease through contaminated seed material is also likely. Ph. helianthi has a definite variability that is manifested in pure cultures in the form of different colorations of the mycelium, in the formation of two types of spores in the pycnidium (_a_- and _b_-spores in the strains A and B, respectively), and in variation of its pathogenic properties to sunflower specimens. Strains with _a_- and _b_- spores in their pycnidia have been established to have a similar pathogenicity upon artificial inoculation. Both strains have shown definite intraspecial physiological and morphological diversity. Ph. helianthi thrives at higher temperatures than other sunflower pathogens (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea) do. In various nutrient media, Ph. helianthi growth and spore formation are most intense between 20 and 25�C. Growth and development of the fungus are sharply inhibited by 30�C, and they cease completely at 35�C. Field studies have shown the disease to be most intense at air temperatures of 10 to 20�C with absolute temperature fluctuations from 5.6�C at night to 28.3�C during the day. The most effective preventive measures appear to be the use of resistant varieties and the use of fungicides. Russian research to protect sunflowers against the disease has been extremely limited. The sunflower lines VIR 130 and VIR 160 and the hybrid Krasnodarskiy 885 appear to have the highest resistance to stem brown-spot, whereas the varieties Berezanskiy, Yenisey, and Ultraskorospelyy appear to have the lowest resistance. Studies conducted abroad have established several fungicides that appear to be effective against the disease. The fungicides Ronilan and Rovral have been approved for use on sunflowers in Russia. Fungicides should be applied to sunflowers three times: before they button, when or soon after they first flower, and at the end of flowering. Tables 5; references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.
