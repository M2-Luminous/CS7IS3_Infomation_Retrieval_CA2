Speaking at a meeting with the workers of the Azovmash machine-building plant in Mariupol, Ukrainian port city on the Azov Sea, on Monday, Kravchuk said that "we cannot allow the scanty Ukrainian market to become empty. If we open up the borders now, the major part of consumer goods and agricultural produce will be taken out to the Russian Federation." "Presently, due to objective reasons we have a situation when the same goods made in Russia and Ukraine have different production costs," Kravchuk continued. He believes that production cost largely depends on the price of energy carriers, the bulk of which Ukraine receives from Russia. "If Ukrainian enterprises paid for oil and gas as much as Russian plants and fabrics pay, then we would need no customs checkpoints. Trade between Ukraine and Russia would become state business, not private," he said. Kravchuk stressed that "trade relations between Ukraine and Russia must develop and expand." "Such great powers must have strong friendly and economic ties," he added.
