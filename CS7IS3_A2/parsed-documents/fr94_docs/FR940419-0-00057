FR940419-0-00057 FR940419-0-00019 2. Previously Issued Conflict of Interest Guidance Many commenters expressed concern that the January 1990, memorandum from the Director of the EPA's Procurement and Contracts Management Division, which conveyed general guidance on conflict of interest to Superfund contract staff and Superfund contractors, was not published with the proposed rule and formally open for public comments. Some also expressed concern with issues it raised and requested that it be rescinded. Others mentioned that they were pleased that the proposed rule was a considerable improvement over the January 1990, guidance. It was EPA's intent that the proposed rule supersede the January 1990, guidance. We would like to make it clear that this final rule and its preamble discussion supersedes the January 1990, guidance and the proposed rule. 3. Justification for Special Conflict of Interest Provisions Some commenters questioned EPA's authority to implement a conflict of interest rule and questioned the need for an EPA rule on conflicts of interest stating that adequate safeguards exist. Others contended that there is no balance between the benefits to be achieved compared to the cost of compliance. We disagree. FAR subpart 1.3 provides agencies with the authority to implement supplemental acquisition regulations to satisfy specific needs of the agency. We have developed the conflict of interest rule to address the specific requirements of EPA's Superfund and other programs since sufficient coverage is not provided by existing regulations. In the past few years, the General Accounting Office (GAO) in conducting reviews of EPA's programs, the EPA in performing management studies of the Superfund program, and Congressional Committees have all concluded that EPA's existing conflict of interest procedures are inadequate to protect its programs. The GAO in its report ``Superfund Contracts: EPA's Procedures for Preventing Conflicts of Interest Need Strengthening'' (GAO/RCED&hyph;899&hyph;57), dated February 1989, and EPA, in the Administrator's Management Review of the Superfund Program (1989), pointed out the special vulnerability of the Superfund program and strongly recommended that action be taken to strengthen EPA's existing procedures. EPA is responsible for leading the nation's efforts to protect and clean up the environment. This includes the development of environmental standards, control of toxic substances and the cleanup of hazardous wastes, as well as enforcement of applicable laws and regulations. Historically, the Agency has relied heavily upon contractors to accomplish its mission, and much of this work is highly sensitive, particularly in the Superfund program. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund) 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675, consists of Public Law 96&hyph;510 (Dec. 11, 1980) and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. It provides for liability, compensation, cleanup and emergency response for hazardous substances released into the environment and the cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. Because EPA has the dual responsibility of cleanup and enforcement and because its contractors are often involved in both activities, and may conduct work for EPA and the private sector, it is imperative that EPA contractors are free of conflicts so as not to jeopardize CERCLA response and enforcement/cost recovery actions (hereinafter referred to as enforcement). This rule focuses primarily on performance after contract award, unlike FAR which focuses on conflict of interest issues related to contractor eligibility for award. Under Superfund contracts, work is performed at multiple sites and new and constantly changing cleanup priorities make it impossible for EPA to identify, prior to contract award, all site locations where work will be performed. In addition, it is impossible for EPA to predict, prior to contract award, enforcement actions against PRPs at specific sites. Moreover, such cases may take years to resolve. Therefore, EPA must address conflicts of interest during and after contract performance to effectively monitor conflicts and safeguard Superfund enforcement. U.S. Department of Justice and EPA attorneys, enforcing CERCLA, stress the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest in the Superfund program. Conflicts of interest discovered after work has begun can create costly delays in cleanup of sites when EPA must mitigate damage resulting from conflicts to safeguard cleanup work and enforcement from further prejudice. Therefore, it is imperative that EPA contractors do not perform work for PRPs that conflicts with work performed for the Agency. Conflicts arise because of differing interests of the EPA and PRPs. EPA's primary concern is to assure that adequate environmental protection is provided, as opposed to the primary interests of PRPs, who are usually motivated to keep costs minimized. Because these conflicts often arise in the context of adversarial enforcement proceedings, such conflicts and leaks of sensitive enforcement information not only jeopardize cases at the litigation stage, but also weaken the Government's position both in obtaining PRP commitment to clean up sites and in cost recovery negotiations with PRPs. To date, EPA has the potential to seek over $4.5 billion in cost recovery; the stakes are high.
