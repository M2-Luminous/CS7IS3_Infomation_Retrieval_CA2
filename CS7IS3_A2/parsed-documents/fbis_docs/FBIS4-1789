Because the notice was made verbally and the official did not present any written statement or docket, the two MING PAO officers remained in Beijing and made great efforts to get in touch with the relvant authorities to verify the information. Xi Yang's relatives received a telephone call from a court official early in the morning of 1 April, and they were informed that the first hearing of Xi Yang's case of stealing and gathering state secrets had concluded and he had been sentenced. This paper immediately sent men to Beijing to learn more about the situation. Because it was the weekend, the relevant court officials were not in their offices. That being the case, the verbal notice still has not been verified by the authorities. Chang Chien-po, MING PAO executive chief editor, and Chang Hsi-hong, senior editor of the China page, contacted lawyers in the hinterland yesterday to learn more about the possibility of filing an appeal for Xi Yang's case. Chang Chien-po said: "When I met with Xi Yang's relatives the day before yesterday, they indicated that they were also thinking of consulting a lawyer. We will do our best to find a lawyer for Xi Yang's relatives. To our knowledge, under current Chinese law, Xi Yang's relatives may consult a lawyer, but we can only offer assistance from behind the scenes."
