The strains of CHIK virus employed for B8635, M81 and Ross isolated from Yunnan, China or Africa. Studies showed that these two species of mosquitoes were capable of transmitting CHIK virus by bite to susceptible hosts. Parental females of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti were infected orally with CHIK virus, and 3070 first generation progeny from infected mothers were pooled into 55 pools and examined for the virus. Positive rate of pools from Ae. albopictus were 46.15 percent (6/13) for larvae, 33.33 percent (4/12) for adult females and 62.50 percent (5/8) for adult males. Positive rate of pools from Ae. aegypti were 18.18 percent (2/11) for larvae and 22.22 percent (2/9) for adult females. In another experiment, CHIK viruses were detected in second and third generations progeny obtained from individual infected Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Based on these studies, infected females were capable of transmitting the virus vertically to their offspring. There was no apparent difference in transovarial transmission capabilities of these two species in orally infected mosquitoes. These results indicate that Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti have the potential to play a role in the maintenance of CHIK virus in nature.
