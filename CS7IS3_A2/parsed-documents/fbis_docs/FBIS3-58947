This was announced by CSU Chairman Theo Waigel on Monday evening [24 January] after a meeting of the CDU and CSU Presidiums in Munich. The current president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, is to be nominated as joint candidate for the office of president. CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl decisively rejected speculation about a grand coalition. The chancellor said that the intention was to continue the coalition with the FDP [Free Democratic Party]. Moreover, the voters had a right to know who the SPD [Social Democratic Party] would work with after the elections. Kohl conceded that there had been mutual criticism at the strategy summit of the Union parties [CDU and CSU]. "We are not a mutual admiration society in which everyone adores everyone else," he said. Waigel stressed before the summit that the Union parties see the SPD as their main opponent. [passage omitted] Talking about the issue of Europe, the chancellor stressed that the CDU wanted to remain the "classical party for Europe." There were no ifs and buts in its support for European integration. In the European elections it had to be made clear to the citizen that peace and freedom could only be lastingly secured on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty.
