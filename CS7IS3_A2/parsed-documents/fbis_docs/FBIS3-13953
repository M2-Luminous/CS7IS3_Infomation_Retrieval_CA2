Two causes are indicated. The first is the compulsions of domestic politics. This factor has, of course, always had a decisive influence on the Pakistani stand on bilateral talks. But the latest brusque refusal to pick up the thread of the discussions between J.N. Dixit and Shahryar Khan, is a particularly striking instance. J.N. Dixit and Shaharyar Khan had themselves envisaged a resumption of the dialogue soon enough. This was the implication of the clear Indian offer to submit detailed proposals in search of common ground on Siachen and Sir Creek. This apart, Benazir Bhutto herself had given ample cause for the belief she was interested in an understanding on Siachen. Since then the climate in Pakistan has been anything but favourable for serious talks with India. Nawaz Sharif has stepped up efforts to portray the PM [prime minister] as one who is inclined to do a deal with India on Kashmir. The Pakistani decision not to go ahead with a resolution in the UN General Assembly seeking to censure India for alleged human rights violations has especially drawn much flak in the Pakistani media as well as in the National Assembly. Other domestic difficulties, too, have somewhat weakened her position. Not the least of them has been her quarrels with her mother and brother both of whom seem to be determined to embarrass her in every possible way. If the upshot of all this has been to persuade her not to accord relations with India a high priority, it is a logical sequel. Conceivably, the rigid tone of the Pakistan Foreign Office's statement ruling out a continuation of the bilateral dialogue -- reflected in the call to "finalise modalities" for a plebiscite in Kashmir -- may also mean a felt need for a review of all that has been done to hasten annexation of Kashmir. Pending the outcome of any such exercise, it is a common practice for Foreign Offices to reiterate fundamental positions on contentious issues with an air of finality. In purely rational terms, a thorough review should be a natural corollary to the failure of the frenetic campaign carried on by Pakistan abroad to compel India to concede Kashmir. In the last five years, Islamabad has left no stone unturned to convince the rest of the world that India is committing a genocide in Kashmir and that the only way of putting an end to it is for India to hand over the territory to Pakistan. But this has hardly had the desired impact. What then should be done? The policy-makers in Islamabad cannot possibly avoid asking themselves this question any longer. Further, Islamabad's tussle with pro-independence Kashmiri groups in Pakistan has intensified. All this adds up to a major challenge to both the security and foreign policy establishments in Islamabad. How they will cope with it is hard even to guess. *
