The open Majles session recessed at 1715, to resume at the evening session. Mr. Akrami's Proposal on Oil Products Concerning the import of oil products, Mr. Akrami, deputy from Semnan, proposed that this be prohibited in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. Concerning his proposal, Akrami said: We now have a revenue problem due to the drop in oil prices. One revenue solution is to reduce our domestic consumption. Economy must begin with the government itself. One solution is substitution. That is, the Ministry of Petroleum should convert its passenger automobiles to burn natural gas. The other government organizations should voluntarily reduce their consumption of oil products, petroleum and gasoil, and this would also improve the environmental situation somewhat. He then called for expansion of natural gas service in homes and the like. He said: This would automatically replace kerosene and the like. The minister of petroleum may say he has nothing to say against it but it is impossible, but the task of the Majles is to make policy and the government must implement it. Continuing, he said: We must prepare a consumption model for the government itself to follow. Nothing will be solved merely by raising prices. The government representative and the commission opposed Mr. Akrami's proposal. The government representative Mr. Aqazadeh said in opposition: This motion is not a policy, it is a decision. If it is a policy to say that we must economize, then we must find the way to do it. One way is rationing. According to previous experience, this does not work. It creates fuel shortages and a black market. Then Mr. Akrami's proposal was put to a vote and was not approved. Engineer Yahyavi's Proposal In the debate about oil revenues Engineer Yahyavi proposed an increase of 40,000 barrels per day [bpd] for oil products and said: In this regard I issued a guidelines memo to Mr. Ahmad Nateq-Nuri that what the Plan and Budget Commission did was in violation of the guidelines. Without the knowledge of the Oil Commission they deducted 40,000 barrels from the figure for domestic consumption and added it to the figure for exports to increase the revenue ceiling the Plan and Budget and Oil commissions had agreed to and which was to have been presented to the Majles. They thereby added about $190 million to the revenue ceiling. He noted that the Ministry of Petroleum did not allow for increased consumption in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] over the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. He said: If we reduce this ceiling by even 40,000 barrels, it will put pressure on the deprived class. Gasoline and gasoil have priority in oil product imports, and then if something is added it is spent on kerosene imports, meaning that if we subtract this 40,000 barrels it will come out of kerosene imports and this will again be pressure on the low-income classes. Mr. 'Abdollahi's Proposal Speaking in opposition to Engineer Yahyavi's proposal, Mr. 'Abdollahi said: The 13.8-foreign exchange figure the Majles approved for the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] has decreased to 12.4 for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. I wish we had accepted economic growth. In the Second Five-Year Plan we reduced basic goods to $695 million from the $1.35 billion figure in the First Five-Year Plan, due to the fact that energy growth is very great and is disproportionate to the growth in gross product. These are the instances we cite in saying that we must reduce reduce oil products and consumption. Continuing, he said: Despite this, we increased our consumption figure from 1.34 million bpd to 1.5 million bpd, which is 12 percent growth. This rate of consumption is twice the world's per-capital consumption, three times the consumption in Turkey and so forth. Where will it go? Concerning Note 25, 'Abdollahi said: If we had set prices justly and fairly five years ago we would be having better times now, and if we do not make a decision today we will bring the country up against more problems in the future. Ahmad Nateq-Nuri's Proposal Speaking in agreement with Engineer Yahyavi's proposal, Ahmad Nateq-Nuri mentioned that import priority goes to gasoline after gasoil and then to kerosene. He said: It appears that social justice itself is the most oppressed thing of all. Anytime someone has a problem he says it is because of social justice. This is what we do. If you want to prevent consumption, first go and fix your ministry, reduce government consumption. First reduce the numbers of 6- and 8-cylinder automobiles in the ministries. Continuing, Ahmad Nateq-Nuri discussed the shortage of fuel in various regions. he said: We are not opposed to reducing consumption, but begin the consumption model with yourself. He discussed the fact that the commission has thought in a onesided way, and has used its power everywhere. For the sake of the oppressed people, he asked the deputies to vote in favor of Engineer Yahyavi's proposal. Then the expert from the relevant commission discussed Engineer Yahyavi's proposal. He said: The joint Plan and Budget and Economic and Financial Affairs commissions made this decision, not the Budget Commission, and it is unjust of the esteemed brothers to deal in this way with this commission. The nation's production capacity is no more than this and we can produce no more than this. We must retain the reserved portion. We voted on liquid gas exports and we voted on the dollar unit for each barrel, and in general we arrived at the figure Engineer Yahyavi mentioned in his talk. He then discussed the issue of economy on the joint commission. He said: Policies are like the policy to prevent waste and dissipation. We should import the same amount we set last year and save the 40,000 barrels, from which we will derive more revenue for other projects, and that is what is to be gained from these proposals. The figure of $190 million is deducted from revenues, of which the rial equivalent is R332 billion. That is, we must add add 33.3 billion tomans to these revenues before you, which are about 215 billion tomans. This means we must deduct more revenues from the country, and this proposal comes from the petroleum brothers. Talks by the Minister of Petroleum and the Government's Representative The government representative mentioned the order of priorities of gasoline, gasoil, and then kerosene. He said: The nation's consumption is based on existing demand. The figure of 190,000 barrels was approved and we have now imported 100,000 more barrels of oil. Mr. Mirvalad is saying that we have done this on paper and moved the figures, but this did not occur in the projects in practice. If you reduce the figure this year, next year's exports will be reduced and will be used for domestic consumption unless you support the policy that we will distribute only this much and any shortfall will either be accepted or you will use rationing and ration coupons. Continuing, he said: If the policy is one of no coupons and no regulations, it will be based on society's demand and we will not be able to do anything. Continuing, he then said: If the price is not revised, 200,000 barrels will not be enough and we will have to go to a ceiling of 300,000 barrels. The government wants to control the growth of consumption with the prices it has set. He also added: If we do not make a decision about prices, we will have to build a refinery every year. Then the commission's proposal was put to a vote and it was not approved. Majles Notes Yesterday during the debate and study of the budget bill RESALAT's correspondent spoke with Mr. Salehi, deputy from Izeh. He discussed the procedure for allocating budget credits to the nation's various provinces. He said: One problem the Majles must study and solve is the Plan and Budget Organization's failure to plan properly. This organization's officials must think with concern and in national terms and use study and care to identify various potentials in the farthest parts of the country. He said: For example, it is noted that of the 17 heavy projects in one of the nation's infrastructure areas, seven were implemented in the province of Esfahan alone, and the other 10 were implemented in the rest of the country. Continuing, the deputy from Izeh said: A 700-bed hospital owned by the Social Security Organization was completed and began operating in less than two years in the province of Esfahan, while construction on a comparable hospital in Khuzestan began in the year 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976] and is still 30 percent incomplete, even though the number of people served by the Social Security Organization in Khuzestan is greater. Mr. Salehi also added: There is a city in the province of Khorasan, which has all resources and even an airport, but the other cities do not have such resources, because due to relationships based on personal taste, a large part of the nation's national resources are concentrated in one place. What answer do the Plan and Budget Organization's officials have for these problems? The Majles must exercise greater care in this regard and it must assess and control the numbers and figures for expenses in the years since the revolution. In conclusion he said: Recently a bill came to the Power Commission seeking authorization to build a series of food industries 50 km from Esfahan. This created such a negative reaction among the deputies because of the unjust distribution of resources that it was unanimously rejected. This shows that enough care is not being exercised in distributing the budget.
