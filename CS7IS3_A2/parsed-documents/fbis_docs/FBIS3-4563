Hata did not specify any actions, but he predicted that international pressure would mount on North Korea to open two undeclared nuclear sites to inspection, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news conference. Hata, speaking at a meeting of government and ruling coalition leaders, also said North Korea's decision to grant visas to international inspectors has helped ease international concern about its nuclear program, Hatoyama said. An inspection team of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Vienna on Sunday to inspect seven declared nuclear sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. But so far North Korea has rejected pressure to allow inspections of two other sites at the nuclear complex that are suspected of playing a role in an alleged nuclear bomb project. North Korea issued visas to the seven-member inspection team Saturday after Pyonyang and Washington reached an accord on U.S. suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea. The inspectors are expected to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday. The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog. North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to open to checks of the two undeclared facilities.
