FR940810-2-00130 FR940810-2-00077 10. Except as noted below, each class of shares generally may be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another Fund. Class R shares may be exchanged for Class A shares of a Fund at any time at the option of a Class R shareholder, provided the current net asset value of the shareholder's Class R shares is at least $1,000. Shares of any class of a Fund, including a class with a CDSC feature, may be exchanged for shares of any money market funds sponsored by Nuveen that do not impose a sales charge and may not be subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Shareholder Service Plan (``Money Market Exchange Shares''). 1 Additionally, exchanges may be permitted among dissimilar classes at the discretion of the directors of a Fund if a shareholder ceases to be eligible to purchase shares of the original class by reason of a change in the shareholder's status. All exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 1 For purposes of imposing any applicable CDSC on redemptions of Money Market Exchange Shares (and applying any applicable conversion feature), the period during which the shareholder held the exchanged shares would be counted. A Fund may elect not to count the period during which the shareholder held the Money Market Exchange Shares. In the event that a Fund elected not to count the period during which the shareholder held the Money Market Exchange Shares, the amount of any applicable CDSC would be reduced in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3(b)(5)(i)(A) under the Act by the amount of any Plan payments to which the Money Market Exchange Shares may be subject. 11. Shares of one class (the ``Purchase Class'') will automatically convert at their net asset value to shares of another class with different features (the ``Target Class'') after the expiration of a specified period, subject to terms fully disclosed in a Fund's prospectus. This conversion feature will apply to convert Class C shares (and Class B Shares, if issued) to Class A shares, and may apply to convert shares of other classes established in the future to Class A shares. For purposes of the conversion, all Purchase Class shares in a shareholder's Fund account that were acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of such shares (and which had not yet converted) will be considered to be held in a separate subaccount. Each time any Purchase Class shares in the shareholder's Fund account are converted, an equal proportion of shares then in the subaccount also will convert, and will not longer be considered held in the subaccount. 12. Any conversion of shares will be subject to the continuing availability of an opinion of counsel or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the conversion of shares would not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. Conversion of shares might be suspended if such an opinion or ruling were no longer available. 13. Expenses attributable to a Fund but not to a particular series thereof (``Fund Expenses'') will be borne by shareholders of the Fund on the basis of relative aggregate net assets of the Fund without regard to class. In the case of a Fund that has multiple series, Fund Expenses will first be allocated among the series, based on the relative aggregate net assets of such series. Expenses that are attributable to a particular series, but not a particular class thereof would be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes. Each class will bear the Class Expenses and payments under any rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and/or Shareholder Service Plan (``Plan Payments'') applicable to such class. 14. Applicants propose that the Funds be permitted to impose a CDSC on redemptions of Class B shares. The amount of the CDSC and the timing of its imposition may vary. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of Class B shares that were purchased more than a specified period (the ``CDSC Period'') prior to redemption or on Class B shares derived from reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC Period; such a charge would be imposed, however, on the lesser of the net asset value of the shares redeemed (exclusive of any reinvestment of dividends or distributions) at the time of redemption or the net asset value of such shares at the time of purchase. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions or amounts that represent an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation, second, of shares purchased prior to the CDSC Period, and third, of shares purchased during the CDSC Period. In determining the rate of any applicable CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made of Class B shares of a Fund held for the longest period of time within the CDSC Period. The CDSC schedule will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD, as amended from time to time. 15. Applicants intend to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Funds will comply with rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act. 16. If redeemed shares upon which a CDSC was imposed are reinvested in Class B shares of the same Fund or another Fund within the period specified in the Fund's prospectus, Nuveen, as principal underwriter, will credit the shareholder's account with the amount of the CDSC previously imposed. The Class B shares acquired through such reinvestment will continue to be subject to the CDSC; the holding period of Class B shares thus acquired will include the holding period of the redeemed Class B shares. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of classes of shares representing interests in the Funds might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and thus to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act.
