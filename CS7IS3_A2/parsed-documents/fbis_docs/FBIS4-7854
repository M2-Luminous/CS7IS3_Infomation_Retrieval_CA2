He said that he will hand an application for membership to the Greek foreign minister in Athens tomorrow. The minister said a sounding among 12 EU members indicates favorable reception of Poland's application. He added that over 70 percent of Poles favor Poland's membership in the EU.

These conditions are: the existence of stable democratic institutions, the observance of human rights, the rule of law and order, legislation being adapted to EU standards, and a market economy.
