Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Communist Party Politburo and head of the party's ideology department, told PRENSA LATINA the government's decision is very clear and will not be reversed. Balaguer's assertions were made shortly after a meeting with Amalio Fiallo, a Cuban resident of Venezuela, who recently organized a workshop on participative democracy theories in the city of Camaguey, approximately 700 km east of Havana. The Communist leader said the Camaguey meeting, which was also attended by Cuban emigres who reside in the United States, besides examining an important topic like democracy, promoted improved relations between Cubans on and off the island. Now we have a better understanding of our differences and diversity of concepts and also of the things that bring us together, asserted Balaguer, who spoke highly of the workshop and about two previous seminars conducted by Fiallo in Havana. In Balaguer's opinion, these seminars are part of a process to normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, which the government will not allow to be hindered by radical emigre sectors or the hostility of the United States, where most Cubans abroad reside. Balaguer pointed out that it is not a matter of changing the emigres' ideology: Our views can differ; that will not prevent us from working with all Cubans who, regardless of where they may be, desire the best for Cuba, he said. Fiallo, meanwhile, noted that -- although he did not arrive at there thinking this way -- the seminars on participative democracy are also a means of preparing for the "nation and immigration" conference scheduled for April by the authorities and approximately 200 members of the Cuban community abroad. This effort, he said, proves that the Cuban people can sustain civilized conversations that begin with respect and end cordially and this, regardless of the topic, will foster a climate of rapprochement. In the opinion of Professor Amalio Fiallo, director of the Pro- Man Society of Caracas [Sociedad Prohombre de Caracas], a process of understanding is taking place between Cubans on the island and abroad which is viewed positively by both sides. In his opinion, nevertheless, it is necessary to separate the majority of Cubans from a small group of radical exiles who control the news media and are now intensifying their attacks in view of the April conference. Another participant in the conversation was Jerold Moser, the representative in Venezuela and the Caribbean of the Hans Seidel Foundation of Bavaria, Germany, the organization that is financing the seminars on participative democracy in Cuba as it previously did in Madrid, Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, and other U.S. cities. Moser explained to PRENSA LATINA that his institution sponsors programs in favor of dialogue and international encounters and that he supports the plan presented by Fiallo, which he views as a good example for the world, although it will be carried out among Cubans.
