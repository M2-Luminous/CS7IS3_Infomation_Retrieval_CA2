FBIS3-19473 "drweu052__a94019" FBIS-WEU-94-052-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 March 1993 ANNEX Germany Bonn Gives 'Arafat Economic, Political Support AU1603151194 Hamburg DPA in German 1425 GMT 16 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1603151194 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Tunis/Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government will give PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat political and economic support, because it considers him to be the guarantor for the continuation of the autonomy negotiations with Israel. This position of the Federal Government became known in Tunis on Tuesday [15 March] on the sidelines of a talk between 'Arafat and Juergen Moellemann, president of the German-Arab Society. However, Bonn will not support the efforts of 'Arafat, who is weakened in his own camp, to get an international armed protection force. Bonn will only advocate sending civilian observers -- with the participation of the European Union -- to the territories occupied by Israel. Bonn sees the Arab-Israeli peace process as being in a serious crisis and considers a longer delay likely. It doubts that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will take place on 13 April as planned. However, as soon as the autonomy administration has been established there, the Federal Government wants to open a German coordination office in Jericho. According to information obtained by Bonn, Israel does not rule out an attack by Islamic fundamentalists in retaliation for the massacre in Hebron. During a meeting with Moellemann on Tuesday, Tunisian Foreign Minister Ben Yahya warned against "underestimating the explosive potential of Shi'ite fundamentalism, in particular in Egypt."
