Domestic demand accounted for 0.8 percent of the inflation- adjusted growth of the gross domestic product (GDP), while external demand contributed 0.2 percent. Consumer spending gained 1.4 percent in the first three months of this year, while corporate plant and equipment investment declined 1.0 percent. The real gross national product (GNP) in the same quarter expanded by 0.8 percent from the preceding three months, or an annualized 3.3 percent. GDP and GNP are the total output of goods and services, with GDP excluding net income from overseas. Meanwhile, Japan's GDP in fiscal 1993 that ended March 31 remained unchanged from the previous year in real terms, while the real GNP decreased 0.1 percent. Of the 1.0 percent growth for the first quarter, domestic demand accounted for 0.8 percent, while external demand contributed 0.2 percent. The GDP sank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. Consumption further gained 1.4 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent rise in the previous quarter, while plant and equipment spending declined 1.0 percent but improved from a negative 3.8 percent in the October-December period. Active government spending in line with pump-priming packages helped consolidate the upward move, the EPA [Economic Planning Agency] said. The real gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter rose an annualized 3.3 percent. Of the data representing the total output of goods and services, GDP excludes income from overseas. For fiscal 1993, figures released simultaneously showed that the GDP growth remained flat, or only fractionally on the plus side of 0.03 percent. The 0.0 percent performance was the weakest since the negative performance of 0.03 percent posted in fiscal 1974. On a GNP basis, the fiscal 1993 economy shrank 0.1 percent. Returning to the GDP, the government said that as a result of the fiscal 1993 showing, the current fiscal year will technicallly see a 0.4 percent growth even if all the quarters post zero expansion. It said, however, an average 0.77 percent, or an annualized 3.12 percent, growth is necessary in each quarter in the current fiscal year to accomplish the official forecast of a 2.4 percent expansion. Private economists agree with optimistic remarks by the EPA's Tanaka, saying it looks like Japan is beginning to prepare for a major recovery. "I think the fiscal year-end factor and a reaction to the contraction in the fourth quarter of 1993 combined to boost the figure for the January-March quarter," said Atsushi Miyawaki, a senior economist at Japan Research Institute. "But generally speaking, Japan appears on the verge of an upward swing," he added. Bank of Tokyo analyst Yozo Nishimura said conditions have considerably improved and that a substantial revival can be expected in fiscal 1995 after a gradual recovery in the current fiscal year. But Miyawaki said there is still a possibility of negative growth in the April-June period in reaction to the healthy first-quarter performance. Personal income remains sluggish, he noted, and the major focus will be whether the effects of the summer income tax cuts will persist in the following months. Nishimura was a bit more optimistic and expected flat growth as the worst case for the April-June period. "The risk factor is the effect of the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which could throw cold water on buoyant export activities," he said. Economists estimate Japanese exporters have their boom-or-bust rate set at 105 yen to the dollar.
