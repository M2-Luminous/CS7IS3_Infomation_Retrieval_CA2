Even 2.5 percent is possible, Economic Chamber economist Christian Festa told a press conference yesterday, referring to a poll among 300 Austrian companies. The precondition for recovery is, however, membership in the European Union [EU]. There are positive signals from various sides: Austria is in the "early stage of economic recovery," according to experts as well as the fact that orders received are rising. This tender seed of economic growth must, however, not be destroyed by new taxes and other burdens, Guenter Stummvoll, the secretary general of the Economic Chamber, stressed. Rather, the upward development is to be supported by more flexible work time. The wave of bankruptcies is also declining: During the first five months of this year, the cost of bankruptcies reached about 10 billion schillings. During the same period last year, the cost was almost twice as high. "We have to expect an easing of the situation regarding the number of bankruptcy proceedings opened and, above all, regarding the amount of the estimated debts," Klaus Herzenberger, head of the Loan Protection Association of 1870, says, being optimistic also for the further course of the year. On the labor market the situation clearly improved at the end of May, far more than justified by the usual seasonal decline. The level of unemployment in Austria -- 4.5 percent -- is about half of that in the European OECD area as well as of the EU, which has an average unemployment rate of 11.2 percent. At the moment 194,287 unemployed are registered at the labor exchange offices, which is 6,943 fewer than at the end of May 1993 and 25,765 fewer than in April. At the same time, the number of vacancies is rising: At the moment, there are 35,000 vacant jobs. That is 2,665 more than at the end of April.
