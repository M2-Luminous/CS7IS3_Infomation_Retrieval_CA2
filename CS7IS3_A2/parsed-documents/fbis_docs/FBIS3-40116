While most people in a society with no democratic traditions were not ideologically prepared for democracy, so were unsuited to it, particularly the upper levels who were anxious about it, the push toward democracy had already become a fact, leaving the only possibility being to retreat to a second line of defense and consider its rate of advance, which was logical. In the course of drafting the Basic Law, the crux of the political-system controversy was over whether democracy would occur "fast," "slow," "more," or "less." During my time with the Basic Law Drafting Committee in Guangzhou, I had responded to a Hong Kong reporter's question on democrats and conservatives that: Hong Kong's democracy dividing line is one of radical or moderate democracy, not of democracy or conservatism (without remembering the specific words, this was my general idea). But this controversy certainly evolved into an intricate and complex dispute between China and Britain and between China and Hong Kong, becoming so complicated and confusing that it was hard for the public to see the true facts. China had designed Hong Kong's political reform pace according to Deng Xiaoping's thinking on "general elections" "proceeding step by step," which Britain had later essentially accepted in [then Hong Kong governor] Wilson's public version of "advancing gradually in due order," which Deng Xiaoping had immediately endorsed publicly. This "advancing gradually in due order" was a substitute term for "proceeding step by step." Most democracy radicals were in the middle and lower-middle levels of the middle (middle bourgeoisie) stratum, who were calling for equality of upward mobility politically, economically, and as to human values. Such calls gave no cause for much criticism, as they needed to be designed into the political system within the democratic framework of the Basic Law needing to consider them. And most democracy moderates were in the upper and middle-upper levels of society, quite a few of whom had originally not endorsed a democratic political system, but had later seen that democracy was unavoidable, so were forced to meekly submit, while still being concerned about too much or too fast democracy. The drafting of the Basic Law set off new hopes that democracy would protect vested interests, or even bring greater benefits and new enjoyments politically, economically, and as to human values. So the "proceeding step by step" or "advancing gradually in due order" principle for practicing a democratic political system, gave consideration to both democracy radicals and moderates, striving for a compromise to reduce unrest. But the varying degrees of mobilization of the various social strata was also a problem. The situation in Hong Kong at the time was that while some in the upper, middle, and grassroots levels already had democratic political and government aspirations, most people had not yet been organized. But the lower and middle level's organized "pressure groups" had already appeared in embryonic form. During the Sino-British talks, all social forces, mainly the middle level's lower-middle strata, organized various new social groups, which gradually began to collaborate. My own internal analysis at the time was that: The situation was much like that of the initial inland anti-Japanese struggle, in which various elements had organized guerrilla forces, with those possessing a few guns acting as "commanders," and "commanders sprouting up like weeds" for a time. These guerrilla forces grew, with the large eating the small, and the strong gobbling up the weak, to gradually merge into a large guerrilla force, and even into a "regular" army. And this group development in Hong Kong could also take a similar path to grow into a political party. But as most of the upper bourgeoisie had not yet awakened, while the middle and lower strata had already gone into action, society lacked organized checks and balances. As to Li Hou's proposal that the future Hong Kong SAR Government practice "the separation of powers," this was based mostly in Western nations on political-party politics, with multiparty elections and majority-party rule. As these governments had majority-party support in congress, they could ensure that their political orders were passed. But Hong Kong had no political parties, with the big and middle bourgeoisie essentially not yet having organized. Even if they had organized, it would have been hard to achieve the right climate in a short period of time. Meanwhile, the democracy radicals representing the middle and lower social strata were organized in embryonic form (after the 4 June incident, the democracy radical forces did certainly further expand to appear in a political party form). I estimated at the time that the continuation of this could very likely lead to a general situation before 1997 of one-party legislation, with antagonism after 1997 among the Chief Executive, the administrative sector, and the Legislative Council, making it impossible or hard to pass any bills, leaving nothing of the Hong Kong administration's original efficiency, and touching off political, social and internal-administration turbulence. This meant that the "separation of powers" plan was out of line with Hong Kong's realities. Before long, on 16 April 1987, Deng Xiaoping publicly disagreed in a meeting with the Hong Kong [Basic Law] Drafting Committee with the "separation of powers," showing that this idea of Li Hou and others did not conform to the Central Government spirit. Li Hou and Lu Ping also publicly stated at the time that they did not approve of the emergence of political parties in Hong Kong. This [the emergence of political parties in Hong Kong] was also out of line with Deng Xiaoping's thinking and Hong Kong's realities. So when reporters asked me about Li Hou and Lu Ping's statements, I could only respond that "those are their personal views."
