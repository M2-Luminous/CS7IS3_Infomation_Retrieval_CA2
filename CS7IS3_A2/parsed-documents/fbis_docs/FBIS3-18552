In a written statement, Aktuna said the important thing at this moment is to prevent certain DEP deputies from using their immunity as a shield and to pave way for independent justice. Parliament removed the immunity of six DEP members Wednesday [3 March] and is set to remove the immunity of another three today. "The members of Parliament will certainly act in line with the people's will," he said. "Certain DEP members had recently intensified their actions against the unity of the country." He added that a recent statement of Hatip Dicle, who described the killing of five military cadets and the injuring of 26 by a separatist terrorist organization as "a normal action in war" had created deep resentment in society. Aktuna added that the March 27 local polls will be conducted in a safe atmosphere. The DEP, which held 13 seats in the 450-seat Parliament announced a week ago that it was withdrawing from the polls.
