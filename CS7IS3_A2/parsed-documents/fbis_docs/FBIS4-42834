His main opponent for Delors' succession, Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers, seems to be virtually defeated. Indeed, generally well-informed Spanish newspapers reported that Prime Minister Gonzalez no longer supports the Netherlands Christian Democrat's candidacy. There was good news from Great Britain, too. John Major allegedly no longer intends to pronounce a veto against Dehaene. Things would take a dramatic turn for Dehaene to be kept out of Delors' seat. For the government, this is obviously not very good news, because it will become difficult to keep this coalition together without Dehaene. If the outcome of the European elections is far from brilliant, the top ministers will certainly want to get into the spotlight in the next few months. Coming to the fore, as it is called. It is a well-known fact that this is generally bad for a cabinet's harmonious functioning. However, if the polls published in recent days are confirmed on 12 June, the coalition partners have every reason to go on through the end of their legislative period. The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] no longer succeeds in reaching the 30 percent it had a few months ago. Quite on the contrary, the percentage is slowly but surely crumbling off, which could indicate that the VLD's success is inflated and far from lasting. It is not inconceivable that the recipe worked out by [VLD chairman] Verhofstadt is quite perishable. In that case, the situation might brighten up for the government parties. All they should do then, is stay in power, avoid futile disputes, and postpone the elections as long as possible. If, in the meantime, unemployment decreases and a better economic situation reduces the public deficit, they could present a fairly positive record to the voters at the end of 1995. At present, there is hardly any sign that the economic situation is changing for the better. Moreover, the population is just discovering the new taxes and savings included in the global plan. So it is possible that the government's popularity has now reached rock bottom, and that the future can only be better. If it turns out next Sunday [12 June], that the VLD is already past its peak, the government parties would have every reason to be satisfied. Even if they concede further ground compared to 1991, they could breathe more freely, and hope that the VLD danger can be averted within the foreseeable future, thus keeping Verhofstadt from implementing his liberal ideas. A VLD image-building operation can only be implemented once within a political career. For the VLD chairman, the next few months might well turn out to become an agony.
