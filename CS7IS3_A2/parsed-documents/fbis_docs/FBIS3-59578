Like worms--supplied with a long umbilical cord--the tiny machines crawl through the human body or through motors, cutting or grating here and widening there. Micromachines such as these, which take over the maintenance work in bodies or in machinery or independently carry out environmental monitoring, are still utopian. But tiny individual parts for these micromachines are already being developed. [passages omitted] Until now this field has been dominated by rigid endoscopes, through which even simple, mechanically remote-controlled tools can fit such as scissors, knives or hooks with which to catch stones, for example. Such systems are offered by the medium-sized companies Karl Storz GmbH and Co. in Tuttlingen and Richard Wolf GmbH in Knittlingen, among others, each of which has a world market share of about 30 percent. But the next generation, with which small surgical tools can find even better application, is already announcing itself: semiflexible endoscopes, such as from Fujinon (Europe) GmbH in Duesseldorf. Unlike rigid tubes, the semiflexible endoscopes can be aimed more precisely at the target in the body. Jochen Cramer, sales director for Europe at Fujinon, estimates the existing world market for such systems at DM 70 million, of which market leader Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. in Tokyo has assured itself of 85 percent. Such flexible endoscopes are also attractive when looking for damage in engines and drives. While conventional diagnosis of heavy truck engines takes almost 10 hours because the engine has to be disassembled into individual parts, with the endoscope the analysis is done in a little over 30 minutes. As in the medical field, the goal for the microtechnology developers is the independent mini-machine, which undertakes externally controlled repair work either by itself or with a joystick. Before using it in the human body, however, the researchers must still solve the energy question. While most micromachines that pass through veins, those which so far have been presented as prototypes, need power as an energy source, Wolfgang Menz, head of the Institute for Microstructure Technology at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) is concentrating on the fluidics, that is to say gases or fluids under pressure. "If we use carbon dioxide or a physiological table salt solution, that is harmless to the human," according to Menz. Over the next few years he wants to develop an intelligent endoscope subsidized by the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology: A tiny robot which moves like a submarine in the body's passages. It is equipped with a video camera which transmits live pictures on the surgical video screen. The operator who controls the submarine can manipulate various tools when needed: A router removes deposits that could lead to heart attacks on the walls of the blood vessels, a rotating knife removes diseased tissue and a needle guided by the robot hand sews up the fresh wound. Among the first users of this technology could be Raimund Erbel, head of cardiology at the University Clinic in Essen, who has specialized in prevention of heart attacks. In theory Erbel's micromachine is already perfect: a miniaturized, rotating ultrasound head which scans the interior walls of the heart and coronary vessels. The pictures from a person's inside allow for much more precise conclusions regarding the danger of heart attacks. "Right now we can only detect deposits once the vessels are already up to 40 percent closed," says Erbel. "With the ultrasound head we can see them even at five percent." Furthermore, the type of deposit can be seen. This determines the choice of tool: a diamond-equipped router, which mechanically eliminates the obstruction, or a laser which vaporizes them. The tissue waste left behind by the miniature drill is considered critical by many experts, but Erbel regards it as harmless. The tiny pieces of calcium and fat, according to the heart specialist, cannot endanger the patient. But it will be years before Erbel has to deliver proof of this. Microsystems cannot be used in the human body until after extensive tests. This gives Menz, the researcher in Karlsruhe, time to, as he hopes, develop equipment that works even more targeted and less brutally than a router. "After all, it has the effect of a hand grenade tossed into the arteries," he says with vivid criticism of the vein drill. For that reason Menz is concentrating on intelligent diagnostic capsules which can be swallowed and on their way through the body search for cancer, for example. Such a submarine could then, according to the scientist's ideas, be immediately loaded with the appropriate medicines for combating the degenerated cells.
