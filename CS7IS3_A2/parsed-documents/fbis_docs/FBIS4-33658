These measures are part of the resolution approved on 7 June by the OAS Assembly. They reinforce the economic blockade already imposed on the dictatorial Haitian regime. Their objective is to force the coupist military officers to leave power. In OAS Secretary General Ambassador Baena Soares' opinion, these measures can only be effective if all countries comply with them. Baena Soares pointed out that these same sanctions already have been approved by the OAS five times: [Begin Baena Soares recording] All that is missing is compliance with what has been approved. Sanctions, as the United Nations calls them, and measures, as the OAS calls them, can be effective, but only if they are complied with. [end recording] The blockade of Haiti was reinforced after the plenary session listened to a report by the UN and OAS representative for Haiti, (Collin Granderson). He reported on murdered and missing people, and on an escalation of raping of wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of militants who defend democracy.
