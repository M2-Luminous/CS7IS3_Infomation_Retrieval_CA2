Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "Bagrov Won With Kravchuk But Lost the Crimean Presidency" -- first two paragraphs are KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction] [Text] The Crimea has its own president. Although he has been supported by the majority of the peninsula's population, he has placed many uneasy questions before Ukraine's leadership and alarmed the world. The following interview was given on the eve of the Crimean elections. [Nepomnyashcha] The situation in the Crimea has been precisely described beyond Ukraine's borders. The Crimea is compared with Afghanistan as a potential threat to peace and stability. Has everything been done in Ukraine to prevent this threat? [Tkachuk] Since the spring of 1992, our committee has been delivering to the president and the Supreme Council documents saying that events in the Crimea have been developing in a different direction than was expected when Crimean autonomy was proclaimed. We have come forward with proposals to cancel certain presidential decrees, including the one on establishing a free economic zone, and pointed out that the Crimean Constitution contradicts the Ukrainian one, as well as signaled that Ukraine's property have been illegally confiscated. The president has kept saying: We know about all these issues and are in control of the situation. [Nepomnyashcha] Apparently, he has been afraid that a tough position of the center would call forth a similar reaction in the Crimea. [Tkachuk] First of all, this is a characteristic feature of Ukraine's mentality: It will be somehow... Second, every politician has believed that he is the wisest. What has happened with Bagrov is an appalling example. He won with Kravchuk, having de facto established his own state -- an independent Crimea -- and now, he also is outside the board. [Nepomnyashcha] In Kiev, officials have bet on Bagrov, expecting that he will win the elections and remember that the center has showed support for him. [Tkachuk] Yes, they have bet on him, which demonstrates the weakness of our political prognoses. There is a certain common law -- the expansion of power. If somebody assumes a certain amount of power, this power tends to expand. Having granted autonomy to the Crimea, we allowed the Oblast Council to be transformed into a Supreme Council. However, this should have happened by means of elections, since oblast councils have completely different personnel and intellectual potentials than a supreme one. It was naive to believe that the Oblast Council would improve its way of thinking. This is our analysis. The quicker the powers of Crimean authorities grew, the more subsidies they demanded from the center. Today, although per capita income in the Crimea ranks in the top 20 among other oblasts, the region is in the top 10 in terms of consumption. When Crimean deputies adopted a law on education, which practically eliminated the Ukrainian language, we swallowed this. We also swallowed an electoral law which eliminated Ukrainian parties from the Crimean electoral process. They have established their own banks and customs services to separate even further from Ukraine. In Kiev meanwhile, we have observed this and kept silent, hoping that Bagrov would not forget and repay our services. Today, Bagrov has ceased to exist as a political figure. [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the position of Yuriy Meshkov? Where will he lead the Crimea, having become president? [Tkachuk] I have heard several of his speeches delivered in the Crimean Supreme Council. I will quote him by heart: The yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag wants to once again tie a noose around the necks of the long-suffering people of the Crimea... This is his style. [Nepomnyashcha] While signing the tripartite statement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the Ukrainian side put emphasis on a paragraph concerning the inviolability of borders, assuming that the statement will contribute to positive resolution of the Crimean issue. [Tkachuk] What does a statement mean? If they had signed an agreement or treaty, which would have legal consequences -- meaning that it does not matter if Yeltsin or someone else is in power in Moscow, and that a country is obliged to fulfill the agreement... What, I repeat, is the legal status of a statement? [Nepomnyashcha] What is your prognosis for the development of events on the peninsula? [Tkachuk] Unfortunately, one can smell gunpowder in the air there. The situation will much depend on the Crimean Tatars' position. The Russian population of the peninsula is not very happy about returning there [to Russia]. Yuriy Meshkov emphasized this issue during his campaign. Many Ukrainians who have settled in the Crimea have lost their national roots, and the mentality of our people is rather peaceful. Tatars, on the other hand, have repeatedly stated in the Mejlis [National Assembly] their intention to fight for national liberation. Should this occur, we may see very unpleasant events in the Crimea. [Nepomnyashcha] Are there any possibilities to relieve the tensions? [Tkachuk] There are many possibilities. All that is needed is the political will, since one should take harsh steps, in particular, introduce presidential rule. [Nepomnyashcha] ...which will trigger even greater opposition on part of the new president and political forces that back him. [Tkachuk] Do you think that if we do nothing there will be peace? We used to think that way. We argued in the legislature, saying that it is better to listen to the noise of microphones here than to the cannonade of automatic weapons there. But, the latest assassination of Bagrov's aide testifies to the fact that silence does not solve problems.
