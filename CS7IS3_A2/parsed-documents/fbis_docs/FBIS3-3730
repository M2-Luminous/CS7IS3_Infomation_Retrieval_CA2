Chairman Abulaidi was interviewed by this reporter here. Abulaidi was born to a Uygur nationality handicraft family in Yining, Xinjiang. After completing his secondary education, he was admitted first to the University of Xinjiang to undertake a professional course in industrial and civil architecture, and later to Xinjiang Industrial College to undertake a professional course in electrification and automation of industrial enterprises. He graduated in 1965 and was assigned to work at the Xinjiang Institute of Architectural and Surveying Design. He was engaged in architectural and surveying design for 17 years. During this period, he acted successively as technician, professional team leader, engineer, and vice president. In 1983 he was transferred to the regional planning commission and acted successively as vice chairman and CPC committee secretary. He was in charge of the work of capital construction administration. In September 1991 he was elected vice chairman of the autonomous region while remaining in charge of capital construction work. Last November he succeeded Tomur Dawamat as acting chairman of the autonomous region. During his long career in capital construction work, he began to take part in concrete project design, then he played a part in and was in charge of the work of supervising and coordinating many large and medium-sized capital construction projects. He left his footprints everywhere. Abulaidi said: I feel a greater sense of responsibility after being elected chairman of the autonomous region today. He said frankly: Although Xinjiang is trying hard to catch up with the accelerating pace of development throughout the country, the overall level of development is still low. By the end of this century the whole country will have marched to a relatively comfortable standard of living, while Xinjiang can only match that pace if its GNP increases by 800 percent. At present, the gap between Xinjiang and the average national level is not narrowing, but widening. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are very much concerned about it, and officials and the common people of Xinjiang are even more anxious about it. At this meeting, Xinjiang has set a "rapid and highly effective" development path. In 1994, Xinjiang's GNP must reach 43.4 billion yuan, which is an increase of 11 percent over last year; and the total output value of our industry and agriculture must reach 56.5 billion yuan, which is an increase of 10.8 percent over last year. Otherwise, the door of a relatively comfortable standard of living will be shut against Xinjiang. Abulaidi is still confident of the large-scale development of Xinjiang. He said: Xinjiang has rich natural resources, and, in particular, its achievements in prospecting for and developing petroleum and nonferrous metals are spectacular. Xinjiang has gathered bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry for 16 consecutive years and achieved social stability, unity among nationalities, and a considerable scale of economic construction. Now that the state is implementing the policy of "opening up border areas," Xinjiang is in the forefront. At present, Xinjiang is making more efforts to improve the investment environment. The bottleneck which has restricted the rapid development of Xinjiang-- the problem of communications--will be fundamentally ended during the Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans; post and telecommunications will become a part of the global network of communications in August 1995; and a number of key power stations and hydropower stations are being extended and constructed. When talking about how Xinjiang maintains a stable situation, Abulaidi said that the measure taken by Xinjiang is to "do two types of work simultaneously": The first is to develop the economy, particularly the rural economy, in a rapid and highly effective manner. Xinjiang is a minority-nationality region with agriculture and animal husbandry at the core, which account for a very high proportion. At present, 300,000 people in Xinjiang still have not solved the problem of food and clothing. Only when the rural economy develops can the people live and work in peace and contentment. Hence, the key to maintaining stability in Xinjiang is to promote massive economic development, particularly massive rural development. The second is to resolutely and thoroughly fight against divisive activities among nationalities, which should never be tolerated.
