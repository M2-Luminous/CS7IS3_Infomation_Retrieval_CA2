The new appointments are Juri Luik as the foreign minister, Heiki Kranich as the finance minister, Toivo Jurgenson as the economics minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. Laar after the meeting at the presidential office at Kadriorg characterized the president's reaction to the planned changes in the Cabinet as "understanding." "The president asked a few questions," Laar said. "He will surely consider the aptitude or inaptitude of each candidate for the office at least for himself." Laar said no hindrances were to be expected from President Meri for the Cabinet changes. "I felt no such tone during the conversation with the president. This (changes in the Cabinet) is an issue to be decided upon by the coalition and the prime minister," he said. The prime minister said that in his point of view the constitution didn't allow the president to refuse from approving a minister candidate. "But there also are gaps in the constitution," Laar added.
