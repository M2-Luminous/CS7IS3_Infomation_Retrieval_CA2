Application Review Process and Criteria Initially, all applications will be reviewed to confirm that the applicant is an eligible recipient and to ensure that the application contains all the information required by the Application Contents section of this notice. Each complete application from an eligible recipient will then be evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Committee. The applications will be evaluated using the following criteria: 1. The technical merit of the proposal, including the applicant's understanding of the purpose and unique problems represented by the research objectives of this cooperative agreement program as evidenced in the description of their proposed project. The impact the proposed research effort will have on fostering development of commercially viable communication and powering enhancement systems for heavy vehicles will be evaluated. The technical merit of the proposed research effort, including the feasibility of approach, practicality, planned methodology, and anticipated results, will have the most weight of all evaluation factors. The proposal will be evaluated for demonstrated proficiency in each technical subject included in the proposal. 2. The adequacy and availability of relevant test facilities and equipment identified to accomplish the proposed research effort. 3. The applicant's previous and current organizational experience and personnel qualifications as related to this effort. 4. The completeness and clarity of the applicant's plan for accomplishing the proposed research will be evaluated. This includes the task schedule and proposed management plan needed to direct and coordinate identified project tasks. Terms and Conditions of the Award 1.
