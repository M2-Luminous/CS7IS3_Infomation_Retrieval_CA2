That is the crux of the bill Netherlander Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin and State Secretary Kosto submitted to the second Chamber on Thursday [20 January]. Under this bill, the justice minister can designate certain countries of origin as being safe countries. Safe countries must be countries where there is no fear of persecution in the sense of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. Nigeria and Russia come to mind. An asylum-seeker from such a country can have his application for admittance as a refugee immediately rejected as unfounded. Under this bill, an application from such an asylum-seeker will only be considered if he can establish circumstances which depart from the general situation in the country of origin and which arouse suspicions that he does indeed have grounds to fear persecution. According to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto, the proposed regulation is very similar to the change in asylum legislation that Germany passed on 1 July 1993. With this regulation, Hirsch Ballin and Kosto want to prevent refugees from applying for political asylum in countries with the most favorable legislation. For drawing up the list of safe countries, justice officials will consult with the Foreign Affairs Minister. They do not, however, recognize the usefulness of an advice obligation by the advisory committee on refugee affairs in designating safe countries. The Council of State had left this up to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto to consider. The country of origin is legally defined as the country where a refugee is "born and bred." The Refugee Foundation was not available for comment on Thursday. Earlier the organization had raised strong objections to the idea of safe countries because as a result, refugees are more at the mercy of their own region, where the relief and asylum procedures are worse than in the Netherlands for example.
