He said Singapore, a party committed to the concept, understood the need to realise the caucus in the very near future in the light of the conducive atmosphere both inside and outside the region. Obstacles are no longer there, more so with the change of Washington's stand (on the matter) and that of Tokyo's, he told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Singapore Foreign Minister Professor S. Jayakumar who arrived here this morning on his first visit to Malaysia. We like to see EAEC taking shape this year itself, he said, adding that the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta was working towards it. He said Prof. Jayakumar agreed that given the present circumstances, there was no reason for the caucus not to be realised soon. Abdullah said he hoped that the working relationship between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore need not be too formal and that the cordial ties should also be enhanced down the line, especially at the officials level. Being neighbours, Ablullah said, a good relationship between the officials was vital to further maintain the long-standing bilateral ties.
