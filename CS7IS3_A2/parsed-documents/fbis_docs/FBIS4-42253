Following a meeting over dinner, which was held among the representatives of the TRNC, Turkey, and the United Nations at the President's Office last night, and which lasted approximately three hours, President Rauf Denktas read out to reporters the reply given to the UN Secretariat General. The reply text stressed that the TRNC has the will to conclude an agreement with the Greek Cypriot side on the CBM issue in the hope and expectation of facilitating a comprehensive solution, which considers the realities on the island as the starting point, which is based on political and legal equality, and which consequently assures the equal distribution of authority. The text noted: Acting out of this will, the TRNC will accept the ideas concerning the access to and security of Maras proposed by Mr. Robert Lamb during the meeting held in Vienna on 11 and 12 May with Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant special envoy in Cyprus, as well as the Maras map submitted by the United Nations, on condition that the agreements with regard to the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport and the travel, foreign aid, and landing and take-off benefits to be granted to the Turkish Cypriot side reached during the said meeting on the basis of Mr. Lamb's ideas are included in the text of the agreement to be submitted to the signature of the sides. The text sent to the UN Secretariat General also declared that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to correspond with the UN officials on the above-mentioned subjects. After reading out the reply, Denktas answered reporters' questions. He said that Feissel informed him that he has certain problems, and he will contact New York. The UN officials do not want to change the 21 March document, Denktas noted. He stressed the need to seek the consent of the Turkish Cypriot side with regard to the new elements to be incorporated into the 21 March document. Responding to a remark that Greek Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis is not willing to accept any changes to the document, Denktas said: That is Kliridhis' concern. In reply to another question whether the Turkish Cypriot side is saying a conditional yes, Denktas stated: We did not say conditional. Work was done in Vienna and results were obtained. We want these results to be incorporated into this agreement. These elements must be included into the 21 March document so that they can turn into an agreement and we can sign it. On the subject of Maras, Denktas announced that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to accept the second map. Answering a reporter who reminded him of Feissel's statement before the meeting on the promises made in Vienna, Denktas said that the promises made to the Turkish Cypriots were the focus of the hours-long discussions during the meeting. In a statement after the meeting last night, Feissel said that comprehensive talks were held on all the aspects of the CBM's and that Denktas expressed his views on all the issues. Feissel declared: It was a constructive effort. Refraining from giving concrete answers to questions on the outcome of the meeting, Feissel reported that he will convey the content of the talks to the UN secretary general. He said that the CBM's are still alive. Feissel also declined to answer a question on the content of the message he will send to the UN secretary general after the meeting.
