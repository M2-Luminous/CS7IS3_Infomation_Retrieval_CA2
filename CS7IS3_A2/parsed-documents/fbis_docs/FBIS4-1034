The questioning of the seven men about their involvement will begin today. The government had previously refused to release the men for questioning since it was feared that sensitive information on South Africa's atomic and missile secrets would be exposed. Observers believe there is a strong possibility these men will supply the secret information in exchange for a new identity and residence in the United States. An offer by Armscor for these men to be indemnified and for the payment of their fines was rejected last month by American prosecutors. The men are extremely dissatisfied with the government's and Armscor's inability to arrange indemnity for them.
