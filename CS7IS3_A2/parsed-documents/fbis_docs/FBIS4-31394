Out of the 364 deputies of the Hungarian parliament, 63 percent are new faces. Not a single nonparliamenary party succeeded in exceeding the 5-percent threshold. At the same time, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] gained 54.15 percent in the recent elections. We asked Attila Agh about the long-term effects of the results of the 29 May elections. [Agh] The "six-party system" has become stronger. We can really see the spectacular nature of this development if we compare the situation with the neighboring countries: Nothing close to this occurred in Slovakia or Poland, for example. In other words, this shows the firm stability of the Hungarian party system and the fact that this party system began developing as early as the second half of the 1980's. Essentially, there has been no "newcomer" since 1987-88, although the small parties saw the possibility of getting into parliament around 1992-93, but this hope fizzled away in 1994. In the 176 election districts, the candidates who made it into parliament almost exclusively came from the six parties. All this is very rare, and it is a very Hungarian particularity. [Torok] What is the situation of the parties that can be called stable? [Agh] In Central Europe, the right of the political spectrum is generally more fragmented than the left. In my opinion, there will be a balanced party system in Central Europe when there is a consolidated center right. [Torok] What is the cause of this phenomenon? [Agh] The right-wing parties failed to modernize and the institutional continuity broke up; there is only some kind of a cultural and mental continuity here. If we had fallen on the other side of the Iron Curtain after World War II, it is possible that the Smallholders might have been forced to modernize. It transpired at the latest elections that the supporters of the clearly Christian-national middle class trend of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are to be found in the Buda districts. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] only focuses on the church issue out of a multitude of issues, and this gives them a sure 7 percent, but not more. In other words, this preserves their small-party nature. [Torok] What future do you envisage for the right-wing parties? [Agh] I envisage a lasting and very sad future for them. As long as they are unable to overcome their fragmentation, they will have few prospects ahead. We must seek the reasons for their strong historical continuity in the fact that their base of officeholders was not poor, although they have often been humiliated. They preserved their class situation and mentality, and they even passed this on to their children. This is why the late Jozsef Antall was a liberating experience for them. [Torok] In your view, what does the landslide victory of the MSZP mean? [Agh] The MSZP has no idea of the amount of difficulties they are facing, including economic problems, but let the economists speak about them. Contrary to many people, I think that the party itself does not have any factions today; there are only various cultural trends there, but factions might emerge in the future, namely three factions. Mathematically, there are bigger chances for a 209-member faction to fall into three parties, because the MDF started with fewer members in 1990, and the results are well known. In my opinion, the big question is whether the MSZP will be able to deal with these difficulties, because it is possible that various trends will find a political expression in the wake of social conflicts. [Torok] Concretely, what trends and groupings do you have in mind? [Agh] First of all, a technocratic-administrative trend. They will be the ones who argue professionally and concentrate on solving everyday problems. Another possible trend is made up of people who make a professional and ideological problem from the problems of the provinces. I would like to stress that I do not mean here the often mentioned popular-national trend whose alleged leader is Matyas Szuros; this is the chewing gum of ill-informed correspondents. This group will say that Budapest is not the center of the world, that it is important to develop the provinces, and that politics should serve the interests of the whole country. Finally, I regard the demagogic designation of the interests of the working class as the third trend. I would immediately add that I do not mean here the often mentioned trade union line; I mean that interests emerge here that might lead politics in the direction of preserving the interests and values of a classic working class. [Torok] It seems that the so-called trade union line also causes a lot of trouble to the possible coalition partners.... [Agh] As I said before, I do not see this as an acute danger in the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ]. I would also list them in the first group because they are capable of evaluating the changing world of Hungarian employees dynamically. I think that one who believes the trade union is naive enough to think that the current level of metallurgy in northern Hungary can be maintained definitely does not know Sandor Nagy and the other outstanding trade unions leaders. [Torok] Can you envisage an internal struggle between these trends within the MSZP? [Agh] I think there are possibilities for the emergence of three such trends, and the order of appearance is also an order of power. I do not think these groups will separate very much in personnel, because one can join one group in connection with one problem and another group in connection with another problem. I hope the MSZP will be able to deal with this problem and avoid the breaking up of the party into different parties. It is also important that the MSZP avoid the situation in which there is a dialogue and trends within the party but a monopolistic demand outside. I find openness very important, especially toward the intellectuals.
