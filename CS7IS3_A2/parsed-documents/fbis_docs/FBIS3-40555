In an interview with the MASHRIQ panel held in the interior minister's office in Islamabad, the minister said that the government was determined to establish the supremacy of the law at any cost. He said that the "big fish" of the drug dealing business, who were facing legal charges in the U. S. or other countries, would first have to complete all legal procedures in Pakistani courts, and, if found guilty as charged, these individuals would then be handed over to face court trials in other countries. He said that Pakistan had bilateral agreements with other countries under which Pakistan would have to extradite to these countries individuals who had committed crimes there. He said that the present government had no intention of shirking its international responsibilities. In answer to a question regarding Murtaza Bhutto, the minister of the interior said that under the policy of ensuring that the law was implemented, any individual charged with a crime, whether the individual was Murtaza Bhutto or Altaf Hussain, would receive the same treatment under the law. He said that the sentences pronounced against Murtaza Bhutto by the military courts in his absence became null and void under a former, general amnesty declared by the People's Party. The minister added that certain charges against Murtaza Bhjutto, including the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] hijacking and the Shah Bandar case, were still pending, and that Murtaza Bhutto would be given every opportunity to clear himself in a court of law. The minister said that all Pakistanis residing in foreign countries, including MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader Altaf Hussain, would be free to return to Pakistan, but those who were facing criminal charges would not be able to escape legal proceedings. In answer to a question regarding the increased smuggling of foreign products into Pakistan, the minister agreed that no Pakistani government so far had succeeded in stopping this pernicious practice. He said that, in view of the fact that markets in smuggled goods existed all over the country and thousands of individuals depended on them for their livlihood, it would not be practicable to shut down this activity entirely. He said that he had proposed that, after the payment of customs duties on foreign goods at the sale centers, these goods should be allowed free passage. In this way the checkpoints set up on the GT road, which subjected Pakistanis to humiliating searches and resulted in illegal goods being left behind [not clear; or allowed to go free?] could be abolished. In answer to a question regarding the unrestricted entry of foreigners into Pakistan and the presence of foreign spies pretending to be sailors, Babar criticized the actions of past governments, which he said had adopted a generous policy of issuing visas for free travel between Pakistan and India and which had ended the restriction on obtaining a confirmation from the police before granting visas. The minister said that, whereas in the past hardly eight or ten visas daily were granted to individuals wishing to come to Pakistan from India, the [new] policy had given rise to the undesirable practice of granting up to 800 visas daily. The minister said that the present government had reviewed the policy, and it was hoped that the situation would gradually return to normal.
