The murder was "more motivated by politics than crime", Valeriy Khomyakov, consultant of the "new regional policy" parliamentary group of which the murdered deputy was a member, said in an iterview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that the lawmaker was killed in connection with his publication of the list of 266 major criminals of the Russian underworld with their nicknames. Khomyakov called this publication "a possible version". According to the consultant, Ayzderdzis was "out of big politics" and leaned to right-wing centrists according to his sympathies. The lawmaker was in high moods at the group's meeting on Tuesday when legislators saw him the last time. He did not show any signs of anxiety, Khomyakov said. The "New Regional Policy" group at the lower house made a statement on Wednesday concerning the murder of independent legislator Ayzderdzis on April 26 who was shot point blank at the entrance to his house in Moscow's satellite city of Khimki. The statement says that a new name was added to the bleak list of contract murders, increasingly committed for political reasons. A deputy of the supreme body of power was killed for the first time. Criminals committed a heinous crime against an individual which become a common feature in Russia of late. The gaunlet was again thrown to society, the president, the government and parliament. The state, bodies of authority and law enforcement organs again strikingly displayed their helplessness and flimsiness in the struggle against crime. Further passivity and abstention from tough, energetic and resolute measures aimed at stopping and eradicating crimes and wrong-doings, puts into growing jeopardy both the life of individual people and the very existence of Russian statehood, the document stresses. The parliamentary group demanded that "the president of the Russian Federation as guarantor of human rights and freedoms should use his constitutional powers to the utmost for immediate and uncompromising work to establish law and order in this important sphere of our every-day life". The statement by the group was also signed by lower house speaker Ivan Rybkin. Following the return of the lower house's delegation from the place of the murder, speaker Rybkin announced a closed session of the house. Deputies voted at the start of the session that Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of law enforcement bodies of Russia should be present at the meeting.
