Bruce C. Vladeck, Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration. Dated: May 10, 1994. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary. Note: The following addendum and appendixes will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. Addendum_Proposed Schedule of Standardized Amounts Effective with Discharges On or After October 1, 1994 and Update Factors and Rate-of-Increase Percentages Effective With Cost Reporting Periods Beginning On or After October 1, 1994 I. Summary and Background In this addendum, we are setting forth the proposed amounts and factors for determining prospective payment rates for Medicare inpatient operating costs and Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. We are also setting forth new proposed rate-of-increase percentages for updating the target amounts for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, except for sole community hospitals and hospitals located in Puerto Rico, each hospital's payment per discharge under the prospective payment system will be comprised of 100 percent of the Federal national rate. Sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate payment: the Federal national rate, the updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 1982 cost per discharge, or the updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 1987 cost per discharge. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid on the basis of a rate per discharge comprised of 75 percent of a Puerto Rico rate and 25 percent of a national rate (section 1886(d)(9)(A) of the Act). As discussed below in section II, we are proposing to make changes in the determination of the prospective payment rates for Medicare inpatient operating costs. The changes, to be applied prospectively, would affect the calculation of the Federal rates. In section III we discuss our proposed changes for determinating the prospective payment rates for Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. Section IV sets forth our proposed changes for determining the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. The tables to which we refer in the preamble to the proposed rule are presented at the end of this addendum in section V. II. Proposed Changes to Prospective Payment Rates For Inpatient Operating Costs for FY 1995 The basic methodology for determining prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs is set forth at §412.63 for hospitals located outside of Puerto Rico. The basic methodology for determining the prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs for hospitals located in Puerto Rico is set forth at §§412.210 and 412.212. Below, we discuss the manner in which we are changing some of the factors used for determining the prospective payment rates. The Federal and Puerto Rico rate changes, once issued as final, will be effective with discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. As discussed in section IV.C of this proposed rule, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) specifies that for discharges occurring in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1994, the average standardized amount for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an other urban area. Pursuant to section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, we will update the rural standardized amount by the amount necessary to equate the rural standardized amount with the other urban standardized amount. As there will no longer be separate other urban and rural standardized amounts, we will refer to the urban and rural standardized amounts that will be effective beginning with FY 1995 as the ``other standardized amount.'' As required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act, we must adjust the DRG classifications and weighting factors for discharges in FY 1995. In summary, the proposed standardized amounts set forth in Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c of section V of this addendum reflect_ Updates of 1.1 percent for large urban and other urban hospitals (that is, the market basket percentage increase of 3.6 percent minus 2.5 percentage points) and an update for rural hospitals of approximately 8.4 percent (that is, the amount required to equate the rural standardized amount with the other urban standardized amount); •Revised labor and nonlabor shares of the national average standardized amounts to reflect the national average labor portion of the standardized amounts for urban and rural hospitals (the revised labor and nonlabor shares of the Puerto Rico standardized amounts reflect the Puerto Rico average labor portion of the standardized amounts for urban and rural hospitals); •An adjustment to ensure budget neutrality as provided for in sections 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) and (d)(3)(E) of the Act by applying new budget neutrality adjustment factors to the urban and other standardized amounts; •An adjustment to ensure budget neutrality as provided for in section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act by removing the FY 1994 budget neutrality factor and applying a revised factor; and •An adjustment to apply the revised outlier offset by removing the FY 1994 outlier offsets and applying a new offset.
