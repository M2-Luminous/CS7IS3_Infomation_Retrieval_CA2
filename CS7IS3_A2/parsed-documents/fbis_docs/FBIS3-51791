This problem, Camacho said, is reflected in three worrisome issues, whose adequate solution depends on continued confidence in the strategy and in renewed progress. The first issue, he said, involves serious concerns about the proceedings implemented through the Amnesty Law for the purpose of making it increasingly restrictive. Camacho went on to explain that this is the key issue among many difficult factors in the conflict, and if it is not resolved it may lead to the loss of a great opportunity for amnesty and the return of the EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation] nonmilitant members to their communities in a reprisal-free climate. The second issue is a question: What is the agenda and, especially, how can national issues be resolved and the Republic's institutions strengthened without upsetting the legal order? Concerning this issue, Camacho Solis pointed out that amnesty contains guarantees for the state and society and, therefore, the cessation of hostilities is a condition for its concession. The requirements for the implementation of amnesty, however, must be imaginatively and actively fulfilled. Regarding their agendas, which the fulfillment of the consolidation of the peace process depends on, Camacho said the regional agenda will, by and large, redefine the relationship between the Chiapas communities and the institutions. Changes must be made, even in public priorities, to devote more attention to the Indian regions. Meanwhile, the national agenda cannot associate the possibility of change within the country with the dynamics of an armed movement if there is to be a democratic government. The third issue, Camacho stressed, is that demands have been made of him to explain the connection between his activities and politics. In this regard, he pointed out it is essential to achieve a political solution to this conflict to ensure a favorable climate for 1994. Everyone, he insisted, must execute the policies entrusted to him. Camacho said he will be completely devoted to this task as long as he can be useful.
