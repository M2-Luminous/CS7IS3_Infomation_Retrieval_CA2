Coroas, Cuban National Center for Scientific Research, Organic Synthesis Institute at the Latvian Academy of Sciences, Riga, and Havana University Department of Mathematical Cybernetics; UDC 578.324.087:591.181] [Abstract] The ion exchange process occurring by means of ion channels in the cell membrane and the recently discovered ion channels in viral protein shells (capsides) which consist of base structural building blocks referred to as protomers linked by polypeptide chains are discussed, and it is speculated that chemical substances with the specific effect of blocking the viral or bacterial ion channel can be found. Such mechanism, if found, could make it easier to identify viral infection protection mechanisms. A mathematical model developed for designing substances with the desired ion channel blocking property which makes it possible to examine how some ions or molecules affect the state of ion channels is proposed assuming that the kinetic energy of the transported ions can be ignored. The underlying principles and realization of the mathematical model as well as its applications to the South American bean mosaic virus for Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ions are described in detail. The Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ion trajectory inside the ion channel and the electric potential magnitude at the Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ion trajectory points are plotted. The findings show that a potential barrier arises in the path of the calcium ion but does not in the case of the lithium ion, which is consistent with Silva, Cacheau, et al.
