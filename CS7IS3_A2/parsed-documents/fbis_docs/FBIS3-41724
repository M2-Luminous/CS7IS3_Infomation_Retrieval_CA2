The prices of vacation passes have risen abruptly, and the costs of maintaining a single vacationer increased last year by almost 40 times in comparison with 1991. The average cost of a pass exceeds the minimum wage set by the government 15 times. The closing and respecialization of health improvement institutions, including children's, have assumed threatening proportions, their construction has been halted for practical purposes, and health institutions are being sold off at bargain-basement prices. Diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria and tularemia, which had not been registered at all in Russia for many years, have reappeared among children. Over 1,300 illnesses occur annually in every 1,000 children and adolescents. Of 42 million children, only 10-14 percent come to primary school healthy. A resolution adopted at the meeting called for developing the ``Russian Health Resorts'' and ``Children's Vacations'' programs, and offering tax advantages and preferential loans to enterprises of the sanatorium and health resort complex. There are plans for establishing a republican reserve fund from which to compensate the expenses of travel to vacation places, and part of the cost of passes. The participants of the meeting concluded that there was a need for creating permanent interregional commissions on organizing vacations for children and laborers.
