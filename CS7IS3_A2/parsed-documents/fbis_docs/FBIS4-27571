However, since North Korea and the United States both feel that it is necessary to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date, government authorities view that the DPRK-U.S. talks can be held before 10 June at the latest. Even though the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is being delayed somewhat more than expected, the government has already reached an agreement with the United States on the strategy that it will take regarding the third round of talks. Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, who returned on 26 May after visiting the United States to deal with this matter said: "The basic position of the ROK and the United States is that both countries will make an attempt to completely resolve the North Korean nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks." In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, the two countries are of the position that the issues of completely returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]; receiving special inspection [tukpyol sachal] of unnotified facilities; and accepting the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] demand for inspection on the replacement of the fuel rods in the five-megawatt atomic reactor, must be demanded to North Korea and implemented. On the other hand, if these are implemented, the ROK and the United States agree that the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. relations and economic assistance, which North Korea is demanding, can be discussed on a comprehensive level. However, the ROK and the United States are of the position that they will not settle for a package deal which is to simultaneously exchange each other's demands, which is being demanded by North Korea. If the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is held, the government decided that it will demand that North Korea completely return to the NPT and meet the conditions of the IAEA's demands on the replacement of the fuel rods first. This is due to the judgment that since North Korea is continuing to refuse ordinary inspection [tongsang sachal] by putting forth its special status in that its withdrawal from the NPT is still being withheld, it is urgent to return North Korea to the NPT and normalize ordinary inspection. Also, using its special status, North Korea is refusing the IAEA's condition in storing the fuel rods which were selected voluntarily. Therefore, if North Korea promises to completely return to the NPT, the tug-of-war regarding the replacement of the fuel rods will be able to come to an end. The ROK and the United States decided that even during the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, if measures for nuclear safety is broken because North Korea decides to unilaterally replace the fuel rods, they will suspend the talks. However, the ROK and the United States already agreed that if North Korea completely returns to the NPT and responds to holding discussions on the issue of special inspection, they will hold a wide range of discussions on the demands made by North Korea including the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. relations. It also seems that practical discussions on methods for resuming South-North dialogue to discuss the issue of implementing the South-North declaration on denuclearization will be held at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Even though the government withdrew the exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the ROK and the United States decided that they will carry out the South-North dialogue in a mutual and supplementary way to discuss the DPRK-U.S. talks and the issue of South-North mutual inspection. In the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. relations, issues other than the nuclear issue are linked such as North Korea's missiles, human rights, and terrorism issues. Therefore, government authorities view that there is high possibility that discussions for a full-scale improvement in relations will be held at a separate political consultation which will be held after the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Regardless of this kind of strategy by the ROK and the United States, how the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will proceed will be determined in connection with how North Korea deals with this matter. Therefore, the government authorities still worry about this matter.
