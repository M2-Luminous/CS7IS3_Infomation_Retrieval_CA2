An absolute majority of top officials of rayon executive committees and city mayoralties have submitted these documents and information in a timely manner. Executive committees of such rayons as Kamenskiy, Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive Committees, as well as the mayoralties of the cities of Bendery, Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol ignore the provisions of the elections law and directives of the Central Electoral Commission, refusing to send the necessary information and organize the preparations for, and the conduct of, elections to Parliament. The aforementioned rayon executive committees and city mayoralties block the preparation for and the conduct of elections in respective rayons, and prevent residents of these population centers from exercising freely their right to elect and to be elected. Based on the above, the Central Electoral Commission resolved: 1. To demand the Government of the Republic of Moldova jointly with the executive committees of Kamenskiy, Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive Committees, as well as mayoralties of the cities of Bendery, Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol, take appropriate measures for the preparation for and the conduct of elections in these population centers in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Elections of Parliament and Parliament's Decree on the Procedures for Enacting the Law on the Elections of the Parliament dated 19 October 1993. 2. To make it incumbent upon the chairmen of Kamenskiy, Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive Committees, and the mayors of the cities of Bendery, Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol to submit for the Central Electoral Commission's approval the composition of a technical group and announcements of the mayoralties of respective population centers regarding electoral precincts, their boundaries, location, and telephone numbers, as well as proposals with respect to candidates for chairmen of precinct electoral commissions, and decisions of communities and cities councils on the composition of precinct electoral commissions before 20 December 1993. 3. To inform the Republic of Moldova's procurator of noncompliance with the Law on Elections to Parliament on the part of aforementioned rayon executive committees and city mayoralties in order to take appropriate steps in accordance with the current legislation.
