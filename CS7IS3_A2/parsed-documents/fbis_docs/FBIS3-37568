Along with the main draft prepared by the constitutional commission, an alternative draft was examined, which was proposed by one of the republic's public movements. The latter was finally adopted as a basis: it proposes the introduction of a unicameral parliament and the post of nationally elected head of the republic. Premier Vyacheslav Khudyayev, who put forward the initiative to call a republican constitutional conference, suggested that, in addition to deputies, representatives of organs of local governments, public organizations, and entrepreneurs should take part in its proceedings. According to the premier, however, the Council of Ministers "does not intend to convene the constitutional conference independently from parliament."
