She also said that FOGADE will request the implementation, as soon as possible, of the Public Credit Law, approved by the Congress for 4.15 million bolivares and earmarked to cover the payment of up to 4 million bolivares announced by Minister Sosa. Aguirre said she never agreed with the system that has been applied to handle financial aid. [Begin Aguirre recording] Our dependency on the financial system must be taken into consideration. Venezuela cannot be left without payment instruments. The procedure to attend to this insolvency crisis will be completely different from the one used in the case of the eight banks. You have asked me a number of times whether I agree with this system. I cannot. Financial aid and the insolvency crisis must be handled by the Banking Superintendency, which must detect the trouble. Once the insolvency problem is detected, the state, because the insolvency crisis is general, will take over and assume control of the bank's shares. The liabilities, however, which are the bank's most valuable possession, will remain intact. [end recording] Finally, she explained that the government is not dealing with 2 million people affected by the intervention but with 2 million banking instruments, which does not necessarily involve 2 million people because one single person may possess several instruments.
