However, such an accusation seems to be groundless. After the recent Japan-U.S. summit, Kantor told ASAHI SHIMBUN's General Bureau for America that "we will show you the list of 33 agreements." However, a spokesman for Kantor later said, "The list does not exist. We do not have enough material to compile an official list." "I think somebody briefed the USTR based on old materials." Thus, no concrete evidence was presented at all for the criticism. This criticism constitutes a basis for asserting "Japan is a nation that will not come up with results unless there are criteria for gauging the degree of market liberalization in the future." It has been an important basis for the U.S. position that "objective numerical criteria are indispensable." Senior U.S. Government officials also repeated the same criticism in public and at news conferences at least four times, and this has certainly influenced public opinion. However, if the USTR explanation is true, it means that the United States' repeated official criticism against another country did not have any clear basis. The Japanese Government has looked into past agreements, and compiled documents showing examples of remarkable results of Japanese efforts -- such as "Under the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] procurement agreement of 1980, the purchase of foreign products increased by 46 times in 12 years; and under the 1988 beef and orange agreement, beef imports increased by 1.9 times in four years" -- to refute U.S. claims. It is asking the U.S. government for an explanation. The Japanese are strongly critical of the United States because "in past negotiations, the United States has also criticized Japan based on dubious statistics." "This is the usual American lawyers' tactic of reiterating arguments that suit their purpose," (according to a Japanese negotiator). The main reason for the recent "breakdown" in the framework talks was the lack of trust between the two parties. What is needed now is not one-sided criticism and threats, but a "mature" attitude of not doing anything to aggravate this lack of trust.
