This person who is chiefly consulted on Taiwan affairs by the CPC said: The "one country, two systems" pattern advanced by Deng Xiaoping has always been the CPC's basic principle for reunifying Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. However, regarding the substantial contents of "one country, two systems," there is a lot of room for discussion. Such questions as how the government is to be composed and what the future national name will be can be settled when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait come together and talk. He cited Mao Zedong's joke that, throughout his life, Mao Zedong was most unhappy about changing the national name from the Republic of China to the PRC. This person pointed out: The point the CPC sticks to is "reunification." It also agrees to Taiwan's demand of "being master of its own affairs." The only thing that cannot be changed is that Taiwan cannot have independence or pursue the existence of two separate countries. This important policymaker pointed out: The CPC has indeed studied specific questions regarding one country, two systems including the question of a national name. But before the two sides hold face-to-face talks, the CPC will never show its "one country, two systems" hand, regarding the national name and form of government, because the CPC maintains that once they have shown their hand, the Taiwan authorities will not want to talk. Therefore, although the CPC has some ideas about the "one country, two systems," it will not publicize the specific contents. Concerning whether or not the CPC-proposed "one country, two systems" principle will change in the future, this person did not think that was possible. He said that "one country, two systems" is already the CPC's bottom line for its reunification policy and that any further concessions are out of the question.
