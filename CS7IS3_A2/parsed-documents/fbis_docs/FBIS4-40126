As has already been reported, these two powerful groupings, equipped not only with infantry weapons, but also with seven units of armor, sent their men into central Groznyy over the weekend, making a number of demands of the present Chechnya authorities. Lengthy talks were unproductive. Furthermore, on Sunday evening the insurgents shelled the building housing the National Security Department and tried to hold a rally on the city's central square. The authorities decided to eliminate the groups. By 0400 this morning forces loyal to Dzhokhar Dudayev had blocked the insurgents in one of the rayons of Groznyy and, following a long battle involving the use of armor, took by storm the four four-floor buildings that the insurgents had occupied. Eight government soldiers were killed, including Khamzat Khankarov, the commander of the Chechen formations that had been fighting in the conflict in Abkhazia. The number of victims of the other side and among civilians is still unclear. Khoza Suleymanov, badly wounded, has been arrested. It is not known what has happened to Ruslan Labazanov. Chechnya's law enforcement bodies are carrying out a search for remaining insurgents who have disappeared in the city and in the republic and who may commit individual acts of terrorism. An emergency sitting of the Chechen Cabinet has been going on in Groznyy since this morning. [Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 1300 GMT on 13 June adds: "The press service of the Chechen Interior Ministry has told ITAR-TASS that by 1200 local time the operation conducted by the forces of the Interior Ministry, the State Security Department, and the Special Purpose Detachments of the Chechen Armed Forces in the outskirts of Groznyy was completed."]
