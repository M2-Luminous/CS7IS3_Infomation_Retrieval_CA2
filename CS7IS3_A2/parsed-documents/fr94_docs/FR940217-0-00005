FR940217-0-00005 FR940217-0-00002 PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by correctly adding the following airworthiness directive (AD): 94&hyph;03&hyph;07 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8814. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;209&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this AD, within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994: (1) Perform a surface temper etch inspection and a fluorescent magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks or thermal damage of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes in accordance with the service bulletin. As a result of these inspections, accomplish either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this AD, as applicable: (i) If cracking or thermal damage is found on any bolt: Prior to further flight, replace the existing bolt with a new or serviceable bolt in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat the inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (ii) If cracking or thermal damage is not found on any bolt: Apply finish and reinstall the bolt in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat the inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (2) Perform a visual inspection to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings and the brake rod bushings at the inner cylinder fork lug end in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (b) For airplanes having line positions 132 through 518, inclusive: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this AD, within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3), as follows: (1) Install the retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; and adjust the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting; in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0125, dated November 11, 1993. (2) Remove the cross bolt from the brake housing and brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; remove the brake rod pin assembly; perform a visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; prior to further flight, replace any damaged brake rod pin assembly with a new or serviceable assembly; modify the brake rod pin assembly; install the modified brake rod pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and install a new brake attach pin retainer configuration; in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994. (3) Perform a one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or a missing piece in the bushings in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994. (c) For any bushing that is found broken and/or any bushing that is found having a piece missing during the inspection(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2), as follows: (1) Within 10 flight cycles after detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 10 flight cycles since detection. Or (2) If the affected bushing has not been replaced within 10 flight cycles after detection, observe one-brake-deactivated performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) until replacement of the affected bushing is accomplished. Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional, while operating with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for broken bushings and/or a bushing with a missing piece. (d) For any bushing that is found to be cracked or deformed during the inspection(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2), as follows: (1) Within 100 flight cycles since detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 100 flight cycles since detection. Or (2) If the affected bushing(s) has not been replaced within 100 flight cycles since detection, observe one-brake-deactivated performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved AFM until replacement of the affected bushing is accomplished. Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional, while operating with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked bushings. (e) Operators may operate beyond 60 days after the effective date of this AD with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked or broken bushings, provided that the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished. (f) Revise the Limitations and Flight Performance sections of the FAA-approved AFM (or computer generated takeoff weight tables) to include the following information. (This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM.) If the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have not been accomplished within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, the following two-brake-deactivated performance decrements must be observed until the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished. The following adjustments reflect takeoff and landing performance, assuming failure of two brakes. Operation must be performed with all brakes operative and the anti-skid system operative. Option 1 (1) Subtract 70,000 LB ( 31,750 KG) from the takeoff limited weight (the most limiting (lowest) of maximum certified, obstacle clearance, tire speed, brake energy, climb, or field length limited weight). No adjustment to the takeoff speeds for the resulting weight is required. (2) Landing Field Length_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Multiply `all brakes operative' FAR landing field length by a factor of 1.20. (3) Maximum Quick Turnaround Weight_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: No change from the `all brakes operative' value. Option 2 (1) Field Length Limited Weight_Section 4.4 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Reduce the `all brakes operative' field length limited weight by 10,500 LB (4,750 KG). The maximum allowable takeoff weight is the most limiting (lowest) of maximum certified, climb, obstacle clearance, tire speed, or this adjusted field length limited weight.
