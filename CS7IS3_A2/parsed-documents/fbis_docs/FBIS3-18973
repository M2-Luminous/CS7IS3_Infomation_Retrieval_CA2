But the Nordic colleagues will not be allowed to get away with special concessions and camouflaged trade barriers. Danish farmers are now asking the Danish Government to block the special agricultural provisions that the other Nordic countries are requesting as part of their EU membership. The negotiations on the admission of Sweden, Norway, and Finland have entered a decisive phase. They are scheduled to be completed by 1 March. But according to Danish farmers, an excess of special provisions and transition periods that are too long could shatter the big Danish expectations for the new export markets. For this reason, according to a letter to Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat), the Agricultural Council supports the EU Commission's negotiating proposal, which is described as disappointing and unsatisfactory by the applicant countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria. Danish farmers support full membership for the applicant countries. But according to Agricultural Council administrative director Klaus Bustrup, complying with the large number of demands, many of which the council regards as unrealistic and unacceptable, will mean that the countries will generally retain their present agricultural policies. This means high tariff barriers for food products, among other things. With reference to the applicants' proposals to date, for example in the veterinary area, farmers warn against a lot of special concessions that are really camouflaged trade barriers. For example, the council points out that all demands from the applicant countries concerning border checks must be rejected as obvious trade barriers. We noted that the council seems to be afraid of a lot of attempts to get provisions that are camouflaged trade barriers. "Exactly, and that would not be fair. And we cannot accept special provisions of a general nature, for example allowing the countries to have some self-sufficiency goals, as they have now -- that is inconsistent with the whole idea of a common market," Bustrup said. The applicant countries' adjustment to the EU's agricultural policies is a key problem in the admission negotiations; the southern European countries in particular have rejected giving agricultural concessions to the north European applicants. It is quite clear from the letter to the agriculture minister that farmers consider the applicants' demands too unrealistic and unacceptable. This applies among other things to transition periods, quota allocations, and subsidy rights. We asked how he thought the other Nordic countries will react when their Nordic colleagues support the strict course laid out by the EU Commission. "Naturally we are writing to the minister in this phase of the negotiations, but I think we have also been quite aboveboard with respect to our Nordic colleagues," Bustrup said.
