"Whereas the conservatives and the SPD used to be worlds apart, Labor Minister Bluem and SPD social affairs expert Dressler are congenial brothers," Kinkel stated in the party organ LIBERAL DISPATCH (April edition). The FDP leader spoke in favor of more privatization and deregulation in the economy. As a "counterforce" to the Greens, the FDP must clearly support nuclear energy as a "transitional energy," it must promote biotechnology and genetic engineering, and reject general speed limits, Kinkel pointed out. Moreover, his party should "vigorously advocate its role as the party ensuring the rule of law" and support performance elites in Germany. It is particularly important "for the FDP to be noticed both because of what it does and because of the way it does things," Kinkel continued. Credibility and style have become central political messages. "Politicians may make mistakes, but they cannot afford everything," the FPD leader stressed.
