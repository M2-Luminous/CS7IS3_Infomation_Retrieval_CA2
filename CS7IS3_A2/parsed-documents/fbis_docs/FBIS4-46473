The research that was conducted this year has shown insignificant seepage of cesium and strontium radioactive isotopes from the nuclear submarine, which attests to a seal failure of the reactor and partial destruction of the pressure hull. However, the latest measurements have shown that, although the nuclear reactor is giving off a definite background, it does not pose a serious danger. We have detected evidence of corrosion and fragments of the torpedoes' warheads in the submarine's torpedo tubes. The warheads, which are gradually being destroyed, contain plutonium and, according to the assessments of KOPRON Chairman Captain 1st Rank T. Borisov, could result in serious ecological consequences in 2-3 years. KOPRON's experts have arrived at a final conclusion: It is dangerous to salvage the "Komsomolets" and therefore it is necessary to build a special sarcophagus from the submarine's hull, having sealed the submarine's nose section and torpedo tubes using a special compound (development of the compound is continuing). The Russian Academy of Sciences, Gosatomnadzor [State Committee for Nuclear Energy Oversight], Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], environmental protection organs and the Ministry of Defense have supported the proposals of T. Borisov's committee. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.
