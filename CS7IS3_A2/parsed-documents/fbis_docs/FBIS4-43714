Only yesterday they were influential ideologues. Have they now become a mere sect--or the victims of their own success? Here is a survey of the last of the faithful. Are the free marketers out of fashion? Guy Sorman, the patented free marketer, is indignant. "As soon as our ideas are no longer challenged and our program has been implemented, it is only natural that no one would speak of us any more," he says. The impetuous crusader for mass distribution, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, does not share this fine enthusiasm. "For a year now the masks have been coming off," he says. "The protectionist arguments hold sway today. The free enterprisers have gone into hiding. To speak of deregulation or of competition has become a provocation!" Guy Sorman is not mistaken. Privatization, independence for the Bank of France, and elimination of governmental authorization for dismissals--all of which the free marketers were demanding in the early 1980's--are no longer the object of an ideological civil war, even though they have not been completely incorporated into our national ethos. Nor is Michel-Edouard Leclerc mistaken when he adds: "The right is burning its idols. During these past five years it has been distancing itself from Reaganism and Thatcherism, and ever since it encountered its first popular challenge it has been denouncing the excesses of the free-market extremists.'" As a matter of fact, how many political leaders still dare to call for the privatization of Social Security, the prisons, the ANPE [National Employment Agency], or the universities? Moreover, those in the current majority who are self-appointed advocates of "a different policy"--such as Philippe Seguin--do themselves make use of state resources. Here is an anecdote that speaks eloquently to this point: in 1985, acting in the name of free enterprise, the Center region--led by the UDF [French Democratic Union]--eliminated all forms of aid to private business. It reestablished them last year, in the name of job protection! No one will deny that Balladurism--the heir to Pompidouism--is partial to interventionist solutions such as political control of the privatized groups and the revival of regional planning, which presupposes the effective return of state intervention. The upcoming European elections are another tangible sign. Of about 10 slates of candidates, not one is openly advocating liberal principles. Quite the contrary: the Franco-British businessman Jimmy Goldsmith--who yesterday was the herald of private enterprise--occupies the second spot on the slate of Philippe de Villiers, who himself was once a free marketer but today is campaigning for protectionism and against the Europe of Maastricht. Worse still: on the eve of the elections, indications are that the supporters of European social democracy could become the leading political force in the new European Parliament, thereby relegating the free marketers to anonymity. France is not the only country in which the free-market doctrine is losing some of its luster. On the other side of the Atlantic, the neo-Keynesians have held sway since the most recent presidential election; and in Great Britain the heirs of Margaret Thatcher have been devastated by two setbacks at the polls. Even the former East bloc countries appear to have reneged on their hasty conversion to Western-style free enterprise. There is one exception, however--the exception that proves the rule: Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party is advocating solutions that are Reaganite in inspiration, despite the ideological diversity of the coalition that was victorious in the most recent elections. As one of the few French politicians who have remained faithful to their convictions of the 1980's, Alain Madelin was also the only one to be pleased at Berlusconi's victory. Even Minister of Enterprises Alain Madelin--although deploring the fact--does not deny that the free-market ideology has lost some of its attraction. "In a period of economic crisis such as the one through which we are passing," he says, "people are distrustful of the state while at the same time they are seeking its protection." Will a renewal of economic growth suffice to reverse the ideological current? The free marketers are not naive enough to believe in such a mechanical scenario. "Our discourse has been too exclusively economic in nature," Madelin adds. "We should henceforth propose reforms not merely to achieve efficiency but also to promote justice." He calls for "dialogue with a view to reestablishing the free-market philosophy." "The 1986-style free-market philosophy rapidly reached a limit--the limit of its capacity to persuade the middle classes," Herve Novelli declares. "It must do away with the elitism professed by the intellectuals." The new UDF deputy for Indre-et Loire, who is close to Alain Madelin, has enlisted under the banner of a "people's free-market program." It is a very comprehensive program indeed! With the creation of his Ideas-Action clubs, Madelin promises that by next fall there will be a program of this type to deal with issues ranging from the problems of the suburbs to medical ethics. The opposition in 1986 went to the voters with a very free-market oriented program, which candidate Jacques Chirac totally disregarded during the l988 presidential campaign. In 1993 the right soft-pedaled the free-market views held by one segment of its troops. What will happen at next year's presidential election? The free marketers are at a disadvantage from the very start, because their two principal candidates for the presidency, Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, are not serving as point men for the free-market cause. "Don't fool yourselves," Guy Sorman counters. "To distinguish himself from his opposition, Chirac will have to inject a substantial dose of free-market philosophy into his program." Could this perhaps be mere wishful thinking on Sorman's part? [Box, p 51] Politics: Free Enterprise Has Its Supporters If there were only one free marketer left, Alain Madelin would like to be that person. Not really in sync with the Balladurian policy (unlike his "friend of 30 years," Gerard Longuet, who has incorporated a measure of Colbertism [protectionism] into his free-market philosophy) and feeling too cramped in a not very important Ministry of Enterprises, Madelin decided to resume his role as an agitator of ideas. He launched his Ideas-Action clubs in a speech he made to an audience of political leaders and business executives (not all of whom were free marketers, far from it) at a meeting held on 10 March in Paris. The clubs were ostensibly designed to serve as the intellectual laboratories of the free marketers of civilian society and the world of politics (Madelin claims to have already converted approximately 100 members of Parliament to join with him). On 10 May he opened the first club in Lyons and hopes to have 100 opened by next summer. The platform of the movement will be formalized at meetings to be held this fall. According to some observers, this is a way for Alain Madelin to reestablish himself politically in the period leading up to the presidential election. With this one exception, the free marketers in the government are maintaining a conspicuous reserve. Neither the Giscardians Herve de Charette and Pascal Clement, nor the attorney Philippe Mestre, nor Francois Leotard or Edmond Alphandery have raised their voices overmuch to defend their convictions of yesterday. Yvan Blot, former RPR [Rally for the Republic] speechwriter for Jacques Chirac at the time when the latter was flirting with the free-market doctrine, has joined the National Front! As for Raymond Barre, he is hopelessly somewhere else. The new activists of the free-market cause are to be found instead among the young deputies of the majority who were elected in March 1993: for example, Herve Novelli, who followed Longuet and Madelin from the extreme right into the Republican Party [PR] and supervises the Ideas-Action clubs; Nicolas Forissier, the newly elected PR deputy for Indre; Franck Thomas-Richard (UDF) in Cher; and Claude Vissac (RPR) in the Ardennes. [Box, p 51] Business: The Revival of Colbertism Is it symbolic? Despite their differences, the two declared candidates for the presidency of the CNPF [National Council of French Employers]--Jean-Louis Giral and Jean Gandois--do not make excessive use of free-market arguments. Giral is more accurately described as a follower of Philippe Seguin's "other policy." The employers' pro-free market clubs--such as the Enterprise Institute--have been somnolent for a number of years. Except for Claude Bebear, PDG [CEO] of Axa; Michel-Edouard Leclerc, fierce opponent of the Royer law and the cultural exception [in GATT negotiations] Jacques Maillot, president of New Frontiers, who argues tirelessly for the deregulation of transportation; and Paul Dubrule, co-president of Accor, whose pro-free market convictions are firmly rooted, these business executives appear instead to welcome governmental interventionism. The presidents of the newly privatized groups cannot point an accusing finger at the tutelary state, to which they are indebted for the executive positions they hold. Worse still: for the most part, they are themselves high-ranking government officials! Although Jimmy Goldsmith--the former president of Generale Occidentale and Groupe Express--insists that he is still a free marketer, he has placed his ardor at the service of environmental protection and protectionism. His faithful follower Rene de Laportaliere--former publisher of l'EXPRESS and owner of Libertes Services (a lobbying [preceding word in English] firm in charge of preparing ready-to-use free-market projects)--is devoting himself to real-estate activities involving France and Belgium. Still another newspaper publisher who is a well-known free marketer has also disappeared from the scene: Alain Lefebvre, who returned to the professional press after having launched MAGAZINE HEBDO in the 1980's. [Box, p 52] Reflexions: Observations, Wanderings, and Survivals The pro-free market intellectuals continue to be active but seem to be living with a nostalgia for the past decade. The group of the "new economists"--Pascal Salin, Henri Lepage, Florin Aftalion, Jacques Garello, and Jean-Jacques Rosa--continues to publish its discussions in the press but is reviving issues (such as elimination of the SMIC [intervocational minimum growth wage] and deregulation of the labor market) that the government seems in no hurry to implement. "For several years now, the leading lights of the present majority have been disinclined to associate with the intellectuals of the Right," is Henri Lepage's bitter comment. This disaffection is serving to deepen the differences. By adopting positions on Europe that are not deemed to be very free-market oriented, Maurice Allais--"the" French Nobel Prizewinner for economics--has fallen out with his colleagues. Guy Sorman, author in 1984 of La Solution liberale [The Free-Market Solution], who has just published Le Capital, suite et fins [Capital: Conclusion] (published by Fayard), insists that contrary to the views expressed by orthodox free marketers such as Salin and Rosa, the market will be unable to solve the unemployment problem in Western societies. Sorman even recommends measures that are somewhat constraining for private enterprises, in an effort to induce them to hire unemployed workers who are in training. Apart from the economists, other intellectuals are preaching the good free-market doctrine as it applies to themes "that concern society." In the magazine COMMENTAIRES (which he publishes)--and in his editorials in L'EXPRESS--the lawyer Jean-Claude Casanova calls attention to the timeliness of the thinking of Raymond Aron. For his part, the philosopher Philippe Nemo--antagonist of our educational system--praises a number of free-market experiments in education and the autonomy of educational institutions. As the heir to the anarcho-free market tradition, FIGARO's editorialist and writer Alain Gerard-Slama, who is also a professor at Sciences Po, denounces the new "moral order" that involves bans on smoking, speed limits, and AIDS-prevention campaigns, all of which are constraints that would anesthetize individual responsibility. In short, the free-market concept has been broadened--and some will say that it has been diluted.
