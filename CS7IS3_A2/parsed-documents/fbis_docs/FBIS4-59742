A prominent mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the local mediations stopped following the appearance of obstacles which are insurmountable without Syrian mediation. Syria has often mediated and ironed out such obstacles in the past. The conclusions reached by the mediators were as follows: 1. Prime Minister al-Hariri insists that the cabinet must be reshuffled and made effective and he is not prepared to change that position. He is willing to discuss eliminating the difficulties in his relations with President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri after the reshuffle. Prime Minister al-Hariri bases that position on his conviction that keeping the cabinet as it is now implies the intention to get rid of him because it would mean that the cabinet would be under the threat of defeat. [passage omitted] 2. The president of the republic is agreeable to a cabinet reshuffle. The reshuffle draft al-Hariri took with him to Damascus last Saturday had the approval of the president. 3. The Chamber of Deputies speaker would support a reshuffle affecting the Interior Ministry provided that that portfolio is given to Deputy Prime Minister Engineer Michel al-Murr with the current Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij becoming state minister or social affairs minister. Birri believes that such a step would "put things right." If there is to be a reshuffle, he insists that the Finance Ministry should go to a Shiite in place of Minister Fu'ad Sinyurah. The same mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that among the obstacles which could not be overcome without Syrian mediation were the fact that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants Minister of Municipal and Village Affairs Sulayman Franjiyah out of the cabinet, and Birri's insistence that the finance minister must be a Shiite in any cabinet reshuffle.
