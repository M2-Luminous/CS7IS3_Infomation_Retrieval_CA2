This is a sign of an important change indicating that North Korea would no longer use the nuclear program as a nuclear card and that it would concentrate diplomatic efforts on resolving its economic problems. The diplomatic sources said that the current North Korean economic situation is more serious than the nuclear issue, and that North Korea would therefore accept, in any form, the comprehensive nuclear inspections [kwangbomwihan haeksachal] required by the international community during next month in accordance with the statement issued by president of the UN Security Council. They also said that China and North Korea had held meetings -- official or unofficial -- in New York, Beijing, and Vienna regarding the nuclear issue and that they had in-depth discussions to discuss North Korea's economic opening after the settlement of the nuclear issue. They predict that Kim Il-song will visit Beijing soon because the North Korean leadership, including Kim Il-song, actively supported China's economic opening during the successive visits to Pyongyang by members of the Political Bureau of the CPC and envoys of China's Liberation Army since July last year, and because Kim Il-song stressed trade development in his New Year's address.
