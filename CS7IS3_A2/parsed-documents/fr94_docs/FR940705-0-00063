FR940705-0-00063 FR940705-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG81 Active Military Service Certified Under Section 401 of Public Law 95&hyph;202 AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning persons who are included as having served on active duty. The need for this action results from recent decisions of the Secretary of the Air Force that the service of the group known as ``U.S. Civilian Flight Crew and Aviation Ground Support Employees of Northwest Airlines, Who Served Overseas as a Result of Northwest Airline's Contract with the Air Transport Command during the Period December 14, 1941 through August 14, 1945,'' and the group known as ``U.S. Civilian Female Employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps While Serving in the Defense of Bataan and Corregidor during the Period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945,'' constitutes active military service in the Armed Forces of the United States for purposes of all laws administered by VA. The effect of this action is to confer veteran status for VA benefit purposes on former members of these groups who were discharged under honorable conditions. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date is December 13, 1993, the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force determined that such service constitutes active duty. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Trowbridge, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, telephone (202) 273&hyph;7210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 401 of Public Law 95&hyph;202 authorized the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the service of members of civilian or contractual groups shall be considered active duty for the purposes of all laws administered by VA. A notice of certification of the following group by the Secretary of the Air Force appeared in the Federal Register of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 297): U.S. Civilian Flight Crew and Aviation Ground Support Employees of Northwest Airlines, Who Served Overseas as a Result of Northwest Airline's Contract with the Air Transport Command during the Period December 14, 1941 through August 14, 1945. A notice of certification of the following group by the Secretary of the Air Force appeared in the Federal Register of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 298): U.S. Civilian Female Employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps While Serving in the Defense of Bataan and Corregidor During the Period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945. VA is issuing a final rule to amend the provisions of 38 CFR 3.7(x). Because this change implements determinations of the Secretary of the Air Force in accordance with Public Law 95&hyph;202, which are binding on VA, publication as a proposal is unnecessary. Since a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published, this amendment is not a ``rule'' as defined in and made subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601(2). In any case, this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. This amendment will not directly affect any small entity. There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.
