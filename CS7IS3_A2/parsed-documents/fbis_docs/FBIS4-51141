Ma Yongwei, president of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) pledged here today to wipe out "IOU" notes in the state purchase of farm products in the summer and autumn harvest seasons. The first four-and-a-half months of 1994 saw the fastest growth of China's rural savings, a 57.4 billion yuan increase compared with the same period last year. The increase reflects a sound economic and financial situation and improved ABC services, Ma told a press conference today. "Moreover, we can expect to have adequate fund resources to finance grain purchases this year," Ma said, stressing: "We shouldn't have any excuse to give farmers IOU notes instead of cash for their harvests." According to the forecast of relevant departments, output of summer grain and rapeseed will exceed those of last year, if no major natural disasters occur during the next couple of weeks. Though easing funds strains for the ABC, the deposit increase adds some pressure to the bank's business operation, some ABC officials noted. Personal savings at present account for over 80 percent of ABC's operational capital, "with high cost of funds and considerable low-interest-rate policy lending, our bank is hardly profitable," said Ma. He revealed that the ABC netted about 2.2 billion yuan in profits in 1993, the least among the four state specialized banks. The most profitable bank in China is the Bank of China which gained a profit of nearly 10 billion yuan last year. However, a policy-oriented bank to finance agricultural production will start operation in the near future. "When we are relieved of policy lending, we have a brighter prospect to look forward to," said Ma.
