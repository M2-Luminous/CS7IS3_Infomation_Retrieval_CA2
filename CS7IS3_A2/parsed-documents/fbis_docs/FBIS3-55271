"The presidential telephone buzzed. I took the receiver. Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) says that he came to a conclusion that he needs a national security aide and that I should be that aide. I had a second to think it over." In Baturin's words, he understood that "it would be inappropriate to refuse or ask questions. ... Not because he (Yeltsin) was harsh or anything but I felt he really needed it." Baturin said that he had a first brief talk with the president about his new functions Thursday and "we'll have a more detailed conversation probably two or three days after the holidays (Russian Orthodox Christmas). "I will be coordinating the activities of special services and supervision and decision making on everyday matters which must not encumber the president," Baturin explained. He said that, in addition to foreign intelligence, services such as government communication, border guards and counterintelligence "which brings about the largest number of problems daily" report to the president. Unlike the foreign intelligence which must present a report to the president once a week, there is no telling when a decision on counterintelligence will have to be made. "The president entrusts his national security aide with making a decision jointly with the chiefs of these services. I should naturally report to the president," Baturin said. He will brief Yeltsin on the situation in general terms and report strategic issues on which the president alone has the right to make a decision. Unlike the national Security Council which is a consultative body, the national security aide "will have to do business with special services daily." Baturin said that a concept of national security existed which covered the activities of special services and defined the kinds of political and other activities which might harm Russia's national interests. He told Interfax that following his appointment he had a talk with chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service at their invitation. "Their attitude (towards establishing the position of a presidential national security aide) was very positive. They view this as an essentially new approach to security matters. We had a very good, productive, meaningful talk," Baturin said.
