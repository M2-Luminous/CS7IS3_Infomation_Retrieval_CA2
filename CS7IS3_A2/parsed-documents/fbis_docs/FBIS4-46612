Cheban, doctor of philosophical sciences: "Some Lessons From Armed Conflicts"] [Text] In various regions of the former Union, pockets of armed conflicts die out and then flare up with new strength. They sow death and destruction; thousands of refugees end up without a roof over their head and without the means of existence. Why have these tragic events become possible? What are their lessons? How do they reflect on the security of the Russian Federation? Colonel V. Cheban, doctor of philosophical sciences, discusses these problems on the pages of the journal. Armed conflicts in Nagornyy Karabakh, Moldova, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia differ in scale, nature, and intensity, but have one thing in common. They are accentuated by the death and grief of many thousands of totally innocent people. The process of disintegration of the former Union and the sovereignization of individual republics is taking place considerably more painfully and tragically than initially seemed. There was no civilized division of the territory and economic, scientific-technical, and military potential of the once powerful superpower. Just what are the bitter lessons of the armed conflicts taking place on the territory of the former Union? Lesson One. Above all, what is striking is the fact that the creation of independent states is taking place on the basis of absolutization by certain social forces and sections of society of their interests exclusively, while completely ignoring the quite just interests of other people. Nationalism, political ambitiousness, and separatism have one common denominator--egoism. It is this that blinds leaders, social trends, and social forces when vitally important problems are being resolved. Inability, impatience, and unwillingness of leaders, social groupings, and government circles to resolve unsettled problems by a civilized method naturally bring egoism and ambitiousness to a most extreme and dangerous form of their manifestation--to armed violence. Here the assumption is made on using fear as the main instrument of socio-psychological control of society or its individual groups. A shifting of priorities of dominating or imposing one's will on others in the direction of moral and physical terror is indicated by the inability or unwillingness to handle the situation by other unarmed means. Lesson Two. Destruction of statehood, the lack of a legal system of coordinates, the arising legal nihilism of citizens, aggravation of social contradictions, decline in the standard of living, endless wide-scale social experiments exhausting the patience of the people, and the limit of trust in the leadership at all levels create favorable conditions for armed conflicts. In addition, extreme in criticism of law enforcement agencies, institutions of state security, internal affairs bodies, and the army, along with searching for real shortcomings, not only makes it difficult for these institutions to perform state functions but also undermines their authority as a barrier in the path of destructive forces and criminals. The hasty and accelerated division of the armed forces and the rash "privatization" of combat equipment and armament resulted in weapons not only becoming a terrible tool in the hands of extremists and criminals but also one of the most popular instruments of "big-time politics." Lesson Three. The long struggle with the "center" and the charged state of lower power structures and administrative formations for confrontation with higher authorities resulted in the boomerang effect: the initiator of criticism of the center is itself becoming the object of criticism "from below." The republics' struggle against the Union center turned into a struggle of autonomies against the former republics. For example, Georgia's persistent desire to leave the Union and the endless accusations against Moscow of "interference" and "imperial ways" led to Georgia itself being on the verge of collapse. Abkhazia and Osetia have tried to "swallow" sovereignty as much as they wanted, and the Georgian government sent military there. Now charges of "imperial ways" and "genocide" have been made against Tbilisi. Moldova acted similarly with respect to the former Union. The desire to move a little farther away from the "totalitarian regime of Moscow" was encouraged in every way at the state and public levels. However, it took the Dniester region to declare its right to independence (particularly after a discriminatory law on a state language was passed in Moldova), and the leadership of Moldova began to restore "constitutional order" by force of arms. The struggle with "separatists" developed into a real war against its own people. Ukraine also has not been spared from the boomerang of sovereignization. If you consider that the Crimea, Western Ukraine, and its eastern areas have an eye on independence, the future is not problem-free in this respect. The development of events in the Dniester region is also similar to the Baltic region. Here there is an absolutization of only the national interests, with complete ignoring of the interests of the Russian-speaking population. The epidemic of sovereignization has also infected Russia. Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechen, and also regions of the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East are hatching not only theoretical but also practical plans for establishing their independence from the Russian center. So, the formula "trouble comes to him who makes trouble for others" is most appropriate for illustrating the current method of sovereignization, when the egoistic, aggressive method is the most popular. Lesson Four. Armed conflicts have shown that despite the proclaimed end of the Cold War and the loud statements about the de-ideologization of international, interethnic, and other social relations, they are still tied to the old normal routine of the past of confrontation between social systems and ideological biases. Gravitation toward the old method of resolving unsettled problems leads to the fact that something fundamentally new is not emerging, but something old and well-known is being revived. Thus, for the Baltic region, the "renewal" developed into the restoration of laws from the 1940's. For the Transcaucasus, the 1920's have been taken as the reference point, when the violent processes of sovereignization took place against the background of a general transformation of the Russian Empire. In Central Asia, renewal was directed even deeper into the past, out of loyalty to old medieval traditions, beginning with absolutization of religion and its role in the spiritual life of society and ending with the unprecedented honoring of the "great people": the bays, khans, emirs, and the like. Renewal in Ukraine includes resuscitation of nationalistic-type trends, movements, and organizations, which in the past fought against the Soviet Union on the side of Hitler. Armed conflicts also are not isolated from geopolitical relations and the interests of foreign states. Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran, not to mention the United States, Germany, Japan, France, and Great Britain, are closely observing events on the territory of the former Union. And observation is developing into an active military policy. For example, a violation of human rights in the Baltic is not noticed by either the United States, Germany, Japan, France, or England, since they are traditionally impressed by the "bold actions of small states" against the "Russian Empire." They do not conceal the plans for armed intervention in the event "Russia attacks Lithuania." Lesson Five. The same pattern of the outbreak and development of armed conflicts is repeated. Initially, one of the belligerents makes an unambiguous threat to use weapons. Then shots actually ring out, which "fortunately" do not result in casualties. Then exchanges of gunfire between "unknown persons" begin, this time resulting in casualties. At this time, various versions and assumptions emerge and are circulated in public opinion, and the initiators of the conflict closely monitor the nature of the reaction to the armed clashes. If a wave of indignation rises over isolated incidents of terror, the armed actions temporarily die down. When they pass by the "angry vessel" of public opinion, the next step is taken: an armed attack of a wider scale is made. It is natural that retaliatory measures immediately follow with such a development of events, and new victims appear. The initiators of the conflict present these victims as a reason for further escalation of tension and confrontation. A new spiral in the bloody fighting begins. As an analysis of events shows, the flywheel of armed conflicts unwinds according to this sinister scenario largely because one of the main conditions for ending them is not met: the public does not receive a timely and specific answer to the question. Who is to blame? The concept of "aggressor" has virtually disappeared from diplomatic and political affairs. Meanwhile, the analysis and prevention of any conflict also begin with the clear definition of this "character." Dissolution of the "aggressor" in a mass of abstract factors gives him an incentive for further aggressive actions and makes the victim even more defenseless. Lesson Six. Armed conflicts are noted for special cruelty with respect to the totally innocent population. This largely explains the great losses among residents of cities and villages. The reason is that the use of weapons is intended not so much for destroying the armed enemy as for intimidating and frightening the unarmed person. For what purpose is this done? As fact indicate, in order to achieve success in their plans, the participants in armed conflicts strive to intimidate the population supporting the opposing side. However, the fear of being killed and the element of revenge for family and friends who have died even further deform people's psyche, already overloaded with negative emotions. All this leads to even greater bitterness in the merciless fight. Hence the guerrilla-like actions, hostage-taking, sporadic exchanges of gunfire, and the lack of a rigid centralization in the subordination of various paramilitary formations due to the "independence" of the fighters. Lesson Seven. All the capabilities of the ties between themselves, both for vertical structures of the opposing sides (government--army--local authorities--local internal affairs bodies--individual citizens) and for contacts between them horizontally (government to government; army to army; social movements to social movements; local members of parliament to local members of parliament from the other side; fraternization of persons involved directly in the conflict), are far from being fully utilized for blocking and ending the armed conflicts. The distinctive protective functions of the "monasteries," which virtually all military garrisons have and where peaceloving citizens can take shelter from terrorism, are also being used insufficiently. A serious obstacle to putting a stop to armed conflicts in the initial stage is the false shame of ruling circles and social movements in taking decisive measures for fear of being categorized as "undemocratic," "uncivilized," "imperial," "hegemonic," "totalitarian," and the like. As a result, in striving to preserve political virginity, the governments of neighboring countries free the hands of the aggressor though their inaction. Lesson Eight. In an interrelated and interdependent world, armed conflicts do not pass without a trace. They are transformed and influence many states and peoples through a system of economic, political, and geopolitical ties. Disruption or severing of economic and trade ties adversely affects the economic life of countries far from the conflict. In turn, discrediting, violating human rights, persecution, and genocide create a migratory wave that is capable of tearing down the social foundations in neighboring states, aggravating the internal situation in them, and causing new conflicts. It is never someone else's problem. It is necessary to treat all conflicts with heightened attention. That is why one should master lesson nine. It is necessary to fight armed conflicts, as well as wars, long before them break out. For this purpose it is necessary to have a developed system of blocking armed conflicts and an effective mechanism for preventing and stopping them. This discussion will continue in the next article.
