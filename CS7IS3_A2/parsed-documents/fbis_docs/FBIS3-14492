In a resolution passed at the end of its meetings the Arab League Council expressed its complete support for the proposal put (?forward) by the the general secretariat which calls for a just trial for the suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice in the Hague emphasising to the Security Council the importance of following through such a proposal taking into account the need for a peaceful solution to prevent an escalation which would lead to an increase in tension in the region. The Arab League Council entrusted the secretary general with the task of following up the execution of the resolution while also expressing its full appreciation for the Great Jamahiriyah's initiative to solve this crisis in a peaceful and just manner. The Arab League Council then reiterated its condemnation of the continuation of the unjust harsh measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah as a result of the baseless resolution imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah by the Security Council at the bidding of the Western countries expressing its extreme concern at the human and material effects of these unjust measures. The Arab League's Resolution was as follows: `The League's Council, referring to Resolution 5156 of 5/12/1991, 5158 of 16/1/1992, 5156 of 22/2/1992, 5224 of 13/9/ 1992, 5281 of 19/4/1993 and 5328 of 21/9/ 1993 concerning the harsh measures and threats which the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah is being subjected to by the United States, Britain and France. Does refer to Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, dealing with the solving of conflicts through negotiation, mediation and judicial settlements, does express its extreme concern at the human and other suffering incurred by the Libyan people and neighboring countries as a result of UN Security Council Resolution 748 of 1992 and 883 of 1993, and does express its full appreciation for the positive initiatives (?undertaken by) Libyan to solve this crisis and its positive response to the stipulations of UN Security Council Resolution 731, and does therefore express its extreme concern for the escalation of the crisis by imposing additional sanctions and the threat of the use of force, a method which is a violation of all international conventions and international law. Does also express its appreciation for the efforts exerted by the seven-member committee and the secretary general of the Arab League in order to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict. After an examination of the general secretariat's memorandum, and after a perusal of the latest developments of the matter, does therefore decide: 1) To reaffirm its previous resolutions concerning solidarity with the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and support for its efforts in arriving at a peaceful solution to the crisis within the framework of respect for Libyan national sovereignty and the principles of international law. 2) To support the recommendtion of the general secretariat calling for a just trial for the suspects, presided over by Scottish judges and held according to Scottish law at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice in the Hague. It urged the Security Council to take this serious and novel recommendation into account in order to seek a peaceful solution to prevent an escalation which would serve to increase the tension in the region.
