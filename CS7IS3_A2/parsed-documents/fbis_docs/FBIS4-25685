FBIS4-25685 "drchi114_k_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-114 Daily Report 1 May 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social QIUSHI Urges Reliance on Working Class QIUSHI Urges Reliance on Working Class HK1306122894 Beijing QIUSHI in Chinese No 9, 1 May 94 pp 2-6, 17 HK1306122894 Beijing QIUSHI Chinese BFN [By Wei Jianxing (1414 0256 5887): "It Is Necessary To Wholeheartedly Rely on the Working Class in Reform, Development, and Stability"] [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress has put forward the goal of reform to build the system of a socialist market economy and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress has adopted the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee on Some Questions Concerning the Building of the System of a Socialist Market Economy," symbolizing that China's economic structural reform has entered a stage of storming fortifications and in which all-out advance and major breakthroughs are integrated. This year is a crucial year for China to accelerate building the new economic system and carry out comprehensive and in-depth reform. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance, the whole country is implementing the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and its Third Plenary Session in an overall manner and various jobs are vigorously developing closely around the center of the basic principles of the party and the state for the work this year, they are also conscientiously obeying and serving the overall situation of "grasping the opportune moment, carrying out in-depth reform, expanding opening-up, promoting development, and maintaining stability." As the leading class in the state, and the representative of advanced productive forces and relations of production, the working class takes an extremely important position in reform, development, and stability. It is of extremely important significance at present and in the future to rely wholeheartedly on the working class and handle well the relations of reform, development, and stability. I. At present, China enjoys economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. Various undertakings are full of vitality and the situation is favorable. The international situation as a whole is favorable to China's development. The better the situation, the more we should grasp the opportune moment, make good use of it, keep sober-minded, and fully see the challenges we face and the existing problems. We should be prepared for danger in times of peace, work more conscientiously, strive to develop ourselves, and promote the overall development of the building of two civilizations. More than 10 years of practice in China's reform and construction have told us that reform is the motive force, development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee. We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class to handle well the relations between reform, development, and stability, enabling them to promote each other and develop in a coordinated way. If we give up relying on the working class, we cannot talk about achieving anything. Reform is the cause of the working class and the masses of the people themselves. The Chinese working class has displayed extremely great political enthusiasm in reform and has always stood in the forefront of reform, the road to a powerful nation, with a high sense of responsibility of being the master of its own affairs. It has the cardinal principles in mind and takes the overall situation into account, actively supporting the introduction of various reform measures. It takes part in and promotes various reforms of its own accord and the brilliant achievements it has made has gone down in history forever. According to an investigation by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the situation regarding the working class contingent, the broad masses of staff and workers have made fine appraisals of the achievements in reform for more than 10 years in China, positively supporting and favoring further in-depth reform and expansion of opening-up. When their interests become involved in some reforms, the broad masses of staff and workers say that as long as it is favorable to the overall situation of reforms, and as long as they can bear it economically, they will support the reforms resolutely. The correct understanding and treatment of various new things and new issues which emerge in reform displayed by the broad masses of staff and workers, the spirit of being the master of one's own affairs and of daring to meet difficulties head-on, and the style and features of the times of being bold in dedication and creation, have effectively ensured the smooth progress of reform. The working class has proved by its own practical actions that it is the master and the subject of reform and that it is worthy of its powerful motivational force. Today, as we are carrying out in-depth reform, it is an extremely important task for the whole party and the whole society to bring into better play this powerful motivational force. The working class is the main force that promotes China's economic development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: Grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and the crux is to develop the economy. Development is a tough argument, is the overall situation, and the crux. During various periods of the Chinese revolution and construction, the working class have made huge contributions to national emancipation and to making China prosperous and strong. Under the new situation of reform and opening-up and modernization, the working class has again performed immortal deeds promoting the building of the socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization. Labor creation by staff and workers trhoughout China accounts for about 70 percent of the GNP and over 90 percent of state revenue. Facing the market and basing themselves on their own jobs, the broad masses of staff and workers have made remarkable achievements in developing new products, raising product quality, concentrating their efforts on constant improvement of labor productivity and economic performance, and pushing to the market sphere the socialist labor emulation drive, rationalization proposals, invention and creation, technological innovation, technological coordination, and other activities. The huge achievements made in China's economic development are an embodiment of the industriousness, wisdom, and sweat of the working class whose main force role in the socialist modernization program has been fully displayed. The working class uses its own advanced ideas to influence and nurture the whole society and promotes the building of the socialist spiritual civilization. Its extensive impact and leading force is self-evident. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy all the more calls for the protection, guidance, and mobilization of the main and leading force. The working class is the mainstay in safeguarding social stability. The importance of social political stability lies in the stability of the working class contingent, which is the premise and basis of social stability. The working class in China greatly treasures the political situation of stability and unity. Whether in the face of complex social contradictions, or under a changeable international situation, it always rallies closely round the party Central Committee. It not only maintains the stability of its contingent but also makes huge efforts to maintain social political stability, thus vigorously safeguarding social political stability. In-depth reform, expansion of opening-up, and promotion of development must be carried out in a stable social political environment. "The working class can be relied upon." Consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity by relying on the working class, try to accomplish promotion of reform and development amidst stability and ensure long-term social stability by reform and development. These are the requirements of the times and also the historical responsibilities of the working class. The nature of our party and the state, and the historical task of reform, development, and stability, determine that we must at all times and under any circumstances uphold, unswervingly and with a clear-cut stand, the party's fundamental guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the working class. The nature of a country depends on what position the people of that country take and what kind of relationship exists between man and man. Our party is the vanguard of the working class and the working class is the class basis of our party; ours is a socialist country of a people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class and with worker-peasant alliance as the basis, and the working class is the leading class of the state. Only under the party's leadership can the working class achieve its historical mission and only by closely relying on the working class can the party consolidate and strengthen its leading position and lead the people of the whole country in striving to achieve the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The difficulty in developing a socialist market economy lies in how to link and integrate closely the market economy with the basic system of socialism. This is an unprecedented great cause, without existing experience, which can be utilized. It is required to be daring in exploration, bold in practice, and constant in innovation under the leadership of the party Central Committee by relying wholeheartedly on the working class and the masses of the people. In this historical process, the inevitable trend is that socialist public ownership occupies a leading position, with joint development of diversified economic sectors. To each, according to his labor, will be the major form and multiple forms of distribution to co-exist over a long period of time with some areas; some people will be allowed to become rich first and finally achieve common prosperity. The state controls the power to carry out effective macroeconomic regulation and control over the national economy as a whole. Therefore, in the course of developing a socialist market economy, China's socialist system remains unchanged, the nature of the state remains unchanged, the working class being the leading class of the state remains unchanged, the working class being the class basis of the party remains unchanged, and the working class, as the master of its own affairs, remains unchanged. The subjects of a socialist market economy are enterprises and the subjects of enterprises are staff and workers. Market is the external motive force for enterprise development and the initiatives, wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers are sources of enterprise vitality. That is to say, the extent to which the initiatives of the working class are given play directly affects the success or failure of reform and opening-up and the extent to which productive forces are emancipated and developed, having a bearing on the fate of a socialist market economy. Therefore, to develop a socialist market economy, we must attach great importance to relying on the masses of staff and workers and fully mobilize their initiatives, with which to push forward reform, promote development, and safeguard stability. This is both the requirement by the overall situation of reform, development, and stability, as well as the essence and superiority of the socialist system. II. In the overall situation of reform, development, and stability, how to rely wholeheartedly on the working class is a question which is highly theoretical and practical, with a strong policy nature. It is also a hot issue about which the broad masses of staff and workers are concerned. In this respect, we have many laws, legal regulations, and policies to serve as a basis, and also many successful practices and experiences which we may use for reference and study. At present, we should lay special emphasis on the issues in the following aspects: First, we must start by grasping understanding, and further heighten understanding, of the importance of relying wholeheartedly on the working class. Whom to rely on is a matter of the first importance for the revolution and construction and is also a matter of the first importance for reform, development, and stability. Not everyone understands this clearly. Needless to say, with the development of the situation, many new circumstances and new problems have appeared which merit our attention concerning whom to rely on to carry out in-depth reform, promote development, and maintain stability. Therefore, on this matter, we must first overcome the problem of understanding, especially the problem of understanding on the part of the party and government leading cadres. We should understand the extreme importance of relying wholeheartedly on the working class from the height of safeguarding the nature of the party, safeguarding China's state system and government system, and implementing the party's fundamental guiding principles. It is necessary to propagate extensively, through multiple forms and channels, the advanced ideas of the working class, its fine quality, and the great achievements and huge contributions it has made, and strive to build up in the whole society a powerful public opinion and strong atmosphere of respecting and relying on the working class. In view of the fact that many comrades among leading cadres have taken up new leading posts,ng leading cadres have taken up new leading posts, and that they are not adequately familiar with the party's mass work and mass line, it is required that party organizations at various levels carry out re-education on relying on the working class and the mass line among party cadres, especially among young leading cadres. In party schools, administrative cadre schools, and in the teaching of cadre training, we should add courses about the working class, the workers' movement, and the party's mass work according to the requirements by the CPC Central Committee "Circular on Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over the Work of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation," to lay a favorable ideological foundation for ensuring the implementation of this fundamental guiding principle. Second, we must fully embody and safeguard the status of staff and workers of being the masters of their own affairs in labor legislation and reform measures. The party's fundamental guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the working class must be fully embodied in labor legislation, economic laws and regulations, and reform measures. Otherwise, relying on the working class would be an empty phrase. China's labor laws and regulations are unsound and are far from meeting the requirements for regulating the ever complicated labor relations in the transformation to a socialist market economy. We should work out as soon as possible the "Labor Law," "Social Insurance Law," "Labor Protection law," "Labor Contract Law," "Work Hours Law," and a number of other important laws and regulation. Before the introduction of these important laws and regulation, policies, and measures involving the vital interests of staff and workers, we should fully listen to the opinions and proposals of the broad masses of staff and workers through various channels and forms, so that laws and regulations, policies, and measures are built on a profound mass basis. It is necessary to ensure, through labor regulations and reform measures, that the broad masses of staff and workers constantly raise, with economic development, their material and cultural levels and living standards, constantly improve labor conditions and working environments, constantly create opportunities for occupational training, enter decisionmaking bodies more effectively, and participate in the management of the affairs of the state, and also social and economic affairs. At present, it is especially necessary to strengthen mass supervision over law enforcement and to build a mechanism for effective mass supervision. Party and government departments at various levels should accept of their own accord the supervision by staff and workers and the broad masses of the people, thus placing various jobs under supervision by the masses. Leading cadres should constantly go deep among the masses, go down to the grass-roots units, care for the suffering of staff and workers, listen to the voice of the masses, and take the "first signal" from the masses of staff and workers as a major basis for decisionmaking. In various reforms involving the vital interests of staff and workers, it is necessary to uphold the principles that decisionmaking is scientific and democratic, that staff and workers as a whole are benefited, that the overall bearing capacity of staff and workers should be taken into full account, and that the basic living standards of staff and workers is ensured. This is both the requirement that "reform is for the people" and also the specific embodiment of relying wholeheartedly on the working class. Third, we must rely on staff and workers to transform state-owned enterprise operational mechanisms and promote the building of a modern enterprise system, so that the status and the right of staff and workers to be the masters of their own affairs will be conscientiously implemented in enterprises. The transformation of state-owned enterprise operational mechanisms, in particular the building of a modern enterprise system, is an innovation of the socialist enterprise system and is an inevitable requirement for big socialized production and the development of a socialist market economy. One of the important features of a modern enterprise system with Chinese characteristics is to build a scientific enterprise leadership system and organizational and management system. State-owned enterprise mechanism transformation and system building did not, and will not, change the status of staff and workers of being the masters of their own affairs in enterprises. When staff and workers lose their status of being the masters of their own affairs in enterprises, enterprises lose their socialist nature. To uphold and improve the democratic management system with staff and workers representative conferences as the basic form, and to constantly explore new forms of realizing staff and workers democratic management and democratic supervision, are important contents of relying on staff and workers for mechanism transformation and system building and are the essential property of socialist enterprises. This year, departments concerned in the State Council will organize a number of large and medium state-owned enterprises to make experiments on building a modern enterprise system according to the requirements of the "Corporations Law" to explore the effective ways of integrating public ownership with market economy to further emancipate and develop the productive forces. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress clearly pointed out: "Trade unions and staff and workers representative conferences should organize staff and workers to take part in enterprise democratic management and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. Therefore, state-owned and collective enterprises, whether they practise a contract-based system or a shareholding system, or enterprise groups carrying out corporation transformation and development, must carry out staff and workers democratic management. According to the stipulations in the `Corporations Law,' limited liability companies set up by state-owned sole proprietorship enterprises, by more than two state-owned enterprises, or by more than two state-owned investment subjects, carry out democratic management through staff and workers representative conferences and other forms according to the Constitution and regulations in relevant laws." Regarding the functions and powers of staff and workers representative conferences, the regulations of the "Enterprises Law" should be carried out in principle and we should study and solve new problems in adapting to the requirements of the corporation system. When boards of directors, supervisory boards, and shareholders general meetings are set up in these types of enterprises, a certain number of staff and workers representatives should be elected by the whole staff and workers or by staff and workers representative conferences of enterprises, to take part in these bodies. In public ownership and nonpublic ownership enterprises, especially in foreign business-invested enterprises and private enterprises, it is necessary to set up a system of consultations and negotiations and of signing collective contracts. Trade unions should carry out on behalf of staff and workers and enterprises equal consultations and negotiations on labor remuneration, working hours, holidays and vacations, labor protection, insurance welfare, women's special protection, and other labor rights and interests, and sign collective contracts which standardize the relations of both parties, promote cooperation between both parties, and build up stable and coordinated labor relations, thus implementing the principle of relying on the working class in enterprises. Fourth, we should conscientiously ensure and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers and do practical jobs and good things for them. While continuing to safeguard the political and democratic rights of staff and workers, it is a major issue that cannot be neglected to attach importance to safeguarding the material interests and the right to work of staff and workers. This has a direct function and impact on getting hold of the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. The "Decision" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress pointed out that it was necessary to respect the pioneering spirit of the masses and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. The task of reform and development this year is extremely heavy and many reform measures of great strength and involving a wide range of subjects have been, or will be, introduced. It is really not an easy job to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy and to maintain social stability in the course of speeding up transformation of the system. Thus, in promoting various reforms, developing various jobs, and handling various contradiction relations, we are required to pay much attention to understanding the ideological sentiments of staff and workers and help them solve practical problems of our own accord while conscientiously safeguarding their rights and interests. At present, there are some problems with the bearing capacity of staff in the various localities in the course of turning losses into increased profits for loss-making enterprises, of placement of enterprise surplus staff and workers and bankrupt enterprise staff and workers, occupational recommendations, relief and basic livelihood guarantees for staff and workers who are badly off, social insurance system, housing system, and pricing system, as well as problems that have appeared in delayed payment of wages and pensions for staff and workers in some organizations, government departments concerned and enterprises should solve the above problems properly and strictly in accordance with relevant state regulations. We should give priority to efficiency and consideration to fair play, reform the distribution system, and accomplish the combination of responsibility, power, and interests, the unity of state, collective, and individual interests, and the linkage of the labor of staff and workers with their labor results, thereby truly embodying the principle of to each according to his labor. We should quicken the pace of reform of the social insurance system and build a mechanism to safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of staff and workers. We should work out standards of guarantees for staff and workers basic livelihoods and build the lowest wage system and a mechanism for normal wage growth. Fifth, to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, we must bring the role of trade union organizations into full play. As a mass organization for the working class, trade unions are bridges and ties of the party which link with the masses of staff and workers. They are also social pillars of state powers. With the development of a socialist market economy, the pattern of interests of the three sides; that is, the state, the collective, and individuals, will gradually take shape. Trade unions are the outcome of labor relations and economic contradictions. Their status as representatives safeguarding the interests of staff and workers has become more obvious and their role of democratic channels and social regulation has become more outstanding. They will shoulder more arduous tasks and play a more important role. Therefore, party committees at various levels should strengthen and improve their leadership over trade union work according to the spirit of the central authorities, place it in an important position on the agenda, attach importance to and strengthen the building of trade union leading bodies, and help them further open up the channels for participating in the government and discussing political affairs. In the course of experimenting on the reform of building a modern enterprise system, government departments concerned should, according to laws and regulation and the spirit of directives by the central authorities, absorb trade unions into taking part in relevant experimental work in the whole process and in all directions, including participation in working bodies, drafting documents, and making experiments and carrying out follow-up investigations together. Government and trade unions should strengthen communications and contacts through informal discussions and joint meetings. It is necessary to clarify the status and position of trade unions in representing the interests of staff and workers in the face of the government and enterprises, support them in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers according to law, regulate labor relations, and to organize staff and workers to develop activities. It is necessary to promote various localities to work out detailed rules and regulations for the implementation of the "Trade Unions law" and further clarify the rights and duties of trade unions. It is necessary to support and help trade union organizations to strengthen reform and building themselves, carry out positive explorations in the organizational system, operational mechanism, and methods of activities, accelerate the democratization process and carrying out the mass line, and bring the role of trade union organizations into full play. III. To develop a socialist market economy is the great creative cause of the Chinese working class and the people of various nationalities in China. All staff and workers in China should fully understand the historical importance of the task they shoulder; they should continue to develop the glorious traditions of the working class in the overall situation of reform, development, and stability; and they should further give play to the spirit of being the masters of their own affairs and the role of the main force; and make new and greater contributions. --The working class should continue to develop the spirit of building an enterprise through arduous effort, regard emancipating and developing the productive forces as its own responsibility, and make greater efforts to speed up economic development. With a high sense of responsibility of being the master of its own affairs, it should bring its enthusiasm, initiatives, and creativity into full play; base itself on its own jobs; learn and catch up with the advanced; and strive to make first-rate achievements. It is necessary to try to improve product quality, provide best quality services, heighten labor productivity and economic performance, promote loss-making enterprises to turn losses into increased profits, and perform meritorious deeds for the national economy to enter a new stage by developing on an extensive basis a labor emulation drive, rationalization proposals, technological innovation, technological coordination, and invention and creation activities. --The working class should actively support reform, conscientiously stand in its forefront, and constantly push forward the socialist cause of reform. The reform we are carrying out is the most brilliant cause in the history of mankind. The working class should perform its glorious duty as the master and the subject of reform, actively plunge itself into it, and suggest ways and means for its smooth progress; it should support the party and the government in introducing a number of important reform policies and measures, and take the initiative in participating in various reform practices; and it should correctly understand the gain and loss of interests in reform, handle well the relations between personal and collective interests, partial and overall interests, and immediate and long-term interests. It should soberly understand that the deeper the economic structural reform, the more the interest pattern is readjusted and the more expanded the role of market; the more we working class should stress ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall situation, the more we should develop the fine tradition of the working class and the spirit of "people in the same boat helping each other" and of taking the situation as a whole into consideration; and the more we should uphold the road of common development and common prosperity. --The working class should be the model of stability, and give full play to its role in safeguarding social political stability. For a country like China with a large population and a relatively undeveloped economy, nothing can be done without a stable political situation. The working class should establish the idea of the legal system, treasure and safeguard the political situation of stability and unity, and consolidate and strengthen the unity and unification of the working class contingent. It is necessary further to make clear that we should rely wholeheartedly on the working class, on the working class as a whole, relying mainly on industrial workers, intellectuals, and administrators. Their fundamental interests coincide. Industrial workers are required to have culture, knowledge, and technique; intellectuals are required to have practical experiences and to be integrated with workers; administrators are required to have culture, knowledge, and technique, required to have practical experiences, and also required to have management ability and a sense of the masses. Therefore, industrial workers, intellectuals, and administrators should strengthen unity and coordination among themselves and should especially handle well the relations between the leaders and those who are led. It is necessary to resolutely oppose various activities of splitting the working class contingent, to actively participate in comprehensive control of social security, and to resolutely struggle against various illegal and criminal activities and negative and corrupt phenomena. --The working class should further strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and strive to improve the quality of its own. The development of a socialist market economy puts forward higher requirements on the overall quality of staff and workers. We must uphold the principle of dual tactics and both tactics should be tough. The broad masses of staff and workers should seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the knowledge of the market economy and scientific and cultural knowledge, strengthen education on social morality and occupational morality, constantly improve the cultural and technological quality and ideological and political quality of staff and workers contingent, and enhance their competitive power. They should actively initiate upholding a correct world outlook and a civilized and healthy way of life in the course of developing a socialist market economy, influence and bring along the whole society by the advanced ideas and model actions of the working class, push forward the building of the socialist spiritual civilization, and promote overall social progress.
