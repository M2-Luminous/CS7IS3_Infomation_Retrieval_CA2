Mexico supports the expansion of the treaty as long as confusion about the place of origin is avoided, the official stated while inaugurating the two-day ministerial meeting of the Latin American Economic System (SELA). In his inaugural speech, Serra Puche recalled that the text of the treaty that entered into force on 1 January includes Article 2204 that considers the possibility that another country or group of countries may join the North American commercial zone. Serra Puche explained that with the proliferation of bilateral agreements there will be different regulations on the place of origin, which may cause a triangulation and hamper regional commerce. He stressed that commercial liberalism among the countries that become joined with clear and stable rules yields the benefits of assured access to markets and the design of long-term projects in companies. It also allows, he said, a broad and varied demand and the use of more efficient scales of cooperation and of a broad range of technological options that favor productive flexibility. "The increase in competitiveness stimulates investments, promotes an increase in exports, and creates productive and remunerated jobs, something that entails economic growth," the secretary indicated. Mexico is not on the sidelines of these processes, and in 1990 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari voiced his concern about insufficiencies regarding integration and proposed specific measures to expand the Latin American market, he added. The commerce and industrial development secretary noted that the establishment of multinational economic openings responds to the demands of the world economy and the permanent search to raise the competitiveness of the countries of the region. As proof of that, he said, we have the negotiations that have been started with several area countries, which led to a free trade agreement with Chile. The official announced that, within the framework of the Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias, President Salinas de Gortari will sign on 13 June the G-3 [Group of Three] trade agreement with his Colombian and Venezuelan counterpart. Trade negotiations with the Central American countries are continuing, and the negotiations with Bolivia may conclude in the coming weeks, he added. On the trade agreement with Chile, Serra Puche commented that, according to a joint evaluation commission, there has been a two-way flow of exchange amounting to 86 percent since the treaty entered into force in 1992. During the ministerial meeting taking place at the Foreign Secretariat with representatives from 27 countries, Serra Puche pointed to the role SELA plays as the appropriate forum to reflect on the challenges that Latin American integration entails.
