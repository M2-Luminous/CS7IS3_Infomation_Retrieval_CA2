Subpart H_Competitive Bidding Procedures for Broadband PCS §24.701 Broadband PCS subject to competitive bidding. Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide broadband PCS service are subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q will apply unless otherwise provided in this part. §24.702 Competitive bidding design for Broadband PCS licensing. (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications to provide broadband PCS service: (1) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. (2) Sequential auctions. (b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The Commission will announce by Public Notice before each auction the competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction. (c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount or percentage. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of auction design. (d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction. §24.703 Competitive bidding mechanisms. (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the sequence in which broadband PCS licenses will be auctioned. (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. (c) Reservation Price. The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to auction will not be awarded. (d) Minimum Bid Increments. The Commission will, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. (e) Stopping Rules. The Commission will establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an auction within a reasonable time. (f) Activity Rules. The Commission will establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder will be entitled to request and will be automatically granted one waiver of such rule during each auction stage. (g) Suggested Minimum Bid. The Commission may establish suggested minimum bids on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum bid would count as activity under the activity rule only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received. §24.704 Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties. (a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to §24.702(a)(1), the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, who default on payments due after an auction closes, or who are disqualified. (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder was deposited with the Commission.
