Peter Harris, Chief Director of IEC monitoring, told reporters on Tuesday night that cases had been refered to the attorney general and the Goldstone Commission as a result of investigations into irregularities. One official was under investigation for, as he put it, gross dereliction of duty at best. He was in charge of 611 boxes containing 5,499,000 ballot slips at Marievale. He had been giving conflicting counts of his available material, turning away electoral officers before a team of specialist functions monitors entered his warehouse on the morning of April 28 when the missing stock was discovered. The searchers were accompanied by nine SAP [South African Police] officers. In Pretoria another warehousing facility was found to contain 150 boxes (of 9,000 each) PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] ballots, 100 boxes of Western Cape, 30 of Northern Cape, 10 national, 300 OFS [Orange Fre State] and 10 North West. There were also 100 boxes of IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers, 200 UV lights and four boxes of ink. Mr Harris confirmed that an investiation was also in progress in respect of ballot and material stashes found in warehouse facilities on the West Rand. The findings would also be made public once investigations were completed. He was not prepared to speculate regarding the motives of those involved. "Suffice it to say that the two instances occured at the height of the crisis to supply particular areas that needed them and which could have escalated into conflict. It was at best gross dereliction of duty not to ensure that those materials reached their destination," he said. He said there were also many ballot boxes originating from so-called "pirate polling stations" under dispute in Northern Natal. Discussions and attempts at mediation were in progress. His monitoring group had dealt with 3,500 complaints thus far of which 156 had been refered to the SAP and 10 to the Goldstone Commission. By the time of his reporting 73.9 per cent of the ballot counting had been completed and the final tallies were expected by early Wednesday.
