FR940304-0-00070 FR940304-0-00019 Historically, Cyrtandra tintinnabula was found only on the island of Hawaii on the northern to the eastern slopes of Mauna Kea. Today, 3 populations of the species are known to occur on State-owned land extending over approximately 6 by 1 mi (10 by 3 km) from Kilau Stream to Honohina Gulch and containing approximately 18 known individuals (HHP 1991k1 to 1991k6). This species typically grows in dense koa-, 'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Lowland Wet Forests at elevations between 2,100 and 3,400 ft (650 and 1,040 m) (HHP 1991k3, 1991k4, 1991k6, Wagner et al . 1990). Associated species include other kinds of ha'iwale and Hedyotis sp. The major threats to Cyrtandra tintinnabula are habitat disturbance and plant damage by feral pigs and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals. Based on a specimen collected on Mauna Loa by James Macrae in 1825, Weddell (1856 to 1857) described Urtica sandwicensis , choosing the specific epithet to refer to the Sandwich Islands, an older name for the Hawaiian Islands. Later (1869), he transferred the species to another genus, resulting in Hesperocnide sandwicensis . Hesperocnide sandwicensis of the nettle family (Urticaceae) is an erect annual herb 8 to 24 in (20 to 60 cm) tall covered with coarse stinging hairs as well as shorter non-stinging hairs. The opposite, stalked, thin, toothed leaves are 0.6 to 3 in (1.5 to 7 cm) long and 0.4 to 1 in (0.9 to 2.5 cm) wide. Most of the small petalless flowers are male, but they are mixed with some female flowers in clusters 0.08 to 0.2 in (2 to 5 mm) long which originate in the leaf axils. Sepals of male flowers are fused into a four-lobed calyx about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long which encloses four stamens. The calyx of the female flower, about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and enclosing an unstalked stigma, swells slightly in fruit and encloses a flattened achene (dry, one-celled, unopened fruit) about 0.04 in (1.1 mm) long. The only Hawaiian member of the genus, Hesperocnid sandwicensis is distinguished from other native Hawaiian genera of its family by its annual herbaceous habit and its stinging hairs. It is distinguished from the alien, naturalized species Urtica urens (dwarf nettle) by the lack of calyx lobes (Wagner et al . 1990). Historically, Hesperocnide sandwicensis occurred on the island of Hawaii on the eastern and western slopes of Mauna Kea, the northern to western slopes of Mauna Loa, the Humuula Saddle between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, and the southeastern slope of Hualalai. Twelve extant localities are known, extending over a distance of approximately 38 by 15 mi (61 by 24 km) in much of the historic range of the species. It has not been seen on Hualalai for some time and is presumed extirpated there. Known populations now occur on or near the following areas: Puu Kanakaleonui, Puu Laau, Ahumoa Cone, Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA), and Sulphur Cone. Because the species is an annual plant, the total number of individuals varies with the time of year and amount of rainfall. At the time the proposed rule was written, several hundred to a thousand individuals were known from PTA, a State- and federally owned area of land which is managed by the U.S. Army. Other, smaller populations totalling approximately 80 to 130 plants were located on privately and State-owned land (HHP 1991l1 to 1991l7, HPCC 1991e; Robert Shaw, Colorado State University, pers. comm., 1992). Extensive surveys in 1992 and 1993 indicate the presence of tens of thousands of Hesperocnide sandwicensis in many populations on and near PTA (R. Shaw, in litt. , 1993). This species is clearly much more abundant than previously thought. This species typically grows in open Sophora chrysophylla (mamane)- and naio- dominated Subalpine Dry Forests at elevations between 5,840 and 8,600 ft (1,780 and 2,620 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991l1 to 1991l3, 1991l6, HPCC 1991e, Wagner et al . 1990). Associated species include Asplenium fragile, Santalum paniculatum ('iliahi), and the naturalized Urtica urens (HHP 1991l1, 1991l6; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Individual Hesperocnide sandwicensis plants and populations of plants are threatened by competition from alien grasses such as Anthoxanthum odoratum (sweet vernalgrass) and Holcus lanatus (common velvet grass); grazing by feral pigs, goats, and sheep ( Ovis aries ); habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (HHP 1991l6, HPCC 1991e; Ken Nagata, U.S. Department of Agriculture, pers. comm., 1992). However, Hesperocnide sandwicensis is maintaining large, reproductive populations throughout PTA in areas that are relatively secure from these threats. The thousands of plants found in and along lava flows are particularly unlikely to be threatened by feral herbivores, military activities, or competition from alien grasses (Loyal A. Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. observation, 1993). It is also unlikely that either natural or man-caused fires could destroy a significant percentage of the total populations. Hesperocnide sandwicensis fails to meet the definition of either an endangered or threatened species. Therefore, the Service has withdrawn Hesperocnide sandwicensis from consideration for endangered or threatened status (see notice of withdrawal of proposed rule published concurrently with this final rule).
