FBIS3-31393 "dreeu033__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Hungary Foreign Ministry Spokesman Comments AU1502204594 Budapest MTI in English 1547 GMT 15 Feb 94 AU1502204594 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 15 Feb (MTI) -- At the foreign affairs spokesman's news conference today, questions were asked regarding Hungary's policy toward Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister Peter Boross's recent statement that NATO's AWACS planes were authorized to use Hungarian airspace only for the purpose of peacekeeping. Spokesman Janos Herman was asked if this implied a change in Hungarian foreign policy and if Brussels had reacted to Boross's statement. "The prime minister's statement was not a novelty," the spokesman said. "Hungary previously informed its NATO partners that the AWACS are only allowed to operate in Hungarian airspace under the Hungarian Parliament's mandate." The spokesman said that NATO had not made any formal reaction to Boross's statement. "Brussels seems to be aware that in the interest of both this region and NATO, Hungary should not play even an indirect role in any offensive manoeuvre. The Hungarian Government's position is identical to that of parliament," Herman said. The spokesman said that a hypothetical situation was at issue and expressed the hope that the action would not take place at all and the Bosnian serbs would fulfil NATO's demands. Herman added that Hungary and NATO were in constant touch with one another, also for reasons other than the Yugoslav crisis. Herman confirmed that Hungary would continue to take part in international efforts aimed at settling the Yugoslav crisis, and observe the decisions of the international community, including the U.N. Security Council embargo on Serbia and Montenegro. "Since Hungary is a neighbour of Yugoslavia and a Hungarian minority exists in Vojvodina, its situation differs from that of the countries located further from this region. As a consequence, Hungarian diplomacy faces a twofold task. First, it should make it clear that it has invariably made every effort to settle the situation. Second, it should enforce Hungarian interests within appropriate frameworks. The two goals do not contradict each other. Its basic stance is unchanged but the reactions may differ pending the changing situation," the spokesman said. "Budapest will not initiate any easing, suspending or lifting of sanctions. All the more so because others have already made that initiative and set concrete terms which Hungary backs," Herman said. "Hungary wants to see a solution found, and peace restored in Yugoslavia," Herman said.
