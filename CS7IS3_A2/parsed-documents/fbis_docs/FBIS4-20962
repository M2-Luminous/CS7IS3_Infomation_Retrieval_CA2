FBIS4-20962 "jptdd014__l94022" JPRS-TDD-94-014-L JPRS Narcotics 24 February 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Influence of Drug Cartels Expanding in Risaralda Influence of Drug Cartels Expanding in Risaralda 94WD0276A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Feb 94 p 9A 94WD0276A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish CSO [Text] Pereira--Last year's 519 murders and the discovery of mutilated cadavers in recent months reflect a level of violence unknown until recently in Risaralda's capital. And while the coffee crisis persists, investments are being made in large buildings and businesses. The influx and expansion of drug cartels in the region have produced these disparate indicators. The sectional director of the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], Javier Restrepo Orrego, upon taking this position this week, emphasized that efforts need to be made to keep this phenomenon from continuing to disrupt the citizens' tranquility. To date, 3,090 violations of Law 30 of 1986--possession, distribution, or sale of narcotics--have been recorded. This represents 41.44 [as published] of all crimes in this region during a 10-month period. The 519 murders account for 63 percent of the homicides reported in 1993 by the Forensic Medicine Institute. Only 13 of the 827 autopsies listed the cause of death as "natural causes." Criminologists say this could be seen coming. According to the National Police, in 1992 the city of Pereira had the highest crime rate in Colombia, with 211 crimes for each 10,000 inhabitants, compared with the national average of 64 cases. On the average, 750 crimes are reported per month in Risaralda. In suburban and rural areas, in one month the police found the dead bodies of seven men with no identification. The corpses had been mutilated and had multiple bullet wounds. In some cases, after they were identified it was determined that they had been killed as a result of criminal business deals. These investigations have been hampered by a lack of evidence. The Drug Mafia: a Challenge In January 1994 there were 50 violent deaths reported, 10 more than in the same month of 1993, according to the Forensic Medicine Institute. Risaralda's governor, Roberto Galvez Montealegre, speaking of the breakdown of public order, said that his administration has been concerned and that even though things are under control, it is still possible that the situation may worsen with the presence of the drug traffic and insistent pressures from FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] gangs in the northwestern part of the department. Lieutenant Colonel Libardo Diaz Ortiz, the police commander, was unwilling to provide partial statistics on crime in the last two months "in order to avoid disputes with other regional organizations." In his first official statement as DAS director, Restrepo, who had served as deputy regional director, said his major challenge will be to take action against the drug Mafia operating in Risaralda and the northern part of Valle, for which he will have the agency's full support. Last December the manager of the Civic Company of Pereira (a private organization), Felipe Lopez Hoyos, said the expansion of new businesses and the proliferation of restaurant and fast food franchises were being used to "launder hot money." Moreover, in the controversy about doubling the real estate tax in Pereira, Mayor Ernesto Zuluaga Ramirez said the soaring growth in land and construction prices, caused by the presence of an irregular economy--attributable to drug trafficking investments--justified the highly unpopular rise in the property tax rate. From an approximate value of 150 pesos per square meter in some parts of the city, the tax rate has risen to at least 750 pesos. Pereira Chamber of Commerce statistics say private investment rose 195 percent (almost quadrupling) in 1993 compared with 1991, from slightly over 3.400 billion pesos to 9.479 billion pesos last year. This seems strange, as the region's major economic activity, coffee, is experiencing its most severe earnings crisis, while textiles and the clothing industry are barely sustaining their traditional level.
