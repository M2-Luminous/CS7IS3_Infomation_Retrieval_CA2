The changes affected both the urban and--especially--the rural areas of the 5 regions under consideration: Altay Kray and the Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Omsk oblasts. Considerable variation was evident among the territories, with the maximum increase (24.2%) seen in the Tomsk Oblast and the smallest increment (6.0%) in Kemerovo Oblast. In general, the incidence of gastric and uterine cancers diminished during the decade, but lung, breast and hematopoietic malignancies and resultant deaths were on the increase. These changes in cancer epidemiology signal that the pattern in Western Siberia is beginning to approximate that evident in the Russian Federation as a whole. In addition to industrial pollution and other anthropogenic factors, global etiologic factors must also be considered in assessing the changing patterns evident in Siberian cancer epidemiology.
