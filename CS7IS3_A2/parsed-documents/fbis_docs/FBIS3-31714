"Serbs and Jews like to have lots of dead," said Tudjman and in line with this thesis he stated the figures on their persecutions, adjusting them to the current "home policy". The ustashi, Croatian fascists, whose symbols have been adopted by the new Croatian authorities, during the Second World War killed about one million Serbs, Jews and Romanies on the soil of the then Nazi puppet "independent state of Croatia" (NDH). Tudjman's apology has been purely a formal letter communicated "through a third party" in Washington last Monday to representatives of a few Jewish organizations. Not only that it was long overdue and not sent to all addresses, but it was also obvious that Tudjman's letter had been prepared for daily political requirements. The apology was written at the point when the announced sanctions against Zagreb were being prepared and when the deadline set by NATO to withdraw Croatia's regular army troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina was expiring. The apology proved to be "a success" as there were no sanctions, nor have the Croatian regular army troops pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In his letter, Tudjman repented of having expressed a doubt, in his book "Wastelands of Historical Reality," that six million Jews had been killed during the Nazi holocaust in the Second World War . As a historian, Tudjman asserted that "no more" than 900,000 Jews were killed in the Second World War. Tudjman stated in his apology that he had written a "scientific" book while he was a political convict (is it a justification) and that (only now) he understands the "detriment" of some chapters in his book. Tudjman is the author of the allegations that about 30,000 people had been killed in the ustashi death camp of Jasenovac on the soil of the "independent state of Croatia" (NDH). Tudjman communicated this "knowledge" in 1991, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the NDH. According to reliable data, in the Jasenovac concentration camp, Croatian fascists had killed 700,000 Serbs. According to Jewish sources, 20,000 Jews had been killed in Jasenovac and according to Romanies' sources, about 80,000 Romanies were killed in this camp. Tudjman arrived at the figure on the victims in Jasenovac on the basis of the Nazi documents issued in the days of the Third Reich -- the German state responsible for the crimes against humanity. But, if he had consistently adhered to all German documents, he could have easily found the data by the German commander for the southeast, Lt.-Gen. Alexander Lehr who stated the figure of 400,000 Serbs killed in the NDH territory in April 1943. Tudjman could have also found a statement by Edmund Gleiz von Horsten, who, from the reports received from Jasenovac had inferred that the "number of the slaughtered Serbs was 750,000." Finally, in order for the apology to be really sincere and taken as well-intentioned, Tudjman should have shown by his deeds that he had given up state symbols and state policy of the Nazi NDH. The continuity of the NDH has not been interrupted even today as may be confirmed by international organizations' data saying that 300,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia and 10,000 Serb houses destroyed in the latest war.
