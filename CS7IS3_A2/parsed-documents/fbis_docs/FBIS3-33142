FBIS3-33142 "drlat034_m_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 Brazil New Congressional, Political Leadership Reviewed PY1702172394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 16 Feb 94 p 3 PY1702172394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Text] Brasilia -- Some new protagonists are filling the gaps left by the departure of [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- PMDB Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes [who was killed in a helicopter crash in October 1992], the lack of action by the Itamar Franco government, and the budget CPI's [Congressional Investigating Committee] "firing squad" which eliminated a significant part of a generation that was preparing to take power. This new group shares the scene with a few old-guard survivors who were not devoured by the CPI -- Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul], Senator Mario Covas (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo State], Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party-Para State], Senator Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front Party-Pernambuco State], Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) [PMDB-Amapa State], and State Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL-BA) [PFL-Bahia State]. Even some historical Planalto hopefuls like [Sao Paulo] Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR-SP) and [former Sao Paulo Governor] Orestes Quercia (PMDB-SP) can no longer move without the participation of the "new foxes," a team of congressmen -- whose average age is about 40 -- that was formed during the second half of the military regime. Despite all the difficulties, they earnestly entered the scene. For example, PMDB President Luis Henrique (SC) [Santa Catarina State] mustered enough courage to forge an alliance with the PSDB and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], contradicting Quercia who considers himself the proprietor of the ticket. PMDB leader Tarcisio Delgado, Luis Henrique's squire, said: "We obviously have different styles. Nevertheless, we are responsible for solving our country's problems honestly." One of the most substantial succession talks took place at the Brasilia residence of newcomer Sergio Machado, a jeans manufacturer who entered the political arena to help his friend Tasso Jereissati, the PSDB president, with the only experience of having been Ceara governor. The meeting at Machado's house united the PSDB leadership with the PMDB anti-Quercia band in the early hours of the day on which Congress rejected a quick approval of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic program. Machado's house is on Lake Paranoa in Brasilia, near where former Minister Jorge Bornhausen also lives. At the PFL president's house, the spectrum ranges between Mayor Paulo Maluf and Jose Serra, the PSDB leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and includes new ticket leaders like Alvaro Dias (PP-PR) [Popular Party-Parana State]. The succession talks at Bornhausen's house have always been attended by Luiz Eduardo and Benito Gama, two Bahia congressmen who are serving their second term and have matured through the succession of crises prompted by the investigations of the CPI that handled the PC [Paulo Cesar] Farias case. Jose Genoino, who is at the far left of the new generation of foxes and describes himself as "a democratic radical," explains: "We are molding a new profile of politicians who are concerned over supplying institutional responses to society's requirements. This common sentiment overcomes ideological disagreements."
