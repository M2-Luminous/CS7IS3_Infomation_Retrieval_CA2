They grow taller tortuously, shed yellowed needles and dry up standing. The forests are atrophying over even hundreds of hectares. Widespread die-offs of trees have not been discovered, but in almost every forested tract individual, dying trees are found as well as small clusters of dying trees. "Forests always contain dead and suffering spruce trees, but now there are more than the usual number. What we have here is not trees with stem rot from the top or trees deteriorating from old age. The most worrisome aspect is that even the best-managed forests are suffering," says Olavi Laiho, director of the Forest Research Institute's research station in Parkano. Until now assurances have been given that the forests will withstand the damage as long as they are well managed. Height Growth Rate Plunged According to Laiho, the most visible change is the collapse of height growth rate to near zero levels. Another strange thing is that the trees are very light in weight and fragile; they do not contain water. Laiho is unable to say what is plaguing the trees. "This is not my field, but I have tried to alert other researchers." He has suggested that researchers from the Forest Research Institute go look at a deteriorating forest in Hattula that covers hundreds of hectares and ponder how the sick forest should be treated and how the deterioration should be studied. The health of trees is determined by their needle loss. The method is not considered very reliable. Olavi Laiho suggests that the assesment of a tree's vitality also take note of the height growth, the moisture content of the woody matter, the proportion of heartwood to sapwood, and the changes taking place in the needles. The drying up of the wood might be taking place because the roots have been damaged so that they cannot draw water, or because the needles are damaged so that the water is lost. Drought does not instantly kill a tree. It lives tortuously for a long time. "In the world of trees there have not really been changes in any other things besides the contents of the air and rain and possibly in the ground. Variations in temperature and rainfall account quite well for many things, but damages would occur in the same patterns as these causes show. A frail tree becomes ill in an adverse year. In more favorable conditions it would get along for a little while longer. The issue here is: What has happened to the resistance capacity of the trees?" When he says changes Laiho is talking about increases in air pollution and the impact this has had. Last summer Dr. Laiho visited the forests of southern Sweden. "They are really in a wretched condition, almost all of them half brown, clearly less healthy than Finnish forests." But Laiho still feels it is the same phenomenon. Nobody Wants To Believe a Self-Taught Forest Researcher Hyvinkaa -- Might Matti Juhonsalo be right after all? Could it be possible that a self-taught forest researcher might have a sharper eye and more accurate measuring stick than the professors and ministers do? For years Juhonsalo has transported researchers and politicians in the forests and argued that the talk about good growth in the forests is nonsense. Trees no longer have height growth. Particularly the spruce trees are sick and dry up standing. He is aware of severely ill forests, for example, in his home parish of Jokioinen, in Loimaa rural parish, in Nakkila, in Karkkila, in Tammela, in Eura, and in all of the parishes of eastern Uusimaa. The biggest contiguous deteriorating area is in Hattula. Researcher Got Frightened Juhonsalo has thousands of measurements to back up his claims, but until now no one has believed him. Now Olavi Laiho, the METLA (Forest Research Institute) Parkano Research Station chief, has become frightened by his own observations and Juhonsalo's claims to the degree that he is suggesting the institute research the phenomenon. METLA has studied the changes in tree growth rates since the 1920's. It has not detected a significant reduction, in fact it has detected the contrary. But METLA measures the thickness of the trunk. "There is only one true answer to this question: Either the trees are growing or they are not," confirms Juhonsalo. He trusts in his meter stick. "METLA must not have one, since they are unable to measure height growth." METLA has a tape measure too. In an exception to the usual, METLA measured tbe heights of 161 trees between 1980 and 1991. These trees had grown better than the ones Juhonsalo measured, but their growth, too, has slowed down. Juhonsalo has measured the height growth of at least 1,000 spruce trees every summer since 1985, often of even 2,000 spruce. The growth has decreased each year except in 1991, when it recovered and was almost one-half of the standard year's growth. During the following year, the growth relapsed clearly again. Last summer the remnant was only 27 percent of the growth during 1985, the standard-setting year. "How could the trees grow when a big part of the needles have been shed and those that remain are sick," bemoans Juhonsalo. Zealous and Bold Olavi Laiho knows about Juhonsalo and his measurements. "Juhonsalo is skillful and talented, a man at least equal to the professor level in his native intelligence. You cannot ignore his measurements. He knows how to measure alright." Laiho himself is a cautious and conscientous researcher. No errors have been found in his work, and he has not exaggerated. Juhonsalo is not cautious. He is straight-talking, zealous, and even a little mean. When he gets excited, he lists a lot of politicians and researchers and then calls for the enemy of souls with all of his names. According to METLA inventories, there is plenty of wood in the forests. All of it cannot even be used. METLA has found a lot of cause to criticize the reliability of Juhonsalo's measurements. "If I am right, there is not enough wood even for the new mill in Rauma. The inventory of wood reserves has been done wrong, and even what does actually exist is being destroyed fast, but people do not notice anything. How can Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Pura travel from Tammela to Helsinki without seeing all the dying trees?" Trees Remain Dwarfed According to Juhonsalo, the growth rate of the trees has plunged rapidly. If this trend continues a tree that is 12 cm thick will not grow to 17 cm in thickness in its lifetime, nor will a tree 2.5 meters tall ever grow to be even 6 meters tall. Juhonsalo is frustrated when the politicians will not take his observations seriously. There is no desire to even discuss them, and what is worse, doubting researchers try to prove them wrong. The forests really are deteriorating so rapidly that one will be able to soon determine proof of their poor condition even without a measuring tape. Juhonsalo has marked yellowed trees with colored ribbon. It has taken at most two years for the bark to come loose and for the tree to die. It has happened that a healthy-looking tree has died in just a few weeks. Juhontalo has felled all of the trees that have dried up standing, the snags, in his own and a neighbor's forest plot. One year later he has found more dead spruce trees in the same places. "It was never like this before. I have tramped through Finnish forests for almost 50 years so I am qualified to say that."
