FR940208-1-00067 FR940208-1-00011 (1) During the performance test, continuously record the appropriate operating parameter as determined under §63.427(a); (2) The monitored operating parameter value is the average of values recorded during loadings of gasoline tank trucks that occur during performance test period in which the source has demonstrated compliance with the emission standard. (c) For performance tests performed after the initial test, the owner or operator shall document the reasons for any change in the value for the operating parameter since the previous performance test. (d) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the equipment leak provisions of §63.424 (a), (b), or (c) shall comply with the test methods and procedures in §60.485 (b) through (g) of this chapter. (e) The owner or operator of each storage vessel subject to the provisions of §63.423 shall comply with the testing requirements in §60.113b of this chapter, and with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section when electing to comply with §60.112b(a)(3) of this chapter. §63.426 Alternative means of emission limitation. (a) For determining the acceptability of alternative means of emission limitation for storage vessels under §63.423, the provisions of §60.114b of this chapter apply. (b) For determining the acceptability of alternative means of emission limitation for equipment leaks under §63.424, the provisions of §60.484 of this chapter apply. §63.427 Continuous monitoring. (a) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, certify, operate, and maintain, according to the manufacturer's specifications, the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this section, as appropriate. All monitoring equipment shall be equipped with a continuous recorder for continuously recording and calculating 6 hour average values of the information required in this paragraph. (1) Where a carbon adsorption system is used, an organic concentration monitoring device shall be installed in the exhaust air stream. (2) Where a refrigeration condenser system is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed immediately downstream from the outlet to the condenser section. Alternatively, an organic concentration monitoring device may be installed in the exhaust air stream. (3) Where a thermal oxidation system is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream from the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs. (4) Where a flare is used, a heat-sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or a thermocouple, shall be installed in proximity to the pilot light to indicate the presence of a flame. (5) Monitoring an alternative operating parameter other than those listed this paragraph shall be allowed upon demonstrating to the Administrator's satisfaction that the alternative parameter provides continuous compliance with §63.422(b). (b) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall operate the vapor processor in a manner not to exceed the operating parameter value at §63.427(a) (1) and (2), or below the operating parameter value at §63.427(a)(3), and established using the procedure in §63.425(b). In cases where an alternative pursuant to §63.427(a)(5) is approved, each owner or operator shall operate the vapor processor in a manner not to exceed or not to maintain, as appropriate, the alternative operating parameter value. Operation of the vapor processor in a manner exceeding or below the appropriate operating parameter value, as specified above, shall constitute violation of the emission limit in §63.422(b). (c) Owners and operators subject to the provisions of §63.422(c) shall continuously monitor the pressure achieved in each gasoline tank truck during loading to ensure no exceedences in maintaining a negative pressure. (d) Owners and operators of storage vessels subject to the provisions of §63.423 shall comply with the monitoring requirements in §60.116b of this chapter, and in paragraph (a) of this section when electing to comply with §60.112b(a)(3) of this chapter. §63.428 Reporting and recordkeeping. (a) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the general recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §63.10. (b) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep records and furnish reports as specified in §60.505 (a) and (b) of this chapter. (c) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall: (1) Keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the continuous monitoring data values and the calculated 6 hour rolling average values required under §63.427(a); (2) Include the performance test data specified in §63.425(b) in the Notification of Compliance Status report required under §63.9(h) of the General Provisions; and (3) Record and report the following information when using a flare to comply with §63.422(b):
