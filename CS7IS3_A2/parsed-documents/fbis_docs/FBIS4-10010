As known, the draft of the special powers bill was presented by the Democratic Action Party and was endorsed by the Movement Toward Socialism [MAS]. We have consulted both sides, given the draft bill will be approved within days. [Begin recording] [Carmelo Lauria, president of the Chamber of Deputies] We maintained in the Finance Committee that it was necessary to give the government special powers, so it could quickly approve its tax reform; this was in response to what the government has raised, that the current economic situation had led it to suspend economic guarantees, something that is never desired. In addition, the finance minister had said if the tax law was not approved quickly, super-devaluation could occur. [Segundo Melendez, director of the MAS parliamentary wing] We believe that in such circumstances approval of this law must be expedited, so the government can adopt whatever decisions are needed; in addition, we have pointed out that because the opposition has admitted the seriousness of the crisis we are experiencing and the urgency of it all, it is necessary to have these powers expanded in general to include economic matters. [end recording] [Marcano] Regarding the special powers bill, the Social Christian Party, COPEI, established its position yesterday in the National Executive Committee. Our colleague Ligia Moreno has the following report: [Moreno] COPEI, through the National Committee, expressed its total support to the president of the Republic. The National Committee of COPEI agreed to vote for the inclusion of the tax measures in the special powers law; this would generate more revenue and cover the tax on wholesale activities, the tax on luxury products, the law granting concessions for public projects, and modify when the national public income and expenditure budget would have to be presented, bearing in mind the reforms to the tax code and income tax law. [Begin recording] [Jose Curiel, COPEI secretary general] These measures are important but require a supreme will on the government's part to have them carried out. COPEI is ready to lend its support, as it has done in the past, to join this vast agreement. [end recording] [Moreno] Jose Curiel said bringing Venezuela out of its current crisis is a task for all Venezuelans, and, therefore, his party is supporting the existing system in our country.
