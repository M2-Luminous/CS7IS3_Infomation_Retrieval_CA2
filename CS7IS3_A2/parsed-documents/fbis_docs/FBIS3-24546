L. Yarovenko, Moscow State Correspondence Institute of the Food Industry] [Abstract] The interaction of the components of the principle of preservation of sterility in a multistage system is described as fermenter sterilization that is coincident with the inflow of the nutritive medium and the outflow of the mature culture fluid, with a clear-cut separation of the new and old fluids. The principle itself is such that if the movement of the fluid coincides with the successive prophylactic sterilization of the unoccupied parts of the viaduct, the controlled sterility of the fermentation medium is preserved, and the medium remains uncontaminated for an infinitely long time. As a corollary of that, if the prophylactic sterilization of individual parts of the viaduct coincides with the continuous movement of the fluid, the controlled (or initial) sterility is maintained for an infinitely long period of time. The researcher suggests that all biotechnology production be converted to the contamination-free continuous method, which will also result in a twofold gain in productivity.
