The foreign secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said that India is not resigned to the end of bilateral exercise and it is committed to peace process without any precondition. Talking to newsmen in New Delhi this evening, he said that the long discussions he had with the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, shows that she wants to give a signal to keep the momentum of bilateral interaction at all necessary levels. Admitting that the talks have ended in a stalemate, Mr. Dixit said the ball is, however, in the Pakistan court as they have not agreed to a timeframe for the next round of discussion. Mr. Dixit said while Pakistan insisted during the talks that Kashmir should be the core issue to improve bilateral relations, India asserted that the wide ranging bilateral issue should not hinge on one problem. The foreign secretary disclosed that he had offered specific proposals to improve bilateral ties and his Pakistan counterpart Mr. Shaharyar Khan had agreed to consider them. Mr. Dixit rejected reports in Pakistan press that India has agreed to resume bilateral talks on Kashmir because of pressure from abroad and the problem has become unmanageable. He said New Delhi has the capability to tackle the problem and there is no question of succumbing to pressures in areas where the nation's fundamental interests are involved.
