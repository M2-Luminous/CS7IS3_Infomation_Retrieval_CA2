It makes economic sense for automakers to organize their distributors into keiretsu. For example, it contributes to maintaining after-sales service and to raising sales efficiency. On the other hand, it prevents the entry of foreign cars into the market, and is thus seen as a problem. 2. There are no contractual restrictions on the handling of competitors' products by dealers. Business practices such as rebates, however, restrict the freedom of dealers to handle other manufacturers' cars, including foreign cars. 3. In order to make the auto market more open, it is necessary to change both the system of rebates linked to sales goals and the practice of assigning clearly defined sales territories to dealers. No Contractual Restrictions on Handling Competitors' Products Both domestically and abroad, interest in the pros and cons of keiretsu is increasing. As part of its survey on keiretsu, the Fair Trade Commission investigated the actual state of the transactions among companies in four separate industries: plate glass, paper, automobiles, and automobile parts. The results of the survey have already been made public. With regard to automobiles, there are two types of keiretsu transactions: transactions between auto makers and parts makers (manufacturing keiretsu), and transactions between auto makers and dealers (sales keiretsu). Both types are problematic. The one that will be discussed here, however, is sales keiretsu. To begin with, the actual state of these keiretsu will be broadly analyzed. In recent years, foreign cars have comprised a growing proportion of the passenger cars sold in Japan. Nevertheless, this proportion is still around 5 percent. It is believed that, in Japan, the distribution networks are controlled by auto makers and exclusionary business practices are conducted, making it difficult for foreign cars to enter the market. Passengers cars are sold from the manufacturer, through the dealer (retailer), to the customer. Manufacturers have built sales channels for selling their products. The top manufacturers deal with dealers through multiple sales channels, each for a different model of automobile. In the case of Toyota, for example, Toyopet stores mainly sell Mark II and Corona, while Toyota stores mainly sell Crown and Carina. In Japan, there are 3,759 companies classified as dealers (the number of stores is approximately 17,400). Auto makers have invested in about 16 percent of them. The vast majority of dealers are thus independent companies. Dealers are essentially free to choose which manufacturer's cars to sell and which region to sell them in. In regard to the Antimonopoly Law, questions about keiretsu arise in connection with whether the means of keiretsu organization--the exclusionary conditions and the restrictive conditions--interfere with fair and open competition in the sale of automobiles. If a manufacturer imposes on the dealer a restriction saying that the dealer may not sell the products of competitors, then the transactions that follow, due to this exclusionary condition, will be problematic under the Antimonopoly Law. In trade contracts between manufacturers and dealers there used to be a clause stipulating that the dealer could not sell the products of competitors. In 1979, however, this clause was removed under instructions from the Fair Trade Commission; but there was subsequently another provision stating that the dealer had to consult with the manufacturer before changing an important matter of business, and it was not clear whether the handling of other companies' cars was something requiring advance consultation. Following the issuance, in 1991, of the "Antimonopoly Law Guidelines for Distribution and Trade Practices," all auto makers voluntarily reviewed the problematic terms in their contracts, clearly stated in their contracts that the handling of other companies' cars by dealers was not something that required advance consultation, and notified dealers that they were free to handle the products of competitors. Accordingly, provisions that might restrict dealers from handling competitors' products no longer appear in current contracts. Restrictions on Selling Outside One's Territory Are Illegal In this latest survey, not a single case was found of a dealer handling the cars of more than one domestic manufacturer. On the other hand, dealers handling imported cars have recently increased. Most entered the field in response to efforts by domestic manufacturers to recruit dealers to sell imported cars. The reason, they say, that they have not sought on their own to handle the cars of other manufacturers, is that they would become unable to provide detailed service if the car models that they handled became numerous. But there are probably other reasons as well. Manufacturers, in their contracts with dealers, stipulate goals for the number of cars to be sold. In principle, this number is decided by consultation between the manufacturer and the dealer. There have been cases, however, where the decision tended to be linked to coercive practices, such as the manufacturer unilaterally designating the sales goal or assigning the dealer a certain number of cars; or where the sales goal was decided based on the dealer's full sales capacity. At the same time, manufacturers pay dealers a variety of rebates. There is a rebate for each car sold, of 30,000 yen. However, the large rebates are for reaching the sales goal and for expanding market share. The amount of the former is based on the number of cars established in advance as the sales goal. The latter is based on the market share attained in the dealer's main sales territory. In general, a manufacturer setting a sales goal and paying a rebate if the dealer reaches it is not itself a problem under the Antimonopoly Law. However, the manufacturer setting the sales goal near the dealer's sales capacity and using such methods as rebates to ensure that the goal is reached, in effect restricts the dealer from handling the cars of other manufacturers. So, from the standpoint of free and open competition, it cannot be said that nothing is wrong [with these practices]. Manufacturers designate a certain area as the dealer's main sales territory. Within it, the dealer is obliged to conduct vigorous sales activities. Where the dealer can locate his dealership[s] is thus limited to his territory. As their sales territories, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. basically use the nation's prefectures, for each of which they have one dealer. If this practice does not restrict sales to customers outside the territory or sales to customers coming in from outside the territory, then it is not a violation of the Antimonopoly Law. The reasons for establishing sales territories include: it enables quick, accurate after-sales service; it prevents overlapping investments by dealers; and it enables sales activities to be conducted effectively within the territories. Many dealers feel that they are not contractually restricted from conducting sales outside their territories. However, not a few feel, "I can't conduct sales activities outside my territory," or "I can't sell to customers from outside my territory, even if they come to me." In a questionnaire survey on how dealers handle customers who come to them from outside their territories to make a purchase, less than 20 percent said that they voluntarily refuse to make the sale and instead, for example, refer the customer to the dealer in his territory. Also, some manufacturers use the number of cars sold to customers from the dealer's territory, rather than the total number of cars sold, as the basis for rebates. In such cases, the dealer does not get a rebate on cars sold to customers from outside his territory, and so ends up losing incentive to sell to such customers. The Market for Maintenance and Repair Parts Is Also Exclusionary It has been pointed out that the market for maintenance and repair parts, like that for passenger cars, is exclusionary. There are two kinds of maintenance and repair parts: genuine, brand-name parts supplied by auto makers; and non-genuine parts supplied directly to the market by parts manufacturers. Before auto makers can supply assembly parts, that they purchase from parts manufacturers, directly to the maintenance and repair market, they must obtain the consent of the parts manufacturers. This done, they can purchase as repair and maintenance parts the same parts that they use as assembly parts, and then supply them directly to the market through their sales channels. In their contracts with auto makers, dealers used to be obliged "to use genuine parts" for maintenance and repair. Then, in 1991, when these contracts were revised, this clause was eliminated. However, there are certain sales channels that provide a rebate that promotes the handling of genuine parts and so has the effect of restricting the handling of non-genuine parts. Moreover, when the auto maker demands the parts manufacturer's advance consent in order to supply the market with parts independently developed by the parts manufacturer without any contribution of know-how by the auto maker, the parts manufacturer, if he grants his consent, ends up with the freedom of his business activities restricted, which is a problem. As mentioned before, the number of dealers handling foreign cars has increased. However, these dealers have not always been acting voluntarily. In order to open up the market for cars and parts, the Fair Trade Commission has pointed out to auto makers both the problems revealed by the latest survey results and the Commission's views about them, and has encouraged auto makers to voluntarily grapple with solving those problems. In the future, the Fair Trade Commission will work to understand the kinds of measures [that automakers] take in response to the problems that were pointed out to them; and will watch, from the standpoint of free and open competition, whether the factors causing the exclusionary and closed character of the auto and auto parts markets are eliminated.
