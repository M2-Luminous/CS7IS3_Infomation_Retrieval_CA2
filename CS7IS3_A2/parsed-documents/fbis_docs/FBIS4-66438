(Matsushita Seiko), has successfully developed a chelating resin-based NO[.sub]x[/] remover that was found to be highly effective in eliminating NO[.sub]2[/] (nitrogen dioxide), the most harmful among NO[.sub]x[/] (nitrogen oxides). Matsushita Seiko plans, for the time being, to apply this NO[.sub]x[/]-removal agent to filters that will be incorporated in its own commercial products, including air cleaners, air-supply-type ventilators and heat-exchanger-type ventilators, to upgrade the functions of these products. The developed NO[.sub]x[/] remover is based on the matrix of a copolymer of styrene and divinyl-benzene, which is a porous, polymeric, chelating resin. This matrix is derivatized with a special functional group that undergoes a chemical reaction with adsorbed NO[.sub]2[/] for removal. The agent is capable of effectively removing NO[.sub]2[/] at an ultra-low concentration (approximately 0.01 ppm) in air, and the effectiveness lasts approximately 30 times longer than activated charcoal on a unit weight basis. The resin is made in 0.8- to 1.2mm-sized spheres, so it can easily be attached to a piece of urethane to produce a filter that yields little pressure loss, and it is easy to handle. The resin is also capable of removing other harmful gas components (including SO[.sub]x[/], i.e., sulfur oxides, and acetaldehyde). In recent years, the atmospheric pollution by nitrogen oxides generated by automobiles has become a serious issue. Among nitrogen oxides, NO[.sub]2[/] is considered to be one of several causes for pediatric asthma and allergies, and the atmospheric concentration of NO[.sub]2[/] is known to exceed the environmental standard in some cases. Such outdoor air is causing the worsening of indoor air quality.
