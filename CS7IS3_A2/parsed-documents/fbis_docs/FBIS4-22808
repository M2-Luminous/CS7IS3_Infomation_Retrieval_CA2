We asked First Deputy Minister of the Economy Yakov Urinson to discuss the scenario preferred by the government. [Urinson] Our government has resolved to continue a quite stringent financial course and reinforce financial discipline at the same time, because on one hand we have tremendous nonpayments, while on the other, enterprises keep a lot of spare funds in accounts at commercial banks, and pay taxes poorly. The government suggests that the following be done: If an enterprise cannot pay with money, let it draw up a bill of exchange. If it does not pay on the bill of exchange either, then let it pay with its property, that is, go bankrupt. At present about 30 percent of our production facilities are unprofitable. It would be normal if we could shut down 5 percent of enterprises before the end of the year. If we succeed in making the recession structural (helping the best and giving the worst an opportunity to quietly close down) production will decline by no more than 12 percent during the year. Prices will calm down, too. In February they increased by 10 percent, in March--by 8.7 percent. If we could hold on for another month, interest on credit would also go down. At present it is 210 percent. It could be brought to 100-120 percent. As soon as interest on credit goes down, capital investment will appear. Given the policy for which the government has opted, we project a growth of prices in 1994 by a factor of five (in 1993--by a factor of 10). It will come to 7-8 percent per month. People will already be able to plan their budgets. I think that the exchange rate of the dollar will reach 3,000 rubles [R]. Since subsidies are not expected, it will slowly creep upward. [Korostikova] How many unemployed will we have? How do you expect to help them? [Urinson] There will 3.5-4 million people. At present there are 1.2 million. It has already been one year since unemployment benefits were introduced. However, it would be better for people to have something to do. This is why we allocated funds for retraining (during this period people will receive scholarships and adapt). We will employ people for public works. Small businesses are the third area in which I see tremendous reserves. We have proposed tax relief for small businesses and have provided for a little money in the budget to support newcomers. However, the unemployment problem must be tackled not only at the federal level. The local authorities better know the situation and the way out of it. By law, they can resolve to grant relief from local taxes or introduce new taxes. [Korostikova] Incidentally, about taxes. Will they be revised? [Urinson] I believe that they will not be revised by any means this year. First we need to create a powerful and at the same time refined mechanism for the tax system. Our system is now as crude as an axe. However, let it remain unchanged until we develop a new one and kick it around in the parliament every which way. Rules cannot be changed before the game is over. When the new system is adopted, it should be laid down in the law: No changes for five years under any circumstances. [Korostikova] However, everyone who engages in production assures us that it is impossible to operate because of high taxes. [Urinson] They are inclined to exaggerate the tax pressure here. In 1993 withholdings of all types for the consolidated budget of the state came to about 42 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Russia. What is the state of affairs in other countries? In the United States the corresponding parameter comes to approximately 35 percent, in Japan--38 percent, and in Germany, almost 50 percent. Therefore, not only our tax burden is heavy. However, the outrage here is greater than in any other country because everybody, especially a segment of directors of state enterprises, wants to shift the responsibility for their miscalculations (and resulting high costs) onto the state. Besides, many entrepreneurs operate on the principle "cry harder, tears bring you better luck at cards!" [Korostikova] Could it be that everything is not that simple? Recently I needed to find a new wave entrepreneur-industrialist, not a state enterprise director. This turned out to be difficult. They are few and far between. [Urinson] Ninety percent of our economy consisted of producers. However, we produced guns, tanks, meat, and butter rather than services. There is one take-out kitchen per 100 residential buildings, and one laundry per 1,000 of them. It is precisely in the service sector that the shortage is the greatest. For this reason, financial, legal, consulting, and consumer services are most profitable at present. They say that our trade sector is overgrown. Meanwhile, its contribution to GDP is smaller than in any other country, even a not-too-developed one. Clearly, the capital streamed to the sector, and profits are the highest there. Once the trade sector has been saturated, profits will begin to increase in production, and more goods manufacturers will appear. [Korostikova] Nonetheless, the state collects a good deal of money from us. However, we do not have any idea how it is spent. This is why one kind of expenditure is specified in the budget, while the money, to put it mildly, is not spent in the intended way. [Urinson] A powerful, professional, and depoliticized parliament is the only means of genuine control over budgetary expenditures. [Korostikova] Does the current parliament fit the bill? [Urinson] Of course, there are people there such as Pochinok, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, Zadornov, Petrakov, Fedorov. One cannot deceive them. On the whole, however.... I have spoken before the old parliament and before this one. In the previous one, one out of 10 questions was expert and normal; in this parliament, as many as three are. However, this is what I see: The further we go, the more politics, playing to the gallery, and fueling of passions there is, and the less punctilious interest in each number. I have attended the proceedings of the French parliament. Nobody discusses over there whether you are in favor of the Whites or the Reds. They take a puny statistic--expenditures for whatever--and begin to kick it around every which way. Either a deputy prime minister or a deputy minister of finance makes a presentation. He is questioned for two hours about a number that is one-hundredth of the budget! This goes on for two weeks. Following this, absolutely the entire budget is as transparent as can be. In the process, the press continuously covers who said what about the number under discussion and what the consequences are going to be if they act in a particular way. As a result, people are better versed in budget statistics. [Korostikova] Do you think that our economy has already reached the bottom of its fall? [Urinson] I think that this will happen sometime in the middle of the year. It will be possible to talk about stabilization only after inflation stays at 5-7 percent a month for no less than 10 months, only when the recession is put in order--not all enterprises will shut down, only the bad ones, and most importantly, only when natural investment begins rather than the coercive investment we see at present, that is, when our enterprises begin to invest funds in the development of production rather than exchange rubles into foreign currency. Then a pickup in the economy will begin.
