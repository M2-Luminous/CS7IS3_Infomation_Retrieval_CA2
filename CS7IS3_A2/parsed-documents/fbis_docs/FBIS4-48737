The PRP leader's demands include the opening of the public media to the opposition and the cancellation of plans to hold a conference on the theme "Restauration and Maintenance of Public Order in the State of Law", scheduled for early June in Nairobi. The initiator of the conference is the UN secretary general's special representative in Burundi, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania. All political organizations in Burundi and the army command have been invited to the conference. But the opposition, fronted by PRP sees the conference as a repeat of the Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) summit meeting. [passage omitted] Newspapers close to the opposition has branded the proposed meeting as a "summit of betrayal" for seeking to discuss the delicate issue of the Burundi Army outside the national territory. The threat of a general strike looms over the Burundian capital at a time when interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya has been touring the country for a week, asking his fellow displaced countrymen to return to their homes now that calm is gradually returning.
