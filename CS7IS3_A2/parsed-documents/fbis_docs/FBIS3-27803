He said: The U.S. Senate passed the bill of "Radio Free Asia" on January 25. This is an interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and other Asian countries and a criminal act against them. What the United States really seeks in setting up the radio is to imbue the DPRK and other Asian countries with the "view of the value of American-style democracy" and the poison of bourgeois ideology, thus stifling socialism in this region and destroying the independent governments from within. The United States could profit by such false propaganda in disintegrating socialist countries in other regions from within and bringing them back to capitalism. But such a propaganda cannot work on the DPRK. We have the chuche idea, the great guiding idea of the era of independence, the independent spirit and our-style way of life. The Korean people regard as their life and blood socialism of chuche in which the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind. The United States must promptly renounce the plan to set up "Radio Free Asia," a tool of vile propaganda against the DPRK and other Asian countries. Even if the United States started the broadcast in defiance of the unanimous opposition of the Asian people, it would get nothing from it. The Asian people including the Korean people will determinedly meet the U.S. "cold war" in Asia with the steadfast independent policy of rejecting "Yankee culture" and defending Asian traditions, culture and consciousness.
