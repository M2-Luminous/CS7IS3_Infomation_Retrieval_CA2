FR940112-0-00095 FR940112-0-00021 6. We are clarifying in §§435.831(e)(3) and 436.831(e)(3) (§§435.831(d)(1)(ii)(C) and 436.831(d)(1)(ii)(C) in the proposed rule) that a State must deduct expenses for necessary medical and remedial services included in the State plan even when those services exceed agency limitations on amount, duration or scope. 7. We are adding a new paragraph (f)(1) to §§435.831 and 436.831 to show that the State must deduct expenses incurred during the month of application and any of the preceding 3 months to the extent the individual's liability arose in that period and the expenses have not been deducted previously. We are also adding a new paragraph (f)(2) to show the State must deduct current payments on old bills not previously deducted. V. Request for Additional Public Comments We invite comments on the bases for and the consequences of extending additional flexibility to States using the more restrictive eligibility criteria of section 1902(f) of the Act to implement any of the provisions in this rule. Because of the large number of comments we receive, we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. If appropriate, we will respond to public comments received on this issue in a future Federal Register publication. VI. Regulatory Impact Statement Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for regulations that are likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, cause a major increase in costs or prices, or meet other threshold criteria that are specified in the Executive Order. Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, we prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis for regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. (For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, small entities include all nonprofit and most for-profit providers.) Under both the Executive Order and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, such analyses must, when prepared, show that the agency issuing the regulations has examined alternatives that might minimize an unnecessary burden or otherwise ensure that the regulations are cost-effective. In the NPRM published on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 39959), we examined the five separate provisions contained in these regulations for the significance of their annual economic impact. In four of the five proposed provisions (B, C, D and E), we could not quantify estimates, but we were confident that any impacts would not meet the threshold criteria of the Executive Order or the Regulatory Flexibility Act. However, for provision A (Consideration of Projected Institutional Expenses at the Medicaid Rate as Incurred Medical Expenses), we estimated total Federal and State savings of $18 million. In light of the public comments received regarding Provision A and because of the need to analyze the effects of these final regulations, we reviewed the analysis noted in the NPRM. After reviewing our data and assumptions, we have concluded that the current impact of Provision A will increase from the original estimate of $18 million to $65 million. This increase is a reflection of Medicaid program growth through 1993. Savings will occur in the few cases in which an institutionalized individual will not become eligible or will be found eligible later in time because his or her income significantly exceeded the medically needy income level and the State Medicaid payment rate was used in the eligibility calculation rather than whatever rate the institution chose to charge. Delay or denial of an individual's eligibility will reduce State expenditures and Federal contributions, resulting in negligible savings. Some individuals whose eligibility is delayed and who are spending down at the private payment rate, rather than the lower Medicaid rate during that period, will spend down to the income standard quicker and become eligible for Medicaid sooner. Further, this provision is optional and it is an option only for States with medically needy programs that are not section 1902(f) States. At this time, we do not expect that it will be adopted by all or most States. In addition, some States have already adopted interpretations of the existing regulations on the spenddown process that are very close to our final rule. For all these reasons, we now believe that this provision will have a negligible net impact. For these reasons, we have found that the effect of the provisions of this final rule will not meet the threshold criteria of Executive Order 12291. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in an annual economic impact that will affect significantly a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we conclude that neither a regulatory impact nor a regulatory flexibility analysis is required. VII. Paperwork Reduction Act These changes do not impose information collection requirements; consequently, they need not be reviewed by the Executive Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
