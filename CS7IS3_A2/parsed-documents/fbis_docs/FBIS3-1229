Senior negotiation sources confirmed on Wednesday [23 March] that Mr Kissinger would head the commission which must decide on the federalist content of the new transitional constitution. It is understood that the commission would comprise four men, the other two being from the USA and India. The same sources said that agreement had been reached between the two disputing parties -- the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC [African National Congress] -- that they would abide by the decision of the mediators. It was also agreed that if the mediators ruled in favour of the IFP, it could lead to a postponement of the April 27 election. The ANC and IFP agreed to mediation on the issue of federalism which the IFP claims is not present in the interim constitution. It is demanding more regional powers for the provinces and a greater measure of independence from the central government. Mr Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his north Vietnamese negotiation counterpart for securing the agreement for the US withdrawal from Vietnam, thus ending the Vietnam War. Lord Carrington was the central mediator in the Lancaster House negotiations which brought about the end of Rhodesian UDI [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] and the war for the liberation of Zimbabwe.
