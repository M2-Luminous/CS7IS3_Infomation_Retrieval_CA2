This is what Birgitta Dahl, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] spokesperson on issues of social welfare, stated when SVENSKA DAGBLADET spoke with her on May Day. She had just taken Liberal leader Bengt Westerberg to task from the speaker's podium. Previously, Social Democratic chairman Ingvar Carlsson and party secretary Mona Sahlin had repeatedly invited the Liberal Party to share the government after the election. Greater Responsibility "It is not an invitation without demands," explains Birgitta Dahl, without wanting to go into what is required from the Liberal Party in order to be accepted as a governing partner. From speaker's podiums in Enkoping and Uppsala, in the warm sun but icy wind, she criticized the nonsocialist government in general and the Liberal leader in particular. ``As deputy prime minister and social minister he has a greater responsibility than most people for the social disarmament and the growing chasms in our country. ``The policy that Bengt Westerberg is actively participating in is creating a segregation that is more merciless than the injustices of old times.'' "Westerberg Is a Hypocrite" The Liberal leader himself on Friday [29 April] accused the Social Democrats of wanting to turn back the politics 20-30 years in time. On the Liberal Party's election posters the Social Democrats are likened to a prehistoric lizard. And, according to Bengt Westerberg, it is the Social Democrats who have caused the segregation in society with the large, sterile housing areas of the their million-kronor program. Birgitta Dahl tells SVENSKA DAGBLADET that Bengt Westerberg is a hypocrite and espouses a double moral. And the fact is that she is tougher in her criticism of the Liberal Party leader than of the leader of the Conservative Party. "Carl Bildt, at least, says straight out what he wants. The Liberal, Center, and Christian Democratic parties say one thing -- pretending to be finer and nobler than others -- but do something entirely different. I think that is worse," says Birgitta Dahl from the podium. Difficult Task She also warns that a difficult task awaits after an election victory. "We cannot promise quick results. Even less can we promise material improvements -- restoration -- to anyone who is healthy and has a job." On the other hand, she promises that the Social Democrats will tackle unemployment and, above all, youth unemployment. And there will be fairer taxes, with "proper taxation of capital gains from stocks," a special 5-percent defense tax for high-income earners and the possibility of raising the municipal tax for municipalities that need to. She delivered two other clear messages: The child care subsidy will be eliminated immediately. No form of maid service deduction will be introduced by a Social Democratic government.
