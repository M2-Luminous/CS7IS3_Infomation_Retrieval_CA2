The editor pointed out that the so-called Security Council has passed roughly 50 resolutions on Palestine. Most of them have been calling for the withdrawal of the Israelis from the occupied Arab territories, be it southern Lebanon, the Golan, or others. However, none of these resolutions have ever been implemented; they have been rejected by the Israelis who showed them contempt. The Arab affairs editor wondered why the United Nations has not implemented any of its resolutions regarding the racist Israeli entity saying: Why has the United Nations not returned the territories of those Arab states that happened to be UN members. These territories were seized by force by the racist Israelis who decided to annex them and change their demographic, cultural, and political character--a matter that has contravened recognized norms. The editor also indicated that the Israeli entity has exploited the UN failure to put pressure on those concerned Arab parties. It obliged these parties to recognize Israel's racist and alien existence in exchange for its so-called withdrawal from the Arab lands that it has occupied. This condition constitutes an insult to the Arab countries whose land has been occupied. The Arab affairs editor concluded his comments by saying that real peace would not come to the region except with the return of the Palestinian people to their land and homes, the departure of the Israeli invaders and their return to where they came from, and the establishment of a democratic state in Palestine. Without this, peace in the region will remain delusion, fantasy, and unrealistic.
