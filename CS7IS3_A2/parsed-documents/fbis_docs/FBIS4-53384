[passage omitted] Speaking of cooperation in public security along the Lao-Thai border, from the time of first meeting of the committee for cooperation to maintain peace along the Lao-Thai border until the third meeting now, it is clear that Lao-Thai relations have steadily developed. For example the cooperation to maintain peace along the border has been steadily improved so that the situation there has gradually become peaceful. Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit, secretary-general of the committee for cooperation to maintain peace along the border, told our group of reporters that "the people living along the Lao-Thai border feel more secure than in the past in making a living and traveling to and from the neighboring country." The cooperation in each locality involved the many border provinces of the two countries meeting officially and signing memoranda with each other as well as consulting to find ways to correct various problems which groups of bad people had caused to disrupt the peace in their localities on the border. The cooperation was undertaken to make the border areas in the provinces on both sides peaceful. In addition the cooperation between the armies of Laos and Thailand has involved talks and visits which have brought greater understanding. The top Thai officers including those from the Ministry of Defense, the Supreme Command Headquarters and RTA headquarters have approved of continuing to correct past weaknesses and obstacles to ralations, especially those hostile groups that want to cause confusion and to disrupt the peace in order to block the expansion of Lao-Thai relations. Because of the determination of the Thai officials above, it is felt that in the future Thai officials will do everything in their power against the bad groups which hope to disrupt Lao-Thai relations in order that Lao-Thai relations steadily improve and the Lao-Thai border is peaceful and stable. On 23 February 1994 officials of the Thai Supreme Command Headquarters had Lt.Gen. Phiradet Miphian, the head of the Directorate of Joint Intelligence of the Supreme Command Headquarters, provide information to the Director of the National Police Department so that he could proceed with the case against Vang Pao, Thonglit Chokbengboun and their associates under the charge of violating Thai security -- their base used Thai territory to conduct operations against the Lao government. It was used for concealing weapons, and it caused losses for the Thai people along the border. In addition this affected relations and created doubts between Laos and Thailand. In any case many Thai publications printed stories about this, and they all felt that Thai officials would act as quickly as possible because in a few days the ceremony officially opening the Friendship Bridge was to be held, and the day of this historic ceremony required peace on the Lao-Thai border. The Thai English-language newspaper DIMENSION wrote that: "Vang Pao and Thonglit have a close relationship with the CIA." The commander for suppression said that wrongdoers, especially Vang Pao and his right-hand man, Thonglit, would have to be arrested if they returned to Thailand. If they were in another country, officials would observe to see if they were able to make their group obey the law. A month has passed, and there has been no new information. For real peace on the Lao-Thai border, Thai officials will have to move fast to make their deeds match their words.
