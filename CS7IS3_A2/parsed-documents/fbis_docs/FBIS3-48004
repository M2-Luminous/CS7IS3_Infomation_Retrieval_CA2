In the news conference held at the airport, Representative Lin said: "I will do my best to restore mutual trust as soon as possible and to establish new relations based on the principle of equality and reciprocity." Government officials, including Chong Yong-cho, a consultation officer in charge of Asian affairs at the Foreign Ministry, received the representative at the airport. Some 100 resident-Chinese also warmly welcomed the representative and his wife by presenting garlands of flowers. The representative said: "Although the two countries severed ties a year ago, I think it will not be long before the bilateral relations of frienship are restored since the two countries have maintained close cordial relations in culture and trade for a long time. I think, first of all, it is urgent to restore mutual understanding and trust." He then added: "It took longer than expected for me to arrive in the ROK because I had to pass on the ambassadorial duties of my former post. As soon as the construction of a new office at Kwanghwamun building is completed, the mission will be inaugurated and begin operations." In connection with restoring relations in areas of economy and aviation, he said: "I believe that the bilateral relations in aviation, economy, and trade will soon be restored if the two countries and peoples are prepared to do so." Representative Lin, saying that most Taiwanese people welcome the opening of the Taiwanese mission in the ROK, disclosed that he has met with Han Chol-chu, representative in the ROK mission in Taiwan, and that they had agreed to work closely with one another. The major tasks of the mission will be protecting the rights of Chinese residents in the ROK and assisting Taiwanese students studying in the ROK, he said. Following the break in diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992, the ROK and Taiwanese Governments have since signed an agreement to establish relations in July last year and the ROK Mission in Taiwan began operations as soon as 25 November of last year.
