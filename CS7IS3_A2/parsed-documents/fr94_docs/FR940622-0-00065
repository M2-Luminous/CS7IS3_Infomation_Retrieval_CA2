FR940622-0-00065 FR940622-0-00011 •Section 489.20(q): We are adding provisions based on section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, requiring hospitals to post conspicuously in their emergency departments signs specifying rights of individuals under section 1867 of the Act with respect to examination and treatment and to post conspicuously information indicating whether or not the hospital participates in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved under title XIX. Some public commenters also wrote in support of the posting of signs. •Section 489.20(r)(1): Pursuant to section 6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and in response to public comment, we are adding the requirement that both transferring and receiving hospitals maintain medical and other records related to individuals transferred for a period of 5 years. •Section 489.20(r)(2): Also pursuant to section 6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding the requirement that a hospital maintain a list of physicians who are on call for duty after the initial examination to provide treatment. •Section 489.20(r)(3): We are requiring each hospital (both transferring and receiving) to keep a log of each individual who came to the emergency department seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment or was refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged. •Section 489.24(b): We are expanding the definition of ``emergency medical condition'' to include psychiatric disturbances, symptoms of substance abuse, and situations with respect to pregnant women having contractions. We add definitions of ``capacity'', ``comes to the emergency department'', ``hospital'', ``hospital with an emergency department'', ``labor'', and ``participating hospital.'' We clarify other definitions to make them consistent with other versions of the text. We have deleted the term ``active labor'' in accordance with section 6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89. •Section 489.24(c) (2) and (4) and (d) (1) and (2): We are adding provisions to require a written informed refusal from the patient or individual acting on his or her behalf when the patient refuses treatment or transfer. We specify that the medical record must contain a description of the examination and treatment, or transfer, or refusal. The refusal must indicate that the patient (or person acting on his or her behalf) is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer, or the examination or treatment. •Section 489.24(c)(3): We are adding the requirement that a hospital may not delay providing an appropriate medical screening examination in order to inquire about payment method or insurance status. This is the result of public comment and section 6211(h) of OBRA 89. •Section 489.24(d)(1)(ii)(A): Based on section 6211(c)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding a requirement that an individual (or legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) who wants to be transferred must indicate in writing the reason for the request for transfer and that he or she is aware of its risks and benefits. •Section 489.24(d)(3): Based on section 6211(i) of OBRA 89 and section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90, we are prohibiting a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person who refuses to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency condition that has not been stabilized or against any hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of this regulation. •Section 489.24(e): Based on section 6211(f) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are requiring that a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities accept transfer of any individual requiring those specialized capabilities or facilities if it has the capacity to treat the individual. •Section 489.24(f): Because of section 4008(b)(3)(A) of OBRA 90, the standard for terminating a hospital has changed. HCFA is no longer required to prove that the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to meet the requirements of this regulation. We may now terminate such hospitals for failing to meet these requirements under section 1866 of the Act based upon section 4008(b)(3)(B) of OBRA 90, which requires hospitals to meet the requirements of section 1867 of the Act in order to participate in the Medicare program. •Section 489.24(g): Based on section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90, we are requiring PRO review to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized, in addition to other medical issues, before imposing a civil monetary penalty or exclusion, unless obtaining such review would cause delay that would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or if there is no medical issue to review (that is, no screening examination was conducted). In cases that do not present jeopardy, the PRO review and report to HCFA must be completed in 60 calendar days. •Section 489.24(h): We are clarifying in new §489.24(h) that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment to the physician or hospital, or the affected individual or his or her representative. •Section 489.53(a): We are revising the proposed rule to require a receiving hospital to report incidents it has reason to believe may be violations. •Section 489.53(b): We are adding to the reasons for termination_(a) a refusal of a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities that has the capacity to accept an appropriate transfer; (b) failure to maintain an on-call duty roster, medical records for 5 years, and a log of individuals seeking emergency assistance; and (c) failure to post notices as required concerning participation in Medicaid and the rights of individuals under 42 CFR part 489, subpart B. •Section 489.53(c)(2)(ii): We are specifying that a hospital found in violation of §§489.24(a) through (h) will receive a final notice of termination and the public will be concurrently notified at least 2 but no more than 4 days before the effective date of the termination. This allows a hospital approximately 19 to 21 days to correct or refute alleged deficiencies. We also clarify that we will not terminate if the hospital has corrected or refuted the deficiencies that gave rise to the termination. •We are adding ``or rural primary care hospital'' wherever ``hospital'' appears in §489.24, as required by section 6003(g) of OBRA 89. •We are also removing all references to suspension of the provider from the regulations at §§489.24 and 489.53, based on the deletion of the suspension authority by section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90. •We are making none of the proposed revisions to part 1001, which all concerned suspension of providers. •Section 1003.100: We are revising the proposed section to conform with several rulemaking documents that have been published since our proposed rule. The requirements contained in proposed §1003.100(b)(1)(ii) are now set forth in §1003.100(b)(1)(vi).
