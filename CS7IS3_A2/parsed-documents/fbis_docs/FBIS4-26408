This has proved to be an effective way to help develop the economies of western China as their officials have become more and more capable. In recent years Gansu Province, one of the poor areas in northwest China, has sent over 300 officials to developed areas such as Zhejiang Province in the east and Tianjin Municipality in the north to work for a period of time to learn from local experience; in return, officials from the developed coastal areas have gone to remote areas to help them develop their economies. The officials from Gansu have not only learned the skills of marketing and economic operations, they have also helped to introduce over 100 technical projects to boost the economies of their native places. The past 15 years of reform and opening up in China have brought great changes to the eastern and southern parts of China, but the northwest has made comparatively less progress because of poor natural conditions and other factors. Since 1991, when Jiangsu and Shaanxi Provinces first started exchanges of officials, other provinces have followed suit, and officials exchanges have been carried out between Beijing and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shandong and Shaanxi Provinces, and Zhejiang Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The exchanges involve more than 10,000 officials at various levels. Officials from Shandong and Jiangsu working in 59 poor counties and cities in the west have held a dozen training courses for over 10 million people. They have also helped western areas set up over 250 joint ventures which recorded 440 million yuan (about 50 million U.S. dollars) in output value last year. Scientists and technicians from the Tianjin Academy of Agricultural Sciences have helped farmers and herdsmen in the west learn vegetable storage and cross breeding. At the same time, officials from the poor areas have their eyes opened by the brisk market economy in the east. People from Xinjiang have learned advanced management techniques and helped introduce advanced equipment to their hometowns to promote the development of the chemicals, textiles and electronics industries, as well as agricultural production. Meanwhile, such exchanges have promoted economic and technical co-operation. Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions have signed contracts of cooperation in funds and labor with the developed areas. The developed areas benefit as well from the exchanges as they receive raw materials and energy from the underdeveloped areas. Some political and economic analysts hold that the officials exchanges have brought new changes in the circulation of personnel, technology, commodities and resources between the east and the west.
