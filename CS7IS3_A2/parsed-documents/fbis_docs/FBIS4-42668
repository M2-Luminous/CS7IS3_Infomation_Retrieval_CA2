However, a Foreign Ministry spokesman hastened to add that this was in no way a "base" but merely a logistical support center. Spokesman Ferhat Ataman's clarification follows claims in some of the newspapers that the new structure would be a "second Poised Hammer" -- a similar structure to the ones set up by United States, France, and Britain for protecting the Kurds in northern Iraq. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday [31 May] that the force was important for the monitoring of a cease-fire. "It is important that peace efforts are made under a CSCE umbrella on a multinational basis," she told Parliament members of her True Path Party. "Preparations are under way for a logistic support center in Erzurum for the use of international monitors to be sent to the region of conflict," she said. Erzurum is eastern Turkey's major city closest to the Armenian border. Turkey is a member of the Minsk group of 11 nations working to resolve the six-year-old Azeri-Armenian conflict over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, most Armenian populated but technically ruled by Baku. Armenian forces that have taken all of Karabakh have in the last year seized 20 percent of Azeri lands proper, forcing about 1 million Azeris into refugee camps. Turkey sides with fellow-Muslim and ethnic kin in Azerbaijan urging an end to fighting and a withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azeri territory. Ataman, meanwhile, said earlier reports that Azerbaijan had attacked the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan were unconfirmed. "We have checked the speculations and apparently, there was some firing at the border, but there is no Armenian gain of territory," Ataman said. Turkey says it has the right of guarantee over this enclave at its border. Asked what Turkey would do in case of an Armenian attack, Ataman said: "We have made our point known. There is no change in that." Ankara has said in the past that it would not tolerate an Armenian attack on Nakhichevan.
