During the conversation they dealt with prospects for developing economic and cultural cooperation between our countries. Bilateral official relations at present, noted Yerik Asanbayev, are exemplary and effective. South Korean businessmen in a short period of time have initiated production of televisions in Almaty and refrigerators in Karaganda. However, the dynamism of cooperation must be raised, especially in the sphere of providing credits to Kazakhstan. To support the recently introduced national currency and to ease the transfer to a market economy we need support from outside, stressed the vice president. The republic needs to gather a critical mass of credits for a structural transformation of the economy and introduction of new technology in development of minerals. He expressed the confidence that the South Korean side, which at one time promised to allocate $350 million to Kazakhstan, will keep its word. Housing is built quickly and well in that country. To carry out the program of housing construction in our republic it is intended to make a close study of that experience in order to use it in action. Gratitude was expressed to the ambassador for humanitarian assistance to the value of 150,000 dollars, which had arrived that day in Almaty from Seoul. Kim Chang-kon stated that he would exert every effort to strengthen friendly ties between the two countries, to improve economic links, and to attract businessmen from the Republic of Korea to Kazakhstan.
