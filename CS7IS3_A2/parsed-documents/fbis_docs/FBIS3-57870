The former president of the Iranian Republic, Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who came to power in 1981, only to be deposed by the parliament 18 months later, rants and raves in his own particular manner, [which is] both oriental and Parisian. Without dropping his shy smile and virtual whisper, he said: "The government is respecting neither its laws, nor the European extradition treaty. Not so long ago, it was committed to `terrorizing the terrorists.' Who said this is the country of human rights?" Not just anybody who so desires can gain access to the large white building, but the excessive zeal is out of place. In front of the railings there is a police car. Behind them, in the garden, there is a CRS [state security police] bus, converted into a spartan antechamber, for security checks. Visitors are always searched, but the few policemen and CRS officers guarding the former president confirm that neither the numbers of personnel nor the security precautions themselves have been stepped up. A secretary wearing jeans comes to fetch visitors on the steps, ushers them through a small door, and guides them along the white corridors into a bare lounge. The windows, in front of which two frozen cypress trees sway in the wind, give out onto the Jewish cemetery. "During the 10 years we have been here," the secretary assures me, "we have grown used to the cold and solitude." Hypothesis The master of the house, who was granted political asylum in France, presses on angrily. How can the French government's refusal to extradite Mohsen Sharif Espahani and Ahmad Taheri to Switzerland be explained? Bani Sadr evokes the choice between fear of a new wave of terrorist activity and deliberate complicity. "Fear? I do not think so. Every time a government gives in to a terrorist state it is encouraging acts of violence. When Naccache was sent back to Iran they assassinated Bakhtiar. And look at Algeria. No. There is some form of complicity between the Iranian regime and the French government." He then goes on to describe Iran as the "only country in the world whose foreign policy can be summed up as [being characterized by] terrorism, arms purchases, indebtedness, and large-scale corruption." But what complicity? Continuing his argument cautiously, Bani Sadr, his gaze fixed on the floor, calls to mind Gorbachev, abandoned by Europe, while the Iranian regime, [which is] "greatly weakened and highly indebted, and which is only being propped up by foreign support," has received $30 billion in short-term aid over the last four years. "It is facilitating the task of these governments in the Muslim world. It stands for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. It is serving to supplant the threat of communism and generate fear." The revolt of Bani Sadr, [who remains] motionless, is visible only on his face. He interrupts himself while tea is served, then puts forward a hypothesis: "If the French Government committed the despicable act of sending back the two accused, then it did so because something happened regarding Algeria. Perhaps France obtained an undertaking from the Iranian regime that it would stop providing military and financial aid to Algerian terrorists. If terrorism effectively ceases in Algeria, then France will be able to say that it scored a great victory." Was sending back the two accused the gift offered by France to appease the Iranian anger provoked by the return to France of Mariam Radjavi, wife of the leader of the People's Mujahidin and the "future president" enthroned by her followers? For the former Iranian president, the fury of the Mullahs' press, which denounced French complicity with the "terrorists" of her calibre, was only superficial and "was unleashed just after Charles Pasqua [minister of interior] had started to chase the Algerians out of France." More precisely, "when France consents to send back the assassins of the Muslim Brotherhood, then it must consider this group to be finished. The arrival of Radjavi's wife did not inconvenience Iran; on the contrary. It indicated the defeat of the Mujahidin." Not a man to mince his words. He seems unaware of the danger hanging over him. "They say that Rushdie and myself are facing the greatest danger. However, others have written worse things than he, and his case cropped up at the right time to deflect public opinion from the defeat in the Iran-Iraq war." And what was the greatest sin committed by Bani Sadr? "Representing a democratic alternative for Iran, a unique case in the Muslim countries. I am not afraid. Liberty for Iran calls for a struggle."
