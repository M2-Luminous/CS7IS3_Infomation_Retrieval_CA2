"We do not consider this a friendly gesture," he told reporters in the Ukraine where he is on an official visit. The U.S. House of Representatives, which approved on Wednesday a 13.5-billion-dollar foreign aid bill for fiscal 1995, withheld a quarter of the 363 million dollars earmarked for Turkey in foreign military sales, pending progress on human rights and on Cyprus. "We strongly regret the fact that the aid will be tied to conditions such as human rights, terror and Cyprus," he said. "Under these circumstances, it is only natural that the extension of the multi-national allied forces in Incirlik was not discussed at the National Security Council meeting which was held during the weekend. "The mandate for the forces is to end by the end of this month," he said. Demirel pointed out that the force had been invited by Turkey in the first place to protect northern Iraqi Kurds from renewed attacks by Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn after a failed Kurdish rebellion following Iraq's Gulf War defeat. "We have been defending them (northern Iraqi Kurds) for years," he said. "But now we are facing such behavior by the U.S. Congress. The extension of the mandate is to the advantage of Turkey and we shall meet with the Security Council again to discuss it." Regarding the U.N.-imposed trade embargo against Iraq, Demirel said that Turkey has suffered from it and that nowhere on earth can innocent people be so punished, referring to the people of Iraq. "The integration of the Iraqi Government to the international community is leading the country to disintegration and this will hurt world peace," he said. "Unfortunately the United States, Britain and France have transformed it into an internal political issue." Demirel also stressed that neither Turkey nor the Arab world wants Iraq's disintegration.
