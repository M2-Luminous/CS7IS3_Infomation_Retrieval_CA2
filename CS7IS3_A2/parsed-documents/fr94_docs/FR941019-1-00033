FR941019-1-00033 FR941019-1-00004 Under certain circumstances the disclosure of underlying assumptions may be material to an understanding of the projected results. The Commission also believes that the key assumptions underlying a forward-looking statement are of such significance that their disclosure may be necessary in order for such statements to meet the reasonable basis and good faith standards embodied in the rule. Because of the potential importance of assumptions to investor understanding and in order to encourage their disclosure, the rule as adopted indicates specifically that disclosed assumptions are also within its scope. 35 35 Id . The Commission made explicit the availability of the safe harbor to third-party reviewers, both those retained by the company and those making projections on behalf of management. Also, while not adding any requirement to update projections, the Commission reiterated its earlier position that projections protected by the safe harbor must be corrected when subsequent events or discoveries render them false or misleading. Finally, the Commission elected not to extend coverage of the rule to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. While not rejecting the possibility that projections could be valuable to shareholders of registered investment companies, the Commission stated that ``the nature of information reported by investment companies is sufficiently distinct to warrant separate consideration.'' 36 36 Id . The Commission decided not to require that investment companies provide forward-looking disclosure under the recently-adopted ``management's discussion of performance'' requirement for registered open-end investment companies. Securities Act Release No. 6988 (Apr. 6, 1993). The safe harbor provision has retained its essential elements, although the Commission has made several technical modifications since its adoption. 37 37 See Securities Act Release No. 6949 (Jul. 30, 1992); Securities Act Release No. 6353 (Mar. 3, 1982); Securities Act Release No. 6304 (Mar. 27, 1981); Securities Act Release No. 6291 (Feb. 17, 1981); and Securities Act Release No. 6288 (Feb. 9, 1981). B. Management's Discussion and Analysis Interpretative Release Since 1979, the Commission has further refined its position on disclosure of forward-looking information, particularly in the context of developing and interpreting the management's discussion and analysis (``MD&A'') requirements applicable to the Form 10&hyph;K and other required filings, as codified in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303. 38 These contain a number of provisions that call for disclosure of prospective information. 39 An instruction to Item 303(a) states that the MD&A ``shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of [the] future *␣*␣*.'' 40 In contrast to this required disclosure of ``presently known data which will impact upon future operating results,'' registrants are expressly encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-looking information. 41 The Commission clarified the distinction between ``voluntary'' and ``mandatory'' forward-looking disclosure in a 1989 interpretative release relating to MD&A: 38 Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303, 17 CFR 238.303 (1994). 39 With respect to liquidity, disclosure is required of ``any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in *␣*␣*'' material changes. See Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303(a)(1), 17 CFR 229.303(a)(1) (1994). With respect to capital resources, the disclosure calls for ``any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable *␣*␣*'' Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303(a)(2)(ii), 17 CFR 229.303(a)(2)(ii) (1994). With respect to sales, revenue or income, the Item calls for ``any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact *␣*␣*'' Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303(a)(3)(ii), 17 CFR 229.303(a)(3)(ii). 40 See Regulation S&hyph;K Item 303, Instruction 3, 17 CFR 229.303 (1994). 41 See Regulation S&hyph;K, Item 303, Instruction 7, 17 CFR 229.303 (1994). Both required disclosure regarding the future impact of presently known trends, events or uncertainties and optional forward-looking information may involve some prediction or projection. The distinction between the two rests with the nature of the prediction required. Required disclosure is based on currently known trends, events, and uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have material effects, such as: a reduction in the registrant's product prices; erosion in the registrant's market share; changes in insurance coverage; or the likely non-renewal of a material contract. In contrast, optional forward-looking disclosure involves anticipating a future trend or event or anticipating a less predictable impact of a known event, trend or uncertainty. 42 42 Securities Act Release No. 6835 (May 18, 1989). Thus, the Commission has distinguished between mandatory and voluntary forward-looking statements for disclosure purposes. Moreover, in the context of transactions involving an issuer's or affiliate's purchase of the issuer's shares, or a business combination, forward-looking information (including projections) may be required pursuant to Rule 10b&hyph;5. 43 43 Projections might also be contained in documents required to be filed and discussed pursuant to specific line item requirements. See Item 4(b) of Form S&hyph;4; 17 CFR 239.25; Item 9 of Schedule 13E&hyph;3; 17 CFR 240.13e.100 C. Qualitative Performance There appears to be increasing interest, on the part of both registrants and users of their financial reports in the investor and analyst communities, in enhanced disclosure of information that may affect corporate performance but is not readily susceptible of measurement in traditional, quantitative terms. 44 Among such qualitative informational items are workforce training and development, product and process quality and customer satisfaction. A large registrant considers one such item_product quality_to be so important to its profitability that it has chosen to make it a key determinant of executive compensation. 45 Other companies are beginning to experiment with voluntary disclosure of the utilization of an intangible asset termed ``intellectual capital,'' or employee knowledge. 46 In this connection, another federal agency has urged more corporate disclosure of the use of measures of ``high performance work practices and other nontraditional measures'' of corporate performance. 47 44 See R. Eccles and S. Mavrinac, Improving the Corporate Disclosure Process (Harvard Business School Working Paper 94&hyph;061 (1994) (hereinafter ``Eccles & Mavrinac''); Stewart, Your Company's Most Valuable Asset: Intellectual Capital , Fortune, October 3, 1994 at 68 (hereinafter ``Stewart''). 45 See Chrysler Corporation, 1994 Proxy Statement, filed March 16, 1994. 46 See Stewart, supra note 44; ( citing Skandia AFS' 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders). See also 1994 Annual Reports to Shareholders submitted to the Commission by Dow Chemical Corporation and National Steel Company. 47 Letter from Secretary Robert B. Reich to Chairman Arthur Levitt (Oct. 3, 1994). With respect to the interest of users in this type of ``soft,'' or nonquantitative, corporate information, a large public pension fund factors labor-management relations and other aspects of human resource management into analyses of portfolio company performance in connection with the fund's investment and voting decisions, based on research indicating that workplace practices can be linked to corporate performance. 48 Private pension fund fiduciaries are likely to follow this example, given the Department of Labor's recent issuance of an interpretive bulletin urging such fiduciaries to monitor more closely portfolio companies' investment in training and otherwise developing their workforce. 49 48 See IRRC Corporate Governance Highlights , (July/August 1994) at 15&hyph;16 (reporting that the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, announced that it will consider workplace practices along with financial performance criteria in connection with the fund's annual corporate governance review of portfolio companies, based on the positive correlation found by economist Lilli A. Gordon between ``high-performance workplace practices'' and enhanced productivity and long-term financial performance of such companies). 49 Department of Labor Interpretive Bulletin 94&hyph;2; 59 FR 38860 (July 29, 1994).
