Chen Wu-hsiung, director of the Economics and Planning Department under the Council of Agriculture, said in order to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, Taiwan will have to make some concessions in its trade regime, including liberalizing the rice market. GATT regulations stipulate that Japan should allow rice imports of 4 percent of the nation's total rice consumption in its first year as a GATT member, and increase imports by 0.8 percent annually to reach 8 percent by 2000. South Korea, which GATT considers a developing country, must open 1 percent of its rice market to foreign imports in the first year with gradual increases ranging from 0.25 percent to 2 percent annually in the following years and to open up 4 percent of its market to foreign rice within 10 years. Most GATT contracting parties agreed in Geneva that Taiwan should not be allowed to follow the Korean formula because Taiwan is a developed country, Chen said. Chen also said Taiwan will be hard hit by GATT regulations concerning fruit imports. Chen reckoned that Taiwan peaches, citrus fruits, mangoes, pineapples and pears will face increased competition from abroad. Chen argued that it was unjustifiable that most GATT member countries are against Taiwan's desired tariffication plan because Taiwan is not a GATT member while at the same time demanding that Taiwan abide by the Uruguay Round trade accords to eliminate government subsidies to farmers.
