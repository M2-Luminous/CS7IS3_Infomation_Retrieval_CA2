THE NEW YORK TIMES recently published an article headlined "Russian Imperialism Is Stronger Than Soviet Power," claiming that "Russia is striving to restore its former empire." It was this trend that Valeriya Novodvorskaya saw and condemned in IZVESTIYA (4 March 1994) in an article entitled "I Do Not Love the State." Two academics dealt her a very prompt rebuff in the same newspaper. They wrote among other things: "Were it up to Mrs. Novodvorskaya, the Russian-speaking population of the Dniester Region should be handed over to Romania as the People's Front want." But what if the population does not want that? There are a number of inaccuracies in this talk about the Dniester Region. What is the "Russian-speaking population"? In one of his interviews in the Moscow press, Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev said the following about this term: "I do not accept the concept of `Russian-speaking population.' Which of us is not a Russian speaker? After all, the whole of Kazakhstan speaks Russian, including 99 percent of Kazakhs." That is the linguistic situation in the Republic of Moldova today, with the possible exception that 100 percent of Moldovans here speak Russian. Clearly, the authors of the devastating article in IZVESTIYA were referring to the Russian population in the Dniester Region. But in that case they should have known that the overwhelming majority of the Republic of Moldova's Russian population live not in the Dniester Region, in other words on the left bank, but on the right bank of the Dniester River. If you follow the authors' logic, the Russian population of Kishinev, Beltsy, Bendery, and other population centers on the Right Bank are in very great danger of being handed over to Romania. And if that is the case, a Russian Army should be massed on the right bank and the so-called Dniester Moldavian Republic set up. But that is absurd! There is a second misunderstanding. Neither Left Bank nor Right Bank Russians, or Ukrainians, Moldovans, Gagauz, and representatives of other nationalities are threatened with being "handed over to Romania." Since during a 6 March 1994 sociological poll the overwhelming majority of the population of the Republic of Moldova advocated building an independent, integral, and indivisible state. And whereas some people previously played on the threat of Moldova's joining another state in order to somehow justify separatism and a foreign army's sojourn on its territory, it is now time to renounce this claim which is known to be false. It is better to tell the truth, as a specialist on nearby foreign countries did in Moscow's international newspaper MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS (No. 9). We quote: "The territory of the Dniester Region (that is the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova -- Author's Note) where the Russian 14th Army is stationed is of exceptional military-strategic importance for Russia and it therefore seems quite logical for a permanent Russian military base to be set up there. During the special period [osobyy period] this base will perform the function of an advance detachment, ensuring the arrival and deployment of the strategic grouping of Russian troops in this sector." It is because of these aspirations, Messrs. Academics, that Valeriya Novodvorskaya does not like the state. It is not a question of the rights of the "Russian-speaking population," which no one is violating, but of Russia's special military-strategic interests. It is necessary to call a spade a spade; particularly for doctors of historical sciences.
