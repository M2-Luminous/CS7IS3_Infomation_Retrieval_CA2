Let me tell you that I used to have an army and I trusted His Excellency [H.E.] Lon Nol more than anyone. Lon Nol got all of his ranks and positions because of me. At that time, H.E. Nhoek Chulong retired and H.E. Lon Nol was given command of the army. H.E. Lon Nol was even entrusted with the premiership of the Royal Government when I made an official visit to the Soviet Union. Then, together with Prince Sirik Matak, H.E. Lon Nol deposed me in Phnom Penh. Ever since, as all of you know, we have experienced nothing but hardship and misery. You know how difficult life has been since that coup d'etat. So how can I trust the army? I was betrayed by those who were supposed to be my personal guards, by my own prime minister, and especially by the army itself. Mr. Lon Nol was the head of a royal army, not a republican army; a royal guard, not a presidential guard. He deposed me when he was commander of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces. The same story can be heard in many African and Latin American countries. The head of state is deposed when he is visiting foreign countries, and is deposed by his own soldiers. For this reason, I no longer want my soldiers to be my royal guard. The other day, H.E. [words indistinct] and some other excellencies asked if they could form my royal guard. I said: Wait, do you want to depose me? [laughter] It was not another army but the army close to me that deposed me. Who deposed me? My prime minister did; my commander in chief himself did. Many heads of state around the world have been deposed by their own right-hand men. So let it be known that I will no longer accept my own soldiers as bodyguards. Some may wonder why as a Khmer I do not use my fellow Khmers to protect me. Please excuse me. If you do not want me to die soon, or to be ousted soon, permit me to be protected by my Korean bodyguards. I have 25 now, and President Kim Il-song has assured me that if I want to have 50 he will send another 25. Each of these Koreans has been trained to handle 100 adversaries; one against 100 [preceding three words in French]. So 10 of them can fight against 1,000, and 20 against 2,000. If I have 50, they will be able to fight many, many more adversaries. Therefore, do not give me any nonsense about making arrangements for my protection. There was a request made to President Kim Il-song asking for ammunition and [word indistinct] to set up a division to protect Samdech Sihanouk. President Kim Il-song replied that he would provide anything Samdech Sihanouk wished. I quickly entreated President Kim-Il-song not to give anything; not to reply to the request. This is because if such an arrangement were made, it would be possible for those who made it to depose me. Therefore, I beg your pardon for not being duped. I want to make it clear that I would not accept that arrangement. I have already asked President Kim Il-song not to give you anything. If he did, I would be killed; I would be deposed. So all of my trust is placed in my 25 Korean friends. I am waiting for the Khmer Rouge to return the land they are using before I increase the number of Korean guards to 50. I need the land to build living quarters for them. I am in great need of space, and the land now occupied by the Khmer Rouge would be a good site to build houses for my 50 Korean guards. I have 25 of them now. It is sufficient, but they are working too hard -- around the clock without rest -- for my protection. That is my answer to the second question. I refuse to accept a Cambodian royal guard. Who deposed me? Lon Nol did. [passage omitted including journalist's two-part question] Now, let us discuss the second question concerning the Khmer Rouge and the roundtable. Your Excellency Kong Sam-ol, is it not true that a round table has been prepared? We use a round table, without any edges, to illustrate our idea of equality for all parties living in the same family, free from any distinction regarding status, rank, or position. Those who sit at the round table are among equals. No one is head of state, prime minister, National Assembly chairman, or a mere party leader. We are all in the same family at the round table. Yet the roundtable meeting is impossible. This is a matter of great concern because our people want peace. Why? If there is war, the people suffer greatly. Not only the people, but soldiers and the rank and file will all be miserable. Everyone will suffer, and so will our efforts at national reconstruction. The culprit is war. For this reason, we must seek to stop the fighting by all means. If there is disagreement between the Khmer Rouge and the Royal Government, both sides must agree to talk to each other like brothers. They must not reject or oppose talks. [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] My plan was this: Both sides would meet for three to four hours at a time, after which the negotiators would come out and meet with the media. Those of you in the media would grill them thoroughly to learn about their positions. Once you understood their positions, our people would also come to understand them through your good offices. That was my plan, but we could not do it for now. Why? It was for this reason: At first, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen rejected the proposal for the meeting to be held inside the Royal Palace, although they have agreed to it now. Khieu Samphan said that it was not safe for him to stay near the Royal Palace, citing security reasons. He asked that he and his delegation be allowed to stay in the Royal Palace; not the Khemarin Palace [Sihanouk's residence], but a building inside the Royal Palace compound so as to be close to the king for protection. I agreed to that request and Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen -- who were opposed to the idea before -- have now agreed to it. So I wrote to Khieu Samphan yesterday. Khieu Samphan replied, saying thanks but no thanks. He said Phnom Penh was not neutral and he wants to meet at a neutral venue, perhaps meaning somewhere abroad. He said that no place in the country is neutral. So we cannot go anywhere in Cambodia to meet -- Siem Reap, Pailin, Kep, Sihanoukville -- none would be neutral. Therefore he asked to meet in Paris, Jakarta, Pyongyang, or Beijing. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim have told me they adamantly refuse to meet the Khmer Rouge abroad. They insist that the meeting must be inside the country. The current situation is this: Khieu Samphan refuses to meet inside the country and demands to go outside, while the leaders in Phnom Penh refuse to go outside the country and insist on meeting inside. The other day I met with French Minister Francois Fillon, who came here on behalf of his head of state; his government. He assured me that France would do anything I wished. I told him I would ask Prince Krompreah Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen if they would agree to go to Paris. If they go, Khieu Samphan will also go because he will go anywhere as long as it is not inside Cambodia. Unfortunately, Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen answered that they would not go to Paris, Jakarta, Pyongyang, Beijing, or anywhere outside of Cambodia. With such a difference of views, we have certainly arrived at an impasse; a dead end. In order to hold a roundtable, each side must be willing to compromise. Without compromise there can be no solution. [passage omitted] How can we rebuild the country with the war raging? Our natural resources are being destroyed by the war. Therefore, we must put an end to the war; there must be an unconditional cease-fire [preceding two words in English]. There must be no conditions at all. There must be an unconditional cease-fire and negotiations. That is my proposal even today; I repeat, today [preceding nine words in English]. But who will listen to me? If no one listens, it becomes a very difficult situation, especially now that the Khmer Rouge is winning. How can you expect the Khmer Rouge to join the roundtable readily if they are still feeling high from their victory? There is another thing. They say they refuse to let the Khmer Rouge join the government; that they would not amend the Constitution to let the Khmer Rouge join the government. So we have nothing to give them in return. My idea was to give the Khmer Rouge some reward for transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng, Preah Vihear; and so on -- that is, all the autonomous Khmer Rouge regions -- back to the Royal Government. As compensation, the Royal Government should enact a small constitutional amendment to allow the Khmer Rouge to join the government. You do not have to mention the Khmer Rouge specifically by name, just say that if you need someone from outside of parliament, you can do it. The practice of bringing in people who did not participate in the elections is common in other countries. We did it under Sangkum Reas Niyum. So I asked them to consider all of that. They answered that they would not give anything to the Khmer Rouge. Samdech Chea Sim wrote me that whatever the Khmer Rouge asked for, this side would not give it to them. If they are not given anything, what will they get in exchange? In exchange for the Khmer Rouge transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng, Preah Vihear, and other zones under their control to us, the Royal Government should have some rewards for them. The government's current position, however, is that the Khmer Rouge can come in but will get nothing for it. So they have no choice but to continue fighting. If we win, it will be great; if they win, though, it will be serious for us. For the time being, no one seems to have the upper hand. There is no winner or loser. Only the people are the losers; they are not directly engaged in the fighting, but they have been fleeing everywhere. Some 25,000 fled to Thailand and 10,000 others are joining them now. During the battle of Pailin, 10,000 civilians and soldiers fled in confusion into Battambang. The people are the ones who are suffering. Moreover, many bridges and roads have been destroyed. If the fighting among Khmers continues, our nation will perish. Our country will be wiped out if we Khmers continue to fight and kill each another without pity or compromise. Who will benefit from that? Our neighbors will; the foreigners will, especially Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand and Vietnam are not going to invade us anymore, but they will benefit when we go down. Each time one Khmer kills another, the foreigners gain. [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Our experience, therefore, shows us -- teaches us -- that we must not fight each other; we must regard each other as brothers. This should only be the Royal Government's stand; both sides should uphold this common stance. The Khmer Rouge, however, have never understood this concept. When they were in power, they constantly boasted they had saved the nation. How could they have saved it when 2-3 million Khmers perished? Some Vietnamese also died, of course, but many more Khmers lost their lives than Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge must be held responsible for the deaths of 2-3 million Khmers. How could they boast of being the protectors -- the saviors -- of the Khmer race? Their sale of gems to foreigners -- as well as allowing foreigners to come in and cut our trees -- does not serve the national interest. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is at fault; serious fault. Of course, I am not passing judgment on this or that person. I am not saying that this person must be punished and that person must be acquitted. I am merely asking everyone to end the fighting and start negotiations. This is just my personal opinion. If we have to go to Paris, then let us go to Paris so we can explore any possible way to make peace. If we resume fighting without even trying to end it by all possible means, we will not be at peace with ourselves. We should talk in Paris to see who is right and who is wrong. The ultimate truth will be revealed to everyone, because some of you in the media who have the means will go and listen to the discussions in Paris. Why Paris? I had asked for the meeting be held in the DPRK. I own a very large palace near Pyongyang called the Land of Longevity. There is a lake in front of my palace. There are small hills, pine trees, and a cool breeze. President Kim Il-song donated this land to Cambodia and officially recognized it as Cambodian territory. We would be meeting on Cambodian soil in Pyongyang, but they rejected my offer. So, because Pyongyang was unacceptable, I proposed that we go to Paris or Jakarta. France and Indonesia were the cochairs of the Cambodian peace treaty that we all signed in Paris on 23 October 1991. Our problem remains linked with Paris and Jakarta as the cochairs. Therefore, we should seek their help in finding a solution to our dispute. If the Phnom Penh side disagrees with this, I cannot help it. I know that Khieu Samphan would accept because he will go anywhere provided it is outside of Cambodia. He would go anywhere. This evening I am going to meet with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. This morning I am meeting with you from the media, and in the evening I will meet with the two leaders and we will see what their position is. Then I will make my findings known to all of you in a few lines of writing to both the national and international press. So this is all I have to tell you at this moment. Do not worry. I will continue to make efforts toward peace, because the longer the fighting lasts, the more people will perish. Moreover, we will never be at peace with ourselves if we fail to explore every possibility for peace. When we really run out of peaceful means -- when there is no other way but war -- then we will go to war. I do not give my blessing, of course, but if both sides really want to fight they should go ahead and fight. You will be responsible to history. If I were given the choice -- the power to decide -- I would stop the fighting; order an immediate and unconditional cease-fire [preceding two words in French and repeated in English]. Yes, if I could decide I would order two things: A cease-fire -- cessation of the killing -- and talk. [passage omitted] Your king's position can be summed up as follows: First, there must be an end to hostility -- there must be peace; and second, there must be a roundtable. If this roundtable cannot be held here at home, it should be held somewhere outside the country. In my opinion, this is a good compromise to save either side from a possible loss of face. It is quite convenient to go to Paris. The other option is Jakarta. We can go anywhere provided the three samdeches first agree to go abroad, and second accept a venue convenient to them. If they decide not to go, then we will come to a dead end. That is one possible scenario. If they are forced to agree to go abroad, the king will be criticized for being pro-Khmer Rouge; blindly working for them. They would think that when the Khmer Rouge asked to be quartered in the Royal Palace we had to concede to their request; that the Khmer Rouge won that round. Now the Khmer Rouge has rejected a roundtable inside of the country and the king again wants us to go abroad. So, my children, this is my position: I dare not make another appeal to the three samdeches. If I do, they will say that the king is not neutral; that the king only loves the Khmer Rouge and is harsh toward his children on the other side. So I do not dare put any pressure on the three samdeches. If the three samdeches listen to the radio, they should understand my position. When we agreed to this interview, I requested that our state radio and television broadcast it fully; not partially. Please broadcast the whole thing, even if it lasts until 2300 or midnight. IBC [International Broadcasting Corporation], which is making a lot of money in the television business, is also invited to maximize its broadcast of this interview so that our people -- both our leaders and the masses -- know everything. Many of you from the media are present here, but quite a few are absent. Do the absentees hate me? Are they trying to avoid me? [laughter] That is alright. I do not mind. They will not miss anything, though. You who are here and will surely brief them on what the king said. Anyway, they can listen to the radio or watch television. [passage omitted] [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am from the KHMER APPYEAKROET newspaper. I wish to ask your majesty two questions: First question: Do you have any other means or solutions to solve the deadlocked roundtable issue so that the warring parties will sit at the negotiating table, end the war, and make peace for the Cambodian people? Second question: This is a question about ethnic Vietnamese. Cambodia belongs to the Cambodians. When Cambodians enter Vietnam, they are arrested, yet Vietnamese are flowing into Cambodia on a daily basis. During the election year there was a perceptible decrease in Vietnamese immigration. Since then, more Vietnamese have been coming to Cambodia. One can see that there are Vietnamese everywhere. They clog up our rivers and cities. How are you -- along with the current Royal Government -- going to solve this problem? [Sihanouk] I have said virtually everything about the roundtable. There is no need to elaborate and I have nothing to add to what I already said. Now let us consider the second question; that is, the question of the Vietnamese immigrants, whether legal or illegal. It is difficult to tell for sure how many Vietnamese are in Cambodia. If we ask our leaders, they say there are only about 30,000-40,000 ethnic Vietnamese. Others -- those who are not in power -- put the number at some 2 million. Some would say 500,000 and others 50,000. I do not know what the real number is. In the Royal Palace, we do not have a department capable of counting -- of investigating -- the Vietnamese. I have one of my cousins here, H.E. Buor Herl, who has always served me and who is an authority on Cambodia. He comes from abroad. He is not one of the local businessmen. He saw me in Cambodia and expressed his wish to come and serve me again. I am going to assign him to investigate this issue. He is not going to take a census of all the Vietnamese in Cambodia. That would be an impossible task; some areas are impenetrable because of poor security. Please come here, Excellency Herl. His father, Buor Hong, was a freedom fighter against the French colonialists. He was jailed and exiled by the French. His has always been a family of freedom fighters. Herl himself fought against the Vietnamese, right? It was during the time when the ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia], KPNLAF [Khmer National Liberation Armed Forces], and even the Khmer Rouge joined hands against the Vietnamese. So his credentials are good; he is certainly not pro-Vietnamese. How about your wife? She is a pure blooded Cambodian, is she not? [laughter] If she were Vietnamese, it might would be difficult to conduct the investigation. By the way, do you have a Vietnamese girlfriend? No? [laughter] I have a joke. It is about H.E. Um Manorin [Princess Monique's stepbrother] over there. He used to have a Vietnamese girlfriend. His wife went after that poor girl, smashing all her pots and pans and banishing her back to Vietnam. Was it your wife who sent her packing? Oh, it was Ku Run [police chief]? I heard that she lost a few of her teeth. If you meet her now, I think her face would not be pleasant to see. [laughter] I believe you are more nationalist now, and maybe you have stopped dreaming about Vietnamese starlets. So let us all put our heads together and think about how to deal with the Vietnamese immigrants. More and more are coming every day. Where should we begin the investigation? How many are at Neak Luong? [murmuring] Yes, but Neak Luong has always been known as Saigon Moi. It was known as New Saigon even under Lon Nol. It is not easy to know for sure. Let me tell all of you that the state has a hard time dealing with some aspects of this issue. There are Vietnamese who fled Khmer Rouge persecution and are now trying to return by boat because Vietnam does not recognize them as its own citizens and wants them to return. They are massing at the border. The state is not allowing in for fear of annoying our Cambodian people. There are many boats at the border, and international humanitarian organizations have to feed these people at our country's expense. These organizations are based in Cambodia and are supposed to feed starving Cambodians. Now they are feeding these Vietnamese instead. These organizations include FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization], UNICEF, and others. They are not supposed to assist Vietnamese people in Vietnam, but they are doing just that for the Vietnamese stranded at the border, unwanted by both Vietnam and Cambodia. This is one group. Another group is formed by those who have come into Cambodia by various routes and claim that our soldiers and police are corrupt. No, I am not accusing my children who are soldiers and police of corruption. It is a fact that our authorities cannot stop them because our border demarcation is not as clear as in the past. Under Sangkum Reas Niyum, the border was clearly demarcated. Now it is different. Vietnam might have secretly moved the border deep into our territory. Many of the Vietnamese in our country can still claim to be in Vietnam because the border markers have been replanted inside Cambodia. Therefore, the governments in Phnom Penh and Hanoi must hold talks to demarcate the border clearly. As far as the ethnic Vietnamese in the interior of the country are concerned, they enjoy almost excessive protection by the West. They contend they are the offspring of Vietnamese immigrants who came to Cambodia when King Sihanouk was young. They say these Vietnamese existed when King Sihanouk was king previously and when the French were here, before Cambodia was independent. The present-day Vietnamese, therefore, are the great grandchildren of these Vietnamese immigrants. As such, they have the right to live in Cambodia. This is what has been written in the Western press, showing that the West is siding with the ethnic Vietnamese. [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Then there are the Vietnamese who have Cambodian citizenship acquired under the previous administration on the grounds that they had lived for an extended period of time in Cambodia or were born in Cambodia. Those Vietnamese who have proof that their ancestors lived in Cambodia, or who hold Cambodian identity cards given by the State of Cambodia because they were born in Cambodia, lived in Cambodia for many years, and know the Cambodian language and literature, will not be driven out. This is because Cambodians living in France, the United States, Germany, and other countries have acquired citizenship in their host countries. If Cambodians in, say, Canada can get Canadian citizenship, how can we be harsh with the Vietnamese in our country? If we insist, we would be accused of infringing on the principles of human rights. This matter is quite touchy. Nevertheless, we have the right to deport back to Vietnam those who have immigrated illegally, including prostitutes of all descriptions. We can do that. The government should check out the illegal immigrants -- be they farmers or traders -- and deport them. We can tell them they are not permitted to live in Cambodia and we invite them to return to their own country. We can do this because illegal immigrants of all nationalities, including Cambodians, in France and other countries who do not have proper residency cards are driven out of those countries. So here is my answer to your question: 1. Any Vietnamese having proof that his ancestors lived in Cambodia in the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's, or 1960's -- that he is their great grandchild -- will be allowed to live in Cambodia because he is a Cambodian. 2. Any Vietnamese who legally acquired citizenship under the ruling State of Cambodia on the grounds that he was born in Cambodia or lived in Cambodia for many years and could speak, read, and write Cambodian well will not be asked to leave. We have no legal grounds to deport this category of Vietnamese. We have the right to send back other Vietnamese, though -- any Vietnamese who have illegally immigrated into Cambodia and have not received official permission from the previous administration or the current government. We will politely ask them to leave. We invite them to leave. We must check for this type of Vietnamese. Some areas are not safe to go and check for these Vietnamese, but I believe that the areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge need not be checked because the Khmer Rouge would not allow any Vietnamese to remain alive there. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Your Majesty announced that Khieu Samphan had asked you to leave Phnom Penh. The people were very alarmed. Do you have anything to say to calm their fears? Another thing is that we would like to see a cease-fire in place first before a roundtable is held. [Sihanouk] This is a good question. I have to tell you that I still require more cancer treatment in China, and President Jiang Zemin has invited me on a three-day state visit before I undergo further medical treatment. If need be, however -- if the people need my presence in the country -- I might postpone my cancer treatment in China or I might have my cancer treated here so I can stay in Cambodia. But my wife wants to see me undergo the treatment because she does not want to be a widow soon. Despite all my brave words to the contrary, I am more or less of a henpecked husband. [passage omitted] Now let us talk about the roundtable. It is not right to ask the Khmer Rouge to observe a cease-fire first; both sides must stop fighting equally. Then we can proceed to the roundtable in Cambodia. But Khieu Samphan does not want a roundtable in Cambodia. What is your opinion; what is your suggestion if Khieu Samphan does not want to hold it here? This problem is important. All of you should help solve it. [Correspondent] I am the director of the SAMLENG POLROAT KHMER newspaper. My respects to Your Majesty. It is my opinion that both sides should listen to Your Majesty's proposal. Khieu Samphan's side should stop fighting and so should the people on this side. Both sides should find the solution to our problem together. [Sihanouk] Thank you. I would like to inform you all that at 1730 this afternoon I will meet with Samdech Ranaridddh and Samdech Hun Sen. I will ask them point blank whether or not they agree to a cease-fire. I suggest that the cease-fire should be bilateral and observed equally by both sides. The roundtable will be held in the Damnak Chan Pavilion, and H.E. Khieu Samphan will be asked to join. We will do that, if you do not disagree. I will do that this afternoon. If the two samdeches agree, I will fax a letter to Khieu Samphan and ask him whether or not he agree if the other side has already agreed. Both sides will be asked to send their generals to form a committee under my chairmanship to oversee the cease-fire. After the cease-fire is in place, Mr. Khieu Samphan will be invited to join a roundtable to solve the problem for the people. If this problem cannot be solved, each side will be held responsible before history and the people. If you do not disagree, I will do just that. [passage omitted] [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am the deputy editor of the SAKAL newspaper. According to news reports, the Royal Government will reject the Khmer Rouge because they refused to join the roundtable on 2 May. If this is the case, how will the Royal Government solve the peace problem in Cambodia and what means will it use to do so? [Sihanouk] Thank you. This is an important question, but I have already answered it in detail. Khieu Samphan refused to come to Phnom Penh, saying that his security was not ensured. He wants to go abroad. First he said that if his security was assured he would come. Now he says no even though he was given permission to stay in the Royal Palace. Maybe this is because he is winning battles. Maybe because he is winning he is looking for excuses not to hold a roundtable. This is only a guess. If we want to corner him, we should agree to go to Paris. But the children on this side say it would not be practical to go to Paris. If all the leaders go to Paris, what would happen here? Who would take care of affairs at home? There would be anarchy. I agree with the children on this side. If we go to Paris, it would be difficult to control the situation and the fighting at home. Another thing is that it would not be nice to look at. This does not mean I am siding with the three samdeches. It would be an ugly prospect. There would be no end to the problems and it would be most impractical to resort to foreign venues all the time. Why can we not meet at home? It is proper and sufficient to meet in the Royal Palace. Khieu Samphan should agree to come and join the roundtable here so that all the suspicions can be cleared and everyone can see for sure who is right and who is wrong. We should meet and discuss things once and for all. Each negotiator will be grilled by the media so that the nation, the international community, and history can see who is right and who is wrong.
