Prior to that there had not been any such crop. The output of this winter spring crop is estimated to be about 4.5 million tons, which is equal to the annual rice output in the early years after the liberation. Currently, farmer in southern Vietnam cultivate 3 rice crops a year :winter-spring, summer-autumn, and the year-end rice crop. The cultivated area of each crop is never less than 1 million hectares. In the early years after liberation, farmers in southern Vietnam, mainly in the Mekong delta, cultivated only one rice crop, the year-end rice crop, and obtained an average yield of about 1.8 tons/hectare. Two more rice crops were gradually introduced the winter-spring and the summer-autumn and these became the main rice crops of the year instead of the year-end crop. During the years of implementing the party's directive 100 up to 1988 the area growing the winter-spring and summer-autumn rice was expanded to about 600,000 ha with an average productivity of 4.5 tons/ha for the winter spring crop and 3.5 tons/ha for the summer-autumn crop. Next came resolution 10 of the party's politburo, which called for renewal of the management of agricultural production. This has given a real boost to agricultural production and to the national rice output. Besides increasing rice crops in a year, southern farmers were also called upon to reclaim waste land from the Plain of Reeds, Long Xuyen quadrangle and the western area of Hau River for rice production. Within a few years, about 200,000 ha have been reclaimed from these areas and put under two rice crops a year. Now, Tien Giang, Long An and Dong Thap Provinces in the Plain of Reeds cultivate 529,000 ha with rice. The average food share produced by farmers in the plain of reeds, Long Xuyen quadrangle and the western area of Hau River ranges between 1.5 and 2.5 tons per capita. These 3 areas are now producing an output of 5 million tons of commodity rice a year, more than the total yearly rice output of south Vietnam before liberation. Inspired by their achievements since the start of renovation, farmers in southern Vietnam are continuing to adjust the structure of agricultural production and renew the rural economy in the direction of industrialisation and modernisation, thus creating conditions for the country to integrate its economy into the world economy.
