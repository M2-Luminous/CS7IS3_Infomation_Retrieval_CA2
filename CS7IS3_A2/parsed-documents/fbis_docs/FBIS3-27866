Although coalition party representatives met twice, they failed to reach a conclusion due to a gulf over whether to offset the proposed income tax reduction with a hike in the consumption tax, the officials said. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito (the Japan Renewal Party), told reporters the meetings broke down, adding that the ruling parties will hold another round of talks on Wednesday to thrash out a decision. "It all depends on the SDP (Social Democratic Party)," said Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party. The SDP, the largest force in the seven-party coalition government, has objected to the idea of raising the consumption tax, presently at 3 percent, to cover the diminished revenue resulting from the proposed income tax cut. The income tax reduction is expected to be the core of a fresh economic stimulus package to be finalized by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet on Thursday. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters later that the party is willing to consider a more balanced tax system but oppose the consumption tax hike coupled in the same package with an income tax reduction. He indicated it is acceptable to issue relatively short-term national bonds, like those that mature in five years, to fund tax cuts.
