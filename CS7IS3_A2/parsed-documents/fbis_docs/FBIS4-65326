He is to return to his native New Zealand to take up an academic post. This creates a by-election -- the sixth pending -- in Dagenham, in east London. He had already announced his intention to quit. Mr. Gould, 55, a committed Euro-critic, fought John Smith for the leadership in 1992 as the torch-carrier of the left. But he was routed. He resigned last night as an MP under the technicality of being appointed by the Chancellor as steward amd bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. This is an office of profit under the Crown and prevents its holder from serving as an MP. The two offices of profit under the Crown which are alternatively used are the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of Northstead. Theoretically an MP cannot resign but can be disqualified by accepting such an office. Holding them, however, generates no income, but a person's membership of the House automatically lapses. General election result at Dagenham -- Bryan Gould (Labour) 22,027; Don Rossiter (Conservative) 15,294; Charles Marquand (Liberal Democrat) 4,824. Majority 6,733. Turnout 70.7 The writ for the by-election may be moved today, along with others. It could take place on June 9, the same day as the European elections.
