The Georgian government said in a statement made public Monday that it "is prepared to continue the search for a political settlement through negotiations but will take every step to protect Georgian citizens in the area which is occupied today by separatists and their protectors." The document accuses what it described as "certain political quarters in Russia" of "virtually provoking the Gudauta leaders into a new escalation of barbarism" by rejecting a comprehensive treaty between Georgia and Russia.
