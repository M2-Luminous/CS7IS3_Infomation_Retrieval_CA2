UN Operations in Mozambique says the big influx of Renamo members took place at two assembly areas which were opened early this week. Each was designed to accommodate 500 men, but on Wednesday [2 February] 723 Renamo guerrillas arrived at Mocubela in the northern Province of Zambezia, and further south at Savane in Sofala Province 928 Renamo members arrived. Throughout the country there are now nearly 18,000 government soldiers and about 11,000 Renamo guerrillas in assembly areas. The men are being disarmed under a peace agreement signed by the government and Renamo in October 1992. Under the terms of the agreement a total of about 80,000 men should go to the assembly points. Fifteen thousand men from each side are to be incorporated into a new unified defense force while the rest are to be demobilized.
