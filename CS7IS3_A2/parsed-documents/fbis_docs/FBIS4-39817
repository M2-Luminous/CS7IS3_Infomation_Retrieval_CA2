Vladimir Shumeyko made public his views on the budget, which has already been adopted by the State Duma, at a meeting with the correspondent. [Shumeyko] In my view the budget is like porridge plastered on a plate. [Shashkov] Instead of being aimed at, say, the reconstruction of the economy or support for the military industrial complex, the budget, in the opinion of the Federation Council chairman, is just a record of the government's expenditure. [Shumeyko] The Federation Council naturally will not agree to such a budget; at least I personally do not agree to it. [Shashkov] From Vladimir Shumeyko's viewpoint, the difference in approach to the budget between the two chambers of parliament comes down to the fact that the upper chamber represents the state, while the lower chamber does not. [Shumeyko] I have the impression that the Duma, thanks to the fact that it has a political set up and not a state one, by adopting this budget shows -- or so I think -- the worse the better, we'll change the authorities more quickly. But this is not a matter of replacing the authorities, it is a matter of strengthening the state. [Shashkov] A few minutes earlier, Shumeyko shared his impressions on his visit to the strategic missile troops. Here, this was not a matter of strengthening the state. It seems that strategic missiles... [Shumeyko, interrupting] ...Give us confidence that, while we have them and are occupied here with political wars and other business to ensure the collapse of the state, but not construct it, we can at least be sure that no one is going to touch us for the time being.
