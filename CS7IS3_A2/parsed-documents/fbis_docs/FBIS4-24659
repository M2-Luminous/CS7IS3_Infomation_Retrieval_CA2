In comparison, State industrial output last year grew by 6.4 percent, said Xu Hongyuan, an economist with the centre's economic forecasting department. The State Information Centre is an arm of the State Planning Commission. Hindered by some small and medium-sized money-losing factories, State industry only saw a limited production growth of 2.2 percent in March and 5 percent in April, Xu added. However, he predicted that in the months to come large factories will lead State manufacturers to stepped-up production, aided by a slight loosening of the government's controls on credit. "Their production growth may stand at around 7 percent in May and June," he noted. The higher industrial production will help push up growth in the gross national product by 12 percent during the first six months, Xu said. During the first half of this year, State factories are expected to turn over to the government 30 percent more in taxes than in the same period last year. Xu believes that the big factories are propping up the entire State sector, which accounted for nearly half of the country's industrial output last year. Big factories make up one-fifth of all State industrial enterprises. Official sources say that slow sales and outdated products are responsible for "quite a lot" of the operational losses of small and medium-sized firms. Xu said that State enterprises turn over to the government as much in taxes as do foreign-funded firms, but that growth in their production and profits is much slower. This reflects slower improvements in efficiency in small and medium-sized State enterprises. Heavy financial burdens are hobbling State industries trying to increase their profitability, Xu noted. For example, he said, "A worker in a State-owned factory now has to support the pensions of at least two retirees." Meanwhile, wage reform has raised workers' salaries by 28 percent even as State factories struggle for profits and inventories pile up. Economists with the State Information Centre suggest that State firms take bold steps to strengthen their internal management. For instance, they say that linking employee salaries to company profits would raise morale and improve productivity. In addition, they believe that since the central government urges State factories to finance the pensions of many retirees, it should also consider slashing plants tax burdens. Xu said the government should give most money-losing State factories a chance to recover, since they are struggling hard to cope with sweeping reforms in finance and taxation. However, those State firms that stubbornly cling to discredited management methods and continue to lose money should be declared bankrupt or be merged with other factories.
