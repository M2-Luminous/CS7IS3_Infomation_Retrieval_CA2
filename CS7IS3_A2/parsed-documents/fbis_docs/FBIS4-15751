The "Memorandum on Cooperation in the Sphere of National Security," the draft of which Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov has submitted to the [U.S.] White House, and of which we have a copy, notes that the following will be considered top-priority areas: "National security in the economy, ecology, and in the sphere of preserving the health and gene pool of the nation, and the fight against crime, international terrorism, and the drugs mafia." If Washington finds the draft acceptable, the memorandum will be signed within the next few months during a return visit to Moscow by Anthony Lake, assistant to U.S. President for national security affairs. The memorandum, which typically contains at least two references to the fact that the implementation of the cooperation programs will depend on the availability of sufficient funding in rubles and hard currency, regrettably does not give a clear idea of how specifically these programs will supplement those already being implemented by the Foreign Ministry and the Department of State, the defense ministries, and other U.S. and Russian departments. Oleg Lobov's delegation was impressed by the so-called White House Situation Room, where the U.S. top leadership convenes in crisis situations and where, in ordinary situations, information about events in the United States itself and abroad is amassed and systematized. It emerged from a conversation with the Russian National Security Council secretary that there are already plans to set up a similar situation room in Moscow in one of the former Central Committee buildings on Staraya Ploshchad. "How much will the project cost?" "There are no figures as yet regarding cost," Oleg Lobov replied, "but the expenditure will undoubtedly pay off." The expenditure will presumably be considerable, given that the room will be equipped with the same computers and other modern equipment as that in Washington -- if not better.
