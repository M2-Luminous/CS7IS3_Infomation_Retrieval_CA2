In his view, local conflicts could grow into an all-out war throughout that region. Shanibov feared that a Kabardino-Balkarian problem might emerge on top of the Abkhazian, Ossetian-Ingush, Chechen and Ossetian-Georgian troubles. He accused Sergey Filatov, the Russian president's chief of staff, of having inspired the decree on steps to rehabilitate the Balkarian people issued by Valeriy Kokov, the president of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (KBR). The decree called for reinstatement of two Balkarian districts that had been abolished in 1944. Shanibov felt that the decree might revive KBR's territorial claims on parts of Northern Ossetia and the Stavropol Territory. On the other hand, Shanibov believed that those who did not want war and supported Abkhazia and the CCP to an extent were gaining influence in the Russian leadership. He said that the CCP intended to establish contacts with the West and international organizations with a view to obtaining their aid in resolving the North Caucasian problems.
