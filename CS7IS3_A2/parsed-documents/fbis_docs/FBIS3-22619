Bunget-signed report: "The Number of Cancer Cases Explodes -- 500 New Cases Each Year"] [Text] While until recently in Mehedinti County they registered a number of 400 new cancer cases each year, last year the number of those found to be suffering from that illness increased to 500. Among the most frequent forms of cancer are those of the thyroid gland, lungs, and leukemia. According to experts, such an alarming "explosion" of the number of new cancer cases is the consequence of radioactive emissions from Chernobyl. The peak is expected in 1996. However, in the opinion of the experts, the large number of people in Mehedinti County condemned to death by this merciless illness may also be directly linked to the nuclear accident at Kozloduy (Bulgaria) [on the Danube, close to Mehedinti County] and with the risk factors currently existing in Mehedinti County itself, of which the principal ones are the rubber plant, the cellulose and paper mill, and, especially, the heavy water plant. To all this one can also add the typical illness of workers at the uranium extraction plant, endemic nephropathy or E-type uremia. On top of all this, owing to the disastrous financial policy of the current rulers, the number of hospital beds is insufficient and the necessary hospital equipment is also inadequate. Not to mention the current exorbitant cost of chemotherapy!
