Dimidyuk, commander of the Missile and Artillery Troops of the Ground Troops, under the rubric "A Topical Subject": "To the Arms Market Through Joint Efforts"] [Text] IDEX-93: Results, Reflections, Conclusions The Russian exhibit was the largest at the International Exhibition of Weapons and Military Equipment held in the United Arab Emirates this year. It included everything from a Kalashnikov assault rifle to a transport helicopter and a large ASW ship. In my opinion the willingness of enterprises in our defense complex to display the latest items with a view to selling them to potential clients was greeted with interest and at the same time with caution by military firms of the USA, Great Britain, France, Canada and the Republic of South Africa. And that is understandable. The arms trade today is the most lucrative business there is. It can be compared to diamond sales with respect to revenues generated. And one should not seriously count on mutual understanding among the leading foreign firms. The competition is fierce. In order to trade successfully as equals, then, enterprises in our defense complex will have to take a sharp turn toward the market. I feel that since this is a state matter, an attitude corresponding to this status should be taken toward it. The exhibition demonstrated once again that we must give priority for the immediate future to the development of the most modern intelligence equipment, including airborne facilities. So long as we continue to invest money in the revitalization of enterprises producing obviously noncompetitive models, this problem will not be solved properly. Is it not time to officially designate in the nation a minimum of two or three competitors producing these products? Foreign experience has indicated the need for such measures. The government of postwar Japan, for example, did not permit firms to produce products for export until a fully competitive basis had been shaped in the industry. The effects of these decisions were so great that competition became one of the most important organizational principles even in relations within firms. We know that the Sony company is presently developing computers and video recorders simultaneously in ten highly competitive areas. This is typical also for the companies of other Western nations. Among the largest American companies producing the latest weapons, for example, only a tenth of the projects now reach the stage of commercial sale. Their designers always bear in mind the individual, the team or the crew. A convenient arrangement of this or that weapon model, well-designed lighting for the compartment, reliable intercom systems, fans and air conditioners, and effective fire-extinguishing facilities are a basic requirement of the arms purchasers. Extremely important along with the administrative and legal measures are economic regulators, which include long-term measures (programs, subsidies and benefits for effecting important structural and technological reforms in the defense industry), as well as measures designed to stimulate ongoing legal competition. Along with foreign economic actions, these measures include the regulation of prices, taxes, interest and the benefit of state orders. It will clearly be extremely difficult for our nation to take such a turn, particularly since the removal of the state from the economy has only begun. And this means that in order to stimulate competition the state must concern itself with the viability of those enterprises which are not experiencing the best of times. This state concern must differ from that of the present, however. If the state intends to take on the support of weak competitors, then it must see to the implementation of measures to improve their health. Incidentally, it should be mentioned that the reduction of the defense budget is evoking concern that allocations for basic research in the defense industry will also be reduced. This situation could result, as an example, in Russia's artillery science and technology taking a back seat in world scientific and technological progress. And we have fine designers, real professional specialists, working in the military-industrial complex. Take the team at the Uraltransmash production association, for example. The MSTA-S 152mm self-propelled howitzer displayed at the exhibition was developed there under the supervision of general designer Yu. Tomashov. Comments by the military experts indicate that its technical-tactical features are superior to those of American, British and French guns of the same caliber. Its main merit is its modern ammo-feed system and its high maximum rate of fire. Nor could I fail to mention one other prominent designer, S. Nepobedim, who has developed a large number of missiles--from ATGM to the well-known Oka and the Tochka missile system, which was displayed at the exhibition. I believe that books will be written about Sergey Pavlovich and this designer's extensive service to the homeland. His creative work is based on a union of the latest achievements of basic science and advanced technology. It is a terrible thing to think that many of these people will be deprived of the opportunity to engage in basic research as they should and will lose their scientific skills. In the conversion of the defense industry basic research should not be curtailed but, on the contrary, should be enhanced. This fact is for some reason discussed unwillingly and in different languages, as it were. Some people discuss it openly and honestly, while others just give accounts and reports. Still others are demandingly reproachful, especially when they want to shift the blame for their blunders onto subordinates. The latter, they say, underestimate the importance of this factor. But the language of truth should prevail in this discussion. He who is afraid to discuss the problem openly and honestly today, no matter how unpleasant it is, he who has had it with criticism directed at him is convincingly demonstrating that he has become a totally new type of conventionalist hiding his true identity behind the entire discussion. Given the great importance of these matters, the level of preparation and organization of the exhibit takes on particular importance. I would note with satisfaction that in the course of the joint effort we developed good business relations with V. Glukhikh, chairman of the Committee for the Defense Branches of Industry, with his first deputy G. Yanpolskiy and with the exhibit's board of directors P. Trishin, V. Kartavtsev and V. Belukov. It should be acknowledged, however, that, unfortunately, certain matters were not worked out in the best possible way at the first stage. In this regard I would have to express regret over the situation which developed with the loading of weapons and military equipment onto maritime and railway transport facilities and their unloading. The experience showed that the establishments and military departments involved need to give some serious thought to this matter. There was a shortage of gear for securing the items (rope, chains, bracing line and running-gear supports), beams and devices for loading large pieces of military equipment by means of cranes. This included design flaws in the equipment models themselves (absence of hooks, claws and other devices), which hampered their loading onto these types of transport. How does one account for all of this? Or take the following, which should not escape notice. In my view, the range of the latest weapons and military equipment selected was so diverse it not only significantly complicated preparations for the display but also made it impossible to design the pavilion so as to draw the visitors' attention to specific models. IDEX-93 was the debut of our defense industry, except for specific models of aviation equipment, which had been displayed at previous international air shows. Nonetheless, this approach could still not be considered optimal. I believe that in future such large undertakings the weapons should be broken down into groups: Missile troops, artillery and air defense, for example; armored and engineer troops; aviation; communication and radioelectronic equipment, and so forth. This would make it possible to display not just "bare" models but the weapons system in its entirety. That is, everything involved with the system, including the ZIP [set of spare parts, instruments and accessories], repair assemblies, combat support supplies and equipment, and modern ammunition for the most diverse purposes. It is hardly worthwhile to scrimp on funds to develop advertising write-ups, video films, posters and electrically operated stands depicting the parts and assemblies of the components and mechanisms for the models of training equipment to be displayed. We now need to mesh all of the know-how we have developed into a single whole and concentrate it all in the hands of those who produce the weapons and military equipment. I realize, however, that it will be extremely difficult or even impossible to do this. This is because the defense industry enterprises have not yet been granted complete independence. The equipment is one thing, but its effect in the arms market will be predetermined in great part by how well the teams and crews are prepared. The generals and officers of the MO [Ministry of Defense] GRAU [Main Missile and Artillery Directorate] and GBTU [Main Armor Directorate], our directorate and the military districts deserve high praise in this respect. Tests involving live missile launchings and live firing were conducted under their supervision at the Gorokhovetskiy (MVO [Moscow Military District]) and Kapustin-Yar (PriVO [Volga Military District]) training centers. A special tactical exercise involving live firing and conducted under the supervision of Col-Gen V. Semenov, commander in chief of the Ground Troops, was successfully fitted into the exhibit preparations plan and was off perceptible benefit. This is where the officers achieved a moral victory and acquired confidence in their capabilities. And now, as a result of the painstaking and intense work, top honors and first prize have been awarded to Russia's missilemen and artillerymen for firing on the range. They bettered the norm for combat performance in the desert by 25-30 percent and made no technical errors in the process. Thanks primarily to the good professional skills of officers A. Popov, S. Krainov, V. Polyakov, A. Dyrdin, V. Kuchinskiy, V. Kisov and A Khodul, the demonstration firing and missile launches took place without hitches and with highly effective fire. It goes without saying that when military duty merges with an inner need for self-improvement, with a love for the profession, in this meld are born such professionals. They know what they are worth and each of them, so to speak, has something to place onto the scale. In conclusion, I should mention that the ideas expressed in these comments do not cover all of the problems involved in accessing the arms market by far. There can be no doubt about one thing, however, that we will not travel this difficult path without joint efforts on the part of state agencies, the developers of the new weapons and practical specialists in the forces.
