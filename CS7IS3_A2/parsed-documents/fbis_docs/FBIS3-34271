People on both sides of the Line of Control dividing the Kashmir valley also observed complete strike. In occupied Kashmir, the All Parties Hurriat Conference decided to observe the strike in response to an appeal made by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto. Today was a closed day. Business and commercial centers, government and semi-government offices, and educational institutions remained closed. Public transport remained off the road and life came to a standstill throughout the country. The call for strike to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people struggling for their right of self-determination was given by the Special Committee of the National Assembly on Kashmir. The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto gave all-out support to the strike, highlighting the nation's commitment to the Kashmiri cause. Opposition parties joined hands, demonstrating that the entire nation is united behind the government on this national issue. In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, processions were taken out and rallies organized by people of all shades of political opinion, business, traders, students and labor organizations to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir. The processionists parading through various streets chanted slogans against repression the Indian Army and paramilitary forces have unleashed against the people in occupied Kashmir. Addressing the rally, speakers condemned the Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir and demanded that the United Nations implement its resolutions on Kashmir in order to determine the wishes of the Kashmiri people in a free and impartial plebiscite. They said the unprecedented unity shown by the people throughout the country today spoke of their determination to continue to extend moral and political support to their Kashmiri brethren in their struggle against Indian hegemony. They condemned the Indian president for his unsavory comments against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and said Ms. Benazir Bhutto has emerged as the spokesman of the Kashmiri people. Later, leaders of the rally went to the Indian High Commission and handed over a memorandum. Trade and labor organizations also staged demonstrations in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to express solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren. Carrying banners and placards, the marchers condemned Indian atrocities and urged the world community to halt human rights abuses in the held valley. They supported the government policy on Kashmir and assured that they will not rest until the Kashmiri people throw off their Indian yoke. [passage omitted] Supporting the call of the Pakistani prime minister, a complete strike was observed in occupied Kashmir. Reports say life remained paralyzed in towns and cities of the valley. All government and private institutes and offices; schools, colleges, and universities; banks; and courts remained closed and transport was off the road. Agency reports say Kashmiris staged demonstration rallies in the capital, Srinagar, and other big towns of the valley. They were chanting slogans against Indian troops' atrocities. Indian soldiers used brute force against the demonstrators. The All Parties Hurriat Conference and various religious and mojahedin organizations have endorsed the call for today's strike to demonstrate that the people of occupied Kashmir wholeheartedly appreciate Pakistan's stand on Kashmir.
