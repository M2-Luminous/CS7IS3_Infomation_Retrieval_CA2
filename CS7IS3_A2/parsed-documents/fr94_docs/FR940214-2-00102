FR940214-2-00102 FR940214-2-00059 9. Under the amended order, the CDSC would be waived with respect to: (a) Automatic cash withdrawals by a shareholder in amounts equal to or less than 2% per month of the value of the shareholder's shares at the time that the shareholder's participation in the withdrawal plan commences; (b) redemptions in connection with: (i) lump-sum or other distributions from a qualified corporate or self-employed retirement plan following retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or following attainment of age 591/2 of a plan participant, (ii) the hardship of a plan participant to the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''), (iii) a loan made by a qualified corporate or self-employed retirement plan to a participating employee, (iv) distributions and withdrawals from retirement plans or individual retirement accounts (``IRAs'') or custodial accounts under section 403(b)(7) of the Code following attainment of age 591/2; and (v) a tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares that are acquired as a result of an exchange into any Fund from any fund in the same ``group of investment companies'' as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act as the Trust and that are sold subject to a sales charge upon purchase (the ``Exchange Group of Funds''); (d) involuntary redemptions; and (e) redemptions by (i) employees of Travelers Inc. (formerly known as Primerica Corporation) and its subsidiaries (including Smith Barney Shearson), American Express and its subsidiaries, and The Boston Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, IRAs for those employees, employee benefit plans for those employees, and the spouses and minor children of those employees, (ii) accounts managed by investment advisory subsidiaries of Travelers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (iii) directors, trustees or general partners of any investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson serves as distributor. In accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act, a CDSC will not be imposed on exchanges between a Fund and any fund in the Exchange Group of Funds. 10. Under the amended order, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption proceeds in shares of any other Fund within 180 days of the redemption will continue to receive a proportionate credit (in the form of additional shares of the Fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for the CDSC imposed on the prior redemption. Also, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption proceeds within 30 days of the redemption in shares of any fund in the Exchange Group of Funds will continue to receive a proportionate credit (in the form of additional shares of the fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for any CDSC imposed on the prior redemption. In each case, the amount of the credit would be funded by Smith Barney Shearson out of a ``house'' account into which Smith Barney Shearson would maintain, on an ongoing basis, a portion of the proceeds from CDSCs assessed to shareholders. The account will at all times be maintained in an amount sufficient to provide all credits to which shareholders are entitled. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to permit the Funds to continue to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of the shares as described above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions. Applicants believe that the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load were imposed at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility that he or she will have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that the imposition of the CDSC permits the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. Applicant's Condition As a condition of the requested relief, applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, as currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
