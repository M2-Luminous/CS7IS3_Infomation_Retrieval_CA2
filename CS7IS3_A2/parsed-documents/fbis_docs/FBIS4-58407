FBIS4-58407 "drnes086_m_94002" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 JORDAN Al-Majali on Attendance at Cairo Signing Al-Majali on Attendance at Cairo Signing JN0305202294 Amman Jordan Television Network in English 1900 GMT 3 May 94 JN0305202294 Amman Jordan Television Network English BFN [From the "News at Ten" program] [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Jordan was not boycotting Middle East multilateral peace [talks] but rather lowering the level of participation in the talks. Dr. Al-Majali said the decision will continue until the situation on the ground changes with regards to Western interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. The prime minister told The News at Ten that Jordan would attend tomorrow's signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, adding that the agreement was not coordinated with Jordan. [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] We have told our foreign minister [title as heard] and our ambassador in Egypt to attend the meeting, which is going to take place tomorrow. [Correspondent al-Sha'ir] Did the PLO coordinate with Jordan with respect to the signing tomorrow? [Al-Majali] Not really. We did not receive anything from the PLO side, but we received from Egypt an invitation to attend, and we hope that it will be a very successful one. [Al-Sha'ir] Jordan is going to send an observer to Doha for the multilateral talks. Does this mean that Jordan still is going to avoid the peace process? [Al-Majali] Don't use the word observer. He is not an observer; he is a member of the delegation, but he is a single person to attend, and he will be attending, and in fact he has been there for a few days to talk even preliminarily before the general meeting. But he is not going to participate in the same way like in the old days because, still, we are not sure whether the issue of al-'Aqabah has been settled completely. Still, I think, it is in its final stages, so everything will be okay after that. [Al-Sha'ir] So, until a decision is taken, Jordan... [Al-Majali, interrupting] We are just joining. We are attending. We are not boycotting. We're just lowering the level of the participation itself, which is because of the economic reasons. Multilateral is for economic reasons. We cannot be punished economically and in the same time attend something in the economic side and in the regional side. [end recording] Dr. Al-Majali was speaking after a meeting with Egyptian journalists visiting Amman to cover Thursday's meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee. The prime minister expressed hope that the meeting will be a basic tool to reestablish Arab solidarity and upgrade coordination between Cairo and Amman. Dr. al-Majali called for a grace period in discussing Arab differences, and allowing time to heal existing rifts. He told the Egyptian journalists that while Jordan recognizes the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, it does not want any agreement by the PLO to have negative consequences on Jordan.
