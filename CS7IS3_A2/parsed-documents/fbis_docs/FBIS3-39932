Offended by numerous press reports about his person and his ability as secretary general, he sharply attacked the media -- "certain magazines that invent primitive slogans, which spy on party friends and colleagues, which write impertinent serialized stories and provide corresponding slogans to the opposition." He told the 900 journalists who attended the party congress: "I hope you contribute to making it possible for the political dispute and the formation of public opinion to take place in a matter of fact and unpolemical way." Then he turned to the political opponent, the Social Democratic Party [SPD]: He accused the party of avoiding the discussion of topical issues with the CDU. The only thing the SPD has offered in the past few months was obstructionism at all levels. The following sentences were balm for the 1,000 CDU delegates: "We are winning support. Approval for our policy is increasing. Numerous people, including those in the new laender, are acknowledging what we have achieved." Then the CDU secretary general presented the new basic program of the CDU: - Society: "We want to continue to strengthen the family. Those who educate children should pay fewer taxes." - Unemployment: "Our reply to 4 million unemployed is: Only a strong economy ensures jobs. We will expand the social market economy and create new future-oriented jobs in this way." - Social benefits: "We will restructure the welfare state. We need new structures to ensure social justice and social balance tomorrow." - Internal security: "We advocate the right of the citizens to security. Concerning `electronic evidence,' we would like to tell the Free Democratic Party of Germany: Nobody in Germany supports a liberalism that facilitates the work of dangerous criminals." - Europe: "We will make Europe strong. Europe must never again be powerless in view of murder, rape, and immense suffering." - Environment: "We will develop a global environmental strategy that will offer the poor an opportunity for development through their own strength. It remains our task to preserve what God has created." The deputy chairman of the CDU Bundestag group, Heiner Geissler, noted a crisis of confidence in the CDU. In a speech, which was received with prolonged applause, he stressed that confidence and competence cannot be restored through "pride in oneself" but only through arguments.
