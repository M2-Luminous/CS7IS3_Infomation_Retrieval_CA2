"Since the International Olympic Committee [IOC] has had the intention of making a new breakthrough in popularizing Olympism, the Olympic Games should be moved out of the circle of developed countries and a Third-World country should be awarded the games in the near future," he said. The Chinese Olympic chief made his statement when he reviewed China's sports in the past year at a press conference following the announcement of a vote for the top ten world athletes of 1993. He said Beijing's close loss of 43-45 votes to Sydney in the Monte Carlo IOC vote to choose the host city for the 2000 Olympics last September was by no means a tragedy for China's sports. On the contrary, Beijing's bid was fruitful and significent, because it has helped to spread the Olympic spirit among the largest population of the world. Answering the question if China would bid again for the 2004 games, he said the Chinese Olympic Committee would take into full consideration both the world and domestic situation before making any decision. "Many foreign friends and IOC members as well as our domestic suporters have written to me, wishing that we bid again for the 2004 games. I'd like to thank them for their warm encouragement, but there is still a lot of time before we make our decision," he said. An IOC weekly bulletin last December said that 14 cities are interested in bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games -- Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg of South Africa, Beijing of China, Dusseldorf and Aachen of Germany, St. Petersburg of Russia, Buenos Aires of Argentina, Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro of Brazil, Stockhom of Sweden, Seville of Spain, Istanbul of Turkey and San Juan of Puerto Rico. He Zhenliang said, "The IOC wishes China could try again for the 2004 games, but it's not time yet to make any formal decision."
