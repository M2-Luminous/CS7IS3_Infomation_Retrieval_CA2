When I speak of a turnaround, I have in mind the agreement signed in Washington, which represents a complete negation of the present policy of Dr. Franjo Tudjman, the policy that allied itself with the Serbian chetniks at the expense of the Muslims. Because that policy enabled not only the chetniks, but also the Russians, to break through to the Adriatic, the United States has finally realized that the basic principles of the post-world war order are being destroyed, that Tudjman's pact with Belgrade was destroying Yalta and that the West was losing its spheres of interest. Therefore, the United States and its allies have joined forces in the defense of their strategic interests to revive the Yalta Agreement -- extending their sphere of interest to the Drina River. How strong the U.S. influence is can be judged by the fact that Granic was `brought' by plane to Washington, where he was presented with the agreement that renders the present Croatian foreign policy, as well as the pact with Milosevic, irrelevant."
