FR941213-0-00076 FR941213-0-00018 After removing the ineligible lines, NHTSA determined that there were 57 below-median lines still eligible for selection under section 33103. Out of the 57 below-median lines left, NHTSA designated the 28 lines with the highest theft rates to be marked pursuant to section 33103. NHTSA proposed to list each of the selected lines in appendix B to part 541. Pursuant to section 33103, NHTSA proposed that parts marking for these below-median lines begin with MY 1996, the first model year that begins at least six months after October 1994. Since section 33103 did not specify marking of replacement parts for below-median lines, NHTSA did not propose to require marking for replacement parts. III. Public Comments on the NPRM In response to the NPRM, NHTSA received comments from 15 commenters: Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates), the American Automobile Manufacturers' Association (AAMA), Automark, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, General Motors (GM), the International Association of Auto Theft Investigators (IAATI), Isuzu, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan, Prospective Technologies, Toyota, and Volkswagen. The commenters discussed the issues raised in the NPRM as follows: 1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' NHTSA received five comments on the definition of ``light duty truck'' (LDT). Four commenters stated that NHTSA's proposed definition of LDT was consistent with the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, and should not be changed. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, on the other hand, stated that since ACTA was intended to expand the number and types of vehicles subject to parts marking, the LDT definition should be ``drawn as narrowly as reasonable under the circumstances.'' Advocates recommended that LDTs be defined as those vehicles: ``built and intended for use exclusively for the transportation of property or special purpose equipment.'' Thus, Advocates appears to urge that LDT be defined to make as many low theft vehicle lines as possible subject to parts marking. In the agency's view, this outcome would be inconsistent with Congress's action in exempting low-theft LDTs from the requirement. Moreover, after reviewing the 1990/91 final theft data for LDT lines, NHTSA found few LDT lines with below-median theft rates. If NHTSA included all below-median LDT lines, only four additional vehicle lines (the Nissan, Toyota, Isuzu, and Ford Ranger pick ups) would be added to the 28 lines that were proposed for inclusion in appendix B. Furthermore, since Advocates' definition would result in vehicles being classified as MPVs for theft purposes that are classified as trucks for vehicle identification number (VIN) purposes under the vehicle safety standards, adopting Advocates' definition of LDT would make it difficult for NHTSA to track and monitor the theft history of these LDT lines through the use of VINs. Since there were no other comments addressing the definition of LDT, this final rule adopts the definition of ``light-duty truck'' proposed in the NPRM. Since only Ford addressed the definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' and it concurred with the definition discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA is adopting the NPRM's definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle.'' 2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' Two commenters suggested specifying additional parts as ``major parts.'' Advocates recommended the addition of airbag modules. IAATI recommended that for LDTs and MPVs, the vehicle frame and radiator support assemblies be added. NHTSA will not adopt these recommendations because it does not determine that at present, airbag modules, frames, and radiator support assemblies are among those parts most frequently repaired or most costly to replace, the criteria NHTSA has used to determine whether a part should be specified a ``major part.'' However, since air bags will be mandatory for all passenger motor vehicles by model year 1999, the determination for airbag modules may be changed. Toyota stated that no additional parts should be specified until there are ``positive results'' from a Justice Department study on the efficacy of parts marking. This study is mandated at 49 U.S.C. 33103(d). NHTSA is not adopting Toyota's recommendation because the Justice Department's findings are not due until December 1999. The ACTA directs NHTSA, well before 1999, to extend coverage of the parts marking requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard to LDTs and MPVs. In order to effectively extend parts marking requirements to LDTs and MPVs, NHTSA must specify parts unique to LDTS or MPVs that must be marked. For these reasons, NHTSA adopts as final the following as major parts for passenger cars, LDTs, and MPVs: engine, transmission, right and left front fenders, hood, right and left front doors, right and left rear doors, sliding or cargo door(s), front and rear bumpers, and the rear door (both doors in case of double doors), decklid, tailgate, or hatchback (whichever is present). In addition, for passenger cars, the right and rear quarter panels are major parts. For MPVs, the right-side and left-side assemblies are major parts. For LDTs, the pickup box, and/or cargo box are major parts. 3. Marking of Motor Vehicle Glazing Parts Although NHTSA proposed specifying vehicle glazing parts as major parts, the final rule does not specify any vehicle glazing parts as major parts. Except for the Advocates and IAATI, all other commenters opposed specifying glazing parts as major parts, and thus making glazing subject to parts marking. Among the reasons cited was that NHTSA does not have authority to require marking of parts that are not among the ``major parts'' specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6) (A) through (K), or are (under (L)) ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed in subparagraphs (A) through (K).''
