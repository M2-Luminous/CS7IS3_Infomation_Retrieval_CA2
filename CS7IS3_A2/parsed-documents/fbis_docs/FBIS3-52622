He said former members of the Parcham (flag) and Khalq (people) Parties and militias supporting them, misused the general amnesty in Afghanistan. "The Islamic government will no longer pardon the rebels who challenge the authority of the government," he warned. Kheyrkhah added that the Afghan Government has never recognized the militias supporting General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. He was critical of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar who leads the Hezb-e Eslami and said he was trying to take advantage of any "illegal leverage" to strike a blow on the Islamic government. According to the Afghan diplomat most of the mojahedin parties are firmly behind the Kabul government in the recent clashes which began four days ago. President Rabbani's forces have mopped up central Kabul of Hekmatyar's and Dostum's forces and are going ahead with their cleaning up operations in the suburb of Kabul, he said. Kheyrkhah said government forces have attacked Dostum's headquarters in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, captured the airport and forced Dostum to flee the city.
