You can now obtain authorization to export freely convertible currency without any particular difficulty right at the currency exchange facility. But prepare yourself not to faint from irritation at the airport if you are suddenly not allowed through the barrier: Your authorization could be forged. "Based on the instances recorded by us, `forged document' criminal cases are being instituted virtually every other day," I was told by Yuriy Afonin, deputy chief of customs at Sheremetyevo-2. "We are seriously concerned by the massive number of fraudulent currency exchange facilities. A completely unsuspecting citizen goes there, buys foreign currency, and the authorization issued to him turns out to be invalid." Hapless passengers are taking out forty, fifty, or sixty thousand dollars each under these false documents -- at Sheremetyevo customs alone these sums apparently run to at least $1 million. On detecting a forgery the customs officers, as instructed, carry out the necessary investigation: They inspect the foreign currency, question the witnesses, including the foreign currency carrier, and pass the case over to the Air Transport Prosecutor's Office. Then the prosecutor's office conducts an investigation and establishes that the authorization is indeed forged; but it is not that the detained person made an honest mistake -- he was completely unaware of the possibility of any violation on his part. Consequently the victim's money is returned to him. The elements of a crime are not present, because the law considers smuggling to be only that which is done with deliberate intent, that is, when a person was aware of everything and desired the consequences. In an attempt to get to the bottom of a forged authorization, the investigative organs make enquiries at the bank whose requisites appear on the document. But as a rule the latter replies that the authorization in question cannot be found in its records and consequently cannot have been issued. The circle is closed and the case ends. But it is not only exchange facilities that provide authorizations. Certain citizens with no great respect for the law are not averse to acquiring the coveted chit from dubious types under the counter. At the beginning of the year the Federal Service for Foreign Currency and Export Control checked out only one of the authorized commercial banks and discovered that tens of millions of dollars in foreign currency were actually being issued there without supporting documents. I was told by the aforementioned service that new checks of both currency exchange facilities and the banks themselves are scheduled for June. From the viewpoint of the Federal Service for Foreign Currency Control, and especially of the customs service, a considerable share of the responsibility for violations of the foreign currency exchange procedure rests with the authorized banks. The law-abiding citizen must have the unhindered opportunity to obtain authorization to export legally acquired foreign currency without the risk of being swindled. But now it is better to do this only in reputable exchange facilities which have a full list of the necessary documents and equipment.
