China's reforms, begun on December 29, will help the country in its bid to rejoin GATT and remove some of the obstacles to the opening up of the country's banking system. In the longer term significant benefits are likely to derive from the improved efficiency of the Chinese economy, the monthly stated. On the other hand, the monthly added, a number of uncertainties and problems may be created by the reforms. Inflationary pressure may be generated by the higher prices of some imports, some domestic enterprises will incur higher costs and domestic exporters will be exposed to greater foreign exchange risks. On the impact of the foreign exchange reforms for Hongkong's economic growth, the monthly said, the reforms are primarily expected to affect cross-border trade and investment flows between Hong Kong and the mainland as well as the territory's monetary sector, provided the new measures are introduced smoothly. Hong Kong manufacturers engaged in outward processing and joint venture activities in China will generally benefit from the unification of the exchange rates, since some of their renminbi outlays that were previously purchased at the official rate can now be obtained at swap rates, the monthly said This will reduce operating costs and mean that prices can be more competitive in international markets. The change will help to support Hongkong-mainland trade related to outward processing, which currently accounts for over 70 percent of Hongkong's imports from China and around half the territory's exports to the mainland. Hong Kong is also expected to benefit from an increase in re-exports of Chinese origin. The effective devaluation of the renminbi due to the exchange rate unification and the fact that state enterprises are no longer obliged to sell part of their foreign exchange earnings to the government at the official rate will help boost the exports of Chinese state enterprises. In general, the monthly said, the reforms are likely to stimulate trade flows between the mainland and Hong Kong, although the impact may not be significant in the short term. The main benefit is expected to come from the long-term efficiency improvements in the Chinese economic system. Hong Kong, as the largest foreign investor in China, contributed 76 billion U.S. dollars, or two-thirds of total contractual foreign investment in China between 1979 and 1992.
