Yi noted, in a meeting with journalists, that holding the third round of high-level talks and suspending "Team Spirit," the annual South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, had been decided on condition that South and North Korea exchange special envoys. Last month, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow unrestricted IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to seven declared facilities and accept Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on exchanging presidential envoys. In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month. "Given the North Korean attitude we saw at the working-level contacts until yesterday, I doubt if North Korea really intends to exchange special envoys with the South. Inter-Korean contacts, if they are only for show (to others), are meaningless," Yi said. Yi avoided making any decisive remarks on whether Team Spirit would be held. "I cannot affirm that because it is a subtle military problem. I think we'll have to watch the progress of the inter-Korean working- level contacts, expecting that Pyongyang's attitude will change at the sixth contact slated for Saturday [12 March]." He said now is not the time to comment on whether international sanctions may be imposed on North Korea if the special envoy exchange is not realized. On reports that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors had found a damaged seal at the North Korean nuclear facilities, Yi said he was briefed on the results of the IAEA inspection. "But that is a problem for the IAEA to cope with, anyway," he said.
