Interviewed earlier today by Walter Medeiros, Jorge Valentim guaranteed that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] does not want the talks to break down and replied to Luanda's charges by saying that the party of the black cockerel wants neither Balkanization nor federalism for Angola. [Begin recording] [Valentim] I have a degree in political science from Brussels University, and I know what Balkanization means. This is not the Europe of 1914, with all those fledgling republics. No one wants to set up republics in the interior of Angola. What fighting there is is the consequence of the massacre of October/November 1992. What we want to achieve here, what we, the UNITA delegates [to the Lusaka talks], are openly advocating here in the negotiations with the government delegation--and there is noticeable political goodwill between the two sides at delegation level--we can say that we advocate a unitarian, but decentralized state. And political and administrative decentralization is not incompatible with, nor antithetical to, the concept of a unitarian state. This is scientific, textbook stuff, and its application is universal. [Medeiros] The agenda item that will be discussed in the next few days is national reconciliation in Angola. As is known, this will entail power-sharing at government level. What ministries would UNITA like to have in a national unity government? [Valentim] Regarding the question of UNITA's participation in the government, I would rather it was not defined in the general terms of power sharing versus no power sharing. UNITA wants to participate very substantially at all levels of the central administration. Now it is up to the two sides to find a modus vivendi for this participation. But to start calling it power sharing could cause a bit of a headache, because power sharing is defined in a certain way in the teaching of political sciences, but the public define it differently. So we would rather see our aims interpreted in a more legitimate way: We are ready to participate in the central government in a significant manner, not along the lines of the [government] theses of 1992. [Medeiros] When you speak of a significant manner, what do you mean in concrete terms? [Valentim] I mean participating by taking on public and important responsibilities such as may inculcate feelings of security and confidence that the process of national reconciliation has indeed begun and that a bright future lies before all Angolans alike. [Medeiros] Does that mean UNITA wants the Defense or Interior Ministries? Does it mean the Economy, Finance, or Petroleum Ministries? Does it mean the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? [Valentim] All I would like to say is that the government knows us well, and we know the government. The party in power, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola], has its history. We have ours, too. And we know each other's histories. [Medeiros] What if the government offers UNITA the Ministries of Education, Health, Social Rehabilitation, and Culture? Will UNITA accept these portfolios? [Valentim] We are....[pauses] We are not in the realm of hypothesis. That is not what the government is saying. We would rather wait. We are in direct communication with the government. Today we had a very fruitful meeting of over two hours, but we did not talk in those terms. We discussed political and administrative decentralization. We discussed security for all Angolans, the leaders and the led alike. We talked about UNITA's participation in the central government. We talked about the status of the president of UNITA. We talked about reciprocal pardons or amnesties. We talked about lots of things. [Medeiros] What status is UNITA claiming for Dr. Savimbi? [Valentim] Well, we have already defined it. It is the status he merits as a historic figure and leader of the largest opposition party. There are certain prerogatives and privileges that we wish accorded to him so that he may in fact fully exercise his role in society for the good of national reconciliation. [Medeiros] Does that include his personal security? And what post would he have? [Valentim] No, no, no. We are still only at the stage of security matters. The question of his post will be a basis for negotiation with the government and we believe that, for the moment, [if we settle for] the status of UNITA president, with full security and respect for his person, I believe we shall have taken a good step forward. [Medeiros] So an announcement that the talks have broken down is out of the question. [Valentim] Well, there has never been a question here of announcing that the talks have broken down. [Medeiros] I do not mean over there [in Lusaka], I mean in Huambo. [Valentim] In Huambo, UNITA criticized a bellicose trend emerging on the government's side. That was UNITA's position. UNITA did not say it wanted a breakdown. All it did was note the discrepancy between the negotiating steps being taken here and the recrudescence of the fighting in the interior. [end recording] UNITA pledges that Angola is one and indivisible. Jorge Valentim was being interviewed by Walter Medeiros.
