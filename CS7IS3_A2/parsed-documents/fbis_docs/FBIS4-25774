Carter arrived here Monday in a prelude to his visit to the DPRK with the possibility of his mediation in the nuclear problem. During the talks over dinner which lasted two and half an hours, President Kim said that the nuclear issue has reached "a critical stage" due to Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Monday, the DPRK announced that it will immediately quit the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and accept no more IAEA inspections of its nuclear program. Kim explained to Carter about the South Korean Government's firm stance toward the nuclear issue, a source said. The source said that Kim asked Carter to convey Seoul's concern and position with regard to the DPRK's IAEA withdrawal. Carter was said to have explained to Kim about the purpose of his visit to the DPRK and promised to relay Seoul's position to Pyongyang correctly. The former U.S. President will pass through the heavily-fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the DPRK on Wednesday morning and is expected to meet DPRK leader Kim Il-song. Carter will return to Seoul on June 18 via Panmunjom and meet again with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam before heading back to Washington. Carter came here at a time when the U.S., South Korea and Japan are seeking United Nations sanctions against the DPRK. Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula would be private. "My hope is to discuss some of the important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he added. The former U.S. president has been active in resolving conflicts in Panama, Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.
