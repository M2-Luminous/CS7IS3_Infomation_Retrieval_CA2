The injection was the biggest in Hong Kong's history. The overnight inter-bank market rate was pushed up to 4.5 percent because of the excessive demand for funds, causing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to pump $2.676 billion into the banking system at about 3.30 pm. The move softened the overnight rate to 3.5 per cent at yesterday's close. The banking sector ended up placing $225 million in surplus funds with the HKMA when the market closed. The stock market fared no better. The Hang Seng Index dived 233.52 points to close at 8,647.48, on the back of world market crashes last Friday. Aggravating the situation was the weak U.S. dollar, which has brokers fearing the U.S. Federal Reserve might raise interest rates as a last-ditch attempt to shore up the currency. It was the third time in less than a week that the Monetary Authority had moved to inject liquidity into the market, after the overnight lending rate repeatedly touched the 4.5 per cent offer rate of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) -- the discount window facility run by the authority. The LAF offer rate was kept at the same level as the Fed's discount rate so as to maintain the stability of the territory's pegged exchange rate system. The HKMA injected $1.36 billion into the market last Friday and $1.57 billion last Wednesday. Although the exchange rate remained stable, hovering at about $7.728-$7.729 to the US dollar, the injections are considered preemptive strikes to prevent the rising interbank market rates from affecting the stability of the peg. "If the interbank market rates are higher than in the U.S., then money will start coming in," said HKMA chief executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong. The Hong Kong dollar bond market mirrored the fall in the U.S., with the two-year government bond price dropping 37 basis points and the three-year bond shedding 44 basis points. One dealer said: "The yield spread between the three-year Hong Kong dollar bond and three-year U.S. dollar bond, which usually ranges between 30 and 50 basis points, has widened to a historical level of 75 basis points." He attributed bearish sentiment in the bond market to the upward pressure on U.S. interest rates. "One famous economist in the US even predicted that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond would climb to 10 percent by the end of the year," he said. However, Mr Yam said the tight interbank market condition was only temporary, caused by expectations on U.S. interest rates and banks' need to shore up funds in preparation for mid-year accounting. "Banks that expect U.S. interest rates to go up will borrow more in advance and sit on it," he said.
