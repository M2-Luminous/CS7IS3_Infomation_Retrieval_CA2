Shi Guangsheng, Chinese vice minister of foreign trade and economic relations, and Ambassador Jennifer Hillman, U.S. Trade Representative Office chief negotiator for textile talks, signed a memorandum of understanding on a bilateral textile trade agreement on behalf of their respective governments. Shi Guangsheng told reporters at the conclusion of the negotiations that [corrected version reads: ...According to a briefing.... (rewording)], both China and the United States made concessions during the latest round of negotiations. The U.S. side has agreed not to insist on reductions of between 25 and 35 percent in import quotas of Chinese textiles; it has also withdrawn articles of arbitrary deduction regarding illegal transshipment of textiles. The Chinese side also made substantial concessions during the talks. China has agreed to accept a quota reduction of no more than three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally transshipped by Chinese traders. Furthermore, China also agreed to major adjustments of some categories of the textile quota proposed by the U.S. side. The third Chinese-U.S. textile agreement expired on 31 December 1993. To negotiate and sign the fourth agreement, China and the United States conducted three rounds of talks without success from September to December last year. Shi Guangsheng said [corrected version reads: ...It is understood.... (rewording)] that during the fourth round of talks, both sides took into consideration the overall interests of bilateral trade and economic ties, and adhered to the principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding, and accommodation, thereby reaching agreement on textile arrangements -- an issue of great concern for both sides. The signing of the new agreement will be conducive to the healthy development of textile trade as well as other economic and trade ties between the two countries. Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, witnessed the signing ceremony and met with the U.S. delegation led by Ambassador Hillman. She said: China attaches great importance to developing cooperation with the United States in economic, trade, and other areas. The United States has capital, technology, and equipment, which are conducive to China's modernization drive, while China has a huge market and abundant source of labor. The two countries are economically complementary. Wu Yi said: Various problems, difficulties, and contradictions may arise in the course of cooperation between the two sides. However, it has been proved by years of practice that the best way to address these problems is through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. Any attempt to exert pressure by one side on the other will be futile and can only lead to a trade war, which we do not want to see happen. Wu Yi said: China and the United States share an identical view and common interests in cracking down on illegal transshipment of textiles. It is hoped that both sides will further cooperate and take measures to ensure a smooth implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the bilateral textile agreement. Hillman said the Sino-U.S. negotiations were productive, cooperative, and mutually satisfactory. She added that China is the largest exporter of textiles to the United States, and the just concluded agreement is "extremely important" for developing economic and trade relations between the two countries.
