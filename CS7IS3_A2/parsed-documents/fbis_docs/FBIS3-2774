Christopher and his party were greeted by Qian Qichen on their arrival -- by car from the China World Hotel, where they are staying -- at the Diaoyutai State Guest House's Fang Fei Garden at exactly 1000 [0200 GMT]. The two foreign ministers shook hands warmly and exchanged regards. In warmly welcoming Christopher's visit to Beijing, Qian Qichen said, "When we met in Paris more than a month ago, I reiterated my invitation to you to visit China." He pointed out: Our talks in Paris went very well. Qian Qichen said that he was looking forward to exchanging views with him on Sino-U.S. relations and other issues. In thanking Qian Qichen for his welcome, Christopher said he has found that Beijing has changed a lot in the past decade. Christopher arrived in Beijing yesterday evening together with his 110-odd delegation, which includes his wife, Mary Christopher; Madame Davis, assistant secretary of state for international security affairs [title as received]; and Frank Wisner, under secretary of defense [for policy]. Beijing is the last leg of Christopher's 10-day, three-nation Asia-Pacific tour. This is a relatively high-level Sino-U.S. contact since the leaders of the two countries met in Seattle last November and is the second meeting between Qian Qichen and Christopher since they met in Paris on 24 January. Christopher, who is 69 and the senior U.S. diplomat, was assistant secretary of state for the Carter administration. He assumed the post of secretary of state for the Clinton administration in January 1993. He is prudent and is not fond of contacts with the media. His speciality is "shadowboxing using words."
