The memorandum asked about the significance of that statement which ran contrary to a number of basic principles in the peace negotiations, in particular denoting a clear change in the U.S. line regarding the basis on which the Madrid peace conference was held, and which also ran contrary to the clear provisions of the UN Security Council resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338 which stipulate that Israel should fully withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 including Jerusalem. Informed Arab and Palestinian sources in Cairo have stated that Washington's position on occupied Jerusalem requires a reconsideration of the Arab positions on the peace negotiations with a need for clear guarantees in this connection. The sources said that the current intensive consultations with the PLO are not expected to yield clear results regarding resumption of the negotiations with Israel unless the issue of Jerusalem is resolved and guarantees are given that the issue of Jerusalem will still be on the agenda of the negotiations. The sources added that, in these consultations, the PLO declared its rejection of any change in the status of Jerusalem, emphasizing that the issue should be included in the provisions of the new [draft] agreement before the resumption of negotiations with Israel.
