Section 1068.61 is amended by revising the section heading, introductory text, and paragraphs (a) and (e), to read as follows: §1068.61 Producer price differential. For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight of milk as follows: (a) Combine into one total for all handlers: (1) The estimated values computed pursuant to §1068.60 (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) through (j) for all handlers; (2) Add the estimated values computed pursuant to §1068.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective prices; and (3) Subtract the estimated value obtained by multiplying the difference between the Class III price and the Class III-A price times the pounds of product determined pursuant to §1068.43(f); * * * * * (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The result shall be the ``producer price differential'' for milk received from producers. 7. Section 1068.62 is revised to read as follows: §1068.62 Announcement of producer prices. On or before the 11th day after the end of each month, the market administrator shall announce the following prices and information: (a) The producer price differential; (b) The protein price; (c) The other solids price; (d) The butterfat price; (e) The average protein and other solids content of producer milk; and
