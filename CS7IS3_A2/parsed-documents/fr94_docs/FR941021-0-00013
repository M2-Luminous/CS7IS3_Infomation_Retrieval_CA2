(ii) The typical test sample shall consist of the exterior housing components such as covers, backplates, good housekeeping panels, cap assembly, anchor posts, decals, etc. Interior components must include the bonding and grounding hardware for cables and service wires and the dielectric shield. The housing may include terminal blocks or cross-connect modules, cable splices, or the typical outside plant equipment the housing is designed to contain and protect. (3) Environmental requirement for housings_ (i) Thermal shock. The test housing shall be placed in a test chamber and exposed to the temperature cycle of Figure 2 for five complete cycles. The step function nature of the temperature changes may be achieved by insertion and removal of the test housing from the chamber. The soak time at each temperature shall be four hours. The housing shall be removed from the test chamber at the conclusion of the five-cycle period. After the test housing temperature has stabilized to room temperature, the housing must be inspected for deterioration of materials and satisfactory operation of mechanical functions.
