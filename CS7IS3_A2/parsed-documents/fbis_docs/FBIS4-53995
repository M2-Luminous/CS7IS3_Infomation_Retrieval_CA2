Timor Issue in Jakarta BK2305141394 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0100 GMT 23 May 94 BK2305141394 Melbourne Radio Australia English BFN [Text] The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, has denied dodging human rights issues in talks with Indonesia's President Suharto. He says he clearly voiced his concerns about the situation in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor during a visit to Jakarta last week. New Zealand's opposition Labor Party has condemned conciliatory remarks made by Mr. Bolger after his meeting with Mr. Suharto, branding him an apologist for Indonesia. But Mr. Bolger said he discussed the situation in East Timor at length with the Indonesian leader. He said he conveyed the substance of a petition signed by 51 of New Zealand's 99 members of parliament protesting against human rights abuses in the territory. Mr. Bolger said the suggestion that the warmth of his welcome in Indonesia stopped him from talking about the issue is simply wrong.
