At the beginning of the open part of the session, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic read the following statement: [Begin Silajdzic recording] The aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina has been underway for more than two years already and has culminated in a fresh invasion by the aggressor's forces from Serbia and Montenegro. With the knowledge of the entire world, the aggressor is bringing new troops, tanks, and artillery from Titovo Uzice, Kraljevo in Serbia, and Podgorica in Montenegro. The residents of Gorazde, surrounded and cut off, have been destroyed with everything that the aggressor has at his disposal for two years, including irritant agents that are being used in concentrations prohibited by the Geneva convention. Every square meter is shelled and the hospital is almost destroyed. Gorazde is defending itself the way it can and is trying to stop the aggressor's forces from entering the town, and naturally, to prevent a massacre [words indistinct]. We would like to remind that this is a UN Protected Area. The UN (?leaders) failed to undertake the measures to which they are entitled by the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. We have learned that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Woerner in connection with these events. However, for the time being there is still no action. The aggressor is encouraged by such a position of the United Nations. The aggressor's soldiers today used force to seize the arms that were in Lukavica guarded by the members of the French Battalion on the basis of a NATO ultimatum of 9 February 1994. This action constitutes a flagrant violation of the NATO ultimatum and paves the way for a new aggression on Sarajevo and other towns throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Parallel to this, the aggressor's forces have been holding approximately 100 UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] soldiers hostage. This is not merely a question of United Nations and NATO credibility, but also a question of peace or war in this [word indistinct]. The international community is responsible for this [word indistinct] because it has facilitated the aggression and made it easy by keeping in power the arms embargo that is only effecting the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is a victim of the aggression. We informed NATO Secretary General Woerner about the development of the situation and demanded urgent action in accordance with the NATO ultimatum. [end recording] The government's session at the beginning of which Prime Minister Silajdzic read the statement that you have just heard, was continued without the presence of reporters.
