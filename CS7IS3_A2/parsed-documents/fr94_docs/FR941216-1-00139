FR941216-1-00139 FR941216-1-00012 (d) Agitation. Agitation nitrators, washers, and other machines which, because of the hazard of the process and the possibility of the process material decomposing, are equipped with mechanical agitators, shall have at least two means of agitation, each operating from an independent power source to maintain agitation if one fails. (e) Machining of explosives. (1) High explosives, cased or uncased, that may be machined without special personnel protection and without coolant, if no metal-to-metal contact is involved, include: Amatol, Octol, TNT, composition B, explosive D, and RDX/TNT compositions containing 60 percent or less RDX. (2) High explosives, cased or uncased, that may be machined without special personnel protection provided a coolant is directed on the tool and explosives at their point of contact and no metal-to-metal contact is involved, include: baratols, pentolite (50&hyph;50 and 10&hyph;90), tetrytol, and cyclotols (composition B less than 60&hyph;40; that is, 70&hyph;30). (3) When essential, other high explosives may be machined by remote control, with the operator protected by a suitable operational shield; however, initiating explosives should not be machined if desired shapes or sizes can be obtained by other means, such as forming. (4) When an unprotected operator is involved in drilling, only a single drill, with a diameter greater than 1/4 inch, shall be used. (5) Machining of cased explosives is permitted in an operation requiring removal of metal before or after tool contact with the explosives filler, provided that operators are protected by operational shields and perform it by remote control. (6) Where wet machining is to be performed, automatic interlocking devices shall prevent machining from starting until coolant is flowing. These controls shall also be capable of stopping the machining if the coolant flow is interrupted. When coolant flow must stop for adjustment of machining tools, positive means shall be devised to ensure that flow of coolant is restored and all automatic control devices are operating before machining can resume. (7) The lineal and rotational speeds of tools used for the machining of explosives shall be maintained at the minimum necessary to perform the operation safely and efficiently. These shall not exceed 210 linear feet per minute nor 525 revolutions per minute. The rate of feed should likewise be the lowest consistent with safety and efficiency, based on the explosive materials being machined. (8) Pneumatically or hydraulically driven machine tools are preferred for all machining operations on high explosives. Control mechanisms for hydraulic and pneumatic equipment shall prevent unauthorized personnel from tampering with speeds. (9) In all machining operations on cased or uncased high explosives, procedures during tool adjustments shall prevent contact between moving parts of the machining equipment and metallic parts of the case or holding fixtures. (10) Machining tools shall be compatible with the explosives being processed. Dull or damaged tools shall not be used for machining high explosives. (11) The explosives products resulting from machining operations shall be removed by an exhaust system meeting NEC requirements, or by immersion in a stream of water flowing away from the operation. Refer to NFPA Standard No. 70. (12) Machining of explosives of questionable quality during an ammunition and explosives demilitarization process shall be accomplished by remote control, with operators protected by operational shields. (f) Assembly and crimping of complete rounds. Each assembly and crimping operation shall be separated from other operations by structures or shielding sufficient to contain any fragments produced. (g) Pressing explosives. (1) Each pelleting operation involving black powder, tetryl, TNT, or other explosives of similar sensitivity; and each operation involving the pressing or reconsolidating of explosives, shall be conducted in a separate room or cubicle having walls of sufficient strength to withstand an explosion of all explosives present. (2) Pressing or reconsolidating explosives in small caliber rounds, tracer bodies, tetryl lead-ins, detonators, and similar items shall be performed on machines having consolidating stations designed to preclude propagation between stations and provide adequate operator protection. Operators shall be behind tested protective barriers during such operations. (3) Punches and dies shall be in matched sets that have passed inspection. All punches and dies used in explosives pressing operations shall undergo a rigid test, such as a magnaflux or X-ray, before use and regularly thereafter. In a pelleting press, punches and dies shall be replaced with matched sets checked and calibrated by a control laboratory. (h) Protection of primers. Equipment, transportation, and operations shall be designed to protect loose primers or primers in components from accidental impact or pressure. When feasible, a protecting cap shall cover the primer. (i) Explosives washout and flashing facilities. When washout operations are placed in operating buildings or other locations, they shall be separated from other operations by operational shields or proper distances. Ammunition items subjected to washout operations shall be subsequently inspected to ensure against residual explosives contamination. When contamination is confirmed, decontamination shall precede disposal. Decontamination of ammunition items by flashing (exposure to flame) shall be performed at the explosives destruction (burning) area or in approved incinerators. (j) Heat sealing equipment. Electric heat sealing machines should be separated from other operations. Temperature limits for heat sealing equipment shall be established, with a safety factor below the ignition temperature of explosives, propellants, or pyrotechnics involved.
