[Vallarino] I think the best guarantee is what has been done and what is written. It has been written in very clear and specific words. Each recommended step is defined and explained. [Molinar] Let us talk about specifics so that we can better inform the people. Will a ministry or an autonomous institution be responsible for implementing the plan? [Vallarino] The plan is to be implemented in three stages. A transition commission will handle the first stage. We are recommending to the president that this commission be appointed by decree and that it be formed by the most capable Panamanians he can find, despite the individual's persuasion. We are recommending the members be professionals from various fields so that all the areas, engineering, legal, environment, will be overseen. [Molinar] Does this plan ensure the stability of Panama Canal workers? [Vallarino] I believe this is one of the most important things of which we must assure the Panamanian people. Those who work for the canal will continue to enjoy the same working conditions and benefits and will abide by the same rules and regulations they follow today. [Molinar] Let us talk about rules and regulations. Will they be allowed to stop canal operations at any time? [Vallarino] One of the nicest things that happened while we were discussing that aspect was that union representatives went to the Legislative Assembly and told us they agree canal operations should never stop; therefore, we are willing to give them the right to strike, and we can also tell the world we know Panama Canal operations will never be stopped due to a strike. [Molinar] Who will handle canal revenues and where will this money go? [Vallarino] That is also properly explained. Even though canal administration authorities will have all the autonomy they need, they are also asked to have direct ties with the government and the legislative branch, via special representatives. Financially, they will be totally independent. [Molinar] Where will the profits go? [Vallarino] These will first be set aside for improvements. What is left over will go to the treasury. We are looking for a way for the canal to produce, for the nation, at least the same economic benefits we receive today. [Molinar] Will it be possible to implement this plan despite the political ups and downs? Can we overcome our political differences and not appoint another commission, and so forth? [Vallarino] If we all believe in democracy, the way I believe in democracy, the people's voice will give the orders. If the people remain united in defense of democracy and remain united in the message we received -- that they do not want politics to meddle in canal administration -- then all the presidents will have to respect those principles.
