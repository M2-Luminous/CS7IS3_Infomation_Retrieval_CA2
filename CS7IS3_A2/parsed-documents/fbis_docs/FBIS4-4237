According to official statistics, at least 19 people were killed in 17 industrial accidents in the first quarter of this year in Beijing. The death toll was, however, significantly lower than the 27 recorded during the corresponding period last year. Officials said many of this year's victims were inexperienced workers under the age of 35. Last year, Shanghai witnessed a 50 percent surge in industrial casualties, despite repeated cautions from the Government. Labour officials said industrial accidents were expected to soar as a result of the increase in the number of migrant workers from rural areas arriving in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Many of these migrants were farmers who had no experience in carrying out industrial work. The lack of safety measures at building sites was a major cause of concern. In Shanghai, three workers were buried alive while working on an underground drainage project. Government officials said that most migrant workers were not aware of their legal rights with regard to a safe work environment. Many employers failed to comply with safety requirements laid down by the Government. The officials said although the Beijing Municipal Government had issued regulations four years ago requiring enterprises to provide a seven-day course on industrial safety for new workers, this was seldom carried out. A study in Shanghai found that only two out of 17 township enterprises surveyed had set aside special funds -- as the law requires for improving safety measures. Some enterprises preferred investing in office modernisation to improving safety.
