A. Sokolov, Yu. V. Chuguy; UDC 535.42:535.31:53.082.5] [Abstract] Results of studies of the features of forming the outlines of three-dimensional edges of images are offered here for a general case, when the amplitude of the light reflection coefficient from its internal surface has a value between 0 and 1. This image is referred to as ``gray'' or (opaque). The intensity profile of the image front edge outline of the gray extended side at different reflection coefficients r(0;0.3;07 and 1.0) is shown in graphs for different N: N=2; N=1; N=05; N=)1, where N is the number of the Fresnel zone. Features of forming the outline of the rear edge of the extended side were also examined, demonstrating that in case of insignificant volumetric effects, the image resembles the contour of a plane edge. However, the coordinates of the fundamental minimum do not coincide with the geometric position of the object's boundary. With significant volumetric effects, the reflecting properties of the internal edge have a substantial influence on the structure of the outlined image.
