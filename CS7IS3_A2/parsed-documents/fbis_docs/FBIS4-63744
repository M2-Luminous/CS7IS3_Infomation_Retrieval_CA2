Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has probably decided to answer in one go the charges which have been repeatedly leveled against it throughout the 18 months of its existence. The package of prepared edicts holds out the promise of a great revival in economic life, which some people have been patiently awaiting while others have been hitherto hoping to avoid. Some of the drafts are relatively uncontroversial in nature, developing already known topics: a package of measures introducing taxes into the budget, measures to normalize settlements and tighten up payment discipline, and certain questions of tax policy. But the package also contains documents which are bound to produce certain upheavals. These include draft edicts "On the Sale of Debtor-Enterprises," "On the Reform of State Enterprises," and "On the Abolition of the Issuing of Quotas and Licenses for Supplies of Goods and Services for Export. One of the edicts will enable a sigh of relief to be breathed by those frightened by the Labor Ministry's promises to limit wages in drastic fashion. The Labor Ministry was indulging in wishful thinking when it issued via news agencies last week its own version of measures to limit incomes. It in no way follows from the draft edict "On the Regulation of Resources Used for Consumption" that a wage in excess of 240,000 rubles [R] per month will be liable to draconian taxation, as the Labor Ministry proposes. And the idea that earnings of R400,000-700,000 per month are "out of this world" will remain the labor minister's personal opinion. There was virtually only one restriction in the draft edict on this topic as it existed at the end of Sunday: An increase in the wages fund which exceeds the level of the growth in prices by more than 70 percent will be liable to a fine. The edict "On Certain Questions of Taxation Policy" will prove even more agreeable to many people. Under this edict the government is required to make proposals on improving the tax system by 15 September. The areas of improvement are as follows: reducing the total number of taxes and reducing the level of profit tax and value-added tax [VAT] by 10-20 percent. Foreign investors -- provided, of course, they are bona fide investors -- can obtain substantial concessions. Joint ventures registered since 1 January this year which have a foreign capital stake of at least 30 percent and investments of at least $10 million are exempt from all payment of profit tax into the federal budget for three years. During the fourth year of their existence they will pay one-quarter of the tax due, and in their fifth year one-half. But if a joint venture is wound up before it has been in existence six years it will have to repay all the concessions received to the federal budget. By all accounts, the government intends to follow the route of drastically tightening up control over tax receipts rather than increasing tax rates. The draft of the relevant edict envisages the mandatory registration of all kinds of accounts (hard currency, deposit, loan accounts, and so forth) with the tax bodies. If, however, a bank does open an account for an enterprise without a certificate from the tax inspectorate, the bank chief will be fined 100 times the minimum wage. If an enterprise goes three months without paying taxes a decision may be made to deem it insolvent. And another pretty tough measure, affecting individuals this time too, is that banks must inform the tax bodies of all transactions exceeding $10,000. But it is the edicts on the reform of state enterprises and the sale of enterprises in debt which could have the most serious consequences. The idea of the reform is to eliminate in practice such a socialist vestige as the "right of full economic authority." This right has allowed the directors of state enterprises to be in complete charge of state property while being in no way accountable. The edict on the sale of debtor-enterprises confirms the statute on this procedure. The Federal Administration for Insolvency Affairs, the debtor-enterprise itself or its creditors, the prosecutor's office or the State Committee for the Management of State Property can act as the initiator of this procedure. Liability for bogus bankruptcy is laid down. Sales are effected purely on the basis of commercial bids without restriction on the makeup of the parties involved (including individuals and foreign buyers). The package of documents also contains a statute on the criteria governing the provision of state financial assistance, which is constantly being demanded from the exchequer by many directors. The criteria and the terms for the provision of assistance are plain and clear. If events develop in a certain way, the question of declaring an enterprise bankrupt may be raised. The issue of these edicts has so agitated the public that Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the president's group of experts, held a press conference on Monday, 23 May. He explained the reason for President Yeltsin's slip of the tongue when he described the economy as being "on the verge of collapse." Livshits observed that the economy is not suffering from any catastrophe -- there is a problem of falling output. He also spoke about the package of edicts discussed in our article. All the edicts come into force from the moment they are signed and will operate until the Duma passes the relevant laws.
