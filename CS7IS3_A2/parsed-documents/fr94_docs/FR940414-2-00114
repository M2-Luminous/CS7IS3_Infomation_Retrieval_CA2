FR940414-2-00114 FR940414-2-00076 33. Pending investment of capital contributions from the Partners and any distribution of proceeds to the Partners, the Partnership's funds may be invested in short-term money market or other comparable investments, including money market funds that may be advised by a member of the Morgan Stanley Group. 34. The term of the Partnership will expire on the tenth anniversary of the date on which capital contributions are first made to the Partnership. The term may be extended by the General Partner, with the consent of Limited Partners representing specified percentages (depending upon the extension being sought) of the aggregate capital commitments. The Partnership may be dissolved prior to the expiration of the term with the approval of Partners representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate capital commitments. In addition, the Partnership may be dissolved upon the occurrence of certain events. 35. A Limited Partner may not withdraw from the Partnership prior to the dissolution of the Partnership, except under certain limited circumstances. The General Partner may require a Limited Partner to withdraw (a) if the Limited Partner is a Defaulting Partner (as defined below); (b) if the Limited Partner violates the restrictions on transfer described below; or (c) if the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion that continued membership of the Limited Partner in the Partnership would subject the Partnership to material onerous legal or other regulatory requirements that cannot reasonably be avoided. A Limited Partner may not withdraw in any event until the first anniversary of such Limited Partner's admission to the Partnership. 36. If any Limited Partner fails to make any required capital contribution when due or called by the General Partner (a ``Defaulting Partner''), the General Partner may elect in its discretion any one or more of the following alternatives: (a) Cause the Partnership to bring an action against the Defaulting Partner to collect the due and unpaid payment plus interest; (b) Cause the Defaulting Partner to forfeit up to 50% of the value of such Defaulting Partner's capital account (as valued at the date the capital contribution was originally due), which forfeited portion will be allocated among the other Partners in proportion to their respective capital contributions, provided that the General Partner will not elect this alternative if the Defaulting Partner is suffering from, or will suffer, severe hardship; (c) Determine that the Defaulting Partner will not be permitted to make additional capital contributions; and/or (d) Reduce the Defaulting Partner's share of the Partnership's future profits by up to 50% of the amount that such Defaulting Partner would otherwise have been entitled to receive had it not defaulted. These rights and remedies are cumulative, and the General Partner may pursue any other remedies available to it or the Partnership to enforce the obligation of the Defaulting Partner. The Defaulting Partner is liable for all costs of the Partnership, including attorney's fees, incurred with respect to the collection of any of the capital contributions and the enforcement of any of the rights of the Partnership.
