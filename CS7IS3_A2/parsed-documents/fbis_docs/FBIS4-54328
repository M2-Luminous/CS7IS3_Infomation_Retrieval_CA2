The government decided this at a meeting of the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Unification Board [NUB] Yi Hong- ku held on 26 May. Kim Hyong-ki, an NUB spokesman, said, "The participants in the meeting agreed that if North Korea refuses to clear away the suspicion of its nuclear development and continues to enforce the nuclear program, our efforts to abide by the denuclearization declaration will meet with grave challenge." The meeting noted that North Korea is persistently pushing ahead with its scheme to reach a package solution to its nuclear issue linking it with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States and the signing of a peace agreement. The meeting made it clear that the issue of replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be discussed between the North and the South along with the issue of political and military confidence- building between the North and the South. The government also reconfirmed its policy that it will continue to link the nuclear issue and the economic cooperation for the time being.
