FR940511-1-00092 FR940511-1-00013 IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis and Compliance Costs A. Regulatory Impact Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 Executive Order No. 12866 requires that a regulatory agency determine whether a new regulation will have ``significant regulatory action'' and, if so, that a cost-benefit analysis be conducted. This analysis is a quantification of the potential benefits, costs, and economic impacts of a rule. A significant regulatory action is defined as a regulation that has an annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more that adversely affects in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or Tribal governments or communities; creates a serious inconsistency with actions taken or planned by another agency; materially alters the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Agency estimated the costs of today's proposed rule to determine if it is a significant regulation as defined by Executive Order 12866. Today's proposed rule is estimated to have an annualized incremental cost of less than $100,000. Based on this compliance cost estimate, today's proposed rule is not considered to be a significant regulatory action. This section of the preamble discusses the results of the analyses of the proposed rule. Approach To estimate the costs, economic impacts, and benefits of today's proposed rule, the Agency compared post-regulatory costs, benefits, and economic impacts with those resulting under baseline conditions. Benefits are addressed in the risk assessment section of this preamble. The baseline management practices for this waste is disposal in a Subtitle D landfill. Results Due to the extremely small universe of facilities potentially affected by this rule, the number of facilities actually affected is insignificant. The requirements promulgated by this proposed rule are estimated to cost industry less than $100,000 per year assuming disposal in a Subtitle C landfill. The economic impact analysis estimates that none of the affected facilities would be significantly affected by the proposed rule. Compliance with this proposed rule is estimated to increase operating expenses at affected facilities by significantly less than one percent. None of the affected facilities is expected to close as a result of the rule. B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , whenever an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes the effect of the rule on small entities ( i.e. , small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however, if the rule is estimated not to have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percent of the population of small entities is likely to experience financial distress based on the costs of the rule, then the Agency considers that the rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and must perform an RFA. EPA evaluated the economic effect of the proposed rule, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and determined that no facilities would be significantly affected. The Administrator certifies that part 268 and part 148 will not have significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities. As a result of this finding, the Agency has not prepared a formal RFA. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain any new information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . The information collection requirements in this proposal were promulgated in previous land disposal restriction rulemakings and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Since there are no new information collection requirements being proposed today, an Information Collection Request has not been prepared. However, facilities will have to comply with existing Subtitle C recordkeeping and reporting requirements for newly listed wastestreams if today's proposals are finalized.
