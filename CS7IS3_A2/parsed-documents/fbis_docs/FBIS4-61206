NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments: "This agreement is the first and most significant step along the path of implementation of the Washington declaration of principles". The newspaper quotes Yasir 'Arafat as saying this event signifies peace not only for Israel and not only for the entire Arab world, but for mankind as a whole. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed that "the document signed in Cairo yesterday marks the creation of the first-ever Palestinian autonomy and opens a new chapter in the settlement of the Arab-Israeli chapter. Along with this, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are vieweing their autonomy with apprehension. Much will depend on the ability of the new authorities to improve the desperate situation of the local inhabitants, the overwhelming majority of whom live in abject poverty". Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who is in Cairo in connection with the signing of the agreement on the Palestinian autonomy, told the newspaper TRUD that "the agreement on Gaza and Jericho is the first major step towards durable peace in the region, it marks a historic reconciliation between Israel and its Palestinian neighbours, I hope it will stimulate progress along other lines of the Middle East settlement. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement must be followed by its practical implementation. This will be a stage no less important than the negotiations". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA said in its comment on the signing: "Both Rabin and 'Arafat are in a hurry to sign peace today, not tomorrow. If they failed to do so, the right-wingers would certainly come to power at the next elections in Israel, and their understanding of the word "peace" is quite different. 'Arafat's political career is also at stake -- should his policy fail, the irreplaceable PLO leader would be replaced by his irreconcilable opponents". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA noted in this respect that "literally a few hours before the signing, Tel Aviv raised, without any preliminary notice, 25 new disputable questions. But nonetheless 'Arafat and Rabin, unshakable in their desire for peace, sealed the historic document with the signatures by their own hands". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yabloko [Yavlinskiy Bloc] leader Grigory Yavlinskiy. Asked why his faction was against the political amnesty, which set President Yeltsin's arch-rivals free, Yavlinskiy said: "We voted against because we thought it most important to set up a commission for the investigation for the tragic events of October 3 and 4. It would have inevitably made clear that both sides were to blame for the bloodshed. But the right-wingers and left-wingers agreed on a compromise which set them free from moral condemnation and juridical liability. I am convinced that the question remains. Life itself will put it on our agenda". PRAVDA also takes up the subject placing a statement by General Valentin Varennikov on its front page who objects against the application of the political amnesty to himself. Varennikov writes "I have no objections to the State Duma decision on amnesty. But I repeat yet again that throughout all stages of the preliminary investigation and during the court trial I never acknowledged and do not acknowledge now the accusations against myself. I declared and declare myself again not guilty." Valentin Varennikov said he had appealed to the military collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to institute criminal proceedings against the people guilty of the break-up of the Soviet Union. The text of his letter of appeal is also printed in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. The same newspaper publishes reports about marches and rallies on May first. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview between the newspaper's editor in chief and the chief of the presidential apparatus, Federal Minister Vladimir Kvasov, who comments on lobbying government decisions. "This country has yet to create the institute of lobbyism. And I am sure that it will be created. Such institutes exist in all market economies". Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin reports in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI about the results of the Russian delegation's participation in the recent session of the leading bodies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the conference of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven countries. Aleksandr Shokhin expressed satisfaction with the results of encounters in Washington, he noted among other things that "an agreement on a 70 million dollar loan to Russia was signed with the World Bank to develop the employment and social insurance services".
