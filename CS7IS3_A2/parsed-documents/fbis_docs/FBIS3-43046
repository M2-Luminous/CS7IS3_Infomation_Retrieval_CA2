Teplova, Scientific Production Association of Polymer Building Materials; UDC 678.58.691.16.621.791.94] [Abstract] The widening gap between the physical and engineering base of the construction industry and today's standards, the low mechanization level of roofing operations, and the increasing popularity of soft bitumen-based materials prompted the National Scientific Research Institute of Polymer Building Materials together with the Tekhnopom National Scientific and Engineering Center to examine the effectiveness of shaped cutting of rolled bitumen-impregnated roofing materials using a specialized laser system. To this end, CW, pulse, and periodic pulse CO[.sup]2[/], garnet, ruby, and Nd-glass lasers are tested. The experiment demonstrates that CO[.sup]2[/] CW lasers with a 1-6 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/] air injection to the cutting zone are optimum for materials moving at a high velocity relative to the beam. A comparison of laser, mechanical, and combined laser-mechanical cutting methods and process parameters makes it possible to speculate that a 36.9 m/min cutting speed can be obtained using a 5 kW laser whose radiation is split into two beams. The advantages of a computer-aided laser cutting system include the simplicity and speed of switching from one standard size of material to another. The findings confirm the outlook for using laser radiation for shaped cutting of soft bitumen-impregnated roofing materials and the method's ability to implement complex designer concepts and original shapes for various building roof shapes. The anticipated economic impact from implementing the computer-aided laser complex using the combined laser-mechanical method with a double-split beam and three knives is up to 10 million rubles in 1993 prices.
