Hosokawa, speaking at a session of the House of Representatives budget committee, vowed to do his utmost to prevent relations between Japan and the U.S. from worsening. The prime minister was replying to Michio Watanabe of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who urged the prime minister to send an emissary to Washington in an effort to prevent Japan from being internationally "isolated." Hosokawa and all his 20 cabinet ministers were present as the lower house's budget committee started deliberations on a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, which calls for a spending increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget. This is designed to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25 trillion yen, and an increase in the overall general account budget for the current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion yen. Besides the former foreign minister, nine legislators from both ruling and opposition parties posed questions. While pledging efforts to rectify Japan's huge trade imbalance with the U.S., the prime minister urged Washington to make "a conscientious decision and response" to Japan. Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met last week in Washington, but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus of over 50 billion dollars. The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would lead to managed trade. A few days after the collapse of the framework talks, the U.S. on Tuesday unveiled steps to impose sanctions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. At the budget committee session, Hosokawa reaffirmed that Tokyo will file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if the U.S. implements sanctions, but he also said Japan will deal with the situation "with a cool head." Hosokawa said that Japan has to make its own efforts on both macroeconomic and microeconomic problems because it plays a large role in leading the world economy. "Japan must tackle what it can voluntarily...such as making procedures transparent for insurance and government procurement, promoting cooperation between the two countries' auto industries, deregulating the economy, accelerating imports and investments, and securing competition," Hosokawa said. International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai told the same session that Japan will draw up a program by the end of February at the earliest to orient Japan's economic structure more towards domestic demand. Hosokawa rejected U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led the trade negotiations, saying that officials of each ministry made considerable effort to protect national interests. He said neither politicians nor bureaucrats can accept the U.S. demand for numerical targets. "We cannot accept a demand that runs counter to economic deregulation," he stated. Hosokawa also said Japan will act with responsibility if the United Nations Security Council imposes economic sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program. Both Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said they have good relations in spite of reports that the premier wants to remove Takemura from his post.
