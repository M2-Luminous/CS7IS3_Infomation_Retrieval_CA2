This is the highest critical temperature (temperature at which superconductive state is shown) achieved for a substance that does not use elements with high toxicity such as mercury or thallium. The synthesized substance is composed of silver, barium, calcium, copper and oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:3:4:10. Superconducting state was confirmed by full diamagnetism and full conductivity. In addition to high critical temperature, preliminary test results indicate that critical current density, which shows size of current flow, will be high, 1 million amperes per square centimeter. Director Hideo Ihara of the superconductive materials laboratory packed a gold capsule with silver and other materials and synthesized a 4 millimeter square mass at high pressure (50,000 atmospheres) and high temperature (1,100�C). The most popular method of fabricating superconducting material is to deposit molecular layers one by one, but weaknesses of this method include the fact that metal decomposes easily and the fact that oxygen tends to escape from the crystal structure. Hereafter, study to reveal crystal structure with great precision will be advanced. Also, since the space between layers of copper oxide, which demonstrate superconductivity, can be reduced if silver is used, it is possible that material with even better performance can be developed. Until now, the best critical temperature recorded for low-toxicity superconducting substances was absolute temperature 110� (-163�C) for a substance using bismuth.
