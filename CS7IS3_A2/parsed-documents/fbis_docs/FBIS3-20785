At first glance the public and the committee of inquiry got nothing but what might have been expected. The main news is that Mrs. Dafina's defense seems to be aimed at passing the buck to the Yugoslav and Serbian bank governors, who "did not say `stop' at interest rates between 10 and 18 percent." The mother of Serbian banking said in all seriousness that she would have abided by a "decision" of any institution prohibiting contracts calling for such high rates of interest. The second great sin of the National Bank of Serbia in Mrs. Dafina's opinion is that it did not agree to accept repayment of the loan granted in March of last year to Dafiment Bank, for which it had taken 251 kilograms of gold as collateral. During the questioning Mrs. Milanovic also stressed several times that her bank had never received a single dinar from primary issue, although she admitted indirectly that it had been purchasing foreign currencies on behalf of the National Bank of Serbia. Asked whether she had street dealers, she replied that that was a question to be put to all the banks. Names To Be Named Later Mrs. Dafina expressed her most delicate charge against the bank governors in describing the days after the flight of her fellow banker, Master Jezda, and the collapse of Jugoskandik. At that time, she said, she begged those responsible to accept the "half-full vault of Dafiment Bank" in the State Treasury, but they supposedly refused. It was then that many began to come for their money with weapons in their hands, with hand grenades around their neck, with pistols and knifes. Asked to name names, Mrs. Dafina replied that she had already lost two children and had only one left. In response to the anticipated question that she cite the names of politicians who withdrew their large deposits after the bank collapsed and allegedly took a profit of about 70 million marks [DM] in interest alone, even when everything had become clear, Dafina Milanovic said with a noticeable dose of bitterness that under a court order she would gladly present all those names "from all the political parties." In connection with a question about Milic from Macva she could not resist saying that "even those she did not know" wanted to have their picture taken with her at one time, but "now everyone shies away." The list of basic "news items" might conclude with Mrs. Dafina's assertion that she always had all the permits, that her business was constantly being audited, and that no official record of an audit had charged her with shady dealing, but always were confined to technical deficiencies. Asked whether she had promptly paid her taxes, she cited a case when DM33,800,000 in taxes and fees were collected from her which the state now admits she did not owe -- but of course it is offering a nominal dinar refund of the overpaid tax. The Gentlemanly Members of the Committee of Inquiry Trying to describe the dramatic tension which "conceived" this performance before the committee of inquiry of the Yugoslav Parliament is much more interesting than the early questioning. (Although the association is a bit unfortunate, it was all a bit like the film portrayal of Al Capone and other gentlemen from Chicago being questioned before Congress.) Even before the session began in the Yugoslav Assembly, Revolution Boulevard was obstructed by a group of several hundred aggrieved depositors, but the police had obviously anticipated something of the kind, and traffic was quickly diverted to neighboring streets. The demonstrators were of course demanding their money, and one of the members of the committee of inquiry even complained that they had shouted to him that he was a thief. The group broke up rather quickly, they seemed to have been more persistent when waiting in line (according to recent estimates, Dafiment Bank owes about DM620 million to 450,000 depositors, while its property and outstanding loans are estimated at about DM220 million). Mrs. Dafina appeared before the committee of inquiry in a subdued mauve suit. This time there was no gold in the jewelry she wore, but there were precious stones in the silver ornaments that remained. Her demeanor was "firm," with a tearful component inserted whenever she mentioned children and the people. Deputy Kastratovic was advised that the committee of inquiry had not "brought" her there, but that she had come on her own to "justify her pledge" and that she was there because she knew people were hungry. In response to all the delicate questions, instead of the U.S. "No comment," Mrs. Dafina replied, "I will gladly answer that question in writing." One got the impression that the members of the committee of inquiry were more afraid of the questioning than Mrs. Dafina. Few people have ever before seen such delicacy and beating about the bush, purported understanding and gentlemanly etiquette in this parliamentary building. Everyone who put questions advised all those present "significantly" that Mrs. Dafina need not answer, since these matters were "delicate." Only the journalists were surprised that no one used such well-known verbs as to lie, to steal and to rob. [Box, page 8] The Resourceful Stalwarts in Montenegro It just so happened that Mrs. Dafina Milanovic was given an occasion for counterattack at the very outset of her appearance before the committee of inquiry. Asked about the melancholy fate of 12,000 depositors on the coast, who, by contrast with Jezda's victims in Podgorica, were short-changed, Mrs. Dafina had a ready answer. According to her figures, an undischarged debt of DM7 million remained of the DM19,800,000 that had been deposited in her Montenegrin branches. She also said that she had informed official authorities that her employees had misappropriated DM4,800,000, that is, that there is no documentation on that money at all and it never came into possession of Dafiment Bank. This is a crime, then, which the local authorities did not react to. Mrs. Dafina also complained that literally all the equipment had been hauled away from her offices in Podgorica, Herceg-Novi and other towns. All in all, the now isolated owner of the largest bank in the Balkans said that in Montenegro she has damages amounting to DM3 million more than her obligations, and she advises the depositors to apply to authorities in that republic, and she promises that she will make public the charge which she has filed with the competent authorities. [Box, page 9] The Israeli Connection Deputy Strahinja Kastratovic was interested in the cofounder of the joint bank (that is, the one that obtained broad authority to handle foreign exchange), the now well-known Mr. Israel Kelman. Did this gentleman put up the founding capital, did he take out any profit, and did he transfer any money from the country "to Israel," Kastratovic asked. Mrs. Dafina replied that in May 1992 Mr. Kelman put up a share of DM2,500,000 and after that had the status of an adviser to Dafiment Bank. She also declared with vigor that Mr. Kelman had not taken anything "to Israel." It is still unknown whether he took something to some other place. Another Jewish name cropped up during the questioning of Mrs. Dafina. That is, she cited as one of the investments which time has confirmed to afford an attractive profit the purchase of a concession from the city of Belgrade to build a garage and to lease it for 30 years (70 percent of gross income) for DM20 million. She said that her partner was Mr. David Dudal (if we heard her correctly), manager of the firm LD Electronic. Deputy Zoran Krasic had Mrs. Dafina repeat the statement that she had insured her deposits abroad and that the firm was ready to come to her aid as soon as the sanctions are removed. It was not stated what firm this is (a certain "Jardino Ineurano Broker INT LTD" has been mentioned in the past), the amount of the insurance premium that might have been paid, nor whether this is once again some Jewish firm (if the firm in question exists at all).
