This came out in remarks the prime minister made this afternoon. Rabin said that we should wait for the meeting between the drafting teams to end in order to assess the extent of their progress before the Peres-'Arafat meeting in Davos. Israeli sources report that there are difficulties in the Cairo talks, and wide gaps still exist between the stands. The prime minister also addressed the statement made yesterday by Jordan's King Husayn, saying that the king's willingness to meet him is an important move forward, although any impending meeting has not yet been discussed. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: Some good news first: Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin views King Husayn's remarks last night as an important development. In Jerusalem, satisfaction was expressed regarding the king's remarks, although they too are taken with a pinch of salt, just as every utterance the king makes. Jerusalem sources believe that Husayn's remarks contain the following message: I may be linked with Syria and al-Asad, but I am no protege of the Syrian president. I am the leader of an independent state. Rabin was satisfied with the Jordanian king's remarks, although he does not foresee a meeting in the next few days; a few weeks perhaps. A few minutes ago, we asked him: [Begin recording] [Correspondent Segal] Have you started packing for your trip to Amman? [Rabin] I read King Husayn's statement carefully. If indeed he is showing willingness to hold a meeting, I will only be too happy. Currently, I know nothing about timetables, nor do I know what is required before the meeting. In his statement, he said that certain preparation is required before the meeting takes place. We are willing to make the preparations. As a rule, however, the very statement about his willingness to hold a meeting with me in public constitutes an important move forward. [end recording] Regarding the Palestinian track, no progress has yet been made in the Cairo deliberations between the Israeli and the Palestinian teams drafting the working papers. The differences in principle are still those regarding Israel's demand to have suspects inspected at the crossings in what has been called a sterile room, a small room, or an isolated cell. Israel agrees not to have the suspects inspected by an Israeli representative there, but with electronic devices. It demands, however, that the inspection of the suspects be held in a separate room. Prime Minister Rabin also did not have anything new and encouraging to report: [Begin Rabin recording] At this time, I cannot say for certain that the differences or stands have been bridged. We will hear a report about what went on in Cairo. We will meet this evening, and we will see. [end recording] At the same time, some Jerusalem sources have said that even if no progress is made, and even if the security issues are not fully finalized in Cairo, progress must be made in Davos -- at least from the Palestinian point of view. The negotiations there will be held with 'Arafat, which simply means that anything can happen.
