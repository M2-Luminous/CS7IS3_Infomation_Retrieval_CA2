Speaking on BBC Radio, the British defence secretary said that air power could not determine the outcome of the Bosnian war, although he denied that air strikes had failed and insisted that air strikes had reduced U.N. casualties there. Rifkind argued that only massive ground forces would have that impact, but he maintained that the United Nations should remain non- partisan. Meanwhile, Lord Carrington, former U.N. envoy to Bosnia, criticized today the West's policy failure in Bosnia. Speaking on BBC TV, Lord Carrington said that with regard to the U.N. peace efforts in Bosnia, "everything has gone wrong." It would be "madness" for the United Nations to wage war against the Bosnian Serbs, he stressed.
