Board of Foreign Trade Director General Hunag Jen-chao said Friday [1 April] that Taiwan will have no way to avert trade sanctions from the U.S. once President Clinton decides to proceed. Anyway, he said, the result in damage cannot be determined until Washington announces how such sanctions are to be enforced. On the other hand, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang [Chiang Ping-kun] said when he attends a ministerial meeting under the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade in north Africa next week, he will explain to other participating countries Taiwan's accomplishments and resolve in protecting wildlife. Chiang stressed it is unquestionable that the ROC [Republic of China] Government and people are determined to protect endangered species. He said the U.S. Government is moving to slap trade sanctions on Taiwan merely because of slandering the island by international conservation groups.
