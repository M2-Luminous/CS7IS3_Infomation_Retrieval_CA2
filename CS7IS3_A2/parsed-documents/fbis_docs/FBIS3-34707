This evening, Zvili denied having said that he is in favor of a Palestinian state. He nevertheless added that he foresees the emergence of a Palestinian state at the end of a long process, although this is a bad solution and Labor opposes it. Zvili added that he foresees Israel ultimately recognizing Syria's sovereignty over the Golan. Referring to an agreement with Jordan, he said that although it has been finalized he does not expect the Jordanian monarch to publicize it any time soon.
