This is the aim of the citywide comprehensive program for the development and support of small business adopted by the capital's government. Officially, a small business is deemed to be one which employs between 15 (trade, everyday services) and 200 (construction, industry) workers. It might appear as if these mini production units and small firms have very few jobs to offer, but there are tens of thousands of them in the city -- and this constitutes a sizable part of Moscow's economy and a major factor of stability in the social climate. The citywide program defines the priority spheres for small business in Moscow: Namely, the production and sale of foodstuffs and consumer goods, everyday services, health care, city amenities and garbage clearance, the development of the tourist sector, and services for visitors. In the first quarter of this year 3.5 billion [rubles] of the city's money was spent on supporting those who decided to take on these concerns. As of next year, the subsidy will make up 0.5 percent of the entire Moscow budget. So where exactly will these considerable resources go? Over the next 18 months in virtually all municipal districts it is planned to set up 60 mini-bakeries, 35 new workshops for repairing household appliances, 14 breweries, 10 small meat processing plants, 6 timber processing plants, 6 knitwear production units, 9 construction units, and 10 garbage collection subdivisions. Apart from the city's money, resources are also being attracted from public associations of entrepreneurs. In return for assisting in setting up a small business, their senior colleagues will be granted concessions in payments for rented premises, power, heat, and water, and they will be exempt from certain municipal taxes -- all according to the "rules of the game" in a market economy. A Moscow Fund for the Support of Small Business is being set up -- its tasks are as follows: To train skilled personnel (there is a dire shortage of competent accountants, economists, and legal experts!); to create databases; and to publish the information and analysis yearbook "Moscow Small Business." The fund has also been tasked with organizing a specialized science park [tekhnopark], possibly on the basis of the former Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, to elaborate promising projects which can then be realized by small businesses. A great help to existing and newly created entrepreneurial structures is the Moscow Leasing Company, which acquires technological equipment and then rents it out to small enterprises in priority sectors and creates "turnkey" production units that are ready to roll.
