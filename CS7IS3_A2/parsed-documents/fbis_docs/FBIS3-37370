The foundation of this new party edifice, which is being erected in accordance with a radical plan, was laid by a program statement declaring that the "corrupt bureaucracy is increasingly taking the center stage of political life, together with right- and left-wing radical (fascist and communist) antireformist forces." According to the authors of the statement, the "executive branch, instead of countering reaction, is getting further and further away from the course of reforms, accompanying the revision of their basic principles with declarations of loyalty to them." Therefore, the "Russia's Choice" party (the name is still being worked on) intends to unite "all those for whom freedom, human dignity, and the prosperity of the Fatherland and its citizens are not empty words and who are prepared inside and outside parliament, in individual and mass actions, to act as guarantors of reforms, guarantors of Russia's renewal." Predictably, the ideological declaration did not meet with any objections on the part of those attending the political weekend. After all, the Russian radical democrats exchange oaths of loyalty to liberalism as regularly as they do vehemently, which does not prevent them in any way from multiplying the splits and discord in their ranks and piling up mutual grievances and criticism. But what guarantees are there that the new political alliance of radical reformers will be viable and effective? "Russian democracy is terrible at times of victory," Yegor Gaydar, the chief instigator of the future party, said in an exclusive interview for IZVESTIYA (the conversation took place in a luxury suite in the leisure complex near Moscow where the conference participants spent the two days). "When they win the democrats immediately start having deep and meaningful discussions, deciding who should do what, and arguing over trivia. But at moments of danger Russian democracy is capable of united, organized action. We are going through just such a time at the moment." "What was the main source of disagreement during the two-day talks?" "Organizational matters, as ever. The principle underlying the structure of the party. The founder-membership. The norms of representation on leading bodies." One of the cofounders of the party, together with "Russia's Choice," is the "Democratic Russia" movement. Its regional structures, amorphous though they may be at present, will find a new use. But an argument has already developed between the leaders of the future alliance in the capital and in the provinces over the principle whereby the leasding body is to be formed, how many seats Moscow will get and how many the provinces will get. The allocation of party portfolios has begun. Yegor Gaydar's intention is that the new party should not be a rehash of existing movements and organizations. A fundamentally new alliance of reformists is being created. It is clear from the program statement that it intends to pursue a "line of constructive dialogue with the federal government and local administrations, taking issue with them on vital matters." It was stipulated that "if the intention to curtail the reforms is put into practice, the party is prepared to oppose the present cabinet." The latter statement has considerable piquancy, given that Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who also participated in the talks near Moscow, will be one of the party's leaders. Making it known that the party is not responsible for the government's activites and their results, the conference participants, in their program statement, skillfully delineated their attitude toward Boris Yeltsin: "We draw a clear line between the president and all the other structures of executive power. `Russia's Choice' will give social and political support to the course of reforms President Yeltsin has been conducting since 1991. We support a president who is conducting this course. We criticize the president insofar as he himself is deviating from this course under pressure from various circumstances." Yegor Gaydar announced that the party's founding congress will take place at the end of May at the earliest. The former vice premier said that the delayed birth of the new political alliance is due to a multitude of organizational problems. But that is probably not the reason. The initiators and creators of the party probably want the founding forum to take place against a particular political and economic background. It is hard to predict what this background will be like by the beginning of the summer. The leaders of the new political alliance are intending to bring into their ranks small and medium-size entrepreneurs, skilled workers, and the intelligentsia and are hoping that a wave of social discontent in the spring and the summer will wash many more supporters to their party shore than they have at the moment.
