He described the proposal made by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev that the CIS should be transformed into a closer Euro-Asian Union as "exceptionally useful and sound." Korotchenya did not know, however, what the basic propositions the union would be dedicated to. In his view, Nazarbayev's proposal will be discussed by the CIS Moscow summit to be held on April 15. "No offical documents on the setting up a Euro-Asian Union have reached the CIS Secretariat," Korotchenya said.
