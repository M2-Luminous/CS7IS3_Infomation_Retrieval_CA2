Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09FEB94-JAPAN-U.S. Japanese Politicians Not Yielding on Objective Criteria Issue SUMMARY Japanese press reporting and statements in the press by senior Japanese officials suggest that Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is coming to Washington in advance of the 11 February summit with no immediate plans to make concessions on the issue of setting objective criteria to assess Japan's trade performance. Tokyo may in fact be calculating that by continuing to take a hard line at this point, it will force the United States to make concessions. It may also hope that its recent announcement of its economic stimulus package and plans for a tax cut will satisfy to some extent U.S. demands that Tokyo take steps to reduce its huge trade surplus. END SUMMARY Senior Japanese political and government leaders who commented to the press on Foreign Minister Hata's last-minute trip to Washington to try to break the impasse in the stalled U.S.-Japan framework talks all stressed that the Japanese Government had no intention of making concessions on the issue of setting objective criteria. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reportedly told a news conference on 9 February that Japan would find it "impossible" to accept objective criteria (Kyodo, 9 February). Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, in announcing Hata's trip, stated that Hata would conduct negotiations in Washington in line with Tokyo's "basic stance" that "it is very difficult to accept the proposal for numerical targets," according to a 9 February Kyodo report. Kyodo on 9 February also quoted an unnamed government source as stating that Tokyo would continue to reject any calls to establish objective criteria, and hinted that Japan would consider taking the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the United States were to invoke sanctions. Hata himself was a bit less categorical on the objective criteria issue, noting only that he would "discuss the matter keeping in mind the potential implications," according to another 9 February Kyodo report. Both Hata and the unnamed government source quoted by Kyodo also alluded to a concern that may in part be driving the Japanese resistance to objective criteria, namely, that other countries- -particularly, in the near term, the European Union--that have trade deficits with Japan might use any U.S.-Japan agreement incorporating objective criteria to press for criteria to assess Japan's trade performance with regard to them. Hata reportedly told the press before leaving for Washington that among the issues he would consider in his negotiations would be "what the implications could be internationally" (Kyodo, 9 January). The unnamed government source was quoted by Kyodo as stating that any concessions by Japan on objective criteria would have an impact not only on U.S.-Japan relations, but also on other countries throughout the world. Such statements have recently marked the commentary of other Japanese officials and businessmen on the issue of objective criteria. For example, on 18 January Asahi Shimbun quoted an unnamed senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official as stating that "the European Union and Asian nations are paying much attention to how Japan handles trade issues with the United States" and warning that Tokyo must therefore "not make unnecessary concessions." Similarly, in an interview in the 2 February Mainichi Shimbun, Yutaka Kume, Chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association and Chairman of Nissan Motor Corporation, also warned that if Japan were to agree to extend the voluntary plan to purchase U.S.-made auto parts announced during former President Bush's trip to Tokyo in January 1992, "I do not think the European Union will remain indifferent." Expectation of U.S. Concessions Some officials in Tokyo may anticipate that by continuing to take a hard line, the Japanese Government will force the United States to make concessions in order to achieve an agreement at the talks before the summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The 5 February Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unidentified source close to the framework negotiations as stating that during his recent trip to Tokyo, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor indicated that the United States would not stick to its "conventional calls" for setting objective criteria--a move which the source apparently interpreted as a prospective U.S. concession. Another report in the same edition of Mainichi Shimbun quoted members of the Japanese negotiating team as arguing that the United States would "withdraw its demands in the end because Japan is doing its best" and as warning that the "possibility of cooperation will expand only if the United States withdraws its demands on numerical targets." Stress on Economic Stimulus Some officials may also hope that the package of economic stimulus measures that Tokyo has just announced, including a 53 billion dollar tax cut, will satisfy Washington's demands that Tokyo take steps to help promote imports and reduce its trade surplus. The 8 February Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unnamed senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official as predicting that "the atmosphere surrounding the ongoing economic framework talks will be greatly changed" depending on the way Japan presented its macroeconomic policies, including the stimulus package, at the summit. Before his departure for Washington, Foreign Minister Hata told reporters that one of the main goals of his discussions with U.S. officials would be to clear up a "lack of understanding" in the U.S. Government about the full extent of the Hosokawa government's efforts to stimulate the Japanese economy and increase imports of foreign goods (Kyodo, 9 February). Outlook In his talks in Washington, Hata will probably continue to resist the concept of objective criteria in any form that might be interpreted in the future as specific targets to which Washington would attempt to hold the Japanese Government. One factor that might encourage him to make some limited concessions, however, will be the pressure on Prime Minister Hosokawa to be able to portray his 11 February summit with President Clinton as successful. Hosokawa has come in for considerable criticism in Tokyo--from within the ruling coalition, from the opposition parties, and from the media, which has until recently generally been sympathetic to him--for his bungling of his initial announcement on 2 February of a large tax cut and the delayed imposition of a 7 percent national welfare tax. A weak performance at the summit--or any suggestion that it failed in some major respect--would almost certainly open him up to further domestic criticism of his leadership. (AUTHOR: BOUNDS.
