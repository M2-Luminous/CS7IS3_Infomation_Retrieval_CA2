The rural labor force in Liaoning Province totals 8.5 million. But the province only has 0.5 hectare of farmland per capita. In the past, most of the surplus labor in rural areas could do nothing but rely on farm production. Experts estimated that about half of the rural labor force is enough for the province's agriculture. Since the mid-1980s, the province has attached importance to the development of rural industry so as to absorb more surplus rural labor. Last year, the number of rural enterprises in Liaoning increased to about 700,000 from 300,000 in 1990. The output value of the rural industry in the province reached more than 16 million yuan, accounting for 80 percent of the total output value in agriculture, and the profit of the rural industry was 10.6 billion yuan. Now about 4.5 million rural laborers have turned to the rural industry in the province. Statistics show that over the past 14 years, about 110 million of the labor force in China's rural areas have shifted to non- agricultural services.
