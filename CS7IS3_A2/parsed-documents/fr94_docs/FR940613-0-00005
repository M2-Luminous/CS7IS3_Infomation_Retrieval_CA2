FR940613-0-00005 FR940613-0-00002 The FAA does not concur. As explained in the preamble of the proposal, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracks in outer wing stringer number 41 and, in one case, complete failure of the stringer. Such fatigue cracking presents an unsafe condition in airplanes, since it could eventually lead to failure of the stringer and reduced structural integrity of the wing. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition could exist or eventually develop on Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, and that repetitive inspections of the affected area must be mandated to ensure that safety is not degraded. The appropriate vehicle for mandating such action to correct an unsafe condition is the airworthiness directive. One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time for accomplishment of the initial inspection specified in paragraph (b)(1) of the proposal be changed from ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500 total landings, or within 1,500 landings after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' to ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500 total landings, or within one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later.'' The commenter operates Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;40 series airplanes of non-U.S. registry for training flights for cockpit crews. The commenter explains that, during one training flight period of a few weeks, the number of flight cycles accumulated may be more than 1,500 landings. The commenter adds that the proposed inspections and modifications require entry into the fuel tanks; therefore, the commenter plans to accomplish the initial inspections and the modifications during regularly scheduled maintenance. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Compliance times for AD's are normally based on a parameter related to failure of a particular component. In this case, fatigue cracking in outer wing stringer number 41 and subsequent failure of the stringer are undoubtedly related to the number of landings. The FAA has determined, in this case, that there is no apparent direct relationship between failure of the stringer and calendar time. In light of this, and in consideration of the average utilization rate of the affected U.S. operators and the practical aspects of orderly inspections of the U.S. fleet during regular maintenance periods, the FAA established the compliance times specified in this AD. The FAA maintains that those compliance times are appropriate. However, the FAA would consider a request for adjustment of the compliance time, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this AD, provided that, for example, continued operational safety of the airplane could be assured until the required action is accomplished. One commenter requests that, in order for the AD requirements to align with the actions described in the service bulletin, accomplishment of the preventative modification should be considered optional, and that operators should be permitted to accomplish repetitive inspections at intervals of 4,000 landings in lieu of the preventative modification. The FAA does not concur. The degree of assurance necessary as to the adequacy of inspections needed to maintain the safety of the aging transport airplane fleet, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous repetitive inspections, has caused the FAA to place less emphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasis on design improvements and material replacement. Thus, in lieu of its previous position of continual inspection, and repair or modification on condition if cracks are found, the FAA has decided to require, whenever practicable, airplane modifications necessary to remove the source of the particular aging phenomena. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 426 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 121 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes will cost approximately $586 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes is estimated to be $161,414, or $1,334 per airplane.
