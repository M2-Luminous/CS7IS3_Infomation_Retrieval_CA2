General, what do you have to say to the Honduran people after listening to President Reina's message tonight? [Andino] Please excuse my sore throat and hoarse voice. Regarding your question, we have said over and over that the Armed Forces is a serious, professional, obedient, nondeliberative institution. The president made a promise during his campaign. The Armed Forces cannot leave the president in a predicament. We must support him. But this doesn't mean that we are in complete agreement with the concept of volunteer military service, not for personal reasons or for a lack of understanding, but because we have many doubts about the benefits that volunteer military service would have for the national interest. I would like to reiterate that the Armed Forces has always supported the president. We will accept the proposal because we are subordinates and have no reason to dispute the president's opinions or decisions. Nevertheless, we believe it is important that it be clearly understood that we do not completely agree with volunteer military service. We say this not as military officers but as Hondurans. [Valladares] General, this means you accept the idea but do not completely agree. [Andino] We hope we are wrong, but we have reservations about the impact of volunteer military service. We agree that existing recruiting measures are not the best, but we think the military service law by itself is good and thorough enough for us. The law separates the issue of military service from recruiting measures. The fact that part of the law -- in this case the part on recruiting -- isn't properly implemented does not mean the law is bad. Only some aspects of it would have to be changed or improved. May I reiterate: This is the president's decision. As subordinates, we gladly support his decision and will do everything possible to ensure that volunteer military service produces the best possible results. [Valladares] This station has learned that some have said a volunteer military service would be enormously expensive, costing nearly twice what the Armed Forces has in its current budget. This has all been discussed; you confirmed it tonight. The Armed Forces accept this proposal because President Reina is the commander in cheif of the Armed Forces, but you have expressed disagreement. [Andino] Right now we have three lempiras allocated to feed one soldier each day. One of the main incentives for volunteer military service is a more balanced diet. These days, when prices of basic goods have skyrocketed, three lempiras could hardly buy an attractive meal for a young man willing to enroll in the Army. And this would have to come hand-in-hand with the correction of all criticisms and defects. We will try to live within our allotment. Let's see what happens. I reiterate. I hope that I'm wrong and that volunteer military service will have the expected results. Nevertheless, there are several factors that could have some effects in the long term. Consider that only three countries in the world have volunteer military service, all of them developed countries. No country in the Second or Third World has this type of military service. But I hope this idea can prosper. We hope the real winners will be the people. In this kind of military service, one enrolls voluntarily and leaves when one desires. But some people might stay with the added attraction of a higher salary. Others would do stay for personal reasons. And this sounds a little bit more like a mercenary service. [Valladares] General, you explained all this to President Reina. I feel there is pessimism among the Armed Forces and that action was taken hastily so as to keep a campaign promise and because of the protests and criticism by some sectors. Has this been done in haste? [Andino] We are members of the military; we are obedient; we are nondeliberative, and apolitical. We would not like to express an opinion on political topics. What I repeat is that we are going to obey, with good faith and goodwill, so that the volunteer military service will produce the expected results. We are here to follow orders. [Valladares] General, at this time, taking advanatage of the opportunity you have given us, Danilo Izaguirre wants to ask you something about the educational military service [servicio militar educativo]. Go ahead Danilo, Gen. Reynaldo Andino Flores is listening: [Izaguirre] Thanks, Raul. General, good evening. How true or false is the following? A group of deputies is going to talk to you to find out whether the government pressured you into remaining silent on the issue of abolishing what the Constitution says on compulsory military service. This group says that if you have indeed been pressured to approve this in haste, it will take measures in the National Congress. Go ahead, General: [Andino] The sovereign National Congress will know what it has to do in this situation and at this time of historic decisions. I think they have enough experience, maturity, and knowledge to know what role the National Congress should play. We will support whatever Congress decides and whatever the president has decided. We will second him the best way possible and with the best intentions. [Valladares] What has Gen. Discua, commander of the Armed Forces, told you about all this? There was a feeling that the military did not agree. Tonight you have confirmed to this station that they are going to obey, and that hopefully this educational military service will be successful, but that only three countries have it, and, with the country's economic and social problems, there is some uncertainty about this educational military service. [Andino] I think the talks that have been held have been very positive. The problem has been analyzed in a climate of great cordiality and understanding on the part of the people appointed by the president. There has been a great desire to find the best solution. I think the alternative that was found... [pauses] We think the reform, as proposed in the new constitutional article, could help resolve the situation because several circumstances are foreseen in the event that the volunteer military service does not work. There are some aspects there which take into account the possibility of a problem with regard to calling on volunteers. [Valladares] There is talk about disbanding nearly four battalions, about questions from the U.S. Government on reductions in the Honduran Army, and about U.S. aid to our country being linked to that. As defense minister, what can you tell our listeners about the situation? [Andino] If we are not in fact independent, at least we should try to be independent. In the Armed Forces, the reduction process has been under way for the past three or four years. In the recent past, a field artillery brigade, an anti-aircraft battalion, and units of the territorial forces were deactivated. We in the Armed Forces are preparing to present to the president a plan for reducing the Armed Forces that includes cutting back several units and merging others. All of this will be proposed not because of any internal or external pressure or because anyone has threatened to go on a hunger strike or anything like that. It is simply because the military is aware of national realities. We live in Honduras, and we have always lived here. As the saying goes: We were born here, we live here, and this is where we're staying. We have spent our entire lives here, and we are aware of the country's problems. We are quite aware of the nation's reality. Considering the 10 percent budget cut implemented during the past administration and the current 10 percent cut, these alone are a 20 percent cut in the Armed Forces' budget. The fact that funds earmarked for the Armed Forces remained unchanged for approximately a decade can be viewed as a form of reduction. And considering the 20 percent I just mentioned, in addition to increases in the cost of living and the currency devaluation, we are talking about a nearly 50 percent cut in the Armed Forces' budget. Taking all this into consideration, we definitely cannot continue with the same structures we have had in the past decade. Independent of what takes place on the financial side, we are aware that some of the original reasons for increasing the size of the Armed Forces no longer exist. But this doesn't mean that because the Cold War is over, we now must get rid of the Armed Forces. In neighboring Guatemala, right next to us, there are no ideological or Cold War problems. Despite this, you are all aware of the problems Guatemala is going through. Guatemala has no border problems with any other country, yet there is no talk there about cutting the Armed Forces. They are confronting internal problems which hopefully we will never have to face. The problems over there are caused by menaces like poverty, injustice, and corruption. [Valladares] Two final questions, General, before you send your message to the Honduran people. Tonight, President Carlos Roberto Reina said that these reforms will mark a turning point in relations between civilians and the military. Or will they mark differences with Gen. Reynaldo Andino Flores? [Andino] No, I don't believe this will create any differences. I believe this marks a historic turning point in the sense that the Armed Forces will once again prove that it is sensitive to national problems. The institution will also prove its subordination to the civilian government. I believe this is the most important thing -- independent of the question of whether the measures are indeed positive -- the Armed Forces will obey. The president, as head of the Republic and commander in chief, commands the Armed Forces. We are a responsible, permanent, and credible institution, subordinate to a policy of obedience and nondeliberation. [Valladares] General, what do you have to say to the Honduran people who are listening to you on HRN? Following this interesting conversation, what do you have to say to those listeners who have tuned in to this HRN broadcast? Gen. Reynaldo Andino Flores, as the Honduran defense minister, what do you have to say now that President Reina has pointed out that military service will be volunteer, educational, social, humanist, democratic, and intended to encourage the younger generation to fulfill their aspirations? [Andino] Well, my message is that we should have faith, hope, and trust that everything will turn out well. The president is a man of experience. He is a national leader. He is our president and the top authority in the country. He knows what he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in everything he does and decides. We, I repeat, are an institution that is at the service of the nation. The president has been elected by a system established by our laws, and we can do nothing but obey him. I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed Forces, do not believe volunteer military service is a good idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men, know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a volunteer military service. I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous country with better chances for an auspicious future.
