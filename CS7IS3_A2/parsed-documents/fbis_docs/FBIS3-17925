Were they valid or not? According to the oblast electoral commission this question can be answered in the affirmative. Of the 47 seats in the oblast legislative assembly 36 have acquired incumbents. And that enables the assembly to function on a legal basis even in this truncated form. In the remaining 11 districts the elections were deemed invalid because of the low turnout. Vladislav Shapovalenko, the president's representative in Orenburg Oblast, broke the calm. He spoke on local television, accusing oblast electoral commission chairman Yu. Andreyev of arbitrariness and juggling with the election results. And he urged the oblast prosecutor to deem the elections in eight districts invalid. If his protest is satisfied the elections in the oblast as a whole will be deemed invalid. In V. Shapovalenko's opinion the statute on the elections according to which the participation of 20 percent of the electorate is necessary for them to be deemed valid has been broken. But in the past the Central Electoral Commission has sent a specification to the localities according to which the percentage of turnout must be determined from the number of valid ballot slips. But in practice there is always a large difference between the number of voters and the number of ballot slips deemed valid. And that difference could be fatal for the eight districts. In terms of turnout they reached the necessary level. But some were tens of a percent and others hundreds of a percent short of the number of valid ballot slips required. It should be noted that Yu. Andreyev was not acting alone. On election day he telephoned the Central Electoral Commission in Moscow several times and sought advice. As a result he was given the go-ahead to deem the elections in these disputed districts valid. The oblast legislative assembly thus become fully empowered, reaching the necessary two thirds of its makeup. It will soon become clear how the conflict will end. But some people see in the position of the president's representative a morbid reaction to the crushing defeat of "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia." Not one of their representatives got into the oblast legislative assembly. Actually, the bloc "against poverty, unemployment, and corruption," which included Communists, agrarian experts, and commodity producers and some others, did not win special laurels either. The head of the local Communists and the chairman of the oblast's union of commodity producers became deputies. It is true that the list of those elected contains many former party functionaries who were able to keep afloat. Despite the appeal from V. Yelagin, head of the oblast administration, to the leaders of rayon administrations not to submit their candidacies, the latter did not heed him. As a result 11 have become deputies. Even more seats were obtained by the directors of industrial enterprises and chairmen of former collective farms -- 19. The director of a commercial bank, the director of a commercial firm, and two journalists successfully passed through the sieve of the election campaign. Elections to the Orenburg City Duma were invalid. Of 13 deputies' seats only four were filled. Elections were invalid in a number of districts of other cities in the oblast. The election campaign cost 2.5 billion rubles. If the question of the contested districts is reviewed they may be considered to have been thrown to the wind.
