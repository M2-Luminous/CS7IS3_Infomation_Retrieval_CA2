Electricity is being supplied to Chechnya as before, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today by Fedor Morozov, head of the central control room of the Yedinaya Energosistema Rossii Russian shareholding company. He said 50 MW of electricity is reaching Chechnya from Russia hourly. Russian power engineering people did not register any alterations to these parameters today. Fedor Morozov thinks that it is so far impossible to understand the reason behind the recent reports that electricity supplies to Chechnya were cut off, since at about 1100 Moscow Time the central control room's communications with Chechnya went down and it has not been found possible to restore them. It cannot be ruled out that several customers may have been cut off, but a decision of this kind could only have been made by Chechnya's local power grid.
