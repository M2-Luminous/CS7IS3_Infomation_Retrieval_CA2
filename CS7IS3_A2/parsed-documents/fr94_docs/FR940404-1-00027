Appendix A to Part 77_DD Form 2580, Operation Transition Department of Defense Outplacement and Referral System/Public and Community Service Individual Application Appendix B to Part 77_DD Form 2581, Operation Transition Employer Registration Appendix C to Part 77_DD Form 2581&hyph;1, Public and Community Service Organization Validation Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1143(c). §77.1 Purpose. This part implements section 4462, Public Law 102&hyph;484 and section 561, Public Law 103&hyph;160 by establishing policy, assigning responsibilities, and prescribing procedures to: (a) Encourage and assist separating Service members, Service members retiring with 20 or more years of service, DoD civilian personnel leaving the Government, and spouses to enter public and community service employment. (b) Encourage and assist Service members requesting retirement with fewer than 20 years of service to register for public and community service employment. §77.2 Applicability and scope. This part applies to: (a) The Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as ``the DoD Components''). The term ``Military Services,'' as used herein, refers to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps. (b) All active duty Service members and former members under section 4462 of Public Law 102&hyph;484 and section 561 of Public Law 103&hyph;160, and DoD civilian personnel leaving the Government, and their spouses. §77.3 Definitions. (a) Community service employment. Work in nonprofit organizations that provide or coordinate services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section. ``Nonprofit'' is defined as having been recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as having a tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4). These organizations shall not be administered by businesses organized for profit, labor unions, partisan political organizations, or organizations engaged in religious activities, unless such activities are unrelated to religious instructions, worship services, or any form of proselytization. (b) Creditable early retirement public or community service employment for service members. Employment in a DoD-registered public and community service organization that provides the services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section, or that coordinates the provision of the services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section. Federal employment shall count toward recomputed military retirement pay and Survivor Benefit Plan base amount for early retirees: however, working in a DoD-registered Federal public service organization may trigger the dual-compensation restrictions of 26 U.S.C. 5532. Employment must have occurred between that date of early retirement and the date in which the Service member would have attained 20 years of credible service for computing retired pay, or he or she must have retired on or after October 23, 1992 and before October 1, 1999.
