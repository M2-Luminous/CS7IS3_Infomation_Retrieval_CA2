FR941205-2-00033 FR941205-2-00029 Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority Part H, Chapter HC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority of the Department of Health and Human Services (45 FR 67772&hyph;67776, dated October 14, 1980, and corrected at 45 FR 69296, October 20, 1980, as amended most recently at 59 FR 47146, dated September 14, 1994) is amended to establish the Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at Morgantown, West Virginia. Section HC&hyph;B, Organization and Functions, is hereby amended as follows: After the functional statement for the Office of Extramural Coordination and Special Projects (HCC13), insert the following: Health Effects Laboratory Division (HCC3) (1) Provides new focused research capabilities in mechanisms of occupational disease and identifies causative substances and early indicators (biomarkers) of response to chemical, biological, and physical substances which will be directed at prevention and control of occupational disease and integrated into the filed research and services programs in NIOSH; (2) develops new state-of-the-art research techniques in physiology, human and animal cellular and molecular pathology; (3) develops new state-of-the-art research techniques in the areas of biochemistry, immunotoxicology, pharmacology, molecular and cellular biology, genetic toxicology, and imaging; (4) provides new research to develop and improve methods for environmental measurement of aerosols; (5) develops and evaluates (including development of performance criteria) intelligent, real-time personal and area direct reading instruments for chemical, biological and physical agents; (6) develops and improves techniques for measuring exposures and human responses to workplace exposures; (7) develops new research techniques in the areas of aeromicrobiology, particle characterization, molecular characterization, micro-sensors, advanced sampling and instrumentation, electronic monitoring, electrical and mechanical engineering; (8) develops new methodologies for exposure modeling of current and past exposures for use in applied research; (9) provides new research capabilities for developing and establishing engineering solutions for the control of occupational diseases and for utilizing engineering techniques to solve problems; (10) develops new research techniques in the areas of computerized workplace simulations and mathematical models; (11) provides environmental and biological laboratory services for all field and laboratory programs in NIOSH; (12) develops and evaluates effective communication strategies for promoting health education to communicate risk and prevention recommendations to those at risk and form coalitions to advocate prevention activities. Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch (HCC32) (1) Provides focused research in workplace exposure and identifies causative substances and biomarkers of response to chemical, biological, and physical substances; (2) develops laboratory techniques or modifications that could be useful for population-based or large environmental testing; (3) develops molecular programs to examine the toxic effects of workplace exposures/agents on human, animal, and cellular systems; (4) defines the levels and circumstances of exposures that lead to development of pre- and post-toxic biomarkers, toxic responses, repair of damage or alleviation of damage, mechanisms of toxicity, and recommendations for prevention and control of toxic exposures; (5) develops integrated research programs in areas including cell to cell communication, cellular interaction, genome activations, responses to and production/release of cellular signals; and mechanisms of control, blockage, and homeostasis of cellular systems, broadly interpreted with respect to environmental and occupational agents; (6) studies microbial cellular components and production and release of exotoxins and mycotoxins in context with the holistic human and animal response, including targets such as the lung, skin, and nervous system; (7) provides support to the Division on state-of-the-art research in the areas of toxicology, molecular and cellular biology.
