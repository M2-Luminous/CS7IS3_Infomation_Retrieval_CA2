A great deal has been done in the period since the creation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. Plans for the organizational development of the Armed Forces and their strategic deployment have been elaborated, and the relevant directives have been sent to the troops and their implementation has been organized. A certain amount of experience has been built up in recruiting citizens to military service on contract. The Armed Forces rear services support has by and large been planned and organized quite well amid the complex economic conditions in the state. A concept for the military training system has been elaborated. At the same time, not everything has gone smoothly in the organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Certain errors have been made in the organization of the command and control of the troops and cadre and training work. Military communications, which are markedly lagging behind world standards in their development, are generating serious criticism. Cooperation with local administrations in settling questions of the draft to the Armed Forces has not been established everywhere in a clear-cut way. There are also other shortcomings which primarily require the responsibility and professionalism of the military leaders in order to be overcome. The main aim of the conference which has been held, Pavel Grachev noted, is to expose our shortcomings and blunders in time. To assess them. And find ways of solving problems. The correct conclusions will be drawn in the Armed Forces, the minister stressed, and all the necessary measures will be adopted to ensure the state's security effectively.
