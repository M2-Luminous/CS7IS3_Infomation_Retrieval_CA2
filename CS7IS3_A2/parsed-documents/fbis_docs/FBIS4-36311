He added: We hope that Kurdistan will become a region where only the regular forces carry arms in defense of our borders. Asked to comment on Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Mas'ud Barzani's proposal for the disarmament of Iraq's Kurdistan and its protection by the international community, brother Talabani said the PUK is ready to take the necessary steps to implement this sacred objective. He added: It is essential that we ourselves take this step under the supervision of the Kurdistan region government. We could form a committee made up of the interior minister, minister of the peshmerga affairs, and the director of the police corps to achieve this objective, he added. Brother Talabani pointed out that expediting the normalization of the situation and ensuring the return of security and order to the sons of our people in Kurdistan would contribute to creating the atmosphere and necessary grounds for establishing the rule of law, democracy, and human rights.
