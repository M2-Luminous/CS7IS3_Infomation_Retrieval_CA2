FR940325-0-00021 FR940325-0-00006 Office of the Inspector General 24 CFR Parts 2000, 2002, and 2003 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1715; FR&hyph;3632&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2508&hyph;AA08 Removal of Internal Regulations: Office of the Inspector General AGENCY: Office of the Inspector General, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule eliminates 24 CFR part 2000, and makes conforming revisions to parts 2002 and 2003. This action complies with Executive Order 12861, by eliminating certain internal management regulations that are not required by law. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emmett N. Roden, Assistant General Counsel, Inspector General and Administrative Proceedings Division, Office of General Counsel, room 10251, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2350 or (202) 708&hyph;3259 (TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Justification for Final Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the rule relates to internal agency organization and management and because the provisions to be removed by this rule are not required by law and are duplicative of statutory provisions or delegations of authority that remain in effect. Background The Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app.) was enacted to create independent and objective units to perform various investigative and monitoring functions in several Executive agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Act confers broad authority upon the Inspector General to conduct independent investigations and audits. Consistent with its statutory independence, and with the delegation of authority to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the functions, powers, and duties of the Inspector General, separate regulations have been adopted at 24 CFR chapter XII (Ch. XII) that are applicable only to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) within HUD. Currently, chapter XII concerns such matters as organization, functions, and delegations of authority (part 2000), availability of information to the public (part 2002), implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974 (part 2003), and production in response to subpoenas or demands of courts or other authorities (part 2004). On September 11, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12861, which requires each Executive department and agency to undertake to eliminate within 3 years of the effective date of the Order not less than 50 percent of its civilian internal management regulations that are not required by law. Part 2000 is a civilian internal management regulation of the type referenced in the Executive Order. The Inspector General of HUD has determined that 24 CFR part 2000 is not required by law and, in large part, duplicates the provisions of the Inspector General Act or of various published delegations of authority that remain in force. Accordingly, this final rule eliminates part 2000 and amends parts 2002 and 2003, to the extent that those parts contain references to part 2000. (Part 2004 does not contain references to part 2000.) Other Matters Environmental Review In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to internal administrative procedures that do not relate to the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule eliminates unnecessary regulations. There are no anticompetitive discriminatory aspects of the rule with regard to small entities, and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied with by small entities. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited to eliminating unnecessary or duplicative regulations. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects 24 CFR Part 2000 Organization and functions (Government agencies). 24 CFR Part 2002 Freedom of information. 24 CFR Part 2003 Privacy.
