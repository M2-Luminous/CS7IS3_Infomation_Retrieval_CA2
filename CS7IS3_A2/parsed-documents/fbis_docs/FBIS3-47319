This was disclosed by a government source on 8 January. It will be the first time for the leaders of both countries to actually talk about the rice issue at summit talks. It seems the U.S. Government will strengthen its pressure on Japan regarding the rice measures in the future. According to sources concerned, President Clinton will likely make the request unofficially. It seems that following the conclusion of the new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round) of GATT, "the United States aims to secure and expand its rice export share before Japan actually decides from which countries it will import rice" (according to the government source). The new round of negotiations over the rice issue decided -- as an exception to an introduction of a comprehensive tariff, designed to replace all import regulations with a tariff -- to adopt "special measures" for expansion of the minimum access instead of shelving the tariffication for six years. Through the minimum access, Japan will import about 400,000 tons of rice for domestic consumption in 1995. It will eventually be increased to about 800,000 tons. Japan still has not decided which countries it is going to import rice from for the minimum access. However, some people are saying, from the viewpoint of protecting rice farmers, that "the government should import rice for production of rice cakes and other processed food" (according to Kozo Watanabe, representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]). So far this is the strongest demand. Many people are saying that priority should be given to the idea of buying rice from Thailand instead of from the United States which is working on producing short-grain rice (called Japonica rice) for direct consumption as staple food. Moreover, the rice produced in the United States is more expensive than Thai rice, which is used in setting the price index in the rice trade market. It is also true that China and Vietnam are exerting efforts to produce high-quality Japonica rice. Because of this, many people think that "American rice, which will have a major impact on Japan's rice production, will not be imported much even after Japan's rice market is liberalized." This was a prevailing view even before the decision on the rice issue was made. Under such circumstances, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is maintaining a negative stance about accepting U.S. requests. But political decisions are more important than economic principles as far as negotiations over the rice issue are concerned. Therefore, some government officials are saying that "the United States started to control our rice policy at the moment when we rejected immediate tariffication and accepted the partial liberalization," (according to the government source). Japan has no choice but to make a decision on the issue of rice imports within the scope of overall Japan-U.S. relations. It seems that Japan will constantly import a certain volume of U.S. rice by eventually accepting the President's request.
