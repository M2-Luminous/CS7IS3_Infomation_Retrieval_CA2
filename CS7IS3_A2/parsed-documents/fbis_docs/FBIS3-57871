Speaking on Europe 1 [radio station] on Saturday [1 January], PS spokesman Jean Glavany said that he "appreciated" that Mitterrand had "pointed to the key problem in French society -- unemployment -- which undermines and ruins everything." "The fact that the president of the Republic said that our society could no longer sustain this evil (...) is, in my opinion, his responsibility as the guarantor of national unity," he added. A long-time advocate of this concept, Jean Popperen was happy to see that Mitterrand adopted it as his own. "The development of the situation necessitates this objective," the former Socialist minister explained, "for otherwise, we are in for serious social splits (...)." This objective must now be implemented: It is the responsibility of the whole social movement. Speaking on France-Inter [radio station] on Monday, 3 January, Laurent Fabius also expressed "the hope that the government and the business world will follow up this concept." Officials from the Right had shown little enthusiasm on this as recently as 31 December. Bruno Megret, the number two man of the National Front, blamed the chief of state for "surfing on the wave of events." "With Mr. Mitterrand, politics no longer means action, rather incantation and good intentions" he said, adding that "France is now in danger." Yves Galand, chairman of the Radical Party, said that "calling for a new social pact would sound more credible if Francois Mitterrand's socialism had not sharpened inequalities." He added that "the president would be better qualified to moralize if his seven years in office had not been marked with `affairs.'"
