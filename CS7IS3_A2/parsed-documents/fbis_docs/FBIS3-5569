The board demanded disciplinary actions or warning against the public officials involved. A board official said his board made a budgetary inspection of the Economic Planning Board and 59 other government offices for five days beginning last Dec. 20. "The check showed a number of offices squandered unused budgets in the year-end period or used them for purposes other than they were intended for," he said. The Health and Social Affairs Ministry, for instance, obtained 174 million won for use in distoma programs reasoning the money was needed in treating distoma patients, the number of whom it estimated at 50,000 in 1993. The Ministry gave the estimate despite the fact that those stricken by distoma numbered no more than 7,900 to 14,000 a year in the 1990-92 period. The ministry used only 31 million won in distoma programs and diverted the remaining 143 million won to other purposes such as staffs' welfare programs. In another incident, the Pusan police agency wasted 30 million won by purchasing additional color films although there was a sufficient stock of them, he said. The official said unused budgetary funds were believed to reach 1189.6 billion won in 1993.
