Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) took the microphone and voiced concern at the power structures' vigorous preparation for the May Day holiday. A multitude of crimes are committed in the capital every day, God knows what kind of "guests" visit it, yet the law enforcement organs are not very worried about all this, the deputy noted, but as soon as the day commemorating spring and labor draws near they begin rehearsing operations using clubs and gas in the Luzhniki stadium.... After a brief exchange between the deputy and the presidium, it was decided that the May Day preparations will be discussed at a session soon. But what in fact were the deputies worried about? It has come to light from several sources that two Taman Division regiments -- the 1st and 15th Motorized Rifle Regiments -- are getting ready for May Day with armored personnel carriers. Blackmail and threats are being employed against officers who are not in favor of sending the regiments into the city. It is being said that the parachute regiment has been transferred from Tula to Khimki. Part of a spetsnaz regiment from Bryansk, allegedly formed from hired criminal elements, has gone to the Sofrinskaya Brigade for training. A communications brigade has been transferred from Sokolniki to another location and has been replaced in Sokolniki by a separate battalion of airborne assault troops directly subordinate to the defense minister. The 901st Personal Ministerial Spetsnaz Battalion has been stationed in Kubinka. The regiments of the Pskov, Tula, and Ryazan Divisions have been virtually disarmed but each of them has one battalion which is being maintained on combat alert condition 1. There is information that Moscow Mayor Luzhkov is almost personally involved in the formation of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] subunits. Former OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] members, militia men, and Afghan war veterans are being recruited to them. They are being promised enormous pay and apartments in Moscow. The Moscow spetsnaz subunits are being urgently reformed into rapid reaction detachments. State of emergency headquarters are being set up under all Rayon Internal Affairs Departments in Moscow. In addition, specific means of influence on people are being made ready: These include far from "harmless" types of gas, such as "cheremukha" [tear gas], and noise-making devices capable of causing panic and rendering a crowd uncontrolable. Hired provocateurs are being trained to fire on OMON units [dlya ognevogo porazheniya omontsev] during the mass events. I would like the authorities to tell us what all these preparations betoken or else deny the facts that I have cited.
