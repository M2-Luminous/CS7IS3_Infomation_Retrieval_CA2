It consists of 40 men specialized in military intelligence operations, and is based in Germany. Thierry Belfroid's report unveils the secrecy that surrounds the existence of these men, whose company will be disbanded in June. [Begin Belfroid recording] If a major conflict had taken place, the Army's special reconaissance teams certainly would have played one of the most dangerous roles. Indeed, the four-person teams would have parachuted right into the middle of the enemy's positions for reconnaissance and sabotage missions, without any help from the outside and at distances exceeding 150 km from any allied base. That is why these volunteers over the past 30 years accepted the very difficult training regimen. The CSR have been trained for every possible situation and have engaged in the most physically demanding sports. The members of the CSR company prepared for every possible scenario, making them seem like "Rambo men," although they do not like this expression. After 30 years of hard and secret living, the CSR have never been used for a real mission. In June 1994, they will be disbanded. A page of Cold War history thus will be turned. [end recording]
