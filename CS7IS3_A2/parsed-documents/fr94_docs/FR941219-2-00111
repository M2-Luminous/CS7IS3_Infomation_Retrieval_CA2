(c) the Plan will pay no expenses associated with the sale. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan that was established January 1, 1974. The Plan has 13 participants, and as of December 31, 1993, the Plan's total assets were $755,525.96. The sponsor of the Plan is Clarendon Family Practice, PA (the Employer), which is a South Carolina subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in family practice medicine. The Plan's trustee is Dr. Coker who is also the sole shareholder of the Employer. 2. On May 18, 1982, the Plan purchased the Land for $41,700 from Marian K. Thames, an unrelated third party in a one-time cash transaction. The applicant represents that at the time of initial acquisition, the Land represented 19.9% of the Plan's total assets. The Land consists of 8.34 acres of vacant land and is located adjacent to other property owned by Dr. Coker, individually. The applicant represents that since 1982 the Land has been rented for approximately $400 a year to W. D. Harrington, a neighboring farmer who is unrelated to the Plan and the Employer, as grazing land for animals. The aggregate rental income received by the Plan for the period 1982&hyph;1994 is $5,200. It is represented that the Land has not been used by a party in interest since it was originally acquired by the Plan. Furthermore, the Land is not encumbered by any debt. 3. Dr. Coker in his trustee capacity, upon the advise of a certain certified public accountant, made the original decision to acquire the Land as a long-term Plan investment. 8 With respect to the Land, the aggregate real estate taxes for the period 1983&hyph;1993 were $153.45. In this regard, the original acquisition cost (the Original Acquisition Cost) to the Plan for the Land is $36,653.45. The Original Acquisition Cost was determined as follows $41,700 (original purchase price) + $153.45 (aggregate real estate taxes) ^ $5,200 (aggregate rental income) = $36,653.45. 8 The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the Plan's acquisition and holding of the Land violated any provision of part 4 of title I of the Act. 4. The Land was appraised on February 11, 1994 (the Appraisal) by W. Burke Watson, Jr., an independent real estate appraiser certified in the State of South Carolina (Mr. Watson). Mr. Watson relied on the direct sales comparison method and estimated that as of February 11, 1994, the fair market value of the Land was $12,500. On July 28, 1994, in an update to the Appraisal, Mr. Burke stated that adjacency of the Land to other property owned by Dr. Coker merits a premium (the Premium) above the fair market value of approximately $500 per acre, which yields a new purchase price of $17,680 to Dr. Coker in this transaction.
