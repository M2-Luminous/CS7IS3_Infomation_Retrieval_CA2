Clearly, the political effects of such actions tend to be carefully weighed, there cannot be any coincidences here. The first striking thing is that Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS], and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev are out of Moscow, and we do not have an ambassador in Washington. There is another thing, however, that matters much more. The exposure of a spy has coincided with Boris Yeltsin's new Bosnian initiative. Some two days ago he proposed that the United States, Britain, France, and Germany hold a summit in a European capital to sign a peace settlement plan for Bosnia. Holding such a summit at Russia's request and, moreover, signing a peace plan would be inconvenient for Western leaders at this stage. The scandal over Ames' arrest removes the Russian initiative from the agenda and brings its publicity effect to naught. The incident with the shooting on a Swedish UN convoy outside the Muslim enclave of Vitez, after which the command of the UN forces in Bosnia immediately asked NATO for air protection, speaks in favor of this theory. A provocation? Maybe. But no one will bother to find out the truth. Moscow itself is to blame to some extent for such a turn of events: Too loudly has it celebrated its diplomatic success. Meanwhile, the success is far from evident. Bringing Sarajevo under UN control means that the Muslims must be disarmed to a level corresponding to that of the Serbs. The Russian partners have so far not coped with the task. The spy scandal can also mark an end to the discussion on tightening Russia's foreign policy doctrine. The arrest of an agent is an irrefutable argument for the Americans. Not to speak of the huge fees paid to Ames, which would knock out on the spot any advocate of extensive assistance to Russia. As soon as the FBI starts estimating the damage done to America by Ames, the old outcry -- "the Russians cannot be trusted" -- will be revived to a new intensity. But what has actually happened? Intelligence services all over the world operate against each other, and this does not harm bilateral relations in any way. For instance, the exposure of an Israeli spy, Pollard, has not affected the American-Israeli partnership. What appears to be a somewhat promising sign is the fact that the Russian intelligence service, although it would not comment on the Ames case, does not pretend it has nothing to do with him, as has often been the case previously. We do not know whether an American spy is presently serving a sentence in Russia. If one is, the matter could be straightened out to the full satisfaction of both sides by carrying out a classical exchange. To do so, however, we will have to wait for a trial to establish Ames' guilt.
