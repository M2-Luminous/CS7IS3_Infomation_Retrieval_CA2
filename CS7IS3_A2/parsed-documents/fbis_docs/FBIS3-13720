Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee, said US envoy Dennis Ross had made the suggestion in a telephone call to 'Arafat. 'Arafat has called for an "urgent" meeting of PLO leaders to take stock of the situation after intense diplomatic activity this past week. The United States has been trying to persuade the PLO to resume talks with Israel on implementing the historic accord on limited Palestinian autonomy they signed in Washington last September 13. The PLO broke off negotiations after a Jewish settler gunned down some 30 Muslim worshippers at prayer in the West Bank town of Hebron on February 25. 'Arafat on Thursday also received messages from the Russian and French governments, spoke by telephone with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and met with Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Terje Larsen. Ghawshah stressed that the PLO was sticking to its demand for "the adoption and application of a (United Nations) resolution guaranteeing international protection" for Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLO leadership reiterated its conviction that Jewish settlers should be removed from Hebron and that any renewed negotiations focus on the status of Jewish settlements in the territories. "Our people can no longer trust American promises and will never agree to continued negotiations in the present situation," Ghawshah said. But he added that the PLO would draft its official position following a UN Security Council meeting scheduled for Friday. Ghawshah cited a Norwegian proposal under which joint Israeli- Palestinian patrols, supervised by international observers, would ensure security for the Palestinians. But he said the idea had been turned down by Israel, which would only accept the presence of observers from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
