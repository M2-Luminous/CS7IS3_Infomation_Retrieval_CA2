The Communist Party of India [CPI], shocked by the defection of two of its four legislators in Uttar Pradesh on Friday last, has initiated a new political exercise to protect the party from any further damage. Last week's developments were indicative of the uneasiness prevailing in Communist circles for quite some time over their political alliance in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh]. While the national party leadership sided with the Janata Dal in the last elections the state CPI leaders felt a better choice would have been the Samajwadi Party of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had shown "greater stamina to fight the fascist forces represented by the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)." The party State executive which is meeting here on Wednesday to take a fresh look at the latest developments is likely to discuss the issue in detail. Some senior CPI leaders have even questioned the bonafides of the Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, as a person wedded to the ideal of secularism. It was Mr. Singh himself who had allowed the BJP president, Mr. Lal Krishna Advania, to take out his `Rathyatra'in 1989 that ultimately resulted in spreading communalism to a number of States. As against this Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav had stood firm and ordered firing on `kar sewaks' when they tried to storm the disputed structure at Ayodhya on October 31 and November 2, 1989. The State unit of the party is expected to drive home its point more effectively on this political question and also to convince the national leadership of the efficacy of their line. However, the recent organisational demoralisation in the CPI does not seem to be influenced by ideological factors. The emergence of the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine in the last elections, mainly because of voting patterns influenced by caste lines, unnerved even hardened workers as caste loyalty proved stronger than ideological considerations. Extending support to the Samajwadi Party may thus become crucial for the CPI, otherwise its influence might be further eroded in pockets where it had succeeded in making some base during the past several decades. The veteran Communist leader, Dr. Z.A. Ahmed, has meanwhile denied that he had resigned from the CPI and joined the Samajwadi Party. His name was among the five U.P. CPI leaders mentioned in a press release distributed by Mr. Mitrasen Yadav, MLA [member of Legistaive Assembly], which informed that they had deserted the communist organisation. Dr. Ahmed has, however, added that Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, was the best person to lead the fight against fascist forces in U.P. He pleaded for a broader base of secular forces to continue this fight against fascism. The CPI MLA, Mr. Udal, said the decisions taken by Mr. Mitrasen Yadav and Mr. Ramchandra Bux Singh to resign from the CPI and join the Samajwadi Party were their individual decisions and these would not affect the affairs in the organisations. Desertions by the two legislators were their individual attempts for adjustments with power and had no ideological basis, he added.
