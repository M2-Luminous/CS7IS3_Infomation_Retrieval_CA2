The dark potential of aggressive U.S. action is countered with suggestions that countries in the Asia-Pacific region must remain committed to free trade, accelerate trade liberalization, and draw the U.S. back into the so-called "open regionalism". The Asia-Pacific Economics Group -- which includes Australian National University Professors Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale as principals and other economists from around the region -- criticizes the current thrust of U.S. trade policy but maintains that America cannot be isolated and ignored by countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The latest Asia Pacific Profiles -- published yesterday by the Asia-Pacific Economics Group in conjunction with Ernst and Young -- paints a picture of continued growth in East Asia in 1994. Among the majors, the profiles suggest Japan will return to growth, the boom conditions in China will ease slightly, Korea's growth rate will increase marginally, and Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesian, and Malaysia will generally match existing growth rates. In an extensive discussion of the troubled trade policy environment, the economists encourage countries in the region to further liberalize trade and effectively remove the incentive for unilateral U.S. action. "What the Western Pacific can reasonably demand from the United States is genuine commitment to the rules and spirit of the multilateral system, and consultation within APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] on proposed departures from them," the latest Profiles says. "The withdrawal of most-favoured-nation treatment (by the U.S.) from one country (China) is a threat to the multilateral system as well as to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation: "The same can be said of unilateral punitive action (by the U.S. against Japan) under Super 301. There would be no neat containment of the consequences of such action to U.S. bilateral relations with particular countries. It would bring havoc and the dogs of war to the whole region." Against such a disturbing backdrop, Professor Garnaut and Professor Drysdale argue that countries in the region should accelerate trade liberalization plans -- even to the point of allowing the U.S. to "free ride" and gain benefits while not opening its own market further. The economists flag their concern at the sudden reversal of fortunes in the trade arena after the "brilliant trade policy triple play" which saw the NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] pass Congress and a successful APEC leaders meeting in Seattle in November and a conclusion to the Uruguay Round in December. "And now, four months after Seattle, it seems that the two sides of the Pacific, lying in the same bed of commitment to trade liberalization and free trade, have discovered that they have different dreams." Professor Garnaut and Professor Drysdale attribute part of this scenario to the lag in perceptions across the Pacific that the economic center of gravity has moved west to East Asia. "Americans underestimate the corrosion of their overwhelming power, and their capacity to lead by fiat. East Asians underestimate the expansion of their influence on the international system, and their responsibility for systemic leadership."
