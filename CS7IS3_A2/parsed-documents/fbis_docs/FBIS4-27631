The five bilateral agreements signed in various fields are vital as they will pave the way to enhance two-way cooperation. This is all the more significant as the breakaway Soviet Union state only achieved independence three years ago. Therefore, there is much the Central Asian nation can learn from Malaysia. As can be seen from the deteriorating situation in Russia, the transition towards a market-based economy is not all that easy. It is important that the right economic policies and development strategies are in place. To this end, Malaysia is ready to offer its expertise wherever it is possible in the spirit of South-South cooperation. With a population of 4.2 million people, Turkmenistan is rich in oil and gas reserves, minerals, cotton, and chemical properties. This provides excellent prospects for the development of downstream activities -- an area where Malaysia has excelled in. The national oil corporation Petronas can look into tapping the oil and gas reserves besides looking to develop petrochemicals in Turkmenistan. Other areas for potential joint ventures include hotel construction, resort facilities, and tourism. But the former Soviet state has to realize that foreign investments do not flow into a country automatically. It must work towards creating a conducive investment climate. Red tape must be cut to a minimum. Bureaucracy has been a major obstacle for cross-border investments. This is often the case in developing countries. So far, Turkmenistan's legislation which provides for foreign investments is a step in the right direction. Its free economic zones is yet another indicator that its investment strategy is on the right track. Infrastructure facilities have to be well in place, otherwise foreigners will be reluctant to invest. It also has to realize that competition for the foreign investment dollar is getting more intense. Also, its private sector has yet to fully develop its potential. There is much it can learn from Malaysia's success in privatization. It is important that the development of private enterprises is accompanied by social benefits. Otherwise a wide cross section of the people will never taste the fruits of economic development and might sow the seeds of discontent. Malaysia is ready to offer training aid under the Malaysia technical cooperation program in administration, banking, and other fields. It has trained officers under this program from numerous other developing nations. It forms part of Malaysia's commitment towards transferring skills to South countries. Turkmenistan's decision to establish an embassy in Malaysia marks a major step in building a concrete bridge towards enhancing two-way contacts at the highest level. This would go a long way in bringing bilateral links to a more significant level. Niyazov's visit, which comprises a high-powered delegation, indicates the importance the country places in its relationship with Malaysia. The visit has also opened a new chapter in what is potentially a mutually beneficial and long-lasting relationship between Malaysia and Turkmenistan.
