Instructions to Russian Cleaners"] [Text] Tallinn--Aleksey Zybin is a communications engineer and hereditary citizen of the Republic of Estonia. He is well known with us as a prominent figure of the Russian civil rights movement. He was a member of the last Supreme Soviet of Estonia. Residents of Tallinn recently elected him to the city assembly, where he is head of the faction of deputies of the Russian Revel slate. He is interviewed by Lembit Annus, our own correspondent in the Republic of Estonia. [Annus] Aleksey Alekseyevich, what brought about the need for the creation of the Russian community of Estonia? [Zybin] The purpose of our organization was the preservation and development of Russian spirituality, cultural distinctiveness, and national-historical memory. It emerged as the Russian people's response to the challenge of the times. Our organization is the youngest in the republic, incidentally. Its "chronology" dates from 17 April of this year. At that time 500 delegates of the Russian Assembly adopted in Tallinn a decision on the formation of a Russian community, elected its duma and approved a program and bylaws. But we are not a Russian political party, merely a civil rights organization of Russian people. Russians, the bulk of whom do not have Estonian citizenship, do not, according to the Constitution, have the right to form political parties. They availed themselves, therefore, of the opportunity to create a social and cultural organization. Unfortunately, the government has still not made up its mind to register our community, and the president, to invite its representatives to the roundtable discussing the problems of Russians in Estonia. Of course, it would be flagrant deception to declare that the community unites in a single organization all 600,000 non-Estonians. But no one can any longer deny the fact that it is the mass of Russians that constitutes the social base of our organization. And this means that the future in the republic is on the side of the community. There is in Estonia today no other organization like ours, whose principal goal is the creation of an integral practicable and effective system of moral, spiritual, and material mutual assistance for all members of its community. It is perfectly explicable, therefore, that it is gaining ever-increasing support from Russians living in Estonia. [Annus] You refer also, most likely, to the results of the October elections to the local government assemblies? [Zybin] Quite right. Surely it is a success when 10 deputies were elected to the Tallinn City Assembly on the Russian Revel slate. This was possible because the community was able to get the better of those who had fervently urged a boycott of the local elections. On account of the boycott, not a single Russian deputy was elected to the city council in many constituencies at that time. And the Russians themselves were the losers because of this. For this reason the people supported us this time. Approximately 20,000 Tallinn residents voted at the elections this time for the Russian deputies of our slate. Mainly from the most unprotected strata of the population. And we ourselves are today the poorest faction of deputies in the Tallinn City Assembly. For example, the Russian community spent on the entire campaign only 3,300 Estonian krona. Six hundred krona went on a one-time lease of the Russian Cultural Center in Tallinn alone. Simple arithmetic shows that each of our deputy's mandates "costs" 330 krona. No other faction of deputies in the Tallinn City Assembly has such "cheap" seats, incidentally. I mention this not from pride but from pain. Poor Russian deputies will today have to defend their equally poor electorate. It is counting on us and firmly believes that we will be able if only in some respects to alleviate its life in our cruel times. [Annus] Aleksey Alekseyevich, what is your attitude toward the assertion of Lennart Meri, president of Estonia, who in his recent interview with the journal DER SPIEGEL said that Estonia is treating "the minority better than Germany is treating the Turks"? [Zybin] I do not know how Germany treats the Turks, but that there is everywhere in Estonia bad treatment of Russians I, as a Russian, have experienced for myself repeatedly. And the language, citizenship, and foreigners laws show this better than a thousand words. So various political statements in the press are one thing; the policy being pursued currently by the ruling national-radical forces is quite another. It is for this reason that the Russian community is endeavoring to help our people in today's Estonia. [Annus] You have touched on the most painful problem of the life of Russians in Estonia today--the question of the official language. What do you think--do Russians need to know Estonian? [Zybin] Everyone should unequivocally know Estonian. It is bad merely that Estonian is being pinned on Russians forcibly, with a stick. What is to be gained today, pray, from the whole of Narva today learning Estonian by rote? There is no one in everyday life to talk to in Estonian. I simply cannot understand either why knowledge of Estonian is now an obligatory requirement of a cleaner, even. What, will she converse in the official language with a duster? It is surely more important that the floor be washed clean. Why does not Estonia take the Finnish route? Recognize as the official languages both Estonian and Russian. At least all the tension in our society would then be lifted. In other words, the Hippocratic precept: "Do no harm," should be introduced immediately in Estonian language policy. [Annus] Imagine for a moment that you are president of Estonia. What would you do in your new capacity first and foremost? [Zybin] I would first of all adopt all measures to achieve an end to the inter-nation hostility at the everyday level. To ensure that Estonians see in the Russians living in the republic the same kind of people as themselves. Not their enemies, who must necessarily be gotten rid of. Second, I would make every effort and use all my presidential possibilities to ensure that Estonian industry once again begin to operate at full power and that the countryside be revitalized. I would necessarily erect legislative barriers in the way of the conversion of tiny Estonia into a dumping ground for unserviceable overseas products and all kinds of industrial trash. In other words, I would create for all Estonian landsmen normal conditions for earning some money for a decent human life. Without normal production, the state cannot exist. There can otherwise be no question of independence. And, third, I would come to an arrangement with the president of Russia concerning the civilized admittance of the Russian people who have declared a desire to move to their primordial homeland. You cannot live your whole life nursing a grievance. No good will come of this, and civil peace and harmony in Estonia even less.
