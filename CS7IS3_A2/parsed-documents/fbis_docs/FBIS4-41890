This is a legal act of unprecedented content which essentially deprives the vast majority of ethnic Russians permanently resident in the country of any realistic possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship. "The law contains elements of ethnic discrimination and enshrines a principle rejected by international experts -- quotas for the naturalization of permanent residents of Latvia, which in general terms will not begin until the year 2000," Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department, told ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. "This means that on the threshold of the 21st century, a state which considers itself democratic and governed by the rule of law has taken another step aimed at legal discrimination against hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of the republic and the formation of a multiethnic state." The diplomat believes that official Riga embarked on this path long before the adoption of the present law. Immediately after acquiring independence it stripped non-indigenous residents of citizenship and began to discriminate specifically against them in the political, social, economic, and other spheres. To this end a whole series of state decisions has been adopted. They include the law on elections to the central and local organs of power, the law on state service, the law on languages, the law on election campaigning, and additions to the laws on the entry and residence of foreigners and on the police which seriously worsen the situation of hundreds of thousands of non-Latvian residents. It goes without saying that this step by the Latvian authorities did not go unnoticed elsewhere, especially not in Russia. The day after the vote, statements condemning Riga's actions were issued by the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry and other state organs and public organizations and on Friday the Federation Council appealed to the parliaments of the CSCE member states. The deputies' appeal notes, among other things, that the law was adopted "despite the many protests of the international community and regardless of the recommendations of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number of international experts." Thus, the senators stress, the Latvian authorities have "flouted public standards in the human rights sphere." Moscow believes that the governments and public of the European countries must prevent Latvia's slide toward aggressive nationalism and the emergence of a center of tension in the Baltic region. For its part Russia will approach the further development of relations with Latvia in the light of the situation developing in Latvia over the law on citizenship.
