This was declared at a news-conference in Almaty on Monday by Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. In his opinion, the main accord -- a charter on democratic partnership between Kazakhstan and U.S. -- puts bilateral relations on a new level in terms of quality. It contains guarantees of the republic's security from U.S. and Kazakhstan's participation in multilateral cooperation within NATO's program "Partnership for Peace." Nazarbayev stressed that the interests of Russia had been taken into account in the bilateral treaty on the non-proliferation of missile technologies, signed not only by American and Kazakh representatives but also by Yuriy Koptev, the Russian Aero-Space Agency's Director General. The president reported that his country claimed 10 percent of the $12 Bn [billion] package, provided by U.S. to compensate for the highly enriched uranium from the SS-18 missiles to be pulled out of the republic for destruction. In his words, Kazakhstan does not seek strategic missiles control. He noted that Bill Clinton had announced that aid to Kazakhstan would be increased a few times over. $311 Mn [million] have been allocated on top of the $85 Mn, appropriated for silos dismantlement assistance. Nazarbayev refuted rumors that while in U.S. he had disapproved western aid to Russia. He said "stakes should be made not on persons but on democratic and economic reforms in Russia," reforms that no one will manage to turn back. He said that since Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr Shokhin were still in the Russian cabinet, it could not be regarded as conservative. In his opinion, Yegor Gaydar and other reformists could influence and help reforms in Russian parliament.
