Representatives from the Society of Wildlife and Nature, the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation and the Green Consumers' Foundation are expected to detail Taiwan's efforts to end its illegal trade in endangered species parts and products during the CITES meeting open only to non-government organizations (NGO). The NGO meeting gives non-CITES members an opportunity to explain their wildlife conservation efforts to CITES delegates. The meeting is sponsored by the British Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), according to beautiful Taiwan Foundation Chairman Ted Ting. As of Saturday, representatives from 10 NGO's had applied to speak during the meeting. Meanwhile, officials from the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation and the Green Consumers' Foundation announced in Jerusalem earlier this week that they will join an Asian region CITES task force to combat illegal trade in wildlife products, Ting said. Israel, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and Uzbekistan have all expressed interest in joining the task force, Ting added.
