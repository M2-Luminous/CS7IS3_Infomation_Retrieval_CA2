"We do not have any facts about the existence of concentration camps in Tajikistan", Liviu Botha, head of the UN mission in Tajikistan, told reporters on Wednesday commenting on corresponding Western mass media reports which claimed that political prisoners are being kept in three major camps on Tajik territory. However, Botha confirmed that he had received the information and added that it needs to be thoroughly checked. He stressed that the Tajik Government agreed to render any necessary assistance to the UN mission in inspecting the mentioned areas were the camps are allegedly situated. Tajik Parliament Speaker Imamali Rakhmonov categorically denied in an interview to TASS the alleged existence in the country of concentration camps and of political prisoners. One of the leaders of the Security Ministry qualified the reports as "dirty insinuations". The news also caused open confusion among foreign and Russian correspondents accredited in Tajikistan who said they had heard nothing about any concentration camps.
