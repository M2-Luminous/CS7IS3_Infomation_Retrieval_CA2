The Blitz [chongyokchok] Development of Fast-Breeding Reactors According to the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC]'s June 1992 final decision on its plan for atomic energy research and development, the ROK is supposed to complete the development of positive reactors [silchungno], which is the third stage of fast-breeding reactor development, 19 years ahead of Japan, which has now started to operate prototype reactors [wonhyongno]. In order to realize this plan, the ROK is using the same blitz mosaic method of synthesizing various countries' technologies that is used to develop nuclear weapons. The ambition of ROK rulers to develop fast-breeding reactors began in the eighties. According to a report on the proliferation of mass-killing weapons which is a secret document of the Russian bureau of foreign intelligence, the ROK authorities agreed early in 1984 with a European country that possessed the most advanced technology in developing fast-breeding reactors, to introduce its fast-breeding reactors and thus began to introduce core technologies, designs, and experimental reactor facilities [silhomno solbidul]. The Institute of Atomic Energy Research thus secretly developed an experimental reactor, whose diameter was 1 meter, at the end of the eighties, and has used it in the various technological experiments required in the development of prototype and positive reactors. In the nineties, the Chongwadae [presidential offices] ruling group began to develop the prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan. On 25 May 1990, the government authorities and Japan signed an agreement on cooperation in the atomic energy field, and agreed to promote technological exchanges and joint research on atomic energy. In an ROK-Japan conference on atomic energy held on 9 November 1990, they conspired [moui] to jointly promote the development of next-generation reactors. In an exclusive secret meeting between Kim Yong-sam and Hosokawa in Kyongju on 6 November 1993, they even secretly signed an agreement on ROK-Japan joint promotion to develop nuclear weapons in return for calling off Japan's repayment for its past crimes. When they began to suddenly [chongyokchoguro] introduce technology and experience for the development of prototype reactors from Japan, the government authorities decided to invest about 2 trillion won in atomic energy research and development, such as the development of a fast-breeding reactor. They began to push ahead with the development of a prototype reactor in 1992, mobilizing all experts concerned with [words indistinct]. Regarding this, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN dated 29 July 1992 reported: the ROK has already started to develop fast-breeding reactors, hastening its mid- and long-term plans. According to the ROK experts on nuclear development, the design of a prototype fast-breeding reactor was turned over to Korea Heavy Industries by the Institute of Atomic Energy Research, and they have not only started to produce facilities of the prototype reactor but also completed a basic study on positive reactors, drafted a conceptional design, and set aside budgeting for it, with an investment of 118.3 billion won. Today, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is busy seeking justification from the international community regarding the lawfulness of the fast-breeding reactor development. In October 1993, the Kim Yong-sam group held an international symposium on next-generation reactors in Seoul and even had some quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] promise to cooperate in the ROK plan to develop next-generation reactors. At that time, in a public notice issued in a news conference in Seoul, Greenpeace exposed and denounced that, far from discussing scientific and technological problems, this symposium was a meeting to encourage construction for producing plutonium in the ROK, as well as an insidious meeting that would bring the danger of nuclear war closer to East Asia. 2. The Ulterior Motive Behind the Development of the Fast-Breeding Reactor Throughout the world, the fast-breeding reactor is acknowledged as lacking economic advantages and safety. For this reason, the countries developing it either suspended its operation or closed it down--the United States in 1977, France seven years after its initiation of operations, and Britain in 1994. Germany gave up operating a test reactor which it had built. (Frank Hanabby), a British nuclear physicist, who visited Japan recently, likened the Monju, the Japanese reactor for producing high-purity plutonium which was put into operation sometime ago, to a nuclear explosion waiting to happen. Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are desperately engaged in the development of a fast-breeding reactor. This is directly connected with their ambition to develop nuclear weapons. We are making this statement based on the following grounds: First, if the South Korean authorities develop the fast-breeding reactor, they can multiply and produce a large quantity of plutonium for the production of nuclear bombs. The December 1991 issue of MAL magazine stated that since the fast-breeding reactor is a device justifying the massive stockpile and production of plutonium, which is the raw material for nuclear weapons, the country operating it should have little difficulty in producing nuclear weapons. The South Korean ruling group is attempting to secure a large quantity of plutonium through the development of the fast-breeding reactor. Second, the development of the fast-breeding reactor provides a pretext justifying the purchase of plutonium from a foreign country. Because the fast-breeding reactor is a reactor which feeds on plutonium, if the fast-breeding reactor is developed, South Korea can massively and legitimately import plutonium and the dioxide of highly-enriched uranium, which the authorities have secretly been importing from Britain. (Kim Chi-o), atomic energy policy officer of the Ministry of Science and Technology, has stated that plutonium, the raw nuclear material that is to be used in the fast-breeding reactor, will be imported from a foreign country. Third, the fast-breeding reactor must be equipped with reprocessing facilities. WOLGAN CHOSON, April 1990 issue, noted that the introduction of the fast-breeding reactor is a prerequisite to the construction of a reprocessing plant, adding that since the introduction of the fast-breeding reactor is almost certain, the construction of a reprocessing plant is a question of time. Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the National Assembly Foreign and Unification Affairs Committee, openly calling for a review of the North-South agreements of 1991, asserting, ``We cannot continue depending on another country for nuclear fuel.'' This clearly illustrates how frenziedly the Kim Yong-sam ring is attempting to provide reprocessing facilities with the development of the fast- breeding reactor. Fourth, the development of the fast-breeding reactor is in itself a process to develop a nuclear bomb. Technologically, the theory of designing the fast-breeding reactor and that of designing the nuclear bomb are the same. Therefore, the technology for the development of the fast-breeding reactor means in many respects the transfer of the technology for the development of a nuclear bomb. Furthermore, nuclear physicists say that the high-purity plutonium obtained from the fast-breeding reactor can be used for the production of a nuclear bomb with the appropriate critical mass [imgye chillyang]. The stern reality clearly proves that the traitorous ruling group in the South scrapped the joint declaration on denuclearization on the Korean peninsula agreed upon between the North and the South and that it is persistently engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. Their attempt to extract plutonium by developing the fast-breeding reactor, the monster called a time-bomb, which is prone to horrible accidents, and to make criminal nuclear weapons that will destroy the entire nation, is an unpardonable antinational crime. The persons in authority should not only abolish the heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor but suspend the development of the fast-breeding reactor immediately. The international reactionary forces, including Japan, should stop acts of conspiring with the Kim Yong-sam ring in its development of the fast-breeding reactor directly connected with the development of nuclear bombs. Our SKNDF and patriotic masses will certainly check and frustrate the Kim Yong-sam ring's development of the fast-breeding reactor for nuclear armament and its maneuvers to secure a large quantity of plutonium. We express the hope that the world's fair opinion will wage vigorous activities to trace to the end and stop the South Korean rulers' maneuvers to develop the fast-breeding reactor and nuclear weapons.
