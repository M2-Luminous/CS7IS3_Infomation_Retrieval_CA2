The porters fled three days ago to the Thai border through the jungle from Mong Kyawt, the base north of Piang Luang recaptured a week ago by Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army Forces. One of the porters, a Burmese construction worker from Rangoon, said he had been captured in the street in Keng Tung two months earlier and was then trucked with 80 others to work for the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (Slorc) Battalion 245 at Mong Kyawt. He said Battalion 245 alone was using about 150 porters. An estimated 10 battalions have been deployed by the Slorc in the Mong Kyawt area. Two of the porters, Shan farmers, had been captured only a week previously from their homes in Mong Hsat, 100 km northeast of Mong Kyawt. They said new groups of porters were being trucked in from different parts of Shan State. The porters were made to carry heavy loads of ammunition and rice for the soldiers. They described how soldiers beat those unable to carry on walking. "Four porters in my group died of diarrhea," said one porter. "I thought I would die if I did not escape." The porters had run away at night. Their clothes were ragged and they had cuts and sores from running through the jungle. [passage omitted]
