What is remarkable is not that it took so long, but that any agreement was reached at all. The area which is now known as the Joint Development Area, covering 7,250 square kilometers on the Malaysian-Thai border, has been in the limbo of polite dispute -- by mutual agreement it had been consigned as a no man's land, which kept its economic potential safely out of anyone's reach. All over the world, border disputes cause friction between nations -- sometimes enough to heat up into war, particularly when the area is rich in resources. The recent Gulf War was a classic case. Territorial disputes tend to go on and on because any contending nation would consider it too much of a face down to concede or compromise -- land area is so integral to the definition of national sovereignty that no territory can be given away or even shared. National claims are often highly complex -- invoking history, geography, security, even ancient tradition -- so that disputed areas are left peaceably unsettled at best. The political dimension of border issues often leave them too intractable for easy mediation -- but there is one way out of this impasse. If there is sufficient consensus to subdue politics, a practical formula can be worked out to jointly extract the disputed territory's socio-economic potential and share the gains. Politics, however, has a habit of getting in the way of relations between nations, to the detriment of economic pragmatism. The attainment of the Joint Development Area agreements not only bears testimony to the growing maturity of the Malaysia- Thai relationship; it forms a pointer to a path of least resistance and mutual benefit in the resolution of similar border problems. It is in the nature of claimant countries never to give way for an interim deal until the core contention of territorial sovereignty is resolved. This centrality of sovereignty in border disputes is why even tiny bits of wasteland can turn into a fait accompli for all out war. Thus the ability to set aside sovereignty for the time being is not only a victory of common sense pragmatism over doctrinaire national self-interest. The realization of mutual economic gain also works the other way -- it diminishes the overriding all-or-nothing significance of territorial sovereignty. Most of the region's remaining disputes are over uninhabited little outcrops of land which have come into contention by being at the far limit of marine boundaries. They become sore points only when they offer an economic potential, usually in the form of mineral deposits. Rather ironically, this potential can also offer a first step to an eventual settlement, rather than the pretext for discord. Separating the prompt gains of joint exploitation from the decisive outcome of sovereign ownership is as hard as seeing the wood for the trees. It not only requires clear-sightedness, but trust and self-confidence. In ASEAN, Malaysia and Thailand are perhaps the two who most readily see eye to eye on an emphatic regional economic focus. Trade and economics are increasingly dominating regional security, diplomacy and multilateralism at the expense of political ideology. Perceiving and acting on, the difference between winning the spoils and sharing the fruits is easy enough for the rational person. For nations, however, it can be a big step. Malaysia and Thailand have taken that step.
