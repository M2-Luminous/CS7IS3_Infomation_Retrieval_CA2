In accordance with Army reform, they will be allowed to comprise only 1,300 lauchers, all with single warheads, by the year 2005. At present fourth-generation strategic missiles are used for alert duty in the Russian Army. Will there be fifth-generation missiles? What will the missile of the 21st century be like? Our country's military scientists have carried out a study of possible scenarios of strategic nuclear forces' operations and came to the conclusion that the missile of the 21st century will be the RS-12M Topol ballistic missile, or SS-25 as it is known in the West. It is produced in Votkinsk [Udmurtia]. The autonomous launcher weighs 80 tonnes, the weight of the nose section is one tonne. The Topol has been used for alert duty since 1985. [Yu. Fedin, commander of autonomous launch installation, identified by caption, against the backdrop of an SS-25 missile] Tests of this hardware have been carried out. I have been involved in testing this hardware since 1983. It is very, very reliable. [Krondo] Since 1984 600 combat training launches have been carried out at the Plesetsk test range. In recent years tests have become much more infrequent in the absence of funds. [A. Polukhin, deputy commander of the division's duty forces, identified by caption] It hurts, of course. Elsewhere people are working flat out, so to speak, and they are being fully funded. Meanwhile we have been put on starvation rations. There is no doubt about it, it hurts. [Krondo] How will this reflect on Russia's combat readiness? [Polukhin] Very badly, there is no other way. [Krondo] Since Russia and its allies in the CIS have always had and always will have their own regional and global interests to look after, only the nuclear missile status can ensure the Russian Federation equitable participation in the solution of worldwide and regional problems.
