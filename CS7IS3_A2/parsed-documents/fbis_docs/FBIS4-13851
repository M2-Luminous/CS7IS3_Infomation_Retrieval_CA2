He said that Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbs' atrocities against the Muslims of that country, especially in Gorazde, were the main topics of his discussions with the Croatian parliamentary speaker and the foreign ministers of Albania, Romania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an exclusive interview with our correspondent on the World Forum Foundation, Dr. Velayati said: [Begin Velayati recording] The forum, which was established five years ago, is a nongovernmental international center that usually meets once a year in the month of Tir [22 June-22 July] at Crans-Montana in Switzerland. In some countries, an emergency session is held on request to discuss specific issues between the annual sessions. Therefore, this is a new form of international gathering that is, as I mentioned, a nongovernmental one and is progressing alongside the United Nations and other affiliated organizations. The first session of this kind was held in Davos, Switzerland and the second one was convened in Crans-Montana [as heard]. In other parts of the world, similar organizations are being established.
