[Franco] An atmosphere of freedom reigns in the country. The government has given free rein to the press, which criticizes and does as it pleases because I have always believed that life looses all meaning without freedom and that mankind will be unable to find peace without justice. [Moreno] There is a tug-of-war between the government and Congress over the passing of the economic plan. Is there any risk that Congress may reject this plan? [Franco] I invited the presidents of both chambers of Congress and gave each of them a letter. Governability is not the sole responsibility of the executive branch. It is shared by Congress and the judicial branch. The government is doing its share. Never in contemporary history has a president of the Republic given so much support to a finance minister. Never in contemporary history have we seen a finance minister appear before Congress so many times to debate and discuss matters. His plan may be amended and he may agree with these amendments. We have established a democratic dialogue with Congress through the finance minister. What has Brazil seen so far? It has seen many economic plans implemented without the knowledge of Congress. Plans were implemented overnight without congressmen being able to even voice an opinion. We are now doing the opposite -- the government holds talks, backs off, moves forward. We currently want Congress to express its opinion on the economic program. If it considers it a good plan, then let it pass it. If Congress considers it a bad plan, let it then specify what is the best plan for our country. The vote of congressmen should not be based on political considerations because it is a presidential year and the [finance] minister may or may not run for the presidency. Brazilians are not interested in this. They are interested in whether the program submitted to Congress can curb inflation. [Moreno] Isn't it a contradiction that Congress increased taxes on individuals and not on companies? [Franco] That was really most unfair. It was a relatively insignificant act and yet it affected the political situation. It caused the government's plan to become somewhat -- the expression is popular but to the point -- crippled. It was unfair from a social standpoint. This injustice will have to be compensated during the next congressional stage on the measures the government wants Congress to pass. [Moreno] The workers want an audience with you, Mr. President, to ask you to veto this tax increase. Will you veto it? [Franco] I granted an audience to Mr. Medeiros (Labor Force President Luiz Antonio de Medeiros) to whom I showed the letter I sent to Congress. We discussed that injustice not long ago. If they come to see me, I will have to get the finance minister to examine the consequences of the workers request on the economic program. If he considers they may be improved, we can retrace our steps. Ours is a democratic government and we can either go forward or backwards. But -- and let us be very clear -- changing our ideas will, to a large extent, depend on the finance minister. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the income bracket affected by the tax increase is not that of workers. Workers will not be affected. If workers come to see me they will have to explain which workers have been affected. The low income bracket is not affected. [Moreno] Most of your former ministers failed to vote on the issue. Did this upset you? [Franco] They must have had their reasons. They do not have to explain their reasons to me. My former ministers and former congressional colleagues must explain to the Brazilian public. They may have had some sort of a problem. I cannot believe, after being a minister of this administration for more than 15 months, how a congressman could fail to attend a session in which issues of such importance for the government would be voted on. There must have been some reason. I will not call for explanations. It is up to the public to question these congressmen. [Moreno] Some former ministers, however, are already covertly criticizing your administration. One of them has even said your administration has no face. [Franco] I ask the Brazilian people: How can a minister who worked with the president of the Republic for 15 months and had the president's full support during these 15 months begin to think, after only 30 days, that the government has no face? Has the government lost its face during these 30 days or is the minister losing his face? Criticism must be made clearly, openly. The press permanently states that my administration is weak. In what sense? Does the press want me invert the institutional order? Does it want the president to adopt authoritarian measures? Does it want to see the president govern the country without the Congress, without the judicial branch? What is the administration's weakness? Is being democratic a weakness? As Otavio Mangabeira [former foreign minister from 1926 to 1930] used to say, democracy is a frail plant. Our democracy is still a frail plant. We are obeying the principles of democracy, which we might very well quote here: Without liberty there is no reason to live and without meeting the demands of justice men will never achieve peace. [Moreno] From your tone we can perceive that this criticism affected you most. [Franco] I just ask: What is the government's weakness? The government has an economic plan. It supports its finance minister and has been supporting other ministers. Where is the government's weakness? In the fact of having an earnestly democratic president? Some would like to see the democratic order inverted. Others would like to see the government disrupt the structure of Brazilian parties. Should we disrupt it the way others did here in South America? [Moreno] Perhaps, Mr. President, the idea of a weak government is associated with your precarious support in Congress. So far you have not achieved a solid majority or even a circumstantial majority to approve basic bills. [Franco] That has a certain logic, but I ask: Do political parties have a strong structure? Often we see that political parties have internal problems and some times very strong confrontations. Today Brazilian political parties are fragile. How was the government formed? The nation was paralyzed in amazement and submerged in discouragement and a rebellious feeling. We had to coordinate fragmented forces to form a government. Parties represented in the government turned against the government. In a parliamentary system the cabinet would have fallen as a consequence of the crisis in Congress. Ministers in the government represent political parties. They stopped being named by their political parties as of 15 December, but they were until then. [Moreno] Political parties argue that a group of personal friends from Juiz de Fora [Franco's home town] run the show. [Franco] What group from Juiz de Fora? We have people from Juiz de Fora here, but what power center from Juiz de Fora are they talking about? Such a power center does not exist. On the contrary, the people from Juiz de Fora at the Planalto Palace do not participate in the high-level discussions on the country's problems. Here we discuss problems with Senator Pedro Simon and Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. We used to discuss them with Deputy Antonio Britto and today we talk about them with government leader Luiz Carlos Santos. We operate that way. Or is the criticism moved by the feeling that the president is a man from a country town and, therefore, he cannot govern the country? Is it because a man from the provinces cannot rule the country? Is it that only powerful men can become president? [Moreno] Do you feel the closeness of the presidential election might affect your government? Criticism against you increases as the elections get nearer. [Franco] The time has come for those who criticize the government to present their candidates for the presidency of the Republic. They are all party members. They will have a great opportunity to solve the country's problems. Let us see if they have the courage to face the public. I would like to see them in public squares, at the elections, discussing issues with the public. I hope they will have the courage to face the public, but not as candidates for deputy or senator, I want to see them as presidential candidates. I am very interested to see who will be the candidates for the presidency of the Republic. I want to know about those who continuously say that they know how to solve the country's problems, that national problems are easily solved, and that they are not solved only because the government is weak, because Mr. Itamar Franco is not prepared for the presidency. If they are so wise and so prepared they should not hide behind a candidacy to the Senate or the Chamber of Deputies. I take advantage of the opportunity to call on them to step forward, now is the right time to do it. [Moreno] Will you support any candidate? [Franco] For the time being, the government has no candidate. [Moreno] It has been said that you have two candidates: Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Antonio Britto. [Franco] They are two great names, but I am not saying they will be our candidates. [Moreno] Will you stay out of the succession process? [Franco] I do not know. We will look at the candidates. I need to know who the candidates are. If you are asking if Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a candidate, my answer is: I do not know if he is candidate. He has not yet discussed that with me. He merely sent me a letter to inform me that at this moment he is not thinking about becoming a candidate. I do not know if tomorrow he will decide to be a candidate. [Moreno] Is it true that you are becoming impatient about Cardoso's failure to produce tangible results in his fight against inflation? [Franco] Never before has a finance minister had so much support from the president of the Republic. I am giving him my full support because I believe in his work and in his desire to serve his country. [Moreno] What are you planning to do after completing your term in office? [Franco] I will go back to my life as an ordinary citizen. I do not plan to seek any elective office any more. Many people want me to resign in April so that I will be eligible to run for governor of Minas Gerais State, but I have declined. I will not deny that it has always been my dream to become governor of Minas Gerais. I was unfortunately defeated in the ballot boxes. I did, however, serve several congressional terms for Minas Gerais. I want to become an ordinary citizen again. I have asked God not to let power get to my head. Power is a temporary thing. While in office one may acquire a false notion of power. Your entourage will desert you as soon as you leave office. All I want to be is a voter. [Moreno] Did you get excited about the proposed idea to allow the incumbent president to seek his reelection without having to leave office? [Franco] I do not want to interfere in the constitutional revision process by raising this issue, but I will say that it is not a tradition in Brazil to reelect presidents or governors. [Moreno] What is your opinion about the efforts of your friend [Senate government leader] Pedro Simon in bringing the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] together to support a single candidate? [Franco] I do not see it as an easy undertaking now. It would have been easier before when two forces like the PMDB and PSDB were united. The PSDB branched out of the PMDB. I see it difficult now. But I am not saying they could not get together for the presidential election. All this will depend on the patriotic spirit of each sector. [Late PMDB Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes managed to bring Tancredo Neves' Popular Party together with the PMDB. [Moreno] Have you already been tempted to seek undemocratic solutions? [Franco] I wouldn't say tempted. I have received many letters and petitions urging me to do so. [Moreno] From important sectors of society? [Franco] From various sectors. I have never been tempted to do that because I am a democrat.
