However, Mock also recalled that the crimes of the National Socialists had preceded the forcible resettlement. In Krumov, Prague's Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Austrian journalists that Mock's comments in connection with the awarding of the Charles IV Prize "might burden bilateral relations." "However, the whole affair should not be overestimated either."
