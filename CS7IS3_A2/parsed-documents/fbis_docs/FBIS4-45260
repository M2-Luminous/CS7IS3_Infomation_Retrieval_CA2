The Chilean Government's television channel reported today that Valenzuela was arrested again by police near Valparaiso, the country's main port. Valparaiso is 125 km northwest of Santiago. The criminal paid $5,000 to the prison guards taking him back to prison after he underwent a medical checkup at a Valparaiso hospital. Valenzuela, who was detained on 11 March, allegedly has been involved in a shipment of 40 kg of cocaine to Sweden in 1992, a case in which two other Chileans have been sentenced to a 10-year prison term in Stockholm.
