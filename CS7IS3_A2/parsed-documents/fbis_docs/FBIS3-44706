The Four Characteristics of 1993's Economic Development [Zhou] How would you characterize China's economic development in 1993? [Li] It can be summed up in four main characteristics: 1. It continued its relatively rapid development rate. GNP grew by 13 percent, something not often seen amid the present world economic depression [xiao tiao 4682 2742]. 2. As for reforms, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee erected the basic framework for the construction of a socialist market economy system, thereby providing the reform with a more specific target. 3. Opening to the outside world moved ahead on an unprecedented scale and the utilization of foreign capital rose to another peak. Direct investment by foreign businessmen topped $20 billion, indicating a general optimism about the prospects for the Chinese market. 4. There were some conspicuous contradictions and problems in the process of development, but the party Central Committee and State Council eased these contradictions and laid a foundation for the healthy development of the national economy by adopting the method of boosting macroregulation and control. Reforms Will Take Major Steps in 1994 [Zhou] What will be the overall trend in China's economic development in 1994? [Li] The trend can be characterized in two phrases: 1) Reform will take major steps; and 2) sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic development. So-called "major steps" carry specific references. These major steps will be reflected primarily in a modern corporate system and in reforms in the financial, tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade systems -- all of them oriented toward building a socialist market economic system. The initial proposal from the State Council was a nine economic growth rate for 1994, a little lower than last year, because two consecutive years of high-speed economic growth will have strained various sectors in the national economy, and the "bottlenecks" -- such as we have in the transport and energy sectors -- will have become more severe. In order to sustain economic development, we need to maintain a more relaxed environment [song kuan 2646 1401]. Compared with countries around the world, a nine percent growth rate is still quite fast. "Healthy" [jian kang 0256 1660] can be understood in many different ways, but right now it means primarily structural improvement and raising economic efficiency. Be Active and Cautious in Price Reforms [Zhou] What moves are in store for price reforms in 1994, and how will they affect reforms in other areas? [Li] This year's price reforms will go hand-in-hand with several other reforms. The overall objective is to bring the price system closer to market laws. In the last decade or so, China has taken very great steps in price reforms and has acquired rich experience. Most price adjustments have achieved the desired results: Except for a few commodities vital to the national economy and people's livelihood, prices for 90 percent of all commodities are now market-regulated. Most of the remaining commodities are in infrastructural industry, the prices of which tend to be low to encourage their consumption, thus hindering the development of these industries. Adjustments are in order, but are also more difficult; for example, the petroleum industry will never be able to develop without adjustment, but any adjustment in petroleum prices inevitably affects its products. So we need to adopt a very cautious and gradual approach. As markets in our country have yet to mature, markets are suffering from their inherent spontaneity and blindness. Therefore, at a suitable time there should be state macroregulation and control to make sure that the people's interests are protected. In each of the significant reformist measures, we have taken the endurance of the country, of enterprises, and of the people into full consideration, and so we are upholding an orderly and gradual approach. Too great a step inevitably will affect company costs and people's livelihood. Lessons From the Grain Market Fluctuations Earlier, grain prices fluctuated in some regions. The causes were many. As the state had enough grain on hand and as state grain sales departments functioned as the main channels, the fluctuations leveled off gradually. The grain market fluctuations should be viewed in this way: On the one hand, sufficient grain reserves displayed the state's macroregulatory and control power; on the other hand, there is a lesson to be learned here, which is that in no way can we grow complacent about, or can governments at any level relinquish control over the problem of price, even at the best of economic times. Reforms in the Monetary, Investment, Foreign Exchange, and Foreign Trade Systems Reinforce Each Other [Zhou] What are the connections between reforms in the monetary and investment systems and those in the foreign exchange and foreign trade systems? [Li] Reforms in the monetary system will set in motion reforms in the investment system. In the practice of the market economy, this means that investment will be regulated and controlled by the money market: The volume of investment depends entirely on amounts of money. Meanwhile, industrial policy will determine the direction of investment. Adopting a unified exchange rate and a unitary, managed floating exchange rate system based on market demand and supply aids the effort to open up to the outside world, will promote further growth in foreign economic cooperation and trade, and will have a positive impact on China's efforts to integrate its economy with the world economy. Financial and Tax Reforms Are in the Interests of Various Circles [Zhou] Can financial and tax reforms be implemented smoothly, in light of the fact that they may affect the local interests of some regions and enterprises? [Li] Financial and tax reforms consist mainly of unifying tax laws, a fair tax burden, and changing the contract system into a tax-revenue sharing system. In all, enterprises do not have a larger tax burden. The reform is an adjustment in the interest pattern. The key to the financial and tax reforms is a reasonable taxation system compatible with the demands of a socialist market economy system, and at the same time, in line with international convention. The tax-revenue sharing system is generally adopted in countries with a market economy. It strengthens the state's financial macroregulatory and control powers. However, most of the additional income for the central government will be plowed back into the local authorities in various forms. To take the endurance of localities and enterprises into account, and to ensure the convergence of the old tax system with the new, we will arrange for a transitional period, during which the present interest pattern will remain as it is. Only gradually will the central financial authorities raise their proportion of revenues from the later-increased part of taxes. The Market Economy Will Be a Unified Market [Zhou] How do you see some of the potential differences in view between the central and local authorities and between the localities themselves, and the problem of imbalanced economic development? [Li] China is a unified country, and the socialist market economy system we are going to develop will be a unified market. Of course, there are bound to be differences in view between China [as published] and localities, and development in different regions is indeed not balanced. The gap between the eastern and western regions has indeed widened, but the western region is developing too. People's living standards there are continuously rising. When we look around the world, we can see that imbalanced development is a universal law; all countries are subject to it. Moreover, the party and the government have taken full notice of the gap between the eastern and western regions, and are adopting measures to solve it. If the concern over the imbalanced development between regions in China and the contradictions between local interests triggered off by reforms are good-intentioned, we can understand these kinds of concerns. If, however, there are people with hostile intentions or hopes, who even assert that the imbalanced development between the eastern and western parts inevitably will "divide" China, banking on the appearance of internal problems in China, then their wishes will never come true. Theoretical Foundations and Organizational Guarantee for Modernization [Zhou] In 1993, the world began to look at China with new eyes. What do you think are the main reasons for this? [Li] The fundamental reason was the enormous progress in China's reform and opening up, and its economic construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. A few years ago, amid the violent changes in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, someone in the world was spreading the theory of "China toppling." Facts have shown that China not only has not toppled, but has grown stronger. Now many economists, commentators, and even politicians around the world are making far more optimistic estimates and predictions than our own regarding China's economic power and prospects. Despite their incongruence from the real situation, in a way they reflect the world's recognition of China's achievements. Now, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's whole set of theories about socialism with Chinese characteristics has taken full shape and has demonstrated its enormous power in practice. Meanwhile, the third- generation collective leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the core, has been formed and is maturing. Thus, our modernization effort is not only blessed with a theoretical foundation, but with also an organizational guarantee. Today, we are more confident than ever in China's future. It should be pointed out, however, that once again there are ill-intentioned people in the world spreading the theory of the "China threat" in an attempt to sow discord between China and its neighbors and to undermine the good relations between China and the surrounding countries. From "China toppling" to the "China threat" is a complete U-turn, and as such is mystifying. Both these extremes reflect ignorance of the realities of China. A strong and developing China will pose no threat to any country; it will only contribute more to world peace and development. China's Foreign Relations Will Further Expand in 1994 [Zhou] How will China develop its diplomacy in the present international situation? [Li] With the coming of 1994, the world enters the third year since the Cold War. Generally speaking, there is an aspect in the international situation which is easing up, and the world is developing in the direction of multipolarization. On the other hand, there are still many destabilizing factors in the world. The two major themes -- peace and development -- have yet to be resolved. In the turbulent and unstable world, Asia -- and especially East Asia -- has maintained relative stability and sustained economic development. This is one important feature in the current international situation. It can be foreseen that in the new year East Asia will further strengthen its status and influence in the world. It also can be foreseen that China's international status will rise further, its foreign relations further expanding. Specifically, China's overall relations with European countries are expected to see notable improvements. The meeting between the Chinese and U.S. heads of state supplied a good opportunity. It is possible to achieve new development in Sino-U.S. relations. Facts have proved that there are wide-ranging common interests between China and the Western countries, which are the foundation for developing ties between them. Common Efforts at Peacefully Unifying the Motherland [Zhou] What are your New Year expectations for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and for overseas Chinese? [Li] With the coming of 1994, the dates when Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland draw even closer. Whatever happens, we will have the ability to restore sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, to uphold the principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. The economies of Hong Kong and Macao now are linked closely with that of the mainland. As the mainland economy develops, the economies of Hong Kong and Macao will grow increasingly prosperous. Peaceful unification is the direction of the general trend and is what people desire. Attempts at "two Chinas," one China, one Taiwan" or "one country, two governments" run counter the historical trend and go against the common wish and fundamental interest of the Chinese people on both sides of the strait. We hope the Taiwan authorities will place the great national cause above all else and will do more practical things for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. I believe all the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots and all the overseas Chinese are descendants of the Chinese race. A strong Chinese nation is our common wish. In the new year we all should continue to work for this.
