Vujadinovic report: "At Risk Even With `Common' Sex"] [Text] Regarding the trend that hitherto placed drug addicts at the top of the groups most at risk of contracting the AIDS virus, according to data for the last year for the Belgrade area, where there is the greatest concentration of registered cases, a certain increase of AIDS cases among heterosexuals has been detected. According to Verica Ilic, epidemiologist from the City Institute for Health Care, in the course of the last year 32 HIV positive cases were registered, 43 diseased cases, and 58 fatalities. The institute registered some 30 HIV positive cases among drug addicts, while 31 people contracted the virus through heterosexual intercourse. "Two years ago intravenous drug addicts were the group most at risk. However, last year there was a considerable decrease of cases in this group -- from 59.7 percent (registered 1992), the percentage of drug addicts in the total number of HIV positive cases dropped to 36.6 percent. On the other hand, in 1992 there were 23.6 percent of cases that had contracted HIV virus through heterosexual intercourse, while in 1993 there was a considerable increase in the number of such cases, jumping to 32.9 percent of the total," Ilic says. How then can the possible mass spreading of AIDS virus be prevented in the future, in view of such a turnabout of the groups at risk, placing heterosexuals ahead? "The most difficult thing is to control the sexual behavior of people, and make them change it. It is particularly difficult, in view of the turbulent times that we are living in, to make young people change it. AIDS is certainly a deadly disease, but those are also an entrance for all the problems that the young people have today [sentence as published]. On the one hand, sex is an outlet, but on the other hand, nobody has enough time for teenagers. It is precisely for that reason that we are insisting on talking to them and educating them," Viktorija Cucic, Yugoslav coordinator for AIDS with the WHO and chairman of the Yugoslav Association for AIDS Prevention. Starting from the association's basic goal -- to educate as many young people as possible, in order to prevent death from ignorance -- the travelling caravan headed by Cucic has recently arrived in Montenegro, where a seminar has been held for 95 youngsters. "We also work with the teachers, using the program "Together Against AIDS." It is about educational seminars comprising six lessons each, which involve the most contemporary educational methods. After the seminars, the teachers themselves organize courses in their schools for students," Cucic explains. She also underlines that, given the poor financial circumstances in Yugoslav health care, knowledge and sane behavior are now the only available instruments for fighting AIDS, so the association is making efforts to equip the people with those instruments in order to develop in them responsibility for their own health.
