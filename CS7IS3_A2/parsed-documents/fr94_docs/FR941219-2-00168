Order 80&hyph;2&hyph;69 established the first interim SFFL, and Order 94&hyph;10&hyph;7 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through November 30, 1994. In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning December 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on the year ended September 30, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. By Order 94&hyph;12&hyph;15 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level: Atlantic 1.3877 Latin America 1.4122 Pacific 1.7834 Canada 1.4994 For further information contact: Keith A.
