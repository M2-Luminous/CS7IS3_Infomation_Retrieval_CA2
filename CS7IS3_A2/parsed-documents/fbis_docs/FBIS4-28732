Why such a negative view of Cambodia when peace is a reality and the Khmer Rouge are nothing more than bandits engaging in skirmishes with the Royal Army? The answer lies with the foreign media who are vultures looking for carcasses. The foreign press are busy painting gory scenes of Cambodia, because even before the echoes of the resounding booms of artillery die down, more gunfire reports pour in. Newspapers throughout the world resonate with "news" of the unfortunate war-ridden country, spewing out information, more information and even more information. In the process of tarnishing this country, foreign newsmen emerge as heroes to their employers, to other pressmen and to their own countries. Meanwhile, in a small country, fighting the skirmishes of war and making valiant attempts to recover from its 20-year history of factional rivalry, Cambodia has also to contend with an enemy from within, namely the Western press it plays host to. News reports are rife around the world about the country beset by war after war, although what Cambodia is currently facing are isolated incidents of skirmishes between guerrillas and the government of the day. The Western defenders of rights and morality who constantly pound their Eastern lesser neighbours to a pulp over issues of rights, have no social conscience. Why is it Westerners can lay claim to having an active conscience when it cannot even help salvage a country from its destituteness, but instead destroy it even more. Why are pressmen who are usually so inhibited in their home country, and now let loose in a foreign country, suddenly indulging and even encouraging all hell to break loose. Skirmishes are brought to a proportion larger than life when newsmen stationed in far-flung countries sending news to their headquarters, want to appear battle-fatigued in the eyes of their headquarter editors. In every foreign correspondent lurks a Rambo, waiting to shoot off his pen. In addition to that, news correspondents have to battle stories generated from countries which have more to boast about than skirmishes -- real on-going, full scale wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, Afghanistan, just to name a few. So competition amongst foreign correspondents to churn out the goriest, most sensational, most destabilising stories is a real fact of being `one-up' on the competitor. Hence, the more gory, sensational and the more colourful a scene is painted, enables the foreign correspondents to appear even more heroic. There is a time and a place for everything, and the time has passed for self-inflicted heroics. It is time to do something constructive for the country instead of running it down. Perhaps the Western self-proclaimed protectors of the masses may consider writing the truth instead, if they cannot condescend to defending the masses of Cambodia and develop the country's needs.
