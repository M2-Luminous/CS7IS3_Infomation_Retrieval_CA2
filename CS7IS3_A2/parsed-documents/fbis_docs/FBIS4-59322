That is why they are fighting with low morale and later they join their brothers in the broad popular base which defends the unity, democracy, and the convention document. This was mentioned in the important press talk which was given by him [the defense minister] to SAWT AL-UMMAL in its issue tomorrow. He indicated that the number of casualties among the Armed Forces defending the unity and democracy is incredibly few. He indicated to the reports by the mass media about tens of victims of children, elderlies and women, who were attacked by missiles and rockets in their houses as the result of random shelling of peaceful towns and villages and residential apartments by the al-Ahmar ruling gang. The defense minister added that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] does not boast of victory in this war, which was forced on our people and homeland by the al-Ahmar gang in a desperate attempt to hold on to power and control the wealth of our people. He affirmed that the national base is broadening daily and our people are determined to continue to repel the gangs of this adventurous family until the great victory is achieved. The defense minister added that the YSP had dealt with the merger of the Armed Forces with the sincere intention to build the Yemeni Armed Forces, which stabilize the unity. The defense minister affirmed that the YSP did not bother about the positioning of military units which were deployed from the southern part to the northern part and vice versa, on the eve of 22 May 1990, because the party had the national responsibility towards the homeland which it hoped to share with the People's General Congress. He added that the subsequent days and circumstances proved that the executive leadership of the al-Ahmar gang had deployed their forces in accordance with intentions to ignite war and control the southern governorates by force, which is not acceptable. The defence minister appreciated the heroes of the Armed Forces and the Yemeni people, who are defending the unity of the people and the homeland.
