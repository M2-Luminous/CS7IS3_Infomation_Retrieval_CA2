On presenting a 20-item program for "more ecological growth and more employment," Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that all cost-intensive projects envisaged by the SPD if it wins the Bundestag elections will be subject to strict ecological standards. However, the SPD wants to strengthen the dynamics of growth by improving economic framework conditions. According to the 20-item concept that was presented by the SPD's economic experts, overcoming unemployment and a major growth in employment are among the priorities of the future government. One of the SPD's proposals is to support the creation of part-time jobs by means of special premiums. Employees sharing their jobs with someone who is unemployed should be rewarded by being exempted from paying unemployment contributions in an unbureaucratic way. These subsidies could be funded by the expired unemployment benefits, Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter Spoeri (SPD) said. Lafontaine said that the 1.5-percent growth rate indicated by the Federal Government is not sufficient to stop the wave of layoffs in Germany. Relying on a higher demand from abroad is not enough either. What is necessary are better framework conditions for investment and the strengthening of domestic demand. But it is also necessary to support the opening up of new foreign markets by an active foreign-trade policy. The SPD rejects a specific economic policy program. Economic development in the new laender has to be given a wide scope. The SPD expressly advocates an improvement in framework conditions for medium-size companies and newly established firms. It is necessary to improve access to private risk capital through a "medium-size company offensive" and to strengthen joint industrial research in medium-size companies. An investment facilitation law is to provide more favorable depreciation conditions and investment subsidies as of January 1995. The SPD wants to promote future investment by tax incentives, and the tax reliefs granted for research and development to small and medium-size firms and to freelance inventors, which were abolished by the government coalition, shall be reintroduced. Special emphasis is put on a market-economy-oriented technology transfer, the marketing of new communication technologies, and the introduction of new media-oriented services as sectors with the greatest future job potential. Ecological modernization of industry and increased efforts in environment protection will also create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, Lafontaine said. The SPD politician confirmed his party's intention not to increase the tax burden, to cut the state's new indebtedness in the medium term, and to make all new projects subject to strict financing clauses. To stabilize public funds, all public services, including social benefits, will have to be checked regularly. The high indebtedness of the state and the interest burden that has increased to 100 million German marks [DM] per year is a huge burden on the future government's work. An SPD government will, however, conduct a consolidation policy that is socially balanced. In abolishing taxation of the minimum subsistence level, the SPD will only be able to ease the burdens of the taxpayers concerned step by step, due to the high costs of DM40 billion involved.
