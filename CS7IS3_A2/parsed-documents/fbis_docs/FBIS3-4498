The meeting stressed: This year, our province will continue to implement the system of inviting and submitting tenders, will fully carry out construction according to the construction projects law, and will speed up the development of the construction industry. It is necessary to concentrate funds on the completion of 26 key construction projects so that they can display their investment efficiency as soon as possible. In view of the fact that urban capital construction facilities in our province are generally backward, it is imperative to arouse the enthusiasm of the localities to raise funds through various channels to speed up the pace of urban capital construction projects. It is necessary to vigorously promote housing construction projects to speed up the pace of solving housing difficulties in towns and cities. It is necessary to formulate rational plans to properly implement experimental construction projects in villages and towns, so that village and town construction can scale new heights.
