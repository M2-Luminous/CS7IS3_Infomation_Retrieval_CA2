FR940830-0-00056 FR940830-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 678 [Docket No. 920409&hyph;3047; I.D. 082294C ] Atlantic Shark Fisheries; Large Coastal Sharks AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Rescission of closure; closure. SUMMARY: NMFS rescinds the closure of the fishery for large coastal sharks conducted in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Rescission of the closure of this fishery is necessary because new information indicates that the second semiannual quota for large coastal sharks has not been taken. Based on revised estimates of landings and projected catches, a new closure date is established. EFFECTIVE DATE: The closure of August 10, 1994, is rescinded effective at 0000 hours, local time, September 1, 1994. The fishery for large coastal sharks is reopened effective 0001 hours local time September 1, 1994, through October 10, 1994. The closure will be effective from 0001 hours, local time, October 11, 1994, through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Michael Bailey, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347; Michael Justen, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305; or Kevin B. Foster, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678. Section 678.23(b)(3) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, by owners or operators of vessels permitted under §678.4. The adjusted second semiannual quota of 1,318 metric tons (mt) is available for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under §678.24 to monitor the catch and landing statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of sharks in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will equal any quota under §678.23(b). When shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota established under §678.23(b), the AA is further required under §678.24 to close the fishery. The AA had determined, based on the best available data on reported catch and projections of future landings, that the semiannual quota for large coastal sharks in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994, would be attained by August 10, 1994. Therefore, a closure notice was published in the Federal Register on August 1, 1994 (59 FR 38943), to take effect August 10, 1994. Upon further analysis of the landings data, including new information that became available since announcement of the closure date, the AA has determined that 656.95 mt of the 1,318 mt quota for the large coastal shark fishery remain unharvested. Therefore, the closure of August 10, 1994, is rescinded effective September 1, to allow an opportunity for shark fishermen to take their full allocation. The effective date of rescission has been established at September 1, 1994, in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the reopening of the large coastal shark fishery. The daily landing rates obtained from the revised estimates indicate that the remaining quota in the large coastal shark fishery could be harvested within 40 days. Therefore, it is projected that the available quota will be taken by October 10, 1994, and for vessels issued a permit under §678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management unit will be prohibited as of 0001 hours on October 11, 1994. The AA is announcing this closure date in advance in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the closure of the large coastal shark fishery. During the closure, for vessels issued a permit under §678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management unit is prohibited, unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per trip is four large coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade, or barter of carcasses and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit under §678.4 is prohibited, except for those that were harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or bartered prior to October 10, 1994, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR part 678 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Dated: August 24, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
