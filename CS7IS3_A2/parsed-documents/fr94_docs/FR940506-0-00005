Discussion of the Rule Business and Industry Disaster (BID) loans guaranteed under the authority of the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act cover costs arising from the consequences of natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar, that occur after August 23, 1992, and receive a Presidential declaration. Since the legislative authority to issue guarantees under BID expired on September 30, 1993, a deadline of July 31, 1993, to file applications was placed in the regulation. This was intended to give RDA staff time to process any applications before the guarantee authority expired. Due to additional disasters that occurred in 1993, the application deadline is removed to allow additional time to apply for assistance. This action was published as an interim rule in the Federal Register on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41171), with a comment period ending September 2, 1993. No comments were received.
