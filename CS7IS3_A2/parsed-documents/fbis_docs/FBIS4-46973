The production potential of the agro-industrial complex, as the domain of the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of Ukraine, consists of 433 enterprises of the Holovmolprom, of which 370 are dairy enterprises. Some 109 meat-processing enterprises and 149 state-owned sovkhozes, which specialize in animal husbandry, report to the Holovmyasprom. As of the beginning of April of this year, 93 dairy enterprises (21 percent of the total number) and 40 meat- processing enterprises plus five sovkhozes, 17 percent, were privatized. At present, integrated agro-industrial associations are being created in the agro-industrial complex with the participation of agricultural producers, processing enterprises, and trading organizations through their transformation into public joint-stock companies: In the dairy industry, 31 associations have been created, and in the meat-processing industry--21. Some 581 and 406 company- operated outlets, respectively, operate in these sectors at present. For now, the leasing of property remains the main ownership arrangement; 187 enterprises of the dairy industry and 58 enterprises and sovkhozes of the meat-processing industry operate in this format. The reluctance of agricultural commodity producers to deliver their products to monopoly enterprises that engage in processing milk and meat has recently become a characteristic peculiarity of the agro- industrial complex. The farms are setting course for the acquisition of their own minicomplexes for smoking meats and other processing equipment. According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, at the enterprises privatized with the participation of agricultural producers the proportion of the stock held by the latter remains comparatively small; besides, it differs substantially in different Ukrainian oblasts. Thus, at the Novaya Odessa Cheese Plant (Nikolayev Oblast), the share of commodity producers comes to 49 percent and at CHERKASSYRMOLPROM, to 35 percent, whereas at the LUHANSKMOLPROM leased enterprise, this indicator is as low as 14.2 percent, and at the Gadyach Cheese Plant (Poltava Oblast), 4.3 percent. At 11 enterprises in Odessa Oblast, at whose facilities the Odessa Joint-Stock Company for Meat Production and Processing was created, the proportion of stock held by agricultural producers came to 52 percent, at the Konotop Meat-Processing Combine to 73 percent, and at the Zaporozhye Combine to 40 percent. At present, 47 enterprises of the dairy industry are undergoing privatization. The fastest pace of privatization is characteristic of Kiev and Cherkassy Oblasts--22 enterprises in each, Chernigov Oblast--21 enterprises, and Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts--19 enterprises in each. In the meat industry, 29 meat-processing enterprises are being privatized: six in Vinnitsa Oblast, three in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, two enterprises in Kiev, Kirovograd, and Poltava Oblasts each, four enterprises in Sumy and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts each, five enterprises in Cherkassy Oblast, and one enterprise in Chernigov Oblast. The above statistics indicate that although privatization in the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine is advancing, it is advancing very reluctantly. According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, associations in Transcarpathian, Rovno, and Chernovtsy Oblasts have not embarked on the privatization of enterprises in the dairy industry at all. As far as the meat- processing industry is concerned, enterprises in Volyn, Dnepropetrovsk, Transcarpathian, Nikolayev, Rovno, Ternopol, Kharkov, Kherson, and, once again, Chernovtsy Oblasts bring up the rear.
