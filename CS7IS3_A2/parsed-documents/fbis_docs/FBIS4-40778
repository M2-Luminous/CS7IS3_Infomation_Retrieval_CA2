After working for almost 30 years at Moscow's Organic Chemistry Research Institute -- a secret apparatus which is part of the military complex -- Mirzayanov has now launched a campaign against chemical weapons. With his colleague Lev Fedorov he published a number of articles which led to his arrest, his indictment for "divulging state secrets," and finally his release due to the authorities' manifest embarrassment. Mirzayanov lives with his family on the outskirts of Moscow in two poorly furnished rooms, on a 60,000-rouble [R] pension. At the time of his arrest, he was selling cheap shirts in the street. Chemical weapons did not make him rich. [Scaglione] Doctor Mirzayanov, how does a brilliant researcher become an inventor of awesome weapons? [Mirzayanov] In 1965, when I joined the institute, certain material considerations carried considerable weight. If I had remained at the Science Academy, I could never have afforded to rent this apartment in a cooperative. Wages were higher; a researcher with my grade earned R280 a month at that time. At the institute I earned R500, I got free meals in the canteen, I got two months' vacation instead of just one. In short, it was advantageous. On the other hand, it was almost like being in a gulag: very strict security regulations, checks, punishment for even very small transgressions. I even needed a special permit to go to the Lenin library, and if by any chance I had been fired, I would have found it almost impossible to find another job. [Scaglione] What were your specific duties? [Mirzayanov] For many years I was involved in producing weapons as an expert in the processes whereby the various substances are absorbed. Then, in the last period, I was responsible for safety checks in the various laboratories and plants. [Scaglione] Did you often observe incidents or violations of the safety regulations? [Mirzayanov] I recorded about 100 such "incidents." In 1987, when I informed the institute's management, a huge scandal broke out. I was even summoned by Chemical Industry Deputy Minister Golubkov [as published], who reprimanded me and warned me not to overstep my authority. They cared nothing about the consequences -- whether for the environment or for people -- of what I had seen. Their only fear was that information might be leaked outside. [Scaglione] What led you to criticize and attack the world in which you lived and worked for so many years? [Mirzayanov] Because signing the chemical disarmament treaty is mere hypocrisy, an empty gesture which not only leaves problems unresolved but actually worsens them. [Scaglione] So do you also believe that new chemical weapons are being prepared in Russian laboratories? [Mirzayanov] No, I do not believe so. Especially because it is not necessary to do so. In the first place, the convention does not prohibit research and, in the military field, the dividing line between research and production is very thin, far too thin. Besides, there is no need to build special factories or special chemical weapons. All you need is, for example, a laboratory producing a given pesticide in Siberia and another plant in Moscow producing a second pesticide. There is nothing irregular about that. Even the technicians involved believe that everything is all right. However, in a third laboratory, kept secret from everybody, a military scientist studies a formula, develops a synthesis of the two substances, and the result is a third substance, ready to be used as a weapon. You must bear in mind that certain chemical syntheses take place in a few seconds, a shorter time than it takes for a missile to fly from one country to another. Thousands of such syntheses are possible without ipso facto violating the convention. [Scaglione] What about the disposal and destruction of the substances which have already been accumulated in laboratories and storage facilities? [Mirzayanov] That is another great scandal. Russia signed the convention knowing very well that it could not dispose of its own reserves, or that it could only do so by exposing the population to very serious risks. According to my estimates, 700,000 tonnes of various types of aggressive substances were produced overall in the Soviet period. But let us assume smaller estimates, like the ones accepted even in official scientific circles, where they speak of 400,000 tonnes only. Today the Russian authorities admit that they still have to dispose of 40,000 tonnes, which means that 360,000 tons have been buried, dumped, or hidden somewhere in a makeshift and dangerous way -- which, in any case, represents a greater hazard than the 40,000 tonnes which, somehow or other, are still stored in the old facilities. [Scaglione] Where do you think the missing tonnes might be? [Mirzayanov] It seems reasonable to think that they were disposed of not far from the production centers, i.e. in the Bryansk region, in Shikany, Kurgan, in Russia's great northern region. There are plants in Cheboksary and Volgograd, but in the fifties certain substances were also being manufactured near Moscow, in Kazan, Dzerdzhinsk, and other towns. [Scaglione] What do you make of General Kuntsevich's sudden dismissal? [Mirzayanov] I met him in the seventies -- as a matter of fact in Shikany, where I was sent several times on assignments. At that time Kuntsevich was still only a colonel and had only recently arrived in Shikany as head of the research center, after being posted for a long time in the Far East. Kuntsevich never worked much in the laboratories. He is a technocrat rather than a scientist, even though he became a general by implementing production of the so-called VX-33 chemical weapon in the Cheboksary laboratories. I know that for some time now he has been out of favor in military circles: They blame him for signing the convention. Perhaps my campaign did the rest, offering the "hawks" a good excuse to fire him.
