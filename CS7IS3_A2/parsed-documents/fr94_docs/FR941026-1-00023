FR941026-1-00023 FR941026-1-00012 A recent review of category 2 insects in the southeast region (Schweitzer 1989) recommended a very high status survey priority for Say's spiketail. The Service concurs with this recommendation and plans to fund a survey within the near future to better determine current distribution and status. However, the service does not anticipate this survey will be completed in time for the 12-month finding on this petition. Although a status review of Say's spiketail dragonfly is currently in progress based upon its inclusion as a category 2 species in the Service's comprehensive notice of review for animal candidates, the Service hereby announces its formal review of the species' status pursuant to this 90-day petition finding. Public comments regarding population trends, biological vulnerability and threats to this species should be sent to the office specified in the ADDRESSES section.
