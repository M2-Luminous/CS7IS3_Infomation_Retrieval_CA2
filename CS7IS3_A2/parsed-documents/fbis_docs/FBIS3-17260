In his words, intensive preparations for the forthcoming dialogue are under way in the republic, and a delegation has already been practically formed. It will be headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, the republic's labor minister. The prime minister stressed that there is no alternative to a peaceful political settlement of the Tajik conflict, but he refrained from stating a preliminary date for the beginning of the dialogue and the names of the representatives of the opposition forces with whom the authorities of Tajikistan are ready to sit down at the negotiating table. Incidentally, the latter circumstance is very important. Local observers believe that, and Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, the commander of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan stated on several occasions that the real force is represented by that part of the opposition which, figuratively speaking, is controlling weapons. It is this part of the opposition, which declared itself as the irreconcilable opposition to the present regime in Tajikistan, and which set up the so-called government in exile in Afghanistan, that has, of late, also announced its readiness for a political dialogue with Dushanbe. Local observers, however, are quite skeptical about the feasibility of the dialogue, referring, in particular, to the recent statement made by the press center of the republican procurator general, which demands that practically all the leaders of the armed opposition be detained and taken to court, including Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda, former spiritual leader of the Tajik Muslims; Shodmon Yusuf, chairman of the Democratic Party; Davlat Ousman, deputy chairman of the Islamic Rebirth Party, and Tohir Abudujabar, chairman of the Rastokhez movement. Criminal proceedings against them, the Tajik procurator general's statement says, were instituted in absentia as early as spring 1993. They are accused of a number of crimes against the republic's constitutional system. Davlat Khudonazarov, one of the opposition leaders, is on a black list too, although criminal proceedings against him have not been officially started.
