FBIS4-6778 "dreas079_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 North Korea U.S., ROK Hold `Aerial War Exercise' 22 Apr U.S., ROK Hold `Aerial War Exercise' 22 Apr SK2404085794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 23 Apr 94 SK2404085794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 23 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. imperialists committed a midnight aerial war exercise aimed at a surprise invasion of the North on 22 April. About 100 planes, including war planes, were mobilized from overseas bases, in addition to the fighter bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes affiliated to the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea, were committed in this provocative war exercise. This war exercise was carried out frantically from 2300 [1400 GMT] 21 April to 0400 [1900 GMT] 22 April in the skies over the areas of Osan, Yongwol, Kapyong, and Tongduchon. It was a dangerous playing with fire aimed at a nighttime preemptive strike on the strategic targets of the Northern half of the Republic. The E-3 early-warning plane, which took off from Okinawa on 22 April, made a double flight over the skies of Kangnung, Chunchon, and Tokchok Island. It was running amok in carrying out all-out plans and commanding the various types of plane units that were bustling about in exercises, such as bombing targets, giving ground support, and aerial war exercises. As the aerial war exercise took place over a long period of time, a KC-135 refueling plane, which was already mobilized and deployed in South Korea from an overseas base, was mobilized over the skies off the coast of Kunsan and refueled scores of fighter bombers and assault planes participating in the war exercise. Thus, this instigated an atmosphere of war. Also on this day, a RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane that took off from Kadena base in Okinawa flew into South Korea and flew over the areas of Pochon, Inje, and Kojin for a long period of time. Thus, it committed an act of taking aerial photographs and electronic reconnaissance of the overall regions of the Northern half of the Republic. Over 500 war planes and 15 reconnaisance planes of various types aimed at invading the North were running amok in the aerial war exercise and espionage acts over the skies of South Korea on 22 April alone. The frantic commotion of playing with fire being committed day after day by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets aimed at the Northern half of the Republic is driving the condition on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous situation.
