The February inflation rate does more than just affect the pocketbooks of the Colombian people. It also shows that something about economic policy or the country's structure of production is preventing us from reaching the not very ambitious goal (as we have remarked before) of cutting the inflation rate to 19 percent in 1994 and below that in future years. Perhaps because of concern over the failure to achieve quick success in the battle against inflation, we are starting to perceive some degree of despair among our authorities, especially the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic, and private businessmen. The latest news is that a new package of measures is being cooked up "to stem overseas borrowing and slow the growth of the money supply." According to the information that this paper published last weekend, the idea is to tighten controls over the inflow of foreign exchange into the country through overseas borrowing and thus to ease the pressure on the amount of money in circulation, which is expanding at a rate of 40 percent a year, when the Bank of the Republic's Board set a target of 21 to 27 percent for 1994. Concern among the authorities is compounded by concern among businessmen and production unions over the fast pace at which the peso is strengthening vis-a-vis the dollar and the currencies of the countries with which Colombia trades actively. The fact is that while inflation remains stubbornly at around 23 percent, the exchange rate is declining at 8 to 10 percent a year. As a result, it is impossible to sustain the real exchange rate (another of the Bank of the Republic's goals) and to prevent a greater revaluation of the peso, to the detriment of the production sector and, in particular, exporters. This is why various circles, including former presidents, are pressing for an accelerated devaluation (something that politicians are welcoming), even if it means faster money supply growth and, ultimately, an inflation rate that exceeds the Bank of the Republic's target. Given this state of affairs, even the casual observer would notice the conflict between the Bank of the Republic (which is primarily interested in reducing inflation) and the private sector, which fears that economic policy will lead to a sharper revaluation of the peso that will irreversibly harm the domestic and foreign competitiveness of our companies. This apparent conflict between the monetary and exchange-rate authority (the Board of the Bank of the Republic) and the private sector ought not to continue and widen, because the risk is that the process of trade and financial liberalization will lose "credibility," thus increasing the pressure to reverse the series of reforms that the Gaviria administration has undertaken to internationalize the Colombian economy. Even more seriously, this would be happening in the midst of an election campaign to choose President Gaviria's successor. In a way, then, what is required is that the Board of the Bank of the Republic, the government, and the private sector alike coldly analyze what is going on. Is there simply an excessive flow of capital into the country that demands a tightening of controls, or is an even larger budget deficit required in these new times? Does the production of foodstuffs require new and greater incentives after all? Or does the inflation rate have to be under 10 or 15 percent a year in order for the liberalization to be successful? We do not have answers to these questions, but we want to pose them to shed light on an issue that is all too important to the country's future development. The credibility of economic policy and the prestige of the Board of the Bank of the Republic are not the only things at stake; so is the fate of the various production sectors and of many Colombian companies.
