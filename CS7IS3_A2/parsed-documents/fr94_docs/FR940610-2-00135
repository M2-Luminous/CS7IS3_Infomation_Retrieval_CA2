FR940610-2-00135 FR940610-2-00068 The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees, and is either paid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established, or out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate. 14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party usually the obligor. These administrative fees fall into three categories: (a) prepayment fees; (b) late payment and payment extension fees; and (c) expenses, fees and charges associated with foreclosure or repossession, or other conversion of a secured position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation. Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates. 15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any date on which pass-through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts in itself or to commingle such payments with its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass-through date. Commingled payments may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership. In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a data specified in the pooling and servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders. 16. The underwriter will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting or private placement of certificates. In a fir commitment underwriting this fee would consist of the difference between what the underwriter receives for the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates. In a private placement, the fee normally takes the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor. In a best efforts underwriting in which the underwriter would sell certificates in a public offering on an agency basis, the underwriter would receive an agency commission rather than a fee based on the difference between the price at which the certificates are sold to the public and what it pays the sponsor. In some private placements the underwriter may buy certificates as principal, in which case its compensation would be the difference between what it receives for the certificates that it sells and what it pays the sponsor for these certificates. Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer 17. The applicant represents that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payment, the cost of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive at some point. Consequently the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the receivables included in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage (usually between 5 and 10 percent) of the initial balance. The repurchase price for such an option is set at a level such that the certificateholders will receive the full amount on all of the receivables held by the trust plus the accrued interest at the pass-through rate plus the full amount of property, if any, that has been required by the trust through collections on or liquidations of the receivables. Certificate Ratings 18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support (such as overcollateralization, surety bonds, letter of credit or guarantees) will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at a level that is a multiple of the worst historical net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in the issuing trust. Provision of Credit Support 19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust (i.e., act as an insurer). In these cases, the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) out of late payments by the obligors, (b) from the credit support provider (which may be itself) or, (c) in the case of a trust that issues subordinated certificates, from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates, and the master servicer will advance such funds in a timely manner. In some transactions, the master servicer may not be obligated to advance funds, but instead would be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of its obligations as insurer. Moreover, a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider of credit support or from the future payment stream. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support and provides its own funds to cover defaulted payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its own initiative on behalf of the trustee, but in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full extent of its obligations under the credit support mechanism.
