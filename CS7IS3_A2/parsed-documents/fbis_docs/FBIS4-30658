Maragay] [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Executive Order [EO] No. 182 allowing foreigners to invest in more areas of the local economy. EO 182 dovetailed with the announcement of the National Economic Development Authority [NEDA] yesterday that "List C" of the First Regular Investment Negative List (RFINL) [as published] would be "empty" or a total blank because no petition from local industries was filed as of the deadline on 31 August 1993. "This is a development welcomed by the investing community because there are no further restrictions being made by the government on the investment environment," NEDA said in a statement. List C, which was approved by NEDA last 21 June, was intended to be a list of investment areas that existing local industries have adequately filled and are therefore off-limits to foreign investors. Since list C is a total blank, only negative lists A and B remain. List A includes areas in which foreign ownership is limited by mandate of the Constitution and specific nationalization laws. List B contains investment areas where foreign ownership Is limited for purposes of public health and safety and to protect small and medium-sized domestic market enterprises. Among the restricted areas in List A are mass media, licensed professions, cooperatives, utilization of natural resources and public utilities. List B includes manufacturers of weapons and explosives, dangerous drugs, small and medium scale domestic market enterprises and export enterprises which utilize raw materials from depleting natural resources. Pursuant to RA [Republic Act] 7042, no foreign equity is allowed in mass media, retail trade, cooperatives, private security agencies, small-scale mining, utilization of marine resources and rice and corn industry. Industries where 40 percent foreign equity may be allowed include exploration, development and utilization of natural resources; ownership of private lands, operation and management of public utilities; ownership and establishment of educational institutions, and financing companies regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Manufacture, repair, storage and distribution of products and ingredients used for manufacturing firearms, gunpowder, dynamite and blasting supples. [sentence as published] Manufacture and distribution of dangerous drugs; sauna and steam bath houses, massage clinics; certain forms of gambling like race track operations and racehorse ownership and importation domestic market enterprises with paid-in equity capital of less than the equivalent of $500,000 unless they involve advanced technology; and export enterprises which utilize raw materials from depleting natural resources and with paid-in equity capital on less than $500,000. EO 182 means that foreign investors would then be allowed to invest in such formerly restricted businesses as travel agencies, tourist lodging services (pension houses and tourist inns), convention and conference organizing, life and non-life insurance business including professional insurance services and reinsurance brokerage. The Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI) headed by businessman Raul T. Concepcion had protested NEDA's decision to close the "List C" of the RFINL on the ground that local businessmen were not adequately informed that they had to submit petitions for entries in the list. The Cabinet cluster-B, however, turned down FPI's petition for an extension of the period for filing of petitions for inclusion in "List C," citing that ample announcements had been made and sufficient time was given for the filing of petitions. NEDA argued that adequate exploitation by Philippine nationals as a criterion for determining foreign equity participation should not be at the expense of the majority of Filipino consumers whose interests should also be of primary concern. "Adequate capacity" is not a sound basis for excluding foreign investments in a particular sector, NEDA said. Restricting entry in an industry on the basis of "adequate capacity" encourages existing firms with high-cost production techniques to continue operating at the expense of consumers, it said. A foreign company would enter if it has something better to offer and can compete with the existing firms by offering quality products at lower prices that would benefit consumers and domestic producers, NEDA added. The Board of Investments (BOI) had stopped using "adequate capacity" as a criterion because it would only enable existing enterprises to exercise monopoly powers.
