We understand that we are to live together and therefore want stability and peace more than anything else," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in conversation with Rasul Guliyev, chairman of Azerbaijani National Assembly, today. Karabakh is our common sorrow. The Russian plan is as realistic as possible. We are offering an honest mediation together with the CSCE and the United Nations, Andrey Kozyrev noted. We can introduce CIS peacekeeping forces, and this will not mean a Russian military presence but a peacemaking operation, the Russian minister stressed. Rasul Guliyev highly appraised the Russian Foreign Ministry's efforts. The Azerbaijani politician believes that economic interests should be at the basis of bilateral relations. "Of all CIS countries we have the deepest integration. Economic ties should be strengthened but for this the war must be stopped," Rasul Guliyev noted.
