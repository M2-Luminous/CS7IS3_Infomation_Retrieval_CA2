Except for some fundamentalist elements who are badly shaken by this total change in the low castes after centuries, everyone should be happy . In a society divided by stratification, the confrontation does not take place between those sitting on the top rung with those on the bottom rung. The confrontation usually happens between those sitting on adjoining rungs--first with second, second with third, and third with the fourth. There had been some confrontations between the backward classes and the scheduled castes. A cooperation between these groups heralds major changes, and these changes can convert a ladder-like system to a flat social system. The BSP-SP coalition can be a strong platform for the claim that the BSP leader Kanshi Ram has made about changing the vertical system to a horizontal system. The skepticism expressed by some people about the stability of this coalition keeping in mind the traditional confrontation is not unjustified, but is pessimistic. The optimistic view point would be that history has taken a turn, and this change could be the beginning of a major historic transformation. These Vidhan Sabha elections, which can be called mini general elections, have given some clear signals which, if read correctly, can indicate the path of the future of our politics. The first important signal is that the 1990 division of the Janata Dal was unreal and unnecessary, and the unity of various Janata Dal factions, under whatever name, is the need of the time. The Janata Dal in Bihar and Orissa, the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Janata Dal in Haryana, and other smaller parties in other states all represent the socialist movement and the desires of the farmers and laborers. This movement is inspired by the desire to change centuries-old unfair social system into an equitable system. Because of their personal ambitions and the conspiracies of the opposing forces, they were divided even when they agreed as it happened during the 1967-70, 1977-79, and 1989-91 periods. The anti-national communal forces that ignore the Constitution were able to gain power because of this internal strife. The Congress (I) had been able to rule at will because of the weakness of this movement, and this made our nation's situation very precarious. Therefore, keeping in mind out nation's interests, these divided groups must unite. The second point made by this election was that politics of such useless issues as temple-mosque cannot always work. They must raise the issues that the people confront daily. The people are being squeezed by high prices and are tormented by the corruption spread throughout government offices. They are suffering from lack of electricity, water, health, and other amenities and from unemployment. All constitutional institutions are corroding. All services for the people (mail, transportation, distribution of services, health, education, and police) are now very unstable. The people will turn away from a political party that ignores these issues and tries to kick around unnecessary issues to take advantage of them. Another signal issued by this mini general election is that the politics of those who make up parties in thin air will not be successful now. The tragedy of the Janata Dal has been that it had good leaders but they could never unite. No political party can function effectively without first organizing itself at grassroots levels of district, county, and state. In addition, the structure of the party will not be strong without the support of such sub-groups as youth, women, labor-student organizations, and organization of creative camps for the training of the party workers. The Janata Dal became weak because of the appointment of party officials through nomination, search for candidates and workers at the time of the general elections, and last minute efforts to find money for election expenses. Every party members understands this problem and we do not need to provide any proof of it. Opposed to it, the secret of Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party's success is that he worked hard for two years. He visited every part of the state, organized camps for training his workers (in the five-day camp in Mussoorie, about 1,000 boys and girls had participated), and maintained contact with all the workers. He has to focus on building a good structure of the party for a lasting success. The main reason the eyes of the whole nation will be focused on Uttar Pradesh is to see how the Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram government operates. Will it follow the old system, or will it be innovative? The people will have this question in their minds because the style of change agents is different from the status quo type of parties. The SP-BSP coalition has already expressed its commitment to change. The change should not be immediate and superficial; it should be long-term and fundamental. The attitude of the Congress (I) and the BJP governments is to disrupt the status quo minimally, because change is dangerous to their existence. We saw that during the anti-Mandal campaign. However, the status quo can be dangerous to parties that herald change. These parties will self-destruct if their tendency for change is fake, have the goal just to somehow stay in power, and avoid breaking up the old died traditions. That is what happened to the V.P. Singh government at the Center in 1990-91. It spent the nine months of its duration wondering whether it should carry out the Mandal Commission recommendations, and whether it should make a solid political decision over the Babri Masjid-Ram Janambhumi issue. It formed committees after committees, and questions were postponed. In the end, this policy of procrastination drowned it. The positive aspect of the SP-BSP government is that the issues such as temple and Mandal that incite people are dormant now. The Supreme Court has given its decision on the Mandal issue and it will be implemented easily. The temple issue is also in the Supreme Court and the BJP will continue its efforts to keep this issue alive. However, this issue can be dealt with logically without any problem. In the Mandal application, following the Karpuri Thakur formula would be useful because this formula proved to help unite the backward castes in Bihar. The main criterion for Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram government's success will be how diligently is it able to carry out the developmental plans in Uttar Pradesh that have been neglected for years. They do not have to depend on the Center for reformation in such areas as supply of electricity and water, roads and transportation system, health and education, and efficiency of government offices. However, the people will feel relieved if actual work is done in these areas. The people of this country are simple like Lord Shiva who was happy with the flowers of dhatura (intoxicating plant). Their needs are very few and their worldly desires are not unlimited like the societies that are slaves of the consumer culture. Still, these people yearn hopelessly for these small comforts and minor reliefs. This shows that this nation never had a government of the people. It will be the responsibility of the SP-BSP government to make the people feel that it is the government of the people. However, the most important responsibility for Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram will be to remove the bitterness felt by various groups in the society against each other and creation of an environment of acceptance and good will. This bitterness is a natural outcome of the efforts to break up the caste system. All this had started when the Constitution was written and implemented. This process has been going on slowly and invisibly since the Constitution promised equal political, social, and economic rights to every citizen, and gave them the assurance of freedom, equality, and brotherhood. These changes have finally begun to emerge in concrete form. The society conditioned to living in one way for centuries is naturally to feel the pains that come with change. This process can be made comfortable if the political leaders form a policy of sympathy and cooperation. Similar bitterness was felt here when the small kingdoms were phased out and the landlord system was ended. We passed that phase easily thanks to the hard work of our dedicated leaders. We need the same understanding and empathy during the period when the caste system is being broken. Uttar Pradesh is the most sensitive state from this perspective, and they must be especially cautious here. The SP-BSP government has to be careful here. We are happy to learn that the cabinet that Mulayam Singh's has announced shows representation from all caste groups. What flaws there are, can be removed later. This government must refrain from the showing favors and taking revenge. For the first time in history, scheduled castes and backward groups have formed a government. It is natural for the higher castes to have all kinds of misgivings. To remove these suspicions, the SP-BSP government must debut the new politics of impartiality, hard work, tolerance and wide-spread collaboration.
