The Maribor prosecutor had to hand the case over to the Ljubljana prosecutor because the seat of the Defense Ministry is in Ljubljana. As we have learned, Tomaz Miklavcic has still not received the aggravating material, but when he does receive it he will assess whether it is ready for [word indistinct]. He has enough time for such an assessment, according to internal regulations, as he himself claims, up to six months. If he initiates further investigations, this period could be as long as four years, which applies to suspicion of an act punishable by up to one year in prison. The public prosecutor's office is a hierarchically organized institution, and if the procedure lasts too long the senior Ljubljana prosecutor Pavle Dolenc may demand that the municipal prosecutor speed up the matter. In order to avoid that altogether, he may take over the matter himself. The republican public prosecutor, Anton Drobnic, may also intervene. The development of these events may, for some people, serve as another occasion to assess to what extent our state is based on the rule of law. We do not know how quickly the Public Prosecutor's Office will react. On this occasion, let us recall that recently, in some other case, the Ljubljana public prosecutor reacted very quickly. The question is of how the aggravating material reached the public before the Ljubljana public prosecutor received them. Is the Post Office alone to blame? We would have to have this in mind, for the Maribor prosecutor stated that we should certainly take care about the country's reputation abroad and make legal distinction between aid to victims of aggression and violations committed from gainful motives.
