According to municipal firemen, an earlier explosion of a dynamite charge injured three persons and destroyed a tower northeast of this capital, which has a population of more than 1 million. Another tower in the town of San Cristobal, south of the capital, was damaged by a bomb that exploded at approximately 2130 (0330 GMT). The firemen have said that there is no confirmation of whether the first reported explosion was produced by a dynamite attack. The downing of the power pylons produced blackouts in the capital and in Solola and Chimaltenango Departments in the west and in Jutiapa and Santa Rosa Departments in the southeast of this Central American country, the only country in the area where guerrilla violence continues. The attacks are taking place on the eve of a strike by 200,000 state employees; in the absence of Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who is staying overnight in Honduras; and only 48 hours prior to a referendum to reform the Constitution to advance the legislative elections.
