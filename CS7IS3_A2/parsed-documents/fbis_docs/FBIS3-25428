The monthly trade surplus in January fell 46 per cent to R[rand]1,065-billion from R1,979-billion in December 1993 but was up on the surplus in the same month last year of R954-million. Imports grew 9.5 per cent to R4,693-billion last month against R4,286-billion in the previous month, while exports dropped eight per cent to R5,757-billion from R6,265-billion. However, analysts said the first month of the year was traditionally quiet for exporters, pointing out January 1994's total exports were higher than January 1993's exports of R5,097-billion. Imports increased largely due to a 35 per cent surge in the import of machinery and mechanical appliances to R1,631-billion in January compared to the same month last year. Economists said this was mainly due to plant replacement and the higher import propensity which accompanies economic recovery, currently being experienced by the country. Imports of base metals, and precious and semi-precious stones were also substantially higher, as were the imports of animal or vegetable fats and oils. Most export categories registered increases over the equivalent month in 1993, but the export of precious and semi-precious stones slid to R277-million last month compared to R400.6-million in January last year.
