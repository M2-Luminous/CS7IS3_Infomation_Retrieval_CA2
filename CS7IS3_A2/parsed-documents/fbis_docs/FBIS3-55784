Shaymiyev expressed the opinion that if Kazan and Moscow sign a treaty before the additional elections to the Russian parliament scheduled for March 13, then Tatarstan's people will actively participate in the voting. Elections did not take place on Tatarstan's territory on December 12 because less than 30 percent of electors came to the electoral districts. "The factor of an agreement will play its decisive role in this issue and will finally determine whether the republics' representatives are elected to the Federation Council and State Duma," announced Shaymiyev. To this effect he expressed conviction that the treaty would be signed before March 13 and Tatarstan "will be represented in the new parliament." According to Shaymiyev, relations between Kazan and Moscow should be grounded on the Basic Laws of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan and should be "agreement-constitutional ones." Commenting on the Russian president's speech at the Federation Council's session, Shaymiyev said that "he met with great satisfaction the thesis stating that a strong Russia should consist of strong regions." "One should not fear to transfer authorities to the regions because as of today none of the regions tries to violate Russia's integrity," said Shaymiyev.
