Upon his arrival at Skopje's Petrovac airport, van den Broek stated that he was bringing some positive messages to Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and the government. On the other hand, he added, much remained to be done, but in any case a dialogue must be restored in the forseeable future.
