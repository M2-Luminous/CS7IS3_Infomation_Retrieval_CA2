How does the SZDSZ think we should represent our often-mentioned national interests in a different, more effective way? [Szent-Ivanyi] [passage omitted] There are a few important areas where consensus among political parties has fractured -- primarily between the government and the opposition and the government and the SZDSZ. The most important is Hungary's foreign policy with its neighbors. In this field, we think that the Hungarian Government's policy has not achieved its aim. It could not effectively contribute to the improvement of the situation of Hungarians beyond the borders, while our relations with several neighbors have significantly deteriorated--which has served neither Hungary's interests nor the interests of Hungarians who live there. Therefore, we have been proposing for more than a year to put this policy with our neighbors on a new basis, to reestablish balance between the protection of minority rights, the support of minorities, and bilateral ties. This is a point where revival is needed by all means. We could not entirely agree with the government's security policy endeavors either. Fundamentally, of course, we agree that Hungary needs security, and it has to be found somewhere within the existing European structures. It has not been debated. However, the government has strongly concentrated on the acquisition of external guarantees. It would not have been wrong on its own, if they had managed to acquire these external guarantees--for example, NATO membership or a guarantee undertaken by NATO. It would have really contributed to Hungary's security. Unfortunately, it was clear that NATO, the leading European countries, and the United States are not ready to give these guarantees. So it follows that we have to reconsider our security policy and lay emphasis on new elements--for example, in Hungary's foreign policy conduct, in our relations with neighboring countries, in Hungary's economic integration with European institutions and with European countries. A rather strange debate has evolved about NATO membership. Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that all those who want Hungary to be a NATO member should vote for the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. Gyula Horn, chairman of the socialists wants a referendum on the matter. In the meantime, it has became quite clear the NATO does not want to admit us at all. [Szent-Ivanyi] As regards Jeszenszky's remark, I cannot consider it anything else but a campaign trick. [passage omitted] Horn's opinion could be worth considering, but we are very far from a referendum for the time being. It would be ridiculous to hold a referendum about Hungary's joining NATO when NATO has no willingness to accept us. [passage omitted] [Barat] In your view, what sort of policy should be followed in connection with NATO's role in Bosnia? [Szent-Ivanyi] The truth is that Hungarian foreign policy has no clear line in this issue, and this confuses our partners. Earlier on, the Hungarian Government very resolutely took the position of urging strong intervention and tough sanctions. I think that this was a slightly stronger position than we should have adopted considering our special situation. [passage omitted] Now, it seems as if Hungarian foreign policy has taken a different direction, thereby endangering the image of being reliable. Jeszenszky's visit to Belgrade and his statements there in connection with sanctions caused doubt regarding Hungary's political reliability. The statements of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross about the AWACS planes are also similar. Boross wanted to formulate correct objectives but put it in a way that can be very easily misinterpreted. We have to bear in mind three objectives: First, we have to reassure the Hungarian public that Hungary will not get involved in a crisis. This is correct. Second, it is worth making a gesture toward Belgrade, for the interests of the Hungarians living there require this. However, there is also a third objective, which has been ignored by both Jeszenszky and Boross. We wish to cooperate with the European organizations and the United Nations, and it is not expedient to confuse the image formed about us. [passage omitted] If NATO wants to extend the original mandate it does indeed have to turn to us, to the Hungarian parliament and not to the prime minister, and the parliament has to make a decision. [passage omitted] Let us not forget that the AWACS planes mean the first and only concrete military cooperation between Hungary and NATO. Since Hungary wanted the Partnership for Peace and expressed willingness for cooperation, it is a confusing signal that she wants to cancel the only existing cooperation, in fact, without any particular reason. [Barat] Well, yes, but Partnership for Peace is not a war partnership, either in name or in content. [Szent-Ivanyi] I agree. If NATO wants to transform this assignment to a warlike partnership, then NATO cannot oblige us to agree, and we must not accept it either.
