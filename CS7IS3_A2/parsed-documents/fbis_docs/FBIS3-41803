Two other students -- men aged 18 and 20 -- are being treated for the disease which can be passed on by close contact such as kissing or by sharing a glass. Doctors have reported eight cases of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia since the beginning of October instead of the normal two to four cases for the time of the year. Of the eight, three are students at Southhampton Institute of Higher Education and two at Southhampton University. Two further cases involved a young girl and a baby, and the eighth case was brought in from outside the area. A spokeswoman for Southampton University Hospitals' Trust said two of the five students were now well. Of the other three students both the men were improving, but the 19-year-old woman was "critical" in intensive care. None of the other cases was said to be in any danger.
