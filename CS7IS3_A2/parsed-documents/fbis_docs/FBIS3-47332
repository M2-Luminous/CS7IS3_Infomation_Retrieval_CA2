The move has been made in response to an agreement Japan made with the United States and European nations at GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round), which was concluded late last year. In the trade talks, these nations demanded Japan lower its tariffs on leather and leather shoes. MITI plans to request a total 4.8 billion yen allocation from the fiscal year 1994 budget. Concerning tariffs on leather and leather shoes, Japan currently imposes a preliminary tariff of 15-27 percent on import volumes under a certain limit and a secondary tariff of 60 percent on those above this limit. This high tariff rate is designed to protect the domestic leather industry. However, Japan agreed with other GATT member nations at the Uruguay Round talks to reduce preliminary and secondary tariff rates on such products by 20 and 50 percent, respectively. Consequently, it is expected that imports will now increase and domestic businesses will face hard times. As a step to help stabilize domestic businesses, the Japan Federation of Leather Industries and Japan Tanners' Association have separately set up funds. Firms belonging to the two organizations have used profits made through utilization of the funds to finance research and development of new technologies. So far, MITI has extended a total of over 7 billion yen to the two funds since the tariff quota system was introduced.
