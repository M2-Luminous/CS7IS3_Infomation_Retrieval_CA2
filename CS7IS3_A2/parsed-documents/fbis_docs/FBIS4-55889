But what they do know how to do, is to pressure television and blame it for the politicians' negative media image. "Politicians have major problems in communicating what they have to say. As a general rule, it is hard to make them provide concise statements that would be within the time limit they have been assigned" -- says Adam Pieczynski, chief of "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast]. He adds that because television has to cut out some of the material (which is necessary in such cases), it makes television information programs vulnerable to the accusation of manipulating politicians. Piotr Zaremba, chief of the news department of Polish Television's Channel 1, agrees with the view: "There are very few politicians who are able to communicate their thoughts succinctly and appropriately" -- Zaremba notes. According to him, there are no more than a handful of political activists who come through well on television -- he lists Ryszard Bugaj, Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Kazimierz Ujazdowski. "From among the political parties, politicians for the Democratic Left Alliance definitely know best how to present themselves on television. It is clear that they have worked on their statements to ensure that they are concise, and without a tone of aggression or holding something against somebody" -- Zaremba says. But when it comes to politicians for the Polish Peasant Party, Zaremba says they portray themselves much worse. "They do not know how to act in front of the camera, they are embarrassed and shy. Their bad image is later explained with television's alleged dislike of them" -- Zaremba says. "My assessment of politicians' capability to present themselves on television is a `C minus'" -- says Wiadomosci's Tomasz Lis. He adds that he is bothered by the fact that politicians do not understand the rules governing television or what the viewers expect from it. "A politician for the coalition proposes time-slots for the government in prime time. He does not understand the disastrous effect this may have both for him and for television's image" -- Lis says. In his view, the current pressures exerted on television may cause a loss of its credibility which has been worked on so hard over the past four years. Piotr Zaremba also agrees with the view that politicians do not understand the rules governing television: "Recently, the `Convention' program was taken off the television schedule. In it, representatives of a few political parties spoke out, and it was broadcast on Friday evenings. The program was very poorly made and its audience was at zero level. But its elimination caused massive protests by various parties -- mainly from outside parliament -- to the effect that the last place from which they can address society, is being taken away from them. This is proof of a complete lack of understanding the fact that in order to address viewers, one must first get their attention" -- Zaremba says.
