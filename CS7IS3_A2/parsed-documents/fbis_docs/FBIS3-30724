Esteemed gentlemen, in my letter of 5 February, I informed you about the massacre of civilians that took place that day at the Sarajevo market. Unfortunately, the statement by the responsible officials in the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] indicates that the revulsion felt by the world and the readiness for action will again be amortized by a prolonged investigation as to the origin of the shell [words indistinct], offers for yet another futile cease-fire, and statements about the necessity of establishing peace acceptable to both sides, and so on. I am afraid that the debate will focus on one shell, and thus divert the world's attention from the more than 300,000 shells that have been fired on this city during the 22 months of the siege. It is not true that over 400 artillery pieces on the hills around Sarajevo are to serve as the Serb defense against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are there for blackmail purposes and to inflict suffering on the civilian population, to halt the life in the city, and to force us into making unacceptable concessions to the aggressor. Of the 9,872 people killed in the shelling of the city, only 164 have been soldiers. Some 1,563 children have been killed and 278 pregnant women. Some 57,897 civilians have been wounded, and over 19,000 of those are maimed for live. Approximately 10,000 apartments and 30,000 places of work have been destroyed or damaged. The city maternity hospital was set ablaze with precise and persistent fire, as were the National Library, the Institute for Oriental Studies, the depot and all the tramways and city buses. The city hospital has been hit 267 times, and nine doctors and 16 patients have been killed. All the churches, mosques, and synagogues in the city have suffered hits and damage. All the Olympic sports facilities have been destroyed, as have the Assembly and government buildings. There is not a single building, school, or university building in the city that has not been hit. Schooling is being conducted in improvised schoolrooms. All the hotels have been destroyed, and the Holiday Inn is the only one open, even though it has been damaged. The UN Protection Force building is a frequent target for artillery attacks. Gentlemen, this city has been in hell for over 700 days. It is time the Serb machine for killing people and destroying shrines, schools, and hospitals is stopped and removed. I appeal to you to inform the members of your organizations of the contents of this letter. This is said in the letter that President Alija Izetbegovic sent to Karolos Papoulias and Manfred Woerner.
