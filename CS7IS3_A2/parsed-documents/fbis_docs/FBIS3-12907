The PLO had announced in a statement made by President Yasir 'Arafat that there will be no return to the negotiations before the Security Council issues a resolution guaranteeing the Palestinian civilians' protection and the disarming of the settlers. Nasir al-Qudwah answered questions we posed to him during a conversation conducted via satellite link tonight. [Begin recording] [Al-Qudwah] As far we are concerned, we are doing our utmost to ensure that a Security Council resolution is adopted as soon as possible. Later today there will be a meeting of the representatives of the Arab group and the Islamic group with the same aim, namely to ensure that the Security Council acts swiftly to adopt a resolution. I still have no information and therefore cannot be sure of the exact time when this will happen. We hope it will occur very soon, if not today then tomorrow, God willing. ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, the Palestinians are demanding that the Security Council adopt a resolution providing for the protection of the Palestinians and disarming the settlers before the negotiations are resumed, as Mr. 'Arafat declared. What are the attitudes of the Security Council members to this Palestinian demand? [Al-Qudwah] True, this is part of the Palestinian demands that we submitted at the start and to which we still totally adhere. The Security Council members are generally supportive of our demands, which they regard as just. Regrettably there were disagreements from the start with the U.S. delegation. We tried, however, through some hard negotiating last week, to find solutions acceptable to both parties. We have had some success but have not yet agreed on a final text. ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke of a tentative U.S. approval of an international presence in the occupied territories. Why is a resolution being delayed, then? [Al-Qudwah] There are still some points on which we did not reach agreement in our discussions with the U.S. delegation. These points include Jerusalem's legal status as part of the occupied Palestinian territory. This is a matter on which we can make no concessions whatsoever. Another point is the mechanism by which the implementation of the resolution will be followed up. As for the issue of international protection, we have succeeded in generally agreeing on the wording. In accordance with this, the United States has agreed to an international presence in the occupied Palestinian territories. [end recording] MBC Television posed a question to Israel's representative at the United Nations Gad Ya'aqobi about Israel's reasons for hindering the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, particularly after it failed to protect the worshipers. [Begin Ya'aqobi recording] We strongly support the Security Council meeting and a swift resolution because we believe that this issue must be dealt with and finished with so that the negotiations can be resumed and a decision made to implement the two parties' agreements, including the Cairo Agreement. [end recording] Ya'aqobi affirmed that Israel does not oppose any steps to protect the Palestinians, but he said he believes that the quickest way to provide this protection is by resuming the negotiations so that a Palestinian police force can be established to carry out its tasks in cooperation with the Israeli forces, as he put it. He repeated that Israel has accepted the principle of an international presence in the occupied territories and noted that this phrase will be included in the resolution which the Security Council will issue. He stated, however, that Israel will not agree to renegotiating the Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement, warning that this would only hinder the talks and obstruct the implementation of the agreements.
