The Comoran opposition in France reiterated this call at a rally in Paris yesterday afternoon. At the end of the rally, the opposition spokesman in France, Abdallah Ahmed Mohamed, talked to reporter Youssoufou Saliou Mohamed: [Begin Mohamed recording] This rally was necessary because an important document was published in Moroni on 17 January by all Comoran opposition parties grouped into a forum for national redress. This forum clearly and loudly asked President Djohar to step down and today we want to sensitize the entire Comoran community to that fact. All the people invited to this rally agreed to come in great numbers in order to demand the resignation of the head of state, to fight for the respect of the principle of human rights and democratic liberties as well as the establishment of a genuine law-abiding state. President Djohar along with his son-in-law, (Mshangama), will miss no occasion to violate the principles of the Constitution. Moreover, President Djohar's son-in-law, (Mshangama), maneuvered to be elected and undertook a true coup de force to be elected speaker of the National Assembly. Right at this moment, many opponents are imprisoned and this is the case of a parliamentarian who was regularly elected in the first round of the legislative elections at (Moutamoudou), namely Mr. Ahmed Mohamed. We believe that this wave of arrests is a serious breach of human rights principles and one of the main grievances of the opposition today is the demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners.
