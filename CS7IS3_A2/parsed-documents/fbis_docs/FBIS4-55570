FBIS4-55570 "dreeu096_d_94011" FBIS-EEU-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 SLOVAKIA SIS Role in Screening Certificates Questioned SIS Role in Screening Certificates Questioned AU1705162194 AU1705162194 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 14 May on page 4 carries an 800-word interview with legal expert Ernest Valko, former chairman of the CSFR Constitutional Court, by Jana Pankovcinova, entitled "After 20 January 1994, the Slovak Information Service [SIS] Is No Longer Entitled To Issue Screening Certificates." In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Valko argues that, after 20 January 1994, the SIS is no longer entitled to issue screening certificates and that any screening certificates issued after that date are illegal. As the interviewer observes, the continued issue of screening certificates by the SIS was admitted by SIS Director Vladimir Mitro in an interview published in the 12 May issue of the Bratislava daily NOVY CAS. Valko explains that, on 20 April 1993, the Meciar government authorized the SIS to issue screening certificates; the validity of the then government resolution was limited to nine months, however, so this authorization expired on 20 January 1994. The expert asserts that there is currently no body in Slovakia that is entitled to carry out screening and that any certificates issued by the SIS after 20 January 1994 are "invalid." He even contends that those who received a positive screening certificate after that date can sue the SIS "because the SIS did not have the right to issue those certificates, and it was its responsibility to let it be known that it no longer has this authority."
