SACOB's business confidence index [BCI] improved by one percentage point to 104.9 from 103.9 in November last year. Releasing the data, chief economist Ben van Rensburg however warned that political electioneering before the polls in April could result in uncertainty over economic policy and thus harm confidence. Electioneering had not helped to bring any clarity to economic policy and would increase uncertainty as political campaigns intensified. Reconciling populist strategies aimed at winning votes with realistic policies which would promote business confidence was difficult for many of the political players. Dr Van Rensburg said a key measure of this type of uncertainty was the capital account which experienced outflows of about R[rand]15-billion last year. The index was higher over the last two months as a result of an improvement in seven of the 13 sub-indices which make up the BCI. - Stock market prices continued to reach new highs, - The value of building plans passed climbed markedly, - Real retail sales were higher on a monthly seasonally adjusted basis, - Short-term interest rates edged lower, and - The gold price firmed on international markets. Negative influences on the BCI included: - The number of new passenger vehicles sold eased, - The volume of merchandise imports were lower, - The exchange rate of the commercial rand against the US dollar worsened, and - The official inflation rate increased slightly. Although the economy was definitely in the recovery stage, Dr Van Rensburg stressed it was vital to achieve a political inclusive settlement. This would bolster business and consumer confidence leading to an easing in capital outflows as well as underpinning the economy. SACOB has forecast a growth rate of between two and 2.5 per cent this year following on the economy's contraction over the last four years.
