But UN troops had still not been allowed to go free, UNPROFOR's Captain Eric Chaperon said, adding that there was still no news of Canadian and French UN troops still being held. Chaperon said tension had lowered in the area, where Bosnian Serb forces have harassed UN forces in recent days since NATO air strikes against the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. On Thursday the Serb forces tried to seize heavy weapons grouped under UNPROFOR control following a February 9 ultimatum for them to withdraw from the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. Chaperon said Friday that reports indicated there was a "relaxed atmosphere" at weapons collection sites after the Bosnian Serb withdrawal. He said UN forces were no longer on full alert. The Bosnian Serbs, angry at the NATO strikes on Gorazde, had been threatening a French battalion at Krivoglavci, to the northwest of the Bosnian capital, with a tank. The report came as UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg held face-to-face talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his Pale headquarters. The talks, the first since the crisis sparked by the Gorazde strikes, were reportedly aimed at discussing a cease-fire.
