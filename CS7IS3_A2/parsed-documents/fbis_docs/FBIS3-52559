The statement says that oppression, coercion, displacement, imprisonment, and torture are the main characteristics dominating the people of Sudan. The regime is also fanning the flames of the civil war, which it falsely calls jihad, and flagrantly encroaching on the rights of the Sudanese in ways that the Sudanese people have never experienced before, even during the era of colonialism. [passage omitted] In a similar statement, the Ummah Party said the independence anniversary comes at a time when the military regime in Khartoum, despite international condemnation for human right violations, is continuing the oppression, pursuit, physical liquidation, and torture of its opponents. The statement said the regime is continuing to fan the flames of the civil war, which is a scourge that is crushing citizens in the south.
