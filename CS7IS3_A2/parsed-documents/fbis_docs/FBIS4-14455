He said priority would be given to the building of submarines, cruisers and anti-submarine warships with a displacement tonnage of 10,000-12,000 tons and medium-class vessels such as destroyers and patrol ships with a displacement tonnage of 4,000-5,000 tons. On the future of Russia's aircraft carrier fleet, Kasatonov said that out of the three carriers it had, only one, Felix Kuznetsov, was on combat duty in the Pacific. The second carrier, Varyag, is 85 percent complete, but he said there was no money to finish the project at the moment. More disturbingly, the carrier is under construction at Nikolyayev shipyards belonging to Ukraine, which is also cash-starved, Kasatonov said. As for the third carrier, Ulyanovsk, it is yet to be assembled, he said. Nonetheless, the admiral believes the current trend of building aircraft carriers will persist though Russia cannot afford this at present. At the same time if other CIS states are ready to help finance the program, Moscow will welcome this, Kasatonov said.
