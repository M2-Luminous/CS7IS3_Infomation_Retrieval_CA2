FR941017-0-00035 FR941017-0-00011 Section 880.4␣(Redesignated 880.12)␣Cooperative Agreements This section was revised to state clearly the roles of OSM, States, Indian tribes, and other Federal agencies when extinguishing or controlling coal formation fires under the authority of these regulations. Paragraph 880.12 (a) states that OSM shall, upon application by a State or Indian tribe with an approved abandoned mine reclamation program, enter into a cooperative agreement with the State or Indian tribe to control or extinguish fires in coal formations. One commenter noted that it did not see a need for OSM to enter into a cooperative agreement with States or Indian tribes that already have existing approved abandoned mine reclamation programs. It argued the outcrop coal fire projects should be handled via the same process as any other ``simplified grant project.'' The commenter went on to say that it can see no practical reason to establish a new procedural framework for this type of activity. The establishment of a new cooperative agreement by OSM to address coal outcrop fires does not comply with Executive Order 12778 which directs Federal agencies to promote ``simplification and burden reduction.'' OSM has not accepted this comment. Congress directed that OSM shall, upon application by a State or Indian tribe having an approved abandoned mine land program, enter into a cooperative agreement with that State or Indian tribe to control or extinguish coal formation fires. While OSM is committed to simplifying its procedures, OSM believes it is not appropriate to use AML simplified grants to fund projects under the authority of the Act of August 31, 1954, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to extinguish or control fires in coal formations. Congress did not identify a source of funds for such projects to extinguish or control fires in coal formations. OSM anticipates that if funds are made available in the future, they will be used to address fires not eligible for AML funding. AML funds cannot be used to address fires on lands not eligible for AML funding such as outcrop fires where no prior mining has occurred. Since the simplified grants are used to fund eligible AML projects, OSM does not want to mix funds for eligible and ineligible AML projects in one funding mechanism. Also, quite likely, these cooperative agreements will have to contain provisions unique to the coal formation fire control program. Paragraph 880.12(b) authorizes OSM to conduct the fire control projects in those States and with those Indian tribes not having an approved abandoned mine reclamation program. However, upon application by such a State or Indian tribe, OSM may enter into a cooperative agreement with the State or Indian tribe to fund the control or extinguishment of fires in coal formations. The Act of August 31, 1954, requires that if a coal fire is in an inactive coal mine on lands now owned or controlled by the United States or any of its agencies, except where the project is necessary for the protection of lands or other property owned or controlled by the United States or any of its agencies, that: (1) the State or Indian tribe or the person owning or controlling such lands contribute on a matching basis 50 percent of the cost of planning and executing such project; or (2) if the State or Indian tribe or the person furnishes evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of an inability immediately to make the matching contribution, that such State or Indian tribe or person pay the Government, within such time as the Secretary shall determine, an amount equal to 50 percent of the cost of planning and executing such project. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 waived this requirement in States or Indian tribes with an approved abandoned mine reclamation program. The same commenter noted that it believes the intent of Congress (in the 1992 Energy Policy Act) was to make Federal funds available for the total cost of abatement of coal fires on all lands in the United States. OSM does not accept this comment. OSM is proposing 100 percent Federal funding for extinguishment of fires in States or Indian tribes having approved AML programs and on Federal lands. Fire abatement on other lands would be funded by a 50/50 cost-share approach. Paragraph 880.12(b) pertains only to those States or Indian tribes not having an approved AML program. As stated above, Congress only waived the requirement for cost sharing on non-Federal lands for States or Indian tribes having approved AML programs.
