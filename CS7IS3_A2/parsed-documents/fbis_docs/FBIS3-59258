The central government took macroeconomic control and regulatory measures but instead of being reined in, the overall social retail price index actually continues to climb. How should we interpret this situation and what actions should we take as a response? Recently we interviewed Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan [1728 0587 0337], an expert on prices, and asked him to comment on price trends and the next stage of price reform in China. Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan is currently director and a researcher with the Finance, Trade, and Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He is also a professor and supervisor of doctoral studies at the graduate school of the academy, and vice president of the China Prices Society. He has been studying the issue of prices for years and has written several books, including Socialist Price Theory and Price Reform and Selected Works of Zhang Zhuoyuan, and hundreds of scholarly articles. He is well known in academic circles at home and abroad. Is It Normal for Prices To Rise Just as Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Gets Under Way? Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan began by briefly describing the current situation on the price front. Before June this year when the central government took macroeconomic regulatory and control measures, fixed assets investment continued to expand with no letup. Coming on top of the raid expansion in 1992, this resulted in an overheated economy, releasing the inflationary pressures that had been building up for the past several years. The overall social retail price index climbed every month, up 10.2 percent between January and June alone. Prices of capital goods also soared, up 21.7 percent by May from the beginning of the year. The price of steel used in construction at one point hit 4,300 yuan per ton, significantly higher than the price on the international market. Meanwhile, the exchange rate of the renminbi on the foreign exchange regulatory market plummeted. On 1 June the government decontrolled prices on the foreign exchange regulatory market. By late June the exchange rate had dropped to $1:11 yuan. The plunge would have continued had not the government intervened in time. Interest rates on the market and the black market surged, with the annual interest rate reaching 20 percent or so in most cases, vastly higher than those charged by banks. The explosion of real estate prices was stunning; the prices of undeveloped land rose in an endless spiral, doubling and redoubling again and again. Faced with this grim economic situation and galloping inflation, the Chinese Government tightened its macroeconomic regulatory and control measures beginning in June to cool the economy, check inflation, and prevent prices from rising too rapidly. Among other things, it clamped a tight lid on the scale of credit and the money supply, strictly limiting the amount of currency issued in 1993 to within 150 billion yuan. It cracked down on illegal capital-raising; demanded that banks collect the funds they had lent in violation of the law within a specified period; raised the interest rates charged by banks; and revived value-guaranteed savings. It demanded that the Bank of China become a true central bank and get out of business dealings in the future. It raised the interest rates on treasury bonds this year and speeded up their sales. It tightened its management of the real estate market, imposed controls on foreign exchange and reformed the foreign exchange retention and utilization system, selling foreign exchange on the foreign exchange regulatory control to hold down exchange rates. Party and government organs at all levels were prohibited from going into business with no exception in a draconian step to stop state organs and their affiliates from collecting all sorts of fees arbitrarily under all sorts of pretexts by using their office, etc. In the professor's opinion, it is essential that the government took these measures. Had the government not acted, the development of the entire economy would have ben affected, as would reform. More than two months later, the above-mentioned measures have begun to pay off, as demonstrated mainly by the following: The upsurge in industrial expansion, hitherto excessive, has retreated. In July the output value of industrial enterprises at the township level and above nationwide rose 25.1 percent compared to the same period last year, but was 5.1 percentage points down from the preceding month. The average daily output value was off 15.4 percent from the level a year ago. For the entire January-July period, the gross value of industrial output was still 25.1 percent higher than the corresponding period last year. In fixed assets investment, fewer new projects were launched. In July, the number of capital construction projects and modernization and transformation projects was off by 6,372 compared to the previous month. The boom in real estate and development zones has begun to cool off. The consumer goods market continued to stabilize and flourish. The trading of capital goods began to slacken, with the volume of transactions heading downward. The supply-demand gap for major materials has narrowed. Prices fell and inventories continued to rise. The regulatory exchange rate of renminbi rose, stabilizing at about $1:8.8 yuan currently, which represents a 20 percent appreciation for the Chinese currency since it hit a record low in late June. Exports rebounded. According to customs statistics, there was a 6.5 percent gain in exports in July compared to the same period last year, while a drop of 9.1 percent was recorded for the preceding month. Household savings surged. In July new urban and rural household savings deposits amounted to 40.5 billion yuan, 26.9 billion yuan more than the same month a year ago, reversing a downward trend. At the same time, however, prices continued to climb because of the delayed effects of inflation. Retail prices jumped 13.9 percent in July, pushing the retail price index up 10.8 percent for the January-July period. Workers' cost of living index rose 12.8 percent in just the January-June period, and 14 percent from January through July. In the 35 large- and medium-sized cities, the workers' cost of living was a high 23.3 percent by July; for the entire January through July period, it was 18.2 percent. Can the central government's macroeconomic regulatory and control measures check inflation effectively? Just how long would prices keep on going up? Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan has offered an analysis of price movements for the remaining few months of 1993 and 1994. What Is the Optimal Meeting Point? As Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan sees it, the introduction of intensified macroeconomic regulatory and control measures would not tame inflation any time soon. The reason is that it usually takes six months or so for macroeconomic changes to be reflected in prices. In the first few months, therefore, prices may continue to go up. He expects inflation to ease notably only after October. When the central government acted to toughen macroeconomic regulation and control, its goal was to cool the economy gradually after a period of adjustment, restore balance to the overall volume of the macroeconomy, and then bring inflation under control effectively after a time lag, slowing the rate of price increases. Specifically, if we manage to keep fixed assets investment, new bank lending, and the increase in the money supply below 1,000 billion yuan, 400 billion yuan, and 150 billion yuan, respectively, this year, and if we can hold the rate of increase of the gross value of industrial output at 20 percent or below and the annual growth rate of gross output value at 10 percent or so, then the nation's overall retail price index for 1993 may stay below 12 percent. In other words, we can hold the nation's overall retail price index for the second half of 1993 below 14 percent. At the same time, the exchange rate of the renminbi will hold steady at $1:9 yuan or so. That way a little more fine-tuning is all we need to do in 1994 to further stabilize the economy and hold the rate of price increases to within two digits. One other scenario is conceivable, however. If the government's macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are resisted by local governments and some enterprises and therefore are not really carried through or if these units go along with them half-heartedly at the beginning only to relapse into their old ways later by going around the red light, thus preventing the economy from staging a soft-landing and reigniting the investment explosion, then the government's original economic adjustment objectives will not be met. In that case, we will have difficulty controlling inflation and prices will continue to rise. Specifically, suppose total investment exceeds 1,000 billion yuan by a wide margin; new bank loans surpass 400 billion yuan, perhaps even reaching 500 billion yuan; the amount of currency issued goes beyond 150 billion yuan; the gross value of industrial output remains at a high level, hitting 25 percent or even higher, and the gross value of output expands 13 percent, 14 percent this year. Suppose too that retail prices surge 20 percent nationwide in the second half of 1993 and the exchange rate falls back to $1:10 yuan. If all that comes to pass, the government would have no choice but to adjust the national economy more radically in 1994 so as to re-stabilize it. And that will come with a steeper price. Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan pointed out that the first scenario is a more likely outcome. The war on corruption being waged nationwide in particular will help us reach the various targets as required in the first scenario. Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan noted that since there is a relationship of mutual substitution between inflation and economic growth, which means that when the economy expands too rapidly, it will inevitably trigger off notable inflation, we must find the best meeting point between a high rate of economic growth a sustainable rate of price increases as a major point of reference for the central government as it regulates and controls the macroeconomy. Bearing in mind the conditions in China, he suggested the following meeting point for the nation as a whole in the next one to two decades: average annual economic growth rate around 9 percent and prices increasing 6 percent on the average annually, not more than 10 percent at most. Assuming that he has located the best meeting point and that the Chinese economy more or less behaves as it should, China would still lead Asia and the world in economic growth rate, ensuring the achievement of the strategic objectives it has set for itself by the end of the century, thereby realizing a fairly comfortable standard of living. What is more, China will match the economic development level of moderately developed nations by the second or third decade of the next century. It seems that this is a promising path that would lead to accelerated economic growth amid stability. What Next Step Should We Take in Price Reform? When you discuss the current price movements, you naturally have to talk about price reform. After 14 years of price reform, Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan said, China has taken big strides in the transition toward a market price system and made substantive progress. The market mechanism has begun to play a leading role in the formation of commodity prices. A distorted price structure has improved significantly. Measured against the requirements of developing a socialist market economy, however, price reform has not been completed. Under the central government's plan to tighten macroeconomic control and regulation, price reform is scheduled to slow down for a certain period of time. In the long haul, however, price reform must be pursued with vigor as well as a steady hand. How then are we to further price reform in the future? Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan put forward the following four proposals. First, decontrol the prices of those products ready to enter the competitive market. As of now there are still prices which should be deregulated but have not, including the prices of a number of leading commodities such as energy products, including centrally allocated coal and finished oil; raw materials such as steel and non-ferrous metallic products; chemical industrial products such as basic chemical industrial products, chemical industrial raw materials, chemical fertilizers, chemical fibers, and plastics; construction materials such as cement; heavy-duty mechanical products; light and textile industrial products, and a handful of agricultural products under contract procurement. The reasons are extremely complex. For starters, there is the fear that once these prices are decontrolled, the overall price level would shoot up so much so that it would be burdensome for enterprises and households alike. Secondly, the market is still immature. Industry-based monopolies and regional separatism have impeded the formation of a unified market and hence more standardized market-regulated prices. Thirdly, to protect their own vested interests, some departments have balked at delegating power, so on and so forth. It seems that even with a more enthusiastic attitude, it will take us two to three years to gradually decontrol those prices which should be deregulated but have not so far. Second, we must further rationalize prices under government control. A number of key commodities are still underpriced, so the task of price adjustment remains an arduous one. For instance, the government should set the prices of crude oil and natural gas in a centralized manner. Moreover, it should raise their planned prices substantially, from the present 200 yuan or so per ton to more than 700 yuan to bring them in line with international market prices. Rail freight charges should be more or less doubled, which would increase the freight per ton/kilometer from 3.85 fen to about 6 fen. The prices of government-procured grains and those sold to consumers also must be raised. Public housing rents are clearly on the low side at present; they too must go up. Price adjustments will involve huge sums of money. The adjustment of the prices of crude oil and natural gas and rail freights alone, for instance, would mean an additional 50 billion yuan changing hands. This cannot be accomplished overnight. If we try to do it in one fell swoop, the overall price level would jump a dozen percentage points, which would be socially unacceptable. Therefore we must phase them in step by step, doing everything we could to straighten out the prices mentioned above within five years or so without, however, touching off a round of double-digit inflation. Furthermore, we must gradually let the market regulate the prices of capital goods. Among such prices, the most important are interest, the price of funds, otherwise known as capital, labor wages, land prices and rents, and exchange rates between the renminbi and foreign currencies. In accordance with the requirements of developing a socialist market economy, they all should be formed and regulated by the market so that the most essential market signals would not be distorted and the improvement of the efficiency of resource allocation would not be hindered. Zhang Zhuoyuan singled out interest rates, the prices of funds, the foremost capital goods, for special discussion. Calling funds the scarcest economic resource in every market economy, he pointed out that having the market determine interest rates is the first step in having the market determine the prices of capital goods. In a socialist market economy, interest rates are the most essential lever available to the government for regulating the macroeconomy. To ensure able, coordinated, and effective economic growth, the government must regulate interest rates. In an overheated economy, for example, the rediscount rate and re-lending rate charged by the central bank must be raised to drive up interest rates on the market and hold down inflation. When the economy is too sluggish, on the contrary, the rediscount rate and re-lending interest rate charged by the central bank should be cut to push down interest rates on the market, spur investment and consumption, and bring about economic recovery and growth. Be that as it may, interest rates regulation by the government or the central bank essentially consists of regulating the base interest rates as a way of influencing market interest rates, not directly fixing or altering market interest rates. As for interest rates charged by commercial banks and other financial institutions on loans or paid by financial institutions on deposits, the government should not intervene but instead give the market a free hand in regulating them. Regarding interest rates payable by enterprise and companies as they seek to raise funds directly, the government too should take a hands-off policy and let the bonds-issuing bodies determine the interest rates to be carried by the bonds. Accordingly a distinction must be made between commercial banking and policy-oriented banking, between commercial banks and policy-oriented banks. When a loan must be made to a key infrastructural project or a project in a leading industry on preferential terms, the treasury may pay interest in the form of a deduction and take other steps to differentiate such a loan from ordinary commercial banking. Finally, we must create an effective price regulatory and control system. Both during the creation of such a system and after, we must keep the overall price level relatively stable and basically stable to ensure the stable and normal functioning of the economy. To stabilize the price level, the key is the implementation of a stable macroeconomic policy by the government. The central bank must keep a tight leash on the amount of money it puts into circulation, limiting not only the cash issued (M0), but also the supply of currency defined broadly to include cash and deposits (M1 and M2). By and large the money supply must not expand faster than the GNP. Nor should the growth rate of the money supply be excessively higher than what the monetarization of the economy requires, preferably around 5 percent. He went on to say that to ensure the stable development of the socialist market economy, we need do more than regulate interest rates, wages, and exchange rates. We must also prevent wild swings in the prices of major commodities. Toward that end, we must set up the necessary grain, energy, and raw materials reserves and establish price regulating funds, including separate regulating funds for grain and agricultural byproducts. Concomitantly, producers, traders, and consumers must be provided with signals -- market and prices -- as a guide to prevent the supply and demand as well as prices of key commodities from moving too sharply upward or down, which would hurt the sustained and coordinated development of the national economy. Furthermore, we must perfect prices-related law-making, enforce the law strictly, and establish a variety of supervisory bodies and methods. All of that is indispensable.
