The prime minister pointed out that Hungary, which inherited a ruined economy, a disintegrated society and a fallen political regime, now has a viable system of democratic institutions, and an economy based on private property. Since no party cooperating with the trade unions has ever implemented a liberal economic programme, there is a suspicion that the Socialists do not want to implement it at all. What is at stake in the elections is whether the country returns to the failed political regime or prevents the interruption of what has started -- even if with errors, difficulties and the problems of incompletion. "I trust in the instinctive wisdom of the Hungarian nation, which has never voted for the left of its own accord -- there had to be an army present," the prime minister said.
