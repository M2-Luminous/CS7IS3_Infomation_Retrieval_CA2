FBIS4-28431 "dreas112_c_94029" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 North Korea `Heinous Political Aim' Alleged `Heinous Political Aim' Alleged SK1006044294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0437 GMT 10 Jun 94 SK1006044294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["United States Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in an interview with the NBC Television on June 7 openly declared that the U.S. stand toward the nuclear issue of North Korea is to take a tough action through sanctions, according to a report. The United States is persistently crying for "sanctions", arguing that "the possibility of measurement is lost" as regards the reactor core refueling in the DPRK. The United States seeks in this a heinous political aim to bar the development of the existing nuclear power industry of the DPRK as a whole and, furthermore, stifle its socialist system. This has been proved with added clarity by the fact that the United States is these days coming out with a totally unreasonable demand for "a special inspection" of two military sites of the DPRK under the pretext of "loss of the possibility of fuel rod measurement". This demand reveals its intention to disarm the DPRK. It is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and a graphic expression of the policy of stifling it to demand "a special inspection". This can never be allowed. The current situation reminds us of that in March last year when we declared our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) against the "special inspection". If the United States throw off the veil of the DPRK-U.S. talks and resort to the strong arm, crying for "sanctions" and "special inspection", our attitude cannot but change. The United States must act with discretion, clearly seeing the firm will of our entire people and whole Army.
