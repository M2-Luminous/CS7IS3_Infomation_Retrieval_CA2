Recently, the CPC Central Committee determinedly adopted "cool down" measures with a view to slowing the pace of real estate development, reducing fixed-asset investment, and easing inflationary pressures. The State Council issued a "red-letterhead document" at the end of last January, ordering all localities to maintain effective control over real estate investment, and to standardize and guide foreign investment in China's real estate market. In addition to halting the construction of "two courses" (racecourses and golf courses), many projects for the construction of high-priced Western-style houses, office buildings, and villas also have been suspended or canceled. The Red-Letterhead Document Orders Rectification of the Real Estate Market Hong Kong investors are the "catalyst" to the mainland's real estate craze, and their investment has involved over 100 million square meters of real estate. Therefore, this new upsurge of macroeconomic control and regulation will have a considerable impact on Hong Kong businessmen who invest in real estate and on Hong Kong people who have brought residential housing on the mainland. Under the heading "Circular on Continuously Strengthening Macroeconomic Control and Regulation of Fixed-Asset Investment," the red-letterhead document calls for efforts, in the present situation marked by "overheated growth in investment and an unduly large scale of construction," to bring the country's fixed-asset investment (including commodity housing) into accord with the government plan. According to the red-letterhead document, a reduction in real estate investment and financing is the key task for the new upsurge of macroeconomic control and regulation. All investment and financing concerning real estate development and foreign-related economic development zones will be brought under the planning and control of the State Council and local governments, and projects that are not listed in the state plan cannot obtain bank financing. The Beijing authorities still welcome foreign businessmen to invest in China's real estate market, but the investment should be oriented toward the ordinary residential housing urgently needed by common urban dwellers. In another word, they should act in coordination with the housing reform on the mainland, and should build more commodity units that ordinary mainland residents can afford, not high-priced Western-style houses, villas, and holiday resorts; still less should they build racecourses or golf courses. Before the red-letterhead document was relayed to the lower levels, RENMIN RIBAO, the official newspaper of the CPC Central Committee, carried a commentator's article entitled "Preventing Blind Development in the Real Estate Industry." It noted: "At present, the scale of basic construction remains considerably great. Some localities, departments, and units have failed to act according to relevant state regulations; some exceed their examination and approval authority, while others act in their own way and start new projects blindly. As a result, the real estate market is tending to become overheated again, and the situation is extremely unfavorable to our efforts to promote national economic development and to check inflation." One can easily see from the official CPC newspaper and the red-letterhead document that failure to check the real estate craze will lead to the same "grim economic situation" as in the first half of last year. Although initial results were achieved in rectifying the bubble economy and in checking speculation in the stock, foreign exchange, and real estate markets during July and October last year, the scale of fixed-asset investment still remains unduly large, and 13 and 19.5 percent increases, respectively, have been registered in the general level of retail prices and in the retail commodity price index in 35 large and medium-sized cities. The drastic rises in commodity prices inevitably will lead to resentment on the part of the public, and are therefore unfavorable to maintaining social stability. This serves as one of the major reasons why the CPC is reemploying the "cool down" to check the real estate craze. The Cool Down Treatment Can Result in Optimizing the Structure Optimization of structure is another aim of the "cool down." The so-called optimization of structure has a two-fold definition: One is the "capital preference" in terms of investment, and the other is the "supply readjustment preference" within the real estate industry. The former refers to the investment (including that made by Hong Kong and foreign businessmen) in such basic industries as energy, communications, transport, telecommunications, and agriculture. By so doing, we can put an end to the present "bottleneck" situation, inject more funds into technology-intensive and capital-intensive industries, optimize the industrial structure of the national economy as a whole, and prevent the bubble economy from exerting adverse impact on social life. Commodity Prices Are Soaring, and the Gap Between the Rich and the Poor Has Become Graphic The "cool down" of real estate investment also is aimed at maintaining social stability. The excessive expansion of the real estate industry will cause drastic rises in the prices of building materials, which are already in short supply. Moreover, the supply capability of communications, transport, and energy will be weakened; as a result, they will fail to concentrate on the country's key construction project, raise the prices and charges for commodities and services, and bring about greater inflationary pressure. Tightening control over real estate investment and bank financing can help deter the further growth of commodity prices. This is a component part of our efforts to maintain social stability. Another aim of the "cool down" is to prevent the gap between the rich and the poor from becoming too wide. Businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries take possession of some land; on it they build Western-style villas and high-priced holiday resorts and houses for "rich households" on the mainland, thus giving rise to "luxury housing districts." However, most of the residents in these areas are still "difficult households" or "packed households." The "difference" between the luxurious and dilapidated houses of two social stratums have made the gap between the rich and the poor too "graphic," a fact that poor households cannot accept easily. In addition, the excessive supply of high-grade residential housing is also a waste of our resources. Therefore, applying a appropriate brake is not only necessary, but is favorable to maintaining social stability. Since the Beijing authorities first used "the experience of Hong Kong" for reference in reforming its land system and put into trial practice the system of "separating two powers" in the mid 1980's, experiments have been made with sales of land use rights in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and large areas of land have been leased or sold in all parts of the country. As a result, the country has attained rapid growth in its real estate industry, the scale of investment is expanding constantly, and Hong Kong and foreign businessmen have become more involved in real estate development on the mainland. The Ministry of Construction under the State Council has revealed the annual growth rate of real estate investment during the "period of above-norm development" of the 1990's: The investment amount in 1991 totalled 31.6 billion yuan, up by 32 percent over the previous year. The total investment amount reached 90 billion yuan in 1992, registering an increase of about 170 percent. The estimated investment amount exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, with a growth rate of about 13 percent. The unduly rapid growth in real estate investment has put tremendous pressure on bank financing, building materials, and commodity prices, thus giving rise to a situation wherein demand exceeds supply. Under such circumstances, the "cool down" can help bring about "healthy development" in the real estate industry. At present, the Beijing authorities have tightened bank financing and have ordered the abandonment of a large number of construction projects. This move will not only drive many small-scale Hong Kong real estate developers into a tight corner, but also will subject those who want to gain profits from their property mainland investment to the effects of a stagnant market and land devaluation, and force them to face a series of problems that cannot be solved easily.
