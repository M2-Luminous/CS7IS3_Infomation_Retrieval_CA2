Less than three weeks after the elections, and following the separation announced by Communist Renewal and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party], now also AD [Democratic Alliance] is bidding farewell, hopping down from the progressive train, in such tones as to call into question the very possibility of a federative agreement. A hectic day of contact-making and meetings seems to have paved the way in the Chamber of Deputies for the birth of a foursome, including the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], Rete, the Greens, and the social Christians, as well as for the probable convergence of AD's 12 deputies into the mixed group, together with the South Tyrol People's Party and Valdostan Union members -- assuming, of course, that the storm through which [Pact for Italy leader] Segni's former allies are going (since yesterday they have also had to cope with spokesperson Ferdinando Adornato's resignation, offered in a long letter addressed to AD's leaders) is not the prelude to a major disbandment. This is the outcome of a tug of war which has occupied the progressive front leaders for the past four days. A political tug of war which, against the background of a yet unanswered "What next?" and of a compelling grassroots thrust toward unity, was also fueled by other factors: personal ambitions, unavowed "logistical" concerns, and, above all, the tensions to which the electoral defeat has given rise among the left-wing political forces. It is first and foremost, the war of nerves currently raging at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] between [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in view of a congress scheduled for the fall and which -- as grudgingly acknowledged at PDS headquarters, where the leadership will be meeting today -- will certainly not be a "ritual" one. All this explains the succession of moves and countermoves, interspersed with crossed vetoes, feints, and double-crossing, which has ended by leaving in AD's hands the hot potato of an embarrassing split. After D'Alema "forcefully" shipwrecked the federative option last week, it has become difficult for Adornato to counter the thrust of AD's republican component, which is absolutely determined to break away from the PDS's "hegemony" and secure independent connections with Segni and [former Italian Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. In the Senate, Bruno Visentini immediately started working on the possibility of setting up an autonomous group of Democrats for Europe. This would be open to senators for life such as De Martino, Bobbio, and Valiani. In the Chamber of Deputies, the same concern first led to a "no" to D'Alema and then gave [former lower house speaker] Napolitano the cold shoulder and suggested, at the same time, Giorgio Bogi as the possible progressive group floor leader. Last Saturday morning [16 April], playing on the novelty of a (strictly speaking) nonparty personality, D'Alema wheeled out Luigi Berlinguer onto the track. It was the Greens, however, who got AD out of an embarrassing situation by counterpoising Anna Finocchiaro to Siena university's former rector. This was a way of breaking off and saving face, given the split at the top of the environmentalist federation, with those against forming a single group prevailing by seven votes against four, and the quasi-certainty that -- thanks partly to less stringent rules -- the environmentalists will organize on their own at Palazzo Madama [Senate].
