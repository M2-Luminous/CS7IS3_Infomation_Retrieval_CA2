The RPF forces could reach Kigali this morning if they do not meet too much resistance. What is the RPF's aim? We spoke to Emile Roua Massirabo, one of the RPF's leaders in Kampala, Uganda: [Begin Massirabo recording] We have to get to Kigali. This is quite obvious. We have to arrive in Kigali to save and to aid the population, which is being massacred at this very moment. Our forces are advancing on Kigali. I can't tell you exactly where they are right now, but they are advancing along the road from the north. We want to put an end to the massacres. We want to arrest those responsible for these massacres, so as to put the country back on the democratic path. The opposition forces have systematically been exterminated. It has never been our aim to seize power. [end recording]
