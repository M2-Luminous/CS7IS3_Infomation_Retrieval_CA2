FR940810-0-00080 FR940810-0-00021 Requiring wet methods is consistent with EPA's regulatory scheme. Wet methods are required by EPA for removal and demolition jobs falling within the jurisdictional limits of NESHAP, and are recommended by that Agency as part of a basic ``O & M'' program for building custodians and maintenance workers. (EPA, Managing Asbestos In Place, Ex. 1&hyph;183, p. 18&hyph;19). EPA/NESHAP, which requires facility owners and/or operators to control asbestos fiber emissions by wetting prior, to during, and after demolition/removal, has provided guidance in a pamphlet entitled ``Asbestos/NESHAP Adequately Wet Guidance'' (EPA 340/1&hyph;90&hyph;019, December 1990, Ex. 1&hyph;300). In this booklet two exceptions to wetting are described: when temperature at the point of wetting if below freezing, and, when use of water would unavoidably damage equipment or present a safety hazard. In the latter case, local exhaust ventilation and collection systems to capture fibers must be used. Others voiced reservation regarding a universal requirement for use of wet methods. E. Downey of US West, Inc. felt that in the case of telecommunications industry and computer systems, use of wet methods would not be practical, particularly in roofing operations (Ex. 7&hyph;79). J. Collins of the US Navy Office of Operations and others recommended ground fault circuit use for avoiding the electrical hazards presented by use of wet methods (Ex. 7&hyph;52). OSHA will allow employers to claim infeasibility if they cannot use wet methods due to conditions such as electrical hazards, hot surfaces, and the presence of technical equipment which cannot tolerate moisture. The use of wet methods for roofing was a major issue in this proceeding. Steven Phillips, counsel to the National Roofing Contractors Association testified: We have submitted for the record a report performed by SRI *␣*␣* their recommendation was that there is no improvement on asbestos emissions and there are safety hazards involved in putting workers on roofs when wet methods are utilized *␣*␣* (Tr. 2456). The National Roofing Contractor's Association (NRCA) cited four reasons not to require wetting on roofs: ``the introduction of water on the roof creates safety hazards, such as slipping; water on the roof can enter the building and cause damage and electrical hazards; the introduction of water on the roof can damage the roof system (e.g., by soaking insulation boards); the SRI International study reveals that roofing work involving wetting does not appear to produce either higher or lower concentrations than work performed dry. We believe this is because of the nature of roof systems. They are applied and in place to repel water. Thus, water (amended or unamended) does not penetrate the material_it just rolls off of it'' (Ex. 7&hyph;112, p. 21). Some participants suggested that using wet methods on roofs should be recommended, but not required, because of safety concerns. For instance, the asbestos administrator for Florida, noted that using wet methods on a sloped roof may be more of a hazard to the workers, than the benefits gained (Ex. 7&hyph;6). In contrast, NIOSH recommended that before an operation (tear-off of asbestos-containing roofing material), the roof should be wetted with water or other wetting agent (Ex. 44). BCTD noted in its post-hearing brief that ``the majority of the jobs reported in the SRI Study, submitted by NRCA, employed wet methods'' (Ex. 143, citing Ex. 9&hyph;31A). Various submissions noted that power cutting of built-up roofing is the standard method used to remove roofing material. Use of this method generates dust which may contain asbestos (Ex. 1&hyph;357, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;96, 7&hyph;115). The Paik study and other evidence demonstrate that wetting does substantially reduce exposure. OSHA believes that continuous misting of the cutting blade during the cutting operation, whether performed by hand or by machine will help to control dust. Field observations of such procedures have shown that little water is pooled as a result of the misting process (Ex. 1&hyph;313), and that in most circumstances, evaporation will quickly occur. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that the requirement to mist the cutting blade will create a slipping hazard on roofs under most circumstances. If, however, a competent person determines that the specific conditions of a roofing job (e.g. a steeply sloping roof, or below freezing temperatures) combined with the water resulting from any misting, would create a slipping hazard, misting may be omitted, if other precautions are followed, such as equipping the power tool with a HEPA vacuum system, or using hand methods.
