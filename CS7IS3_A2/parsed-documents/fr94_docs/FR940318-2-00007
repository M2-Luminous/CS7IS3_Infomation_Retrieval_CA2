FR940318-2-00007 FR940318-2-00006 International Trade Administration Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;014. Applicant: University of Arizona, Department of Geosciences, Gould-Simpson Building, Room 208, Tucson, AZ 85721. Instrument: ICP Mass Spectrometer, Model ICP 200. Manufacturer: Turner Spectroscopy, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to analyze key trace elements and isotope ratios that are useful for geological studies dealing with the evolution of the continental crust. Most of the minerals to be analyzed are common rock forming minerals. In addition, the instrument will be used to teach students isotope and trace element geochemistry and analytical techniques for very high precision data acquisition. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 10, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;015. Applicant: Rice University, Department of Chemistry, 1700 Rice Boulevard, Houston, TX 77005. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer System, Model MAT 95. Manufacturer: Finnigan, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to analyze synthetically produced organic and organometallic compounds and extracted natural products compounds. These materials will be investigated to determine the precise mass for elemental composition and/or the nominal mass of molecular fragments to determine the molecular structure of these compounds. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in Chem 314 Advanced Instrumental Laboratory and Chem 105 or Chem 106 demonstration analyses. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 14, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;016. Applicant: Penn State University, Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Drive, P.O. Box 850, Hershey, PA 17033. Instrument: Rapid Kinetics Spectrometer Accessory, Model RX.1000. Manufacturer: Applied Photophysics, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to monitor changes in structure during the unfolding and refolding of proteins in experiments conducted to identify and characterize the folding pathways for the proteins examined. The instrument will also be used in several graduate courses, especially Macromolecular Characteristics and Interactions, where students will study the physical characteristics of macromolecules, examining ligand binding, transport processes and enzyme kinetics by spectroscopic methods. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 16, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;018. Applicant: Penn State University, Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Drive, P.O. Box 850, Hershey, PA 17033. Instrument: Stopped-Flow Spectrofluorimeter, Model SX.17MV. Manufacturer: Applied Photophysics, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to monitor the very rapid changes in structure during unfolding and refolding experiments that are conducted to identify and characterize the folding pathways for the proteins to be examined. It is possible to monitor the formation and breakdown of native, intermediate and unfolded structures during these experiments, in hope of understanding the overall process. The instrument will also be used for teaching purposes in several graduate courses, especially Macromolecular Characteristics and Interactions. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 16, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;019. Applicant: Carnegie Mellon University, 4400 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. Instrument: Rapid Kinetics Accessory, Multi-mixing Version, Model SFA&hyph;12mx. Manufacturer: Hi-Tech Scientific, Ltd., United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in stopped flow kinetic studies on metalloenzymes and small inorganic complexes which serve as effective models for the enzyme active site. A variety of enzymatic and chemical reactions will be studied, including the turnover reaction of galactose oxidase, an enzyme in which a free radical-coupled copper complex as the catalytic active site has been discovered. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 17, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;020. Applicant: Texas A&M University, Department of Oceanography, Eller O&M Building, Room 411B, College Station, TX 77843. Instrument: Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer with Accessories, Model MAT 252 GC. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in studies of the problem of contamination of soil, sediment and waters by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through bioremediation. This instrument will provide reliable methods for determining the exact source of contamination, for examining mobility of pollutants in the contaminated site, and for monitoring the efficacy of bioremediation in situ. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 16, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;023. Applicant: University of Georgia Research Foundation, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, Room 620, Athens, GA 30602&hyph;7411. Instrument: Autosampler and Gas Sampling Kit, Model A200S. Manufacturer: CTC for Finnigan MAT, Switzerland/Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in conjunction with a mass spectrometer which is being used to investigate the minute quantities of flavors in finished food products or the bulk flavors with very high precision, with emphasis on the development and optimization of methods for new flavors and finished products. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 18, 1994.
