FR940919-0-00119 FR940919-0-00016 21. Section 268.7 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(4)(ii), and by adding paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to read as follows: §268.7 Waste analysis and recordkeeping. (a) Except as specified in §268.32, if a generator's waste is listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D, the generator must test his waste, or test an extract using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW&hyph;846 as incorporated by reference in §260.11 of this chapter), or use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this part. Except as specified in §268.32, if a generator's waste exhibits one or more of the characteristics set out at 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the generator must test an extract using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'' (SW&hyph;846)), or use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this Part. If the generator determines that his waste exhibits the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST or RORGS of § 268.42, Table 1), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002), and is prohibited under §268.37; and/or the characteristic of organic toxicity (D012&hyph;D043), and is prohibited under §268.38, the generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2, in the D001, D002, or D012&hyph;D043 wastes. (1) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this part and the waste does not meet the applicable treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part or exceeds the applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d), with each shipment of waste the generator must notify the treatment or storage facility in writing of the appropriate treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part and any applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). The notice must include the following information: (i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; (ii) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043. Generators must also include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined in §268.2(d) and (f), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; (iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; (iv) For hazardous debris when using the alternative treatment technologies provided by §268.45: (A) The contaminants subject to treatment, as described in § 268.45(b); and (B) An indication that these contaminants are being treated to comply with §268.45. (v) For hazardous debris when using the treatment standards for the contaminating waste(s) in §268.40: the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi) of this section. (2) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this Part, and determines that the waste can be land disposed without further treatment, with each shipment of waste he must submit, to the treatment, storage, or land disposal facility, a notice and a certification stating that the waste meets the applicable treatment standards set forth in subpart D of this part and the applicable prohibition levels set forth in §268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). Generators of hazardous debris that is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under §261.3(e)(2) of this chapter (i.e., debris that the Director has determined does not contain hazardous waste), however, are not subject to these notification and certification requirements. (i) The notice must include the following information: (A) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; (B) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043. Generators must also include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined in §268.2 (d) and (f)), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; (C) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; (D) Waste analysis data, where available. (ii) The certification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the following: I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D and all applicable prohibitions set forth in 40 CFR 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment. (3) If a generator's waste is subject to an exemption from a prohibition on the type of land disposal method utilized for the waste (such as, but not limited to, a case-by-case extension under §268.5, an exemption under §268.6, or a nationwide capacity variance under subpart C of this part), with each shipment of waste he must submit a notice to the facility receiving his waste stating that the waste is not prohibited from land disposal. The notice must include the following information: (i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; (ii) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043. Generators must also include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined in §268.2 (d) and (f)), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; (iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; (iv) Waste analysis data, where available; (v) For hazardous debris when using the alternative treatment technologies provided by §268.45:
