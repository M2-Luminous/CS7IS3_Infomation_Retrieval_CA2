Moreover, the current shifts in relations between the two Korean states, and also in relations between the DPRK and the United States, inspire hope that the situation on the peninsula will be finally extricated from four decades of deadlock. It has just been announced that agreement has been reached on holding a first-ever meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and South Korea. It was simultaneously reported in Washington that a third round of talks between the DPRK and the United States will begin in Geneva on 8 July. Judging by statement by the White House press secretary, American diplomats are geared up for serious work. "Talks will continue until such time as they are productive," she said. Particular importance attaches to the fact that Washington has acknowledged that the DPRK nuclear program has been frozen. So we can heave a sigh of relief: A situation fraught with almost the danger of war has now been successfully defused. It is time to ponder the lessons of what has happened. The main one, in my view, is that the world community has to accept that the world contains and will obviously continue to contain states which are highly different from each other in terms of system and ideology. And it is absolutely senseless to attempt to change them with the help of threats and sanctions. Because the result could turn out to be the opposite of what you wanted. Thus, like it or not, the only road is the broadest possible communication with these states at all levels. It is necessary to destroy the myth that "external forces" are threatening their countries' independence. It is not through threats but through consistent dialogue that these countries can be integrated into the world community. It seems that trial and error has brought this realization to even those who only yesterday were counting solely on sanctions.
