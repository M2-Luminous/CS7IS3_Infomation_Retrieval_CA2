This means his department -- after the Defense Ministry, the fiscal administration, and the Economics Ministry -- is in the top group of the 29 federal institutions that are obliged to make economies. Krueger told this newspaper he regretted that his department, which accounts for only 2 percent of the total budget, has been burdened with 5 percent of the amount that is to be saved. He is not pleased with this development. He must, however, accept the Federal Government's decision, especially as he has been offered "compensatory measures." It is planned that his ministry should receive approximately DM150 million from SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] assets. It is still "litigation" money, however, as the legal dispute about SED assets has still not been resolved. Krueger is, nevertheless, firmly counting on the money, because guarantees have been offered at the federal level. The funds, which were always envisaged as additional funds for the Research Ministry, are only available in a limited way. They can only be allocated for research in the new laender. A further DM100 million of this year's budget should, according to Krueger, be financed through the Bank for Reconstruction with low interest loans. This means that in the future, research institutions will increasingly have to finance their work with loans rather than state contributions.
