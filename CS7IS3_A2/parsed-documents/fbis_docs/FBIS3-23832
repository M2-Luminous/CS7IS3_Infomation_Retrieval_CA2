Our society has never before perceived the lack of professionalism, especially in politics and the governance of the country, so acutely. Part of the reason may be that, for the first time in many years, politics and governance are again becoming spheres for professional rather than party-sponsored activities. The longing for professionals expresses the deep-down yearning for stability: As a rule, professionals do not get carried away by radicalism. We decided to begin the discussion of professionalism by meeting with Yuriy Agapov, president of Kredo-Bank, because a person who has managed to put on its feet one of the most stable and respectable banks within a short period of time is definitely a professional. We invited to the meeting Andrey Zverev, chief of the economic department of the government staff; Doctor of Economic Sciences Gennadiy Lisichkin; and Mikhail Dmitriyev, financial consultant to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. 1. Do Not Worry! We Love You.... [Interviewer] How did you start out? [Interviewer] What does it mean to open a bank? [Interviewer] Was there an element of chance in the decision you made? [Agapov] I was born on 13 December 1958 in Belarus, in the small settlement of Ros. My father served in the Air Force. He got caught in the cutback of the military by Khrushchev, and he got what he got: a lathe till the end of his days. He worked in Moscow at a plant that was, incidentally, headed by Skokov--the Foton Plant. This is a small world. I graduated from the finance institute. Later came graduate study and a dissertation. I tried to engage in science, but later, when I understood that this held absolutely no promise, I switched to the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League]. I was a member of the city committee, got certain "ins," some connections, acquaintances. In 1988, after a meeting between young people and Gorbachev, a once-in-a-lifetime random event occurred: I shook hands with him, and this picture ended up in newspapers. At this point, it was as if someone had lit a fire under me; I decided to do something of my own. Actually, I took up the Komsomol in order to get ahead in life at least somewhat, too, because given the family I came from, I had no other career opportunity. So in 1988 I burned all my bridges and embarked on a risky venture, because I did not have a kopek to my name, not a thing. However, I must have had quite powerful inner strength. As early as 27 March 1989, I got my bank registered. This was a bank that had neither money nor premises. If I could start everything over, I would never again get involved in this risky venture: this is how much dirt and filth I have gotten to see along the way. Most importantly, I have lost very many people whom I had considered close friends but who, having gotten access to enormous amounts of money, turned "swinish" right before my eyes. There were two of us, my driver in the Zhiguli and I. Of course, it appears ridiculous now. Subsequently, I made the rounds of a few cooperatives, which had promised me 1.1 million rubles [R], but then for some reason refused to give me this money, just the way it happens. Later, some wise guy came along who decided to take this hollow bank away from me. There was a Russian-style, communal kitchen-style squabble. As a result, I borrowed R3,000 from friends (at the time, this was a lot of money), went to the cooperatives that had signed a contract with me, and said: Take this, and you do not have to pay it back, but send me a noncash transfer and resolve to admit new shareholders. This was an act of desperation, but things started moving. Later, I met with Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bocharov. I latched onto this locomotive (to be sure, later it turned out to be a cart), and we prepared a Council of Ministers decree on an experiment in the Butek Concern. After the decree on the Butek Concern was issued on 25 January 1990, we were granted absolutely unlimited rights! It was altogether fantastic! At the time, I was very naive; it appeared to me that, since there was a decree signed by Ryzhkov, everybody would rush to carry it out. They laughed in my face: You had it signed? Now write your licenses yourself! After two months of wandering from office to office in vain, I took a desperate step. I went to France to meet with Pierre Maurois, deputy mayor of the city of Lille. OCCASIONAL REMARK: And here is an ace in the hole. [Agapov] I knew a gentleman by the name of Jean Raymond de Greve. He was a duke, a real one. He turned out to be an aide to Pierre Maurois who helped me to obtain a permit from the Bank of France to open a correspondent account in France. What followed was a like an episode from a good play. Leonid Ivanovich Abalkin gathered us in the Kremlin to review the results of carrying out the decree of the Council of Ministers. Everyone knew that this was spectacle, but.... My turn came. Why did you fail to obtain a license? Is Gerashchenko not here? Fine, we will postpone it. I said: What do you mean by postpone? I have to open accounts! Malinin from the Bank for Foreign Trade rose up and stated: There is nothing to discuss; this is a small bank, nobody has heard of it, nobody will open an account for it. So I produced the paper with the signature of Pierre Maurois and put it on Abalkin's desk. At this point, Bocharov decided to have our wings clipped. He called me to see him at the Rossiya Hotel and said, in this kind of tragic voice: "I know everything about you. I know how many bribes you take, but do not worry, I will not turn you in. The only thing that I need from you is to bring in all client files and credit contracts to be looked over and for comradely advice to be given." I answered: "There is no problem! However, what you have just said is slander, so let us see a procurator and sort this out." Further on, the full treatment began, and they began to drag in my employees to give testimony. By then, about 40 people worked for me, and the balance was pushing 50-60 million. One decent guy from among the employees came to me and wrote an official memorandum: Functionaries such and such summoned me to such and such a place, and asked me to tell them this and that. I took this paper and got in touch with Bakatin's service: "This is the situation. I am publishing an article on how you smother entrepreneur cadres." A very nice colonel came and said that nothing had happened--nobody has called anybody in to anywhere, do not worry, we love you.... They still love us: They keep digging; this is Russia, after all.... 2. Is There a Shareholder Who Does Not Know His Balance Sheet? [Interviewer] What did you mean by saying that you wanted to have a career? What is the meaning of career for you? What are your expectations in life? [Interviewer] What are your current problems with the bank? Do you intend to convert to joint-stock operations? [Agapov] A lot has changed since I first gave thought to a career. Most likely, I mean by career an interesting job in combination with a normal salary and social recognition. I never thought about wealth. I just did not know what it was. Later, I saw that career meant normal people talking to you, some currying favor with you, and some, of a high enough caliber, treating you as an equal. Of course, it is pleasant. However, this is not a career, but its reflection. This is what I think now. I know that many of my colleagues are just raking the money in. It is not difficult to get rich. What follows is currency conversion and transfer. Everything is legal, everything is normal; you can easily have all you want--and make tracks. However, there is a problem. I have visited many countries, and I know there is nothing for me there. I am not needed there. I am nothing there. Here, I have work; here, I have people who are dear to me; they speak my language here; it is a pleasure for me to live here. I do not want to emigrate anywhere. If I do not want to emigrate, then why do I need a house in Vienna? Or in Spain? It is absurd in a way! Such a house needs to be maintained, and this kind of thing is quite expensive there. I believe that if the company that we have created prospers, we will be able to take a vacation wherever and whenever we want. If it does not prosper, then why have the rest? Our locomotive has started moving, and I cannot stop it any longer. At present, we have approximately 30,000 clients, 28 operating branches, a balance pushing R800 billion. The current section of the balance sheet is such that we have to buy a new computer: there are not enough numerical digits. Of course, I am no longer interested in petty cash. I am interested in large clients, for example, the Customs Committee. We are now taking a number of measures in order to establish complete control over the bank, that is, its statutory capital. This has to do with the fact that, unfortunately, ours is not a civilized country, and many shareholders sincerely believe that they may interfere with the affairs of the bank, that they know something about the balance sheet. In principle, everything may be hidden on the balance sheet so that no audit will find it. Since tremendous amounts pass through the bank, the smartest shareholders are concerned: And just what is the board doing? Besides, the concept of converting large banks to joint-stock operations is already hanging in the air. A number of large banks have decided to anticipate events and to convert to joint-stock operations. As I see it, they have lost a lot by doing so, because one and the same share cannot be sold and purchased ad infinitum; a moment comes when real operations have to be performed. At this point, some guy comes and purchases the controlling share. Given that brokers on the exchange are easy to buy, arranging the purchase of a controlling share with them is no problem at all! We must buy back our statutory capital in order completely to shield ourselves against this kind of thing. 3. Horse, Also Known as Cow [Interviewer] Let us try to visualize the banking "map" of the country. At present a dozen names are commonly heard, and it is a big question who is doing what. [Interviewer] What is the relationship between the Central Bank and the commercial banks? Is Gerashchenko a coachman who drives you (the bank) like a horse so that it will run in the direction needed? [Agapov] The Central Bank is an organ of government; it is, if you will, a factory for producing money in the interest of the society under the control of the leadership of the country. This is a fundamental issue. The monitoring of commercial banks is one of its other functions. This is why I would rather liken Gerashchenko to a nice milkmaid who, when attaching the milking machine to the udder, says: Give it to me, commercial bank! A bank is not commercial because it is "commercial," but rather because it serves clients, unlike the Central Bank. This is it. In turn, commercial banks are specialized; they are divided into land banks, municipal banks, and so on. OCCASIONAL REMARK: This is the same as previously, when the minister had enterprise directors reporting to him. The Central Bank may grant a license or withhold it, close the bank or refrain from closing. [Agapov] To understand all of these inner workings, let us recall that the USSR State Bank was an emission center and a commercial bank simultaneously. Indeed, it could do everything! It gave advice to itself, and controlled itself. During the first stage of the restructuring of the banking system of our country, there was Matyukhin and the creation of the famous RKTs [Cash Clearing Centers]. A segment of the settlement system was taken away from the USSR State Bank. At the time, we did not understand it, but later I understood that this was done in order to lay a hand on spare money in the bustle--withdraw the resources, in our parlance. Hence the false advice notes, because the two systems--the USSR State Bank and the Central Bank of Russia--were never balanced; they existed by themselves. The flows of funds between them were precisely the "out-of-air" money, which we will no longer see or catch (the figure of R3 billion was given; I think that it was considerably more). With pain and blood, the USSR State Bank yielded its functions one by one to other structures: the government and commercial banks. However, the point is that the USSR State Bank could generate profits by serving clients. Now, having ceased to be a commercial bank, it sort of "forgot" about getting profits. So fine, it forgot. However, according to the law on the Central Bank, it now generates profits from everything, primarily in the form of emission profits. Last summer, the Supreme Soviet tried to cut out the remaining functions of the Central Bank in the area of client services, and make it into a real Central Bank and forbid it to generate profits. It could receive proceeds, but would have to live within the cost estimate. Gerashchenko fought this to the death--and won! This is how we live now--within a two-tier banking system. Understandably, two tiers are easier than three or four. However, in real life it is not so, because there is no such thing as commercial banks forming a homogeneous structure. All of them are different banks: some "for a respectable clientele," others, former state banks to which the entire chain, all vaults, and all personnel were transferred. Some of them are loaded with debt. However, given that these are different banks, the conditions for their existence and the extent of their jurisdiction and rights should differ. As I see it, at present we have three groups of commercial banks. The first group consists of banks authorized with regard to major programs, previously called national-economy programs. They have high volumes of assets, chains, personnel, operational experience, and reputations on the market. There are only about 10 of them. Next there are specialized banks. Some work with private clients, others do investments, yet others--mortgages, and so on. Here is a question: Is an investment bank a commercial bank, or a nonbank? This is tremendously interesting! If we treat investment banks the same way we do regular banks, we will never have investment; we do not have resources for this. This is to say, investment banks should be granted some kind of preferential terms for attracting and investing resources, and for taxation. The same is the case with municipal banks. The idea is simple: If all commercial banks are segregated into groups, they should be managed in different ways, too. For now, it is more convenient for the state to pile them all together; naturally, within the pile, those that are strong will always be strong. It is another matter that each bank certainly chooses for itself what it engages in. It cannot be regimented this way: As a universal bank, you must pay these taxes, have this kind of real estate, these reserve funds, and so on. Do work. If you can, do work. If you cannot, switch to another category. This is what the rules of the game should be. 4. One Cannot Drive a Tank Over It [Interviewer] Why do bankers not seek progressive financial legislation? Why is it convenient to treat all banks uniformly? [Interviewer] The law has the wording "other credit organizations." What are these--nonbanks? Is it more advantageous to be a bank or a nonbank? [Interviewer] Why do commercial banks also interfere with the affairs of clients? What is in it for you? [Agapov] "Other credit organizations" is an absurdity. A huge legislative loophole has emerged, whereby money can easily be scooped up on an enormous scale, and one can feel fine in the process. For example, we have a problem with payments to Ukraine and Kazakhstan. A certain company comes along and says: Funds will be transferred within one day! The company is not a bank, but it is a banking operation! The company should have a license with all the requisite guarantees of the rights of clients, with the minimum statutory capital, with taxation, and so on. However, there is a gap in the law: There are banks, but there are no nonbanks, and nothing can be done about it. For example, the edict on trusts came out on 24 December, but the Central Bank cannot hold anyone accountable for performing these operations without a license, since they are nonbanks. Naturally, this is advantageous for the nonbanks. They rake in money on an almost legitimate basis, and then they can legalize their bank. We prepared a text for insertion in the legislation. However, many people in the Supreme Soviet, including our banking geniuses Pochinok and Zadonskiy, simply failed to understand what this was about. They are on high, they cannot see, whereas we live down here, on the ground. We understand how money is raked in out of nowhere. Now about the reason why everything happens this way. Because of stupidity. This is a serious answer, if you could imagine this. Bankers do not lobby enough; legislators do not want this; Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko and a great many executives do not want that.... I am not expecting anything new to happen now. Actually, what has changed? Nothing! The banking system is such that one cannot drive a tank over it. This is why a situation emerges by and large whereby banking practitioners are compelled to make certain decisions. For example, one goes to the parliament, knocks on one door, and then another, and yet another--nothing happens. Fine, he walks away. He tries for a second and a third time. Then he gives it up and proceeds to buy deputies. So it begins: suitcases full of dollars, trips abroad.... All of it is understandable. However, a deputy who has been bought is no longer capable of thinking. He merely hangs on his benefactor's every word. I believe that this is a wrong move. I am convinced that a real politician cannot be bought. A real politician is not for sale, and it is a pity to spend money for one who is not real. Why cannot the bankers unite and lobby on the issues needed? Because most of them are afflicted with anachronisms and live on the principle: You send down to us instructions from the Central Bank, and we will comply with them! Question: Why should a client have just one settlement account? He might have as many of them as he wants, and it is up to him to report this to the tax inspectorate. Our banks are still forced to be control agents. This is why we go into your accounts. Since there is a bank, let it be accountable for wages, for the consumption fund, for foreign-exchange operations. How can a bank do this, given that there is a legal entity--its client, and that this client is liable, with his wallet and his freedom, to the procurator and the tax inspectorate on account of his actions? What has the bank got to do with it? No, they do not hear this! The Edict on Foreign Economic Operations says directly: All banks holding foreign-exchange licenses must perform the functions of foreign-exchange control. This is insane. A client did not make the full payment to the state out of foreign-exchange proceeds, and I will be liable! Whatever for will I be liable? 5. About Common People, "Short Money," and the Long Arm [Interviewer] For now, it makes no difference for citizens whether it is you or the Savings Bank. Nonetheless, the citizens are enticed by promises, by these 30-percent profits on a monthly basis, and get in waiting lines in front of banks. What do you do in order to attract them? Do you need them at all? [Agapov] The question is: Have banks become a social institution or not? Do they work in the interest of individual citizens? No. Why? Because banks are established, finance companies are established, exchanges are established, but nobody teaches the citizens anything. The citizens are, in a way, by themselves, and this entire system is by itself. This is why, as I see it, in the course of accomplishing major economic tasks, it would be more honest to say, looking the people in the eye: Esteemed citizens! The economy will not be restructured in two or three years. It cannot be. The citizens must be trained and prepared. In our country, they try to teach people by hitting them painfully over the head. The people will not understand if they are hit over the head, and if they have antediluvian educations. They understand nothing, and they believe in some abstract state, government, and leadership. It does not make a difference who is in the leadership, as long as there is an authority. The issue of the mentality of clientele is a very broad issue. For now, citizens are not ready for a relationship with a bank, and we are not ready to work with citizens. The Savings Bank is the only bank capable of this. It has a chain and it has personnel. We cannot do it because we pay taxes on proceeds, taxes on profits, taxes on fixed assets. The taxes are very high. It is not advantageous for us to commission new premises which will not yield quick profits. Getting rich quickly at any price does not mean services to the population. This is bluffing, just as the infamous 30 percent, or whatever, per month. This is pure deceit without guarantees because there is reality, and this reality is that the margin (profit of the bank--editorial note by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA) on credit resources should come to no less than 30 points. At present, short-term resources cost about 200 percent on the market. Calculate this: I must place 200-percent resources at 230 percent. This is virtually the limit. In all of that, with a 30-point margin I barely make ends meet, cover my outlays, and get meager profits. How are big profits to be made? There is a source, so-called "short money"--this is the placement of money for one to seven days. The game is that all banks participating in the process conduct operations through one correspondent account at one RKTs. An agreement is signed to the effect that the RKTs will itself debit funds from the correspondent account when the deadline comes, automatically. Therefore, payments are guaranteed. "Short-money" operations are very profitable. However, the main question is: Who gets the profit? Naturally, the few large donor banks, of which our bank is one. Everyone else is a consumer. Those who receive credit and work on it in transit do not "play" on the market. They do have a certain margin, they do get by somehow, but they cannot pay out 30 percent a month. You see, the 30 percent is an illusion. The people raised large amounts by several operations, and it seemed to them that this was it! The same applies to currency operations. In all honesty, I laugh when some banks guarantee 25-30 percent in foreign exchange! In general, mutual relations between banks and the population are a very interesting issue. As it were, clients sincerely believe that they have no need for a bank, and that the banker is definitely a crook if he gets himself a Mercedes. This is how they have been conditioned. Since the banker is a thief, they should not come to him at all, or should come to him with a red sign, or better yet go straight to the procurator, or else organize a demonstration. I do not want to have a demonstration next to my bank and, naturally, I will never strive to engage in extensive operations with private individuals. What do I need this headache for? The second aspect: Actually, what can the population accomplish for the bank? Cash rubles? I do not need them! I would have to build new vaults, set up a counting shop, buy armored cars, and so on, and so forth. OCCASIONAL REMARK: It is impossible to get rid of hatred for the man in the latest model Mercedes or Volvo if one does not treat him as a client and therefore does not invest money in the banking infrastructure. There are a few establishments, for the most part quite suspect, where a great many people stream with their money. Old women are as numerous there as young people wearing leather jackets. [Agapov] In a serious vein, a shift in consciousness is of course taking place, but for now it is venturesome, in a way. No sooner is a child born in the West than they already begin to teach him: Here is your insurance; take this toy money and play with it, and the child grows into the market-economy life naturally. In turn, our people play when they are already grown up. They play stocks, play something else, invest money without audit reports, without verification, without anything! The most terrifying things will begin when these organizations go under en masse, and when citizens understand that they have been truly swindled in a big way. This will be a collapse of confidence in the entire banking system, a catastrophe. However, there is only one way I can warn about it--speak publicly and tell the already mentioned old woman: My dear, there is nothing I can do for you! This is the most I can do, because an armored Mercedes can be blown away with a regular grenade launcher. It does not cost too much.... 6. What Should Be Done in Order Not To Swing From a Lamppost? [Interviewer] You understand the danger of your existence from the class standpoint. What prevents you from uniting and working out an action program so that you will not be smashed to smithereens? [Interviewer] Some banks, having appreciated the potential of the press and television, are buying them, as the saying goes, lock, stock, and barrel, in an attempt to establish an information monopoly. Do you intend to follow their example? [Agapov] I am perfectly aware that all of us may be swinging from the lampposts next to the government, next to entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, and all other "enemies of the people." Unfortunately, the mass media fuel this opinion of us as enemies of the people, and to my mind, deliberately, to a considerable degree. They do not understand that they themselves will swing from the adjacent lampposts. Indeed, why does a common cause fail to unite the entrepreneurs? First, because all of them feed at different troughs. Some feed at the trough of the head of oblast administration, others--at the trough of the mayor, still others--at the trough of the government, and so on, and so forth. Such is reality. Second, all of those feeding are very different people. The notion of caste is stronger in the banking community than anywhere else. For example, a person comes to the financial market. He has already put together a bank, made big money, and made arrangements with whomever it takes. He is rich. But he is a nobody! Nobody wants to talk to him. He is ready to pay any money to be admitted to the professional bunch, to just sit at the same table and have a talk. They do not take him in. There is a precisely delineated circle--a circle of banking veterans. This is the Central Bank, the entire organization of the Bank for Foreign Economic Relations, the former specialized banks. These people have known each other for many years; they take care of their own. From among new people, they only admit those who are from their alma mater, who studied under the same instructors. I spent about two years in order simply to gather together more than 20 bankers from all three spheres: the specialized banks, the Central Bank, and the new commercial banks. Two years, although ours is not the worst reputation around and, generally, we are well known. Why did they come, all of these banking tycoons? Perhaps they understood after all the need to unite. The main issue is how to unite. How is one to unite with someone who has sold his bank to Americans, or to other foreign "teachers?" How to be friends when the direction of interests differs? I for one understand full well that, whether I like it or not, one person will be shooting at another whatever the array. Unfortunately, such is life.... As far as the monopoly on the press and television is concerned, I have my own view on it, just as on Likhachev's murder. I am convinced that Likhachev's murder was political, 10 days before the election, in order to disturb the people. For some reason, they cannot find anyone! Just like the guy who ran over an OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] serviceman on 1 May: Everyone saw him, but he cannot be found! I think that a real rich man will never advertise: a) that he is rich; b) that there are very important people standing behind him! A rich man will do everything quietly....unless somebody pushes him from behind. What do I need newspapers for? What are radio and television for? These are insane expenditures! About $20 million-$30 million is necessary to get a TV channel going. So what is all of that for? I think that preparations are under way for forthcoming political changes which, naturally, will be accomplished by those who are not in the limelight. The unexpected resignation of our main reformer, Yegor Timurovich, seemed very strange to me. It would appear that a fight was on, rivers of blood were being spilled--fight to the death, you are the reformer, you promised the people! No, he quit! Later, Fedorov made the patently unrealistic demand concerning Gerashchenko--and also quit grandly. All of this makes me feel that some kind of a lunge at the government and the president is being prepared. OCCASIONAL REMARK: The views of most varied analysts are similar in that a political collapse may indeed occur in late spring or early summer. Given this prospect, the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov means that from a politico-economic point of view, they have acted as military engineers: They installed a delayed-action mine that must go off, and it is not known when. Understandably, bankers feel this. [Agapov] It will be very complicated for us to counteract this situation. To help the broad masses understand why Gaydar and Fedorov have quit is the only thing that may be realistically accomplished at present. The real clash will thus be delayed for a certain period of time, and the financial muscle will grow, because we understand full well: No matter who is in power, he will not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. She will be turned into a cow and milked. However, I believe that we will not be milked worse than by Gaydar and Fedorov. 7. Is Gerashchenko as Bad as He Is Made Out To Be? [Interviewer] For many people associated with the financial and economic sphere, Gerashchenko has become a symbol, a personification of state-perpetrated fraud. It was not money but rather the shadow of money that was traded. This shadow is growing longer with every passing year. In essence, you are helping him do it. Are you going to get along with him like this? Or is it that he does not get in your way? [Agapov] Yes, Gerashchenko indeed puts money into circulation. However, who laid the foundation for this emission? Who was it? Could it be that Gaydar's edict on decontrolling prices played no role? Or that credit that Fedorov extended to industry was likewise not significant? This is how I would put it: Deception occurs both in the Central Bank and around the Central Bank; however, the degree of this deception is definitely insignificant compared to what is happening in the government. The Central Bank is actually a transit element; it transmits the ideas that were introduced into it. This is the first point. Second, Mr. Gerashchenko has the traits that I like the most in bankers--he is an intelligent and well-balanced person. Why do they dislike Gerashchenko so much? Because he is upper class. He came from a job abroad. He is squeaky clean, and all of the regional managers of the Central Bank are like blue-collar workers compared to him. Gerashchenko has lacked a real cadre base from the very beginning. Meanwhile, the banking system is oh, so complicated! Any idea may be nixed within half a second. Why did Gerashchenko go for it? After all, he understood full well that he would be removed, driven to imprisonment, or smeared with dirt. However, he wanted to try delaying the catastrophic decline of our economy toward which the people who have read a lot of books and know clever words but do not know beans about banking are irrepressibly proceeding. Of course, they do not like him: He has shown major adherence to solving problems nationally. To give the last shirt off our backs and to throw ourselves on the mercy of gentlemen from abroad, sometimes for $24 billion, and sometimes for something else, is all that our reformers have proposed. Gerashchenko's position is different: to prevent high-technology enterprises from going under, to continue supporting them and try to restructure them, even if on an inflationary basis. He sustains, say, Krasnoyarsk-2, which manufactures satellites, and so on, and he is accused of being a scoundrel and a villain. We have our own major complaints to make about Gerashchenko, but he does not interfere with the development of the banking system, does he? If Fedorov were in Gerashchenko's position, he would do in about 80 percent of the banks at present by using the bankruptcy law. This is very simple to do. Gerashchenko understands that this could not be done; a precedent cannot be created. However, Gerashchenko is alone, he does not have a team, and for this reason he cannot make operational decisions. Two years ago, I suggested this: Let us not saddle Gerashchenko and Fedorov with everything. Let us create a special Council of Commercial Banks, a national banking council. Let it be confirmed by an edict of the president or the parliament, and let it assume some of the responsibility. The council could resolve issues of reserves, standards for bank operations, issues of taxation and resource distribution, and make recommendations on the issuance of licenses--after all, we know everyone within our community. First Matyukhin and then Gerashchenko categorically came out against this. Two years have passed, and the idea has been approved, after all. It will be released publicly in the immediate future. It is just that there is nowhere to go; there will be an impasse otherwise. I understand full well that Gerashchenko will apparently quit together with the cabinet. However, his task is to find now some form of a connection between the Central Bank and commercial banks, and such a connection which nobody will ever be able to break. Commercial banks cannot be destroyed in principle, because commercial banks mean clients. Only in the movies does Zheleznyak the sailor come along and close whatever. This does not happen in real life. I have, for example, 30,000 clients; converted to the number of people, this is an entire army, and for all commercial banks, it is the population of the country. This is why playing games with the banks does not work. OCCASIONAL REMARK: It worked for Pavlov, and for Zheleznyaks it worked, too. [Agapov] Pavlov was not playing games with the banks. That was a centralized system. As far as Zheleznyaks.... History does not repeat itself twice at the same location.
