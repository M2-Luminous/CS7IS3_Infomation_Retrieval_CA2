The accident occurred May 1, when a gas explosion ripped through a mine in Jiangxi province, killing 38 miners instantly, the newspaper said, adding that initial investigations had attributed the disaster to poor management and sub-standard safety procedures. Following the blast, the Ministry of Coal convened an emergency meeting May 5 to discuss the recent series of disasters that has afflicted the industry and issued an urgent call for stricter adherence to safety regulations. A total of 724 miners have died in accidents in the first three months of this year alone, compared with 1,058 for the whole of 1993. Following an emergency meeting of labour and coal officials in February, nearly 2,000 mines in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang were closed to allow for the upgrading of safety equipment and the replacement of inadequately trained safety staff. A recent government circular accused local authorities of being soft on officials found responsible for mining accidents. Failure to give "harsh and timely" punishments was one of the main reasons for the alarming rise in the number of deaths and injuries, the circular said.
