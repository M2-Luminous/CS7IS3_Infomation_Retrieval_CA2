He said that no such incident took place and the charge that the Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing was baseless. However, it may be pointed out that the Indian troops have been indiscriminately firing from across the Line of Control on the Azad Kashmir civilian population. Special complaints regarding all such incidents are being regularly filed by Pakistan with the United Nations military observers group in Pakistan.
