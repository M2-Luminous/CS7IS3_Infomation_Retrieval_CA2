In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Ho Chong-man, vice chairman of Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee, said he met the younger Kim during a visit to North Korea in late February and also saw him horse riding. Ho dismissed press reports in February that Kim had sustained serious injuries. Ho said he met Kim on the afternoon of February 28. It was Ho's fifth meeting with Kim. Kim told him that North Korea highly appreciates its agreement with the United States over international inspections of North Korean nuclear sites. Ho said Kim told him North Korea "honors its promises." Ho said he met Kim in Pyongyang and later encountered him outside the capital where he saw him riding a white horse and accompanied by several high-ranking government officials. He said Kim stopped and asked him to join him in horse riding. But Ho said that after he explained he did not know how to ride a horse, Kim rode away at the head of a group of riders on three other horses along a seven- to eight-kilometer country track. Ho said he was fully aware of the reports that Kim had been injured but said he could see no sign of injury during his discussions and walks with Kim. He said Kim appeared robust and slimmer than when they previously met. At a dinner reception in the evening, Kim said North Korea "is conducting diplomacy of its own volition on an equal footing with the United States." The U.S. and North Korea agreed last Friday at a working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume dialogue with South Korea and fully implement International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its seven declared nuclear plants.
