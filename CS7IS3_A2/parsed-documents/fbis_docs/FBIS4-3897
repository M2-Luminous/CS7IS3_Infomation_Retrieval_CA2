It is said that the U.S. Government has already approved Wang Jiaqi's request and granted him political asylum. An informed source said the department concerned of the Hong Kong Government had a contact with Wang Jiaqi last week and asked him to keep a low profile during his stay in Hong Kong. Wang agreed to do so. It is said that Wang Jiaqi is now staying on Lamma Island in Hong Kong, and he is maintaining contact with the outside through a non-government organization. The Mainland Chinese government is quite concerned about possible leakage of secrets due to Wang Jiaqi's flight, and Mainland Chinese agencies in Hong Kong are busy in detecting Wang Jiaqi's move.
