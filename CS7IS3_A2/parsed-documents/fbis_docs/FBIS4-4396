"The three sides concluded the talks by deciding we should donate the rice," said Toshio Miyaji, president of the Tokyo-based Jonan Denki Co. About 15 tons of rice the company has bought from farmers in Ogata, Akita Prefecture, will be donated to old people's homes with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government helping in its distribution. Jonan Denki's store in Tokyo's Suginami ward sold rice last Sunday in defiance of the Food Agency's warning that selling rice without a government license is a violation of the Food Control Law. About 2,000 people lined up to buy about 12 tons of brand-name rice produced in Ogata. The bad weather last year has made domestically grown rice scarce, and consumers have been queuing and paying high prices for domestic rice since February.
