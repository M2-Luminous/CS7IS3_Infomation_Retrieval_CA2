Others -- ministers and public figures who maintain close ties with the prime minister's bureau -- paint a different picture. Sheves established a team to monitor the implementation of the prime minister's and government's decisions, including the way budgets are used by the various ministries. According to him, the team has been operating, coordinating, and discharging its duties. Others say the follow-up team collapsed several months after its establishment. There is a considerable disparity between the versions. While media descriptions have portrayed Sheves as a very strong man, whose proximity to Yitzhaq Rabin has put him in control of extensive information and of the fate of ministers and officials, it now transpires that ministers who had a falling-out with Sheves lost nothing of the access to or good ties with Rabin. Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat enter the prime minister's bureau daily and meet with him whenever necessary. When Shohat presented the cabinet the Finance Ministry's plan dealing with unemployment, while an alternative plan drafted by strategic adviser Hayim Asa -- who has meanwhile been fired -- was submitted on behalf of Sheves, the cabinet endorsed Shohat's plan. A cabinet minister said off the record: "I do not think he is powerful. He did not manage to really harm Beiga [Avraham] Shohat, perhaps just to smear him, and even that is too strong an expression. The bottom line is that Beiga sees Rabin and talks to him, while Sheves has been forced to withdraw his ideas. It was very obvious at a housing discussion (where Sheves proposed reverting to public construction and greater government involvement -- DS)." Officials close to Shohat say the finance minister sees his conflict with Sheves and Sheves' ability to harm him as some force majeure with which he has to live. Shohat finds solace in the fact that Rabin never comes out against him and in the prime minister's loyalty to him. A man conversant with affairs at Rabin's bureau says that when Sheves arrived there, he had many grand schemes to establish a structure similar to that of the White House team, with himself at the top. "All doors leading to the bureau were repainted, many new signs were put up, a project follow-up team was set up, as were other bodies. But Sheves, a pugnacious man who suited Rabin's needs in the primaries and the election campaign, was unable to take charge of such a complex system. Every system he established collapsed, and decent members of the bureau staff admitted there was nothing for them to do there. What remains today is Rabin's skeleton headquarters: Military Secretary Dani Yatom, who liaises with the Mosad and the Shin Bet and arranges the prime minister's flights and receipt of cables; bureau chief Eytan Haber, who writes the prime minister's speeches and is on intimate terms with Rabin. Sheves is nonexistent. He still plays a political role, and as a man with street savvy, he understands the trends in the street, but he does not participate in security and political consultations." Time has proven that 42-year-old Sheves often engages in power contests, in which he is defeated. In the words of one of the ministers: "He draws all his strength from Rabin. If he is separated from him, he will not be able to survive." When Sheves put his strength to a test by promoting Yuval Frenkel's candidacy for Labor party secretary general, the job was won by Nisim Zvili. Ya'aqov Tzur refused to accept Sheves' dictums regarding appointments, but this never hurt his standing. Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer did tell the government that the Construction Ministry's housing plan is coordinated with the prime minister's bureau, but for Ben-Eli'ezer this was apparently a one-time concession. Shohat has not deviated from his economic doctrine, and he continues to back Treasury officials. It seems that Sheves' tests of power ultimately tarnished his image. He once said in a press interview that he must be believed when he says that he does not appoint people, but only recommends appointments to the prime minister occasionally. Then we thought he was acting humble, but today we can believe him. The revolution Sheves brought about in the Prime Minister's Office and bureau -- cutting down the number of advisers to the prime minister; making all other advisers administratively subordinate to the director general; creating new departments and liaison mechanisms between government ministers; improving services to the citizen -- may have been ahead of its time. It would have been more suitable for a time when the prime minister is chosen in direct elections and his powers resemble those of the U.S. President. At the moment, the system does not work well, and only a handful of ministers come to the bureau to coordinate issues with Sheves. For his part, he concentrates his efforts on socioeconomic issues, including the reclassification of development areas and localized treatment of backward or problematic areas (including in the Arab sector), and gets praised for it. Rabin did not interfere with the innovations Sheves made in the Prime Minister's Office. He does not need advisers any way, and except for substantive issues, what happens in the bureau does not interest him. Gradually the bureau began emptying of people and goals. Advisers and key officials, such as Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein, media adviser Gad Ben-Ari, and political adviser Jacques Neriya, quit recently. On the face of it, each of them quit for his own reasons. But, according to knowledgeable sources, most of these departures could have been avoided if these officials had had better access to information. They had no problem accessing the prime minister, but information in various areas was blocked to them and this hindered their work and led to compartmentalization and frustration. Haber and Sheves are seen as the guilty party. The prime minister's bureau is having a hard time filling the vacated jobs. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sheves said that "many people would like to be cabinet secretaries and the prime minister's spokesman." He said he was talking about dozens of people, "all of them good," and noted that the prime minister would soon make up his mind. However, other bureau staffers would only say that the job of cabinet secretary became vacated on 1 April, that Rubinstein was asked to stay on until May, and that no replacement had been found to overlap with him. Although the fact that the prime minister's media adviser would be quitting had been known for a few months, Ben-Ari left and his job has not yet been filled. One could say that the prime minister is the best government spokesman, and that he makes statements to the media quite often. However, the job of spokesman includes regular contacts with journalists, and while Israeli journalists can obtain information from other sources in the prime minister's bureau, foreign journalists have nobody to turn to. People who know Sheves' working ability praise his performance and even his tendency to iron out differences and cut corners. "Sheves is a very good can-do man," said Justice Minister David Liba'i, the only minister who was prepared to speak for the record. "Myself, I have had very little contact with him, but his attitude has always been businesslike and matter-of-fact." He is regarded as a sharp and intelligent man, but not as a methodic and theoretical thinker. People note his integrity and his disposition to speak up his mind anywhere, even to Rabin. According to various testimonies, Sheves does not recoil from confronting Rabin when this is necessary. A person who witnessed such a confrontation says that Sheves insisted on his position even when Rabin hollered at him. The same person added that Rabin hates obsequiousness and appreciates men who stand up for their views. People say that with Sheves, a sensitive and direct man, you know exactly where you stand and note that he is a good friend. Other people, however, say that he can also be crass and rude.
