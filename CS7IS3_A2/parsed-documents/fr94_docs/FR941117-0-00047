FR941117-0-00047 FR941117-0-00009 (a) Policy. (1) MidRange procurements shall normally use the BVS source selection method, prescribed in 48 CFR part 1871, subpart 1871.6 when it is desirable to base evaluation and award on a combination of price and non-price qualitative criteria. (2) The RFO should reserve the right to award without discussion based on the initial offers submitted. (FAR) 48 CFR 52.215&hyph;16, Alternate III will be included in all RFO's for competitive negotiated procurements using qualitative criteria. (3) In exceptionally complex procurements where it is desirable to use a highly structured approach and multiple evaluators, a source selection method following the principles specified in NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook, 48 CFR 1870.303, Appendix I, may be more appropriate than BVS. This may be appropriate in cases in which the following factors cannot be accommodated within the MidRange/BVS selection methodology: (i) The ability to predefine the value characteristics that will constitute the discriminators among the offers; (ii) The complexity of the interrelationships that must be evaluated; (iii) The number of evaluators required to address the disciplines that will be involved in the offers; or (iv) The impact that the procurement may have on higher level mission management (level of selection official) or future procurements. (4) A source selection process combining the mid-range and the NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook (48 CFR 1870.303, Appendix I) approaches shall not be used. (b) Procedures. (1) The buying team will determine which of the source selection methodologies is most appropriate to the specific procurement. (2) The team shall record its rationale for selecting the SEB methodology rather than BVS. Once this decision is made, the team shall no longer function as a MidRange buying team, but shall follow the instructions prescribed in the local procedures for the source selection method. 1871.401&hyph;5 Noncompetitive negotiations. (a) Policy. (1) The RFO may be used as the solicitation method for noncompetitive procurements. (2) MidRange procedures may be used in noncompetitive acquisitions to the extent they are applicable. (b) Procedures. (1) Posting a presolicitation notice on the NABB meets the requirement of (FAR) 48 CFR 5.201 and complies with the notice required by the Competition in Contracting Act. A presolicitation notice is not required if one of the exceptions of (FAR) 48 CFR 5.202 is met. (2) The buying team shall require submission of certified cost and pricing data in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 15.804&hyph;2. (3) The technical member of the buying team shall provide technical assistance to the procurement member during evaluation and negotiation of the contractor's offer. 1871.402 Preparation of the RFO. (a) The RFO shall provide all standard information required for the offeror to submit an offer. (b) The RFO shall contain space for all necessary additional instructions to offerors. As a minimum, the RFO shall contain the following: (1) Incorporation by reference of all required standard provisions.
