[Portal] This was an official trip to participate in the oil conference in Norway, where Cuba had an opportunity to explain the progress we are making in our country in the field of petroleum. This includes exploration and drilling activities carried out by Canadian, French, British, and Swedish corporations. The activity is doing well, and we are interested in getting the news to other countries and other oil companies. Several companies showed some interest in Cuban geological resources and its more promising exploration areas. We believe we have attained our goals. In addition to this success, Cuba has been admitted to the Oil Congress, which was another of our objectives. We believe that this first leg of the journey was highly successful. We went to London to sign a contract with a second British corporation for oil exploration in Cuba. The corporation is the British Borneo Oil Corporation. This firm will join the first one in the central region of the country, where there are already several oil wells in operation. They have shown their interest in moving forward with this specific project. Participation of corporations such as these is based on joint risk concession. This means that there is money being invested that will return when and if production begins. Such contracts demonstrate the degree of trust these companies have in us and the support they are receiving from Cuba in their investment projects. This is why I constantly stress the risk they are running by investing in our country. This is perhaps the most significant part about the trip here. [Pena] Several news agencies have reported on statements regarding the success several Canadian companies are experiencing here. Has anyone found oil in Cardenas? [Portal] We completed the drilling phase at that site, and we were testing the well. I learned here at the Congress that one of the areas has proven positive. There is oil in that seismic structure. This was truly reason for celebration. It was welcomed as great news. It is true, according to official announcements these two Canadian companies have made. It is true, and we will continue our explorations and drilling to determine the well's potential. [Pena] What kind of guarantees can Cuba offer its foreign investors regarding stability and professional ethics? [Portal] As you may know, Cuba is ranked 29 in stability for foreign investment among all of the countries of the world. This is due to the social and political stability the country offers; the technical and cultural advancement of our people, our technicians, and our engineers; and the laws that protect foreign investment. These, I believe, are advantages that encourage people to invest in our country, despite the U.S. trade embargo. This demonstrates just how independent the companies and governments really are. It is important to us because it diversifies our economy, preventing it from depending on one country alone. All of this makes it important for us to consolidate our economic independence.
