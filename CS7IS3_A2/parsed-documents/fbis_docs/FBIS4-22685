FBIS4-22685 "jpusr044___94012" FBIS-USR-94-044 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 27 April 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Metropolitan Ioann Interview Metropolitan Ioann Interview 944F0548A Vladimir ZAVTRA in Russian No 10, Mar 94 pp 1, 2 944F0548A Vladimir ZAVTRA Russian CSO [Interview with His Eminence Ioann, Metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga, by Aleksandr Prokhanov, editor in chief of the newspaper ZAVTRA; place and date not given: "Metropolitan Ioann: `Russia Is the Footstool at the Throne of God'"] [Text] [Prokhanov] Your Eminence, like every other person who is disturbed by the crime of last October, my attitude toward what happened is constantly changing. I was involved in it indirectly, my friends suffered. At first I felt the disaster, the tragedy, in my heart. And during the first two days after the gunfire, the firing from the tanks, and the burial of the victims I experienced terror, human terror. And then this terror was replaced by sadness, apathy, depression. It seemed that something great had been lost, that this bloodshed would not pass without leaving its mark on our history of long suffering. But as time passed and I increasingly came to accept what had been done, my depression began to be replaced by a strange sense of light. There appeared to be hope that these sacrifices, these deaths were not simply bloody absurdity. There is some providential, Russian Orthodox point in all this. The martyrs, some of them to their faith, some of them to the homeland, some to the people, did not die in vain. Their death expiates the vileness, the filth, the swinishness, the thievery, the disintegration. The October events were a light-producing explosion...for example, my comrade Stanislav Terekhov, the first to be taken, was beaten up terribly and thrown into an artillery enclosure. He said that there he decided to become a Christian. And this is a representative of the Red military organization, the Union of Officers. Moreover, there, in jail, he decided he wanted to get married in the church. It seems to me that this is related to a spiritual transformation and I would like to hear your opinion: Am I right? How is one to feel about all this? What is the spiritual meaning of the recent events? [Ioann] I think Terekhov's example is very telling. The Union of Officers, as far as I know, has cooperated with a number of Orthodox brotherhoods in Moscow and St. Petersburg. And it was suggested that Terekhov become a Christian long ago, since he has always been very respectful toward Orthodoxy. But, apparently, something kept him from it, something was standing in his way. And, being an honest person, he probably did not want to take these steps just to please others. Some internal shift was necessary. Thank God if it occurred after the events of "Black October." Even the ancient Greek philosophy included the concept of "catharsis"--purging through tragedy. And the teachings of the Orthodox Church tell us that any moral improvement is possible only through grief. A person pays for his spiritual growth through hardship encountered on his path, patience, and the ability to endure pain which is found only in the experienced and wise. Disaster deprives a person of a sense of external well-being and forces him to change his spiritual condition. And the first step on the path of Christian improvement is recognition of one's lack of well-being. Shock, spiritual disturbance. When this happens, a person begins to feel that something is wrong in his life, that something is missing. And if at this time he fearlessly asks himself the most unpleasant, "accursed" questions--he will inevitably come to the Church, he will come to a religious experience of the world, to the understanding that a full-value existence is impossible without God. "I rebuke and punish all whom I love," said the Lord. The main thing is for the punishment not to be in vain, so that after spiritual vision will follow repentance from sins and a change in life. Now about what happened in October. In the first place, nothing supernatural or surprising occurred. All of Russian history is catastrophic. Cataclysm after cataclysm, catastrophe after catastrophe. The Russian people, carrying through the centuries the Orthodox idea of the embodiment of the truths of the faith, the ideals of justice and mercy, into surrounding life, are endlessly "squeezing" through those circumstances that stand in their way. In an imperfect world evil fights very effectively against good. And when various theological principles are being realized in life they inevitably encounter the most stubborn resistance. From this viewpoint there is nothing surprising about the October events. They are just another obstacle on the path to Russian revival. But at the same time they are an extremely serious warning. If we do not draw the necessary conclusions, if we are not able to break the negative tendencies in the life of Russian society, if we are not able to make ourselves return to the historic path of development and restore the connection of time that has been broken since the 1917 revolution, then the blood in October will have been shed in vain. It seems to me that the outcome of these events is not a defeat of the people but a kind of victory, because it was very difficult to assume that after the incredible ordeals the Russian people have been through during this century, after the desecration of the past eight years of "perestroyka," there would so many people in Moscow who would come to the White House. Because there were very many of them. And this is in spite of the fact that on the opposing side were strength and power and a many-century tradition of obedience, which is so inherent in the Russian personality. In spite of the fact that the opposing side had the media, the leaders of the opposition were not so attractive to the mass consciousness. The people went "for the idea." This, incidentally, escapes the attention of many analysts. On the opposing side everything is clear. They went there for the benefits, "for the power." There everything is psychologically comfortable. But here there is nothing but discomfort. There was not even a common leader, not even a common banner. But the people came. This means that the charge of spiritual energy in society is indeed considerably greater than it seems. [Prokhanov] After this disaster, when the crisis in Russia had become even deeper and more terrible, when society was even more divided, the powers that be came up with a number of plans to consolidate the level of victory that had been reached and to stop the slide into ultimate chaos, civil strife and disobedience, and a general Russian catastrophe. Among all these political and cultural-ideological plans, I am taken by one that is still not being openly discussed, but they are beginning to whisper about it in the back rooms and political clubs. They are beginning to speak about restoring the monarchy. The monarchist plan is being considered from various angles, and its various contours are coming to the surface. For example, one suggests transforming the current president into a patron, into a regent of the young Cesarevich, who will be crowned for Tsardom and become the Russian ruler. Another plan suggests direct election of a Tsar involving a convocation of the synod--all-Russian, including all classes...and this is surprising! When I was a young man it seemed impossible even to think about the revival of Orthodoxy. But my friend who was later ordained into the holy orders said even then: "Everything is in God's hands. A miracle is possible. On these ruins on which we are now standing (we were standing on the ruins of the New Jerusalem Monastery), believe me, even in our lifetime the cloister will be restored. And perhaps we will become brothers in this cloister...." I did not believe him and spoke ironically. But indeed--the miracles happened! And not only in Church life. The restoration of the monarchy was not being discussed in Russia at all 20 years ago. It was a daydream, the wish of a tiny group of extreme monarchists who could be found in certain Orthodox circles. There were none at all in secular life. And now the daydream has almost become a real political aspiration which could even be achieved this summer. But here is what I would like to hear from you. I understand that the Orthodox Church consciousness perceives Russian state institutions in the monarchist form which is traditional for Russia: an Orthodox monarchy. Not a truncated, constitutional one, but an autocratic one that is linked to a mystical anointing of the Tsar, one that is consecrated by the Church and Christ. But could it not happen that today's planners imbue the monarchy with an essentially atheistic context. The more so since the classes that at one time developed, brought forth, and provided for the actualization of the monarchy no longer exist. We do not have the aristocracy through which the monarchy made its mark in society, was nourished by its juices, nor do we have the nobility by which it was supported through military institutions. How can the monarchy be restored in our postindustrial society? Will this great cause not turn into a profanation, a sham, a discreditation of the very idea? Is this not a mechanical, premature action and is there no craftiness included in this plan? Will we not be brought some foreign Tsar in a snuff box? I am convinced that the Church is far from indifferent to these issues.... [Ioann] In the first place, one must say that over many centuries the basic creative principles of Russian life have been defined by the remarkable phrase "orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality." Officially, it was suggested by Count Uvarov at the beginning of the 19th century but in reality it has defined all Russian life since the age of the reign of Ivan III, the moment when the centralized Russian Orthodox state was formed. We must keep in mind that this phrase is not the product of any arbitrary human contrivance but a statement of an objective fact--the fact that a harmoniously constructed society must contain in its basis three most important elements: spiritual, state, and national. The spiritual element is Holy Orthodoxy. The state-organizing element is autocracy, and an autocracy may be regarded at three different levels, and all three of them are quite justified. First. It is possible to regard it as a particular political mechanism whereby the supreme power in the state, which is in no way limited, belongs to the monarch. This is a mechanical way of looking at it, but a correct one. Second. One can regard autocracy as a state structure whereby the fullness of power, which determines the state of affairs in the country, belongs to its internal state institutions. From this viewpoint Russia today is not an autocratic country because it is half controlled from abroad. Nor was Russia an autocratic country when it was under Tatar-Mongol power, since the Khan's Baskaks were stationed in Saray and there the Russian prince received the edict to reign from the great Khan. Today it is quite possible to draw a kind of analogy between these two epochs. Then there is a third level of the understanding of an autocracy. It is mainly inherent in the Russian soul and it is the Church, the spiritual level. In this case autocracy is regarded as a moral-religious condition of society, the collective national spirit. When people recognize that they want to live not under the power of Ivan, Petr, or Sidor, not under the power of any "legal" systems created by the weak and corrupt human understanding, but they want to build their life according to God's law, that higher law of justice, love, and mercy which is given to man in Revelations. And then the people, voluntarily accepting the "yoke and burden" of Christ and the Gospels, will crown the entire state structure with the figure of the anointed sovereign of God--the Russian Orthodox Tsar. All three levels of understanding and laws are admissible. But we, of course, are necessarily attracted most by the spiritual-mystical level. The last element of Uvarov's triad is nationality. He suggests the existence of a concrete collective bearer of religious-moral ideals. And so the Orthodox spiritual foundation, the state form of power, and the people as the collective bearer of the moral ideal--such is the universal formula for a harmonious social structure. And we will never get away from it. We can try to falsify it, emasculate it, to pin the "Black 100" label on it and declare it obsolete, out of date, and unfeasible--but in vain. Any society, beginning with Ancient Egypt headed by the Pharaohs and ending with the modern cosmopolitan American society with its "ethnic melting pot," lives according to these three fundamental laws. The entire question, of course, is which spiritual and religious principles lie at their basis. Today in the West, unfortunately, these are blatantly theomachistic, anti-Christian principles. As for modern Russia, first of all one must say that the monarchy cannot be established from above, just as a person cannot be ordered to "be a believer." The people must grow into this condition. And there are a number of signs from which it is possible to judge that the processes of such spiritual growth are going on. For what we are observing in Rus today is a miracle. By all human measures, according to all rational calculations, this should have been a spiritual desert long ago, everything should have been burned and destroyed. We have been suffocated, poisoned, and mortified for almost an entire century! I think that the backroom architects who planned these terrible scenarios for Russia thought that the Russian people would never regain their viability, in any case not within the fairly long amount of time it would take to set in motion new mechanisms of destruction which would on a new level incinerate and remold the reviving spiritual energy of the Russian people. But "man supposes while God disposes." It has been no time at all since 1985--eight years, and since the time of the first shock (August '91)--three years. But the changes are taking place rapidly, especially, of course, in the world views of those elite groups of the population that determine the condition of society to a considerable degree. And this speed makes it possible for the plans you are discussing to exist. I have already had occasion to hear about them from various parties. As of today there is no real possibility of revival within the framework of the existing political structure of those spiritual ideals which would make it possible to give Russian statehood a monarchic form. You cannot put a suit on a dog and pass it off as a gentleman. And cosmetic, superficial changes in this situation will resolve nothing. But if the changes are deeper, they will set mechanisms in motion in the people's soul and energies will awaken which nobody will be able to influence. The ideas of Orthodox statehood are so deep and so ingrained in the mystical essence of the elemental national spirit that if anybody were to really decide to play with these issues, I am more than certain that he would end up with a quite unpredictable result. As for specific issues related to various names, we must be fully aware that the house of the Romanovs is extremely disjointed as of today. And, say, the attitude toward the best known representatives of this house in Russia--Mariya Vladimirovna, Leonida Georgiyevna, and the "heir" Georgiy are extremely diverse. For example, the association of the house of Romanovs flatly refuses to recognize their grand ducal status. So any attempts today to resolve this problem through any kind of force of will are doomed to failure. One would have to be extremely naive not to understand the objectives pursued by present-day propagandists of this kind of false "restoration." And speaking about a synod, the fact is that a real synod must follow Church canons and Russian national traditions. And if we look at the history of Russian synods we will discover that they have a number of features that make it extremely difficult to perform any kind of political manipulations with them. People today who try to use the synod idea for their own purposes would be forced either to pass off some unauthorized assemblage as a synod or else encounter insurmountable difficulties. I think it is now time to set certain "pre-synod" mechanisms in motion in Russia. We must contribute in all ways to the creation of various public forms of self-organization which could then become support points in preparing for the Assembly of the Land. And then sooner or later this process would reach its logical conclusion. But a real synod would occur when it actually unites the Russian people, when its result is all-national, nationwide solidarity around the single high ideal that enables Rus to rise up to its full height and the people--to recall their ancient historical roots and recognize their ultimate religious-moral calling. And when the people, having recognized this, freely say: "Oh, Lord, we recognize your commandments as our laws, our obligations, our mission, and our duty and we will act and build our personal and state life in accordance with them"--then this will be a synod and it could elect a monarch. [Prokhanov] It does not have to be a Romanov? [Ioann] Of course not. The fact is that the "legal jurisdiction" of the synod is unlimited because it expresses the opinion of all the Russian land in keeping with the moral and religious norms and rests on the unshakable foundation of the all-beneficent and all-perfect law of God. [Prokhanov] Modern political scientists use the term "social psychology." In analytical centers and groups there are social psychologists who investigate the social psychological background in which various measures are to occur. Of course this is a precise, refined specialty which uses research methodology. The professionals manage to understand the condition of people's minds over horizontal and vertical cross sections over the entire area of Russia. But modern society has very inadequate instruments for understanding the spiritual condition of the people. It was thought that in an atheistic society this "sensorium" would be culture. The artist, the writer "fulfilled the duty" of a spiritual guide. And he tried as hard as he could to fill this role, partially replacing the clergyman--the person who was supposed to professionally understand the very problem of the spirit. Otherwise how could one perceive the spiritual condition of the human being or the society while denying the existence of a soul as such and not understanding those processes, the sinusoid along which the soul moves from birth, from the rapturous entry into life through the fall into sin, through the attempts to avoid or exculpate sin, through the spiritual achievement.... And now today when the Church, for which, of course, it is also very difficult, is nonetheless increasing its influence, its power, its luminescence, you are accepting many people--both Orthodox and non-Orthodox--as a spiritual leader, as a person filled with radiant knowledge, as a spiritual guide who has a theological view of present-day Russia. It is no wonder people are drawn to you. I would like to ask you yourself: Is there now a word, a formula, an idea that could help Russians to unite, join together, surmount the schism, the growing hostility, and prevent a catastrophic upheaval? And if the time for the monarchic idea has not yet come, on what basis is it now possible to unite the nation? [Ioann] In the first place, it seems to me that we are on the threshold of a catastrophic upheaval. One of the most important results of the October events is the substantiated conclusion that civil war in Russia is almost impossible today. It would be very difficult to start it. You spoke about social psychologists. But in Russia all the social technologies launched for purposes of its destruction, which have been repeatedly tested, calculated, and substantiated in a gigantic many-century experiment, have failed. None of them has produced the expected result. They have been realized almost fully--by 80 or 90 percent. But this "almost" has always canceled out the final result. Academician Shafarevich once noted that the concept "Russophobia" is justified in both of its meanings. There is hatred for Russians and there is fear of them. Where does this fear come from? The fact is that those masonic mechanisms that work beautifully throughout the rest of the world do not work here in Russia. After all, they have been tested repeatedly by the world underground! Everyone seemed to be counting on them, but in Russia--they do not work. And this happens because social psychology and rationalistic science in general are not capable of carrying out in Russia those tasks that have been set by her destroyers. Every science has its own area of application. In order to understand Russia, in order to function intelligently here, it is necessary to have an understanding of laws of a spiritual nature, a complete and clear knowledge of which is preserved only by the Orthodox Church. Throughout two millennia it has stored not only the truths revealed from above concerning God, but also concerning man and the harmonious social structure of our earthly existence. As for the unification of the people, it seems to me that it has already occurred to a considerable degree. The very fact of your question is evidence of this. Today everyone is looking for something to unite us. And this search in and of itself is that powerful unifying principle which in time will consolidate all of us, all Russian people, around the age-old spiritual ideals of Holy Rus. In recent years a very considerable event has occurred in the life of Russia. There has been a recognition of the fact that we are living wrongly, and that in order to correct this--so that we will begin to live in keeping with our theological calling--a certain breakthrough must be made. And the fact that this question is now rising to its full height in the Russian national consciousness is a very powerful unifying factor. But we must not hurry things. Take, for example, the power in the state. During the past year its slogans have changed radically. Before our eyes the regime has evolved in the direction of national interests, in the direction of searching for a unique form of statehood. This is no accident. Many people are now saying that the people "up above" are simply afraid of losing power and this is why they are building on patriotic slogans. Let us assume that this is true. But that is not the point. Life itself is forcing the authorities to move in the necessary direction. And all of Russia's enemies are afraid of this. They know that if given a chance to develop peacefully if only for 10 years--the many-century, gigantic impetus of national collectivism and great-power statehood in various forms will inevitably lead Russia onto the main path of revival of Holy Rus. After all the historical catastrophes, Russia has always been restored in a new capacity, even more powerful and glorious. [Prokhanov] I, who am not really a Church person, a secular, everyday person, who has occasion to communicate with people of the Church, know the idea that the life of the Church is essentially a spiritual metaphor of the life of Jesus Christ in all of its manifestations: From the birth, the flight to Egypt, the fast, the entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, and the confession--to the cup at Gethsemane, to handing him over to those who would destroy him, to the agony on the cross and death on Golgotha, to the placement in the grave and--the resurrection. Since the Russian people are the bearers of the Christian idea, their fate throughout history has also been to a certain degree a metaphor for the life of Christ. That being the case, various periods in Russian life are like icons in the iconostasis of the life of Jesus. It is quite obvious that the terrible slaughter and persecution of the Church after the 1917 revolution were its agony on the cross. And the Church's quiet, the speechlessness that prevailed after this on our earth reminds one of the death of the Savior and his three-day departure from the world. And then something new began, like an awakening. I do not know if Christ arose in this sense, whether the angel pushed aside the gravestone, but it is clear that a new period began. Which icon from Christ's life do we have now, in your opinion, which stage of His life is Russian society, the Russian people, the Russian spirit experiencing now? [Ioann] Here we must keep in mind that such analogies must be drawn with extreme caution and reverence because, unfortunately, even the well-intentioned part of society, going back to its Church roots and not having sufficient Church experience, sometimes goes too far in its desire to penetrate into the spiritual mysteries of Orthodoxy. One must be gradual, fearful, and reverent when approaching the holy and be clearly aware that ultimately at the foundation of being lies God's mystery, unknowable and rationally inexpressible. "This mystery is great," the Holy Scripture teaches us. It can be perceived within the framework of a profoundly intimate, personal religious experience, when the human heart encounters God, and this personal meeting gives a person a certain understanding that "the ear does not hear, the eye does not see, and the heart does ache" in the ordinary earthly life. The history of the Russian people and the parallels you have drawn with evangelical events, of course, are correct, taking into account all the conditions I mentioned. The crucifixion of Rus in this comparison is "superimposed" on the crucifixion of Christ and the Savior's subsequent entry into public service. The hardships experienced by Rus throughout its turbulent history evoke clear associations with the sorrows, oppression, and persecution experienced by the Savior during His life on earth. A comparison is suggested between his sufferings on Golgotha and what our people and our country have had to endure in the 20th century. And it is quite possible that we are now standing on the threshold of Resurrection. But in order for a miracle to occur we need the power of faith. If we are able to preserve and increase this power within ourselves, then the many prophecies about the Resurrection of Holy Rus will come true...let me speak about the concrete conditions for the Resurrection: Until the Church pervades society, the Russian Resurrection will not occur fully. Until the intelligentsia overcomes its innate illness--intellectual pride--until it recognizes the primary, saving significance of strict Church forms of spiritual life, the revival will not occur. Modernism and liberalism are fatal in the area of the religious world view. The divine truth does not require "updating" or augmentation. From mankind it requires only efforts to perceive it, to join with it. Until this happens, we will not resurrect Holy Rus. But today we are still too strongly afflicted with pride and self-will, which, incidentally, also led Russia to the revolution 80 years ago. And to this day we think: We have stumbled, and we can put ourselves aright--without God's help. No, we cannot put ourselves aright! And until we recognize this our domestic rod and staff of sorrows sent by the Lord will persecute us, being the instrument of the all-beneficent divinity who is concerned about our spiritual enlightenment. [Prokhanov] According to Christian teaching, the end of history is coming, the Terrible Judgment, the end of this sin-filled era. But until the Terrible Judgment occurs, mankind, as before, will be concerned about the fate of his homeland, the condition of resources, institutions, war, schools, roads, and the condition of our minds. People think about geopolitics and interrelations with our neighbors, and all of our hopes are bound up in the well-being of our homeland. Many people understand today that the style and character of life that are associated with modern earthly civilization have exhausted themselves. This civilization is coming to its end--smoothly in some places, and in some places terrifyingly and catastrophically. Is a new situation coming to earth, a new way of life which people are trying to anticipate, to figure out, and some are even trying to build it. Some speak about a certain ecological civilization where every creature, and every plant will live in harmony; others discuss a sensory civilization where striving for material goods will recede into the background and the mechanism for religious, philosophical, and rational consciousness will come into play. Still others have in mind a new, super-integrated earth with rational utilization of the remnants of the earth's wealth, the kind of neosocialism, the kind of worldwide phalanx that will make it possible to maintain universal order. Which is the true one for Russia? Perhaps the image of the 17th century when it was prepared to be transformed into a single monastery, or Russia at the turn of the 20th century, when our realm began to acquire the features of earthly, material well-being? How would you like to see our homeland? [Ioann] In order to answer this question we must first solve the well-known human puzzle: What is the meaning of life? Any ideal of social structure, any form of harmonious coexistence of people on earth is possible only when people live thoughtfully, understanding the purpose of their existence, and build their life in keeping with this. The Church gives a completely clear and direct answer to this. Of course it has nothing to do with any kind of "sensory civilization." It is simple but very difficult to perceive for modern humankind, which is excessively caught up in and bogged down by the passions of vainglory and pride. The meaning and purpose of human life is to return to ourselves that initial heavenly combination of purity and holiness, when the human heart was inaccessible to evil and sin, the condition Adam and Eve were in after the creation, in Eden. The main thing is to return to ourselves that invaluable treasure of lost communication with God. One of the greatest Orthodox saints, the holy Augustine, once said: "The Lord created us for himself and the human heart will not be at rest until it unites with Him." Look: Mankind is constantly striving; fighting wars and changing boundaries, destroying and creating again, pushing it knows not where. This unquenchable thirst for feverish activity, the thirst for new things ensues from the fact that the sacred heart is empty. The human heart was created as a valuable vessel for receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit. After the fall it was deprived of them, and now it is fatally ill. So the Church is the hospital for the soul. And a society will be built well when it does everything possible to make sure that this hospital is able to treat the human soul most effectively, calmly, and peacefully. Russian history knows how the state, social, and economic life of the country and the people must be constructed in order to accomplish this. Thus, for example, in Russia it is impossible to build a healthy economy on the philosophical foundation of a "consumer society." This is unthinkable. The Holy Scripture teaches us: "Seek first the kingdom of God and its truth and the rest shall be given unto you" (Matt. 7:33). It is impossible to build the economic life of Russia based on the capitalist principle of unlimited reproduction of goods and services. This is absurd. The Lord said: "What good does it do man if he acquires the whole earth but his soul is in pain?" (Matt. 8:36). The philosophical basis for our life must be different from what it is today. All the external riches in this world given to man by God are concentrated and available for use; there is nothing prejudicial or illegal in them. But we must not use them to defile ourselves and those around us but, relying on the beneficent properties of this world with which the Lord generously imbued it, help our soul to restore itself to its initial condition of divine purity. When people say that the conservatism of the Church could throw society back 200-300 years, that is stupid. It is impossible to go back 10 years, not to mention 300. But to restore in society that ancient spiritual tradition with which Russia lived for a thousand years is absolutely necessary. Religion presupposes a link between man and God. And just as the separate human individual has his duty to God, so the collective individual of the Russian people has its particular duty to Him. It was advantageous to God in His infinite wisdom to entrust the truth of faith to be preserved and protected by various peoples. First it was entrusted to the people of Israel, but they did not keep these truths, they were not worthy of their high calling, and after the terrible crime of deicide they were rejected, expelled from holy service. Then this mission was turned over to another people, the "people of God"--the Christians, who initially were concentrated in the great-power state body of the Roman Empire. But in the 12th century when Rome introduced inadmissible dogmatic innovations and fell away from the universal fullness of Orthodoxy, its mission was also taken away and turned over to Byzantium (the second Rome). It performed it for several centuries, but in the 15th century as a result of the most powerful military and political pressure it was unable to maintain the proper purity and decided to unite with the Catholics, that is, it allowed a distortion of the divine faith. Then the duty of the keeper of the Truth went to the Russian Orthodox state, to the Russian people, understood as a collective spiritual community. We must constantly be aware of our responsibility for our mission, following it in everything, and build our lives in keeping with our religious duty. Only then will we be able to restore the Russia God needs, which will become a kind of precious shrine, keeping inviolable and pure the ideals of mercy and love, justice and truth, generosity and benevolence. [Prokhanov] I recall that in my youth I was captivated by patriarch Nikon, and in our circles there were "Old Believers" whose idol was archpriest Avvakum. I was Orthodox, a specialist in public law, and a Nikonian, and I frequently visited New Jerusalem, and all of a sudden it dawned on me: Nikon was waiting for the Second Coming of Christ, he wanted to transform Russia into a place where the New Jerusalem could exist. He thought the Second Coming would occur in Russia. Apparently the majority of Russian people believed and expected that Christ would come to Rus, that there would be a Russian Second Coming. And in order to invite Christ to this place, the New Jerusalem was created, where on the suburban Moscow landscape, among the suburban Moscow woods, on the Istra River a place with the name of the holy places would be created. There were the Jordan, Bethlehem, Golgotha, and Favor.... I was struck by the grand scale of this plan. In essence it was as though Nikon had changed the coordinates of the earth, trying thus to change the cosmic coordinates, shifting the meaning and center of history to Moscow. If I have understood you correctly, the ideal of the future Russia should amount to preparing through Russia a place for the arrival of God, making it agreeable to Christ, and in this sense somehow making the image of the homeland more like the New Jerusalem, to the extent that this is possible in the terrestrial hypostasis.... [Ioann] Not at all, Nikon did not have that kind of pride. The building of the New Jerusalem was simply a "material" embodiment of the spiritual fact that Russia recognizes and accepts its religious mission. But the Second Coming should never be discussed too simplistically. This event must be awaited in reverential fear and spiritual trembling. While the Savior came first "in the form of a slave" in order to serve the people, His Second Coming will be "in power and glory" in order to judge us according to our deeds. And nobody will have to ask: "Where is the Christ?" All will be able to see Him, "A bolt of lighting flashing from the East to the West." When the Orthodox ascetics asked how they would know the Antichrist, they frequently received the following answer: "Sons, if you hear that Christ has arrived somewhere, you will know that it is the Antichrist" because when the Lord actually comes everyone will understand instantly because this will be the coming of the Lord and Master of the Universe, the creator of all that is, who is infinite in his accomplishments and his wisdom. As for spiritual images, everything here is fairly clear and simple: Russia as the universal repository and defender of Holy Orthodoxy is the "footstool of the throne of the Lord." This understanding has matured in Russian religious self-awareness over many centuries and it was formulated most clearly right before the revolution by our great saint, the all-Russian man of righteousness and prayer Father Ioann Kronshtadskiy. "To be born a Russian," he said, "is the gift of a certain mission. For in the Church there are no nationalities, 'there are no Greeks or Jews'; it distinguishes people only according to their missions. There is the Tsarist mission, there is the patriarchal mission, there is the monastic mission, there is the secular mission." So the Russian mission, at once sacrificial and heroic, lofty and humble, human and universal, is to be until the end of time an obstacle on the path of the evil that is pressing for earthly power, to stand until death defending divine truths in the sacred objects of the faith. As long as we remember this, Holy Rus will live, unconquerable and a source of terror for our enemies and God's! And for our faithfulness to our duty and the work we do the Lord will grant his warriors a great and eternal recompense, all the blessings of which cannot be accommodated by our present pathetic human imagination.
