Nordic defense ministers meeting in Denmark today expect a preliminary agreement on arms cooperation will be signed at their next meeting in Sweden in June. Norway and Denmark are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, while Sweden and Finland are neutral. Close defense cooperation between the four would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. But the end of the Cold War, Sweden and Finland's agreement to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program, and Sweden, Norway, and Finland's applications to join Denmark in the European Union, have paved the way for them to extend the traditionally close Nordic cooperation in most areas to the defense sector as well.
