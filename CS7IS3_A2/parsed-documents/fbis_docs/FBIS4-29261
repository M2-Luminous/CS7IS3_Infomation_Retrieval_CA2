In a survey conducted by the Seoul Research Center, more than half (50.5 percent) of 182 scholars polled said Pyongyang started the nuclear row to obtain U.S. economic aid. Some 20.3 percent said North Korean leaders caused the nuclear standoff to quell economic and social instability in their country. The survey was conducted May 14-15 on sociologists, political scientists, nuclear and other scientists. The margin of error was not disclosed. According to 10.4 percent of the pollees, Pyongyang raised the nuclear issue as a means of defending itself against the joint U.S.- South Korean annual military exercise "Team Spirit." Some 17 percent viewed the nuclear row as preparations for war. Asked about their sense of danger, 27.4 percent said they felt none at all, 32.4 percent said a little and 23.6 percent replied they felt more or less in peril and worried about the situation. Some 11.5 percent said they felt at considerable danger but there was no way of preparing while only 4.9 percent said they sensed a lot of danger and were preparing for it. Meanwhile, 56.5 percent said they believe North Korea already has nuclear bombs and will make more while 41.7 percent think Pyongyang has the capability but has not yet made any. Commenting on former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang, 39.5 percent expect a temporary effect, 27.4 percent said Carter could not make any strong demands of North Korean President Kim Il-song because he is visiting in a private capacity, and 22.5 percent expected a slight achievement from carter's visit although they felt it was undesirable for a former American leader to get involved. Only 5.4 percent said they thought Carter's visit would be an effective method of resolving the issue and 4.9 percent said there would be no result at all. With regard to North Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, 43.9 percent said it was a North Korean plot to induce U.S. economic aid while hiding its nuclear capability under a shroud. However, 28.5 percent said Pyongyang decided to quit the IAEA as a result of the international community's bid to impose sanctions on it. That's why the United States should withdraw a draft resolution on sanctions and induce Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, they said.
