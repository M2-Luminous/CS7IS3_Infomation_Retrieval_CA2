Major Work in the Past Five Years Under the correct leadership of the provincial party committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the provincial discipline inspection commission and discipline inspection commissions at all levels took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress as guidance, comprehensively implemented the party's basic line, persistently regarded economic construction as the central task, continued the explorations on new ways of doing discipline inspection work to meet the needs of the new situation of reform and opening up, strived to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the party Constitution, conscientiously performed discipline inspection functions, completed a great amount of work for safeguarding party discipline, punishing corruption, improving party style, and building a clean government, and made positive contributions to the smooth progress of Shandong's economic construction, reform, and opening up. 1. We made unremitting efforts in improving party style and building a clean government and remain resolute in serving the basic line. It has always been the guiding thought for discipline inspection organs to improve party style, build a clean government, and ensure implementation of the party's basic line with the focus firmly placed on economic construction, the central task. In the past few years, discipline inspection commissions at all levels persistently emancipated the mind, sought truth from facts, and coordinated discipline inspection work closely with reform, opening up, economic development, and the endeavor of safeguarding stability and unity in line with the requirements of the provincial party committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. To counter the conspicuous contradictions in inner-party life and economic activities, we studied and adopted preventive measures from the perspective of safeguarding party regulations and party laws and improving party style, conscientiously solved budding problems and tendencies, strived to ensure social and political stability, and provided a good environment for developing the economy and establishing the socialist market economy system. Proceeding from maintaining close party-populace ties and boosting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for reform and construction, we made efforts to promote party style and build a clean government. While concentrating efforts on economic construction, the fifth provincial party committee regarded the endeavor to punish corruption and advocate honesty as a major task. In early 1989, it held an on-the-spot meeting in Changle on "persisting in the party's purpose and maintaining honesty in administration," which was participated in by city, prefectural, and county major responsible persons. The meeting summarized and disseminated the experiences in making administrative work public and promoting honesty in party and government organs and put forward new requirements for the province on improving party style and building a clean government. Discipline inspection commissions at all levels made active efforts to help party committees in promoting honesty and diligence in administration, establishing systems for maintaining honesty, and strengthening the supervision by the masses. They popularized such systems as "making work procedures and work results public for the scrutiny of the masses" and "appraising governments' functional departments," thus gradually systematizing the endeavors to improve party style and build a clean government. We strictly enforced the party's political discipline to safeguard social stability. In 1989 when there was a political storm in the country and the international situation was abruptly changing, discipline inspection commissions at all levels and the vast number of discipline inspection cadres took a firm and clear-cut stand and resolutely implemented the instructions of the central authorities and the provincial party committee, displaying their firm party spirit and organizational discipline. The provincial discipline inspection commission issued a timely circular to state party discipline. Discipline inspection commissions at all levels also put forward demands and coordinated with pertinent departments to conduct examinations. They played an important role in defending party discipline, consolidating, and developing the stable and united political situation, and ensuring unity of party organizations and party-member cadres with the party Central Committee. [passage omitted] 2. We made particular efforts to investigate and handle discipline breaches and strictly enforced party discipline. Adhering to the principle of managing the party strictly, discipline inspection commissions at all levels "made particular efforts to investigate and handle discipline breaches within the party and comprehensively perform the discipline inspection function." Starting with discipline enforcement and handling of cases to achieve breakthroughs in opposing corruption, we particularly investigated and handled serious violation of political discipline, such economic cases as embezzlement and bribery, abuse of power for selfish gains, bureaucracy, cases on dereliction of duty, smuggling, sale of smuggled goods, and violation of socialist morality and eliminated a number of corrupt elements. In the past five years, we investigated and handled 92,105 discipline breaches within the party and punished 77,112 party members, of whom 12,891 were expelled from the party, 21,453 were placed on probation, and 2.156 were dismissed from party posts. Among the punished party members, 445 were cadres at the county and section level, and 24 were cadres at the departmental and bureau level. By investigating and handling these cases, we strictly enforced party discipline, educated party-member cadres, and purified party organizations. [passage omitted] 3. We launched special improvement endeavor to correct unhealthy trends. Based on reality and by doing practical work, we followed party leadership and coordinated with pertinent departments to tackle and correct the unhealthy trends that seriously affected economic construction, reform, and opening up that interfered with the implementation of party principles and policies and of which the masses were most dissatisfied with. We carried out this work by concentrating efforts on tackling one or two unhealthy trends at a time. In the past five years, we dealt with the party and government cadres who violated laws and discipline in housing construction, recovered more than 20 million illicit funds, meted out economic sanctions on 13,000 persons, and punished 258 persons according to disciplinary actions. We made conscientious efforts to correct the unhealthy trends in some trades. Focusing on 11 trades, such as public security, industry and commerce, and public health, we conducted education to straighten out problems. We investigated and handled 2,050 cases on abuse of power for selfish gains; put an end to some unwarranted pooling of funds, wanton requisition of donations, and exaction of fees to reduce the financial burden totaling 780 million yuan on enterprises and peasants; straightened out rural chaotic financial management, clarified 360 million yuan of debts receivable and debts payable, and returned 130 million yuan; examined and collected 169 million yuan of public funds owed by 115,000 staff members and workers; and corrected the mistake of 46 departments that violated regulations to provide clothes to their staff members and workers. We also examined and straightened out the use of personnel, financial, and material resources of enterprises without compensation, use of public funds for the education of one's children, and lavish wining and dining with public expenses. Based on their own characteristics, discipline inspection commissions at all levels also persistently coordinated the effort to check unhealthy trends with that to straighten out discipline and coordinated ideological education with improvement of systems to continuously consolidate and expand the achievements in checking unhealthy trends. 4. We strengthened supervision and inspection to ensure the smooth implementation of government orders. Focusing on ensuring reform and opening up and facilitating the establishment of the socialist market economy system, discipline inspection commissions at all levels strengthened supervision and inspection of the implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies, state laws and regulations, and major reform measures, and strived to solve the problems that "orders and prohibitions were not carried out." [passage omitted] In view of the problems discovered during the supervision and inspection, we held several theoretical symposiums to formulate policy standards to meet actual needs. In the past few years, the provincial discipline inspection commission formulated 10 policies to support and protect reform, five requirements to improve party style and build a clean government, 14 opinions to promote enforcement of the "regulations," and 10 regulations to maintain the honesty of party and government organs. All of them were approved and transmitted by the provincial party committee and government in a timely manner, which not only helped standardize the activities of party-member cadres but also provided a policy base for the supervision and inspection and for strict enforcement of discipline. 5. We successfully conducted education on party style and party discipline based on reality. In line with the requirement put forward by the provincial discipline inspection commission for "paying attention to both handling of cases and education," discipline inspection commissions at all levels conscientiously implemented the principle of "putting education and prevention first" and adopted effective measures to intensify the education on party style and party discipline to address the problems in party member's thinking about reform, opening up, and development of the socialist market economy. They coordinated with pertinent departments to launch one large education activity every year. They conducted the education for party members throughout the province to "study party Constitution and correct party style," "study party regulations and laws," "oppose corruption and prevent degeneration," and "study party Constitution, stress dedication, and be qualified party members." More than 90 of the party members received the education. [passage omitted] 6. We improved the contingent of discipline inspection workers with the spirit of reform. Party committees and discipline inspection commissions at all levels attached great importance to improving the contingent of discipline inspection workers. They organized the vast number of discipline inspection cadres to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the market economy, and modern scientific and technological knowledge. On-the-job study and special training enabled the cadres to continuously improve their political quality and professional competence. Meanwhile, in line with the "four requirements" on cadres, we selected a number of cadres in the prime of life who have both political integrity and ability to replenish the leading bodies of discipline inspection commissions. In line with the requirements of the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee, we changed the sections of discipline inspection organs into offices and provided cadres according to regulations. We conducted exchange of discipline inspection cadres in a planned manner to invigorate the contingent. We established and improved the discipline inspection organizations in enterprises, institutions, towns, and townships. We launched provincewide activities to "learn from, emulate, and surpass the advanced and vie to be loyal guards of the party" to promote the self-improvement of the discipline inspection contingent. The vast number of discipline inspection cadres adhered to principles, advanced despite difficulties, remained honest in performing duties, worked hard, displayed good morality and brand-new mental outlook, and created a large number of advanced examples. Fifteen persons of the province were named as national outstanding discipline inspection cadres, and two discipline inspection commissions (group) were named as national advanced discipline inspection organizations. The provincial discipline inspection commission commended 48 advanced discipline inspection organizations and 250 outstanding discipline inspection cadres. In line with the decision of the party Central Committee and the State Council on merging the offices of discipline inspection and supervision organs, the provincial discipline inspection and supervision organs began to do so in March this year and completed this work in three months. This work represented a major reform of the supervision system of the party and government. It helped strengthen the discipline inspection and supervision functions under unified party leadership, helped the government strengthen leadership over supervision work, helped avoid overlapping of work, and helped streamline organs and personnel. All discipline inspection organs carried out this work in a steady and discreet manner, thus achieving unity and pooling efforts. Working in the same office, discipline inspection organs and supervision organs became one organ which performed two functions. In this way, they raised work quality and efficiency and strengthened both the discipline inspection and the supervision functions. Thanks to the concerted efforts of party organizations at all levels and the vast number of party members in the province, notable results were achieved in the party's discipline inspection work and in improving party style and building a clean government in the past five years. Most party members and cadres were honest in performing duties, and the main aspects of party style were good. However, we should also remain clear-headed to note the large number of negative and corrupt phenomena and the very arduous tasks to oppose corruption. Some party organizations and leading cadres with party membership lacked an understanding of the necessity and urgency of the anticorruption struggle and failed to properly handle the relationship between the endeavor of opposing corruption and advocating honesty and the endeavor of economic development, reform, and opening up. Discipline enforcement was not strict enough in some areas. Some leading cadres with party membership had a weak sense of organization and discipline and failed to act as an example. On the part of the provincial discipline inspection commission, its concepts, work methods, and leadership style were incompatible with the needs of the new situation and new tasks; and it failed to work in a creative manner and provide effective guidance and assistance to lower-level discipline inspection commissions. We should solve these problems when carrying out in the future. [passage omitted]
