An official report released today announced that Havana Province will complete its production plans this Tuesday, thus becoming the first to achieve its goals in the country this year. Havana Province leaders also said that they have planted 50 percent of the lands assigned for next year's harvest and surpassed the historic records set for clearing sugar cane fields. Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba for the region, emphasized that these achievements were attained despite the difficult working conditions resulting from the lack of such vital resources as adequate clothing and foot ware and despite the cane workers' poor diets. At this stage of the season, sugar workers are simultaneously doing cutting and grinding work as well as field cleaning and planting chores for next year's harvest. Besides the progress achieved in Havana after 150 days of the harvest season, Ciego de Avila Province, in central Cuba, has reported the completion of its planting work. Granma, in the east, defied unfavorable weather conditions and set out to grind all the cane available. It will soon complete the spring planting phase. Rain and residual humidity are, in fact, two more obstacles to overcome for those brigades entrenched in the battle for higher yields. While reviewing work progress in the field, Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres praised the determined attitude of the sugar workers. He underscored the need to harvest and grind all the available sugar cane in order to reach the planned sugar production volume. He suggested that the strategy is not to loose hope because of the rains and to keep the industry working at its potential, while looking at the harvest as a whole and doubling efforts. According to reports released by the Sugar Ministry itself, the task also includes maintaining the cane planting process at the current pace, which is what will guarantee a better harvest next year.
