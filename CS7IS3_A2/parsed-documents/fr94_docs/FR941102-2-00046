FR941102-2-00046 FR941102-2-00035 [PP 4G4290/T667; FRL 4914&hyph;9] Linuron; Establishment of Temporary Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has established temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide linuron in or on certain raw agricultural commodities. These temporary tolerances were requested by Resource Seeds, Inc. DATES: These temporary tolerances expire September 1, 1996. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 245, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Interregional Research Project No. 4, State Agricultural Experimental Station, Rutgers University, P.O. Box 231, New Brunswick, NJ 8903&hyph;0231, has requested in pesticide petition (PP) 4G4290, the establishment of temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide linuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea] in or on the raw agricultural commodities lupine grain, lupine forage, and lupine hay at 1.0 part per million (ppm). These temporary tolerances will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 67651-EUP-1, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have been established on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions: 1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use permit. 2. Resource Seeds, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. These tolerances expire September 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a(j). List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: October 13, 1994.
