FBIS4-37484 "drnes120dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Authority Minister Discusses Laws, Foreign Aid Authority Minister Discusses Laws, Foreign Aid NC2206092094 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0725 GMT 22 Jun 94 NC2206092094 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Gaza, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Furayh Abu-Middayn, minister of justice in the Palestinian National Authority [PNA], has stated that it is important to have legal control over the Palestinian streets and enforce the sovereignty of the law in all spheres, including traffic regulations, respect for private property, and other affairs. He pointed out that this is necessary after the past four years, during which there was a clear lack of control. In an exclusive interview with MENA in Gaza, Abu-Middayn said that this control has actually begun and that after the Palestinian police arrived, carrying weapons in public has disappeared, apart from those who possess licensed arms. He explained that another new phenomenon has been the holding of the Egyptian-curriculum general secondary education examination in a legal manner without cheating and other irregularities that had plagued past examinations. Concerning education in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said it has always been linked with Egypt. He pointed out that the golden age of Gaza education was in the 1950's and 1960's when Palestinian graduates of Egyptian universities spread in the world bearing their degrees. He said 1,500 Palestinians graduated annually from those universities. He asserted that Egypt has always remained committed to the maintenance of high standards of education in Gaza and the curricula taught were Egyptian curricula. He explained that with regard to the general secondary education examination, Egypt handles the entire supervisory process and corrects the examination papers. Abu-Middayn said that this educational link with Egypt has strengthened the bond with that fraternal country, a sentiment that is clearly felt in Gaza's streets. He noted that this cultural link strengthened Palestinian steadfastness during the years of occupation. Abu-Middayn told MENA that during this week's general education examination in Gaza, the Palestinian police oversaw the examination committees in an outsider supervisory capacity and this ended the cheating that used to take place in the past few years. Asked what laws were being used in Gaza now, the PNA justice minister said that the central law now used is the Constitution of 1962, which separates the executive, judicial, and legislative powers and lays down the legal provisions of these powers. He noted that the Constitution also details the provisions of individual liberties. He explained that this Constitution, which was drawn up during the late President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's tenure, is still in force. He also said there are Palestinian laws dating back to Ottoman times but the major part of the laws were enacted during the British mandate. Furayh Abu-Middayn said that during the Egyptian administration of the Gaza Strip these laws were amended to meet the wishes of the Palestinians. The legislation was based upon the desires of the Palestinians. He clarified that the effort exerted during the 18 years of Palestinian administration was destroyed completely during the past 27 years because Israel passed 1,200 military orders that govern all aspects of daily life, from security restrictions down to educational controls. These orders included all aspects of daily life, which was "the most dangerous issue confronting us." The minister of justice in the PNA said that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement did not in fact cancel all these orders. He noted that there are texts stipulating, for example, that if there are any differences regarding certain issues, they will be referred to legislators of the highest order, and so on. Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will not abide by the military orders except as they benefit the Palestinian people because there are trade and material dealings that have taken place during the past 27 years which we cannot erase with the stroke of a pen. To illustrate this point, he gave the example of the securities and traffic law which was being applied in the Gaza Strip. He pointed out that these progressive laws could be reformulated and made use of once again. He said that the laws we will respect, as stipulated by the agreement, are those laws dealing with external security and the security of the settlements. He clarified that these are things they will not interfere in. However, contrary to this point, we will cancel all laws that go against the wishes of our people, in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the occupier of a land from enforcing any laws except for those dealing with security only. He gave the example of the value added tax Israel enforced on the Gazans amounting to 17 percent on all goods. He affirmed that the PNA will cancel any laws violating the Geneva Convention and going against the interests of our people. Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We are also reorganizing the judiciary so that it would become an independent and sovereign entity that does not submit to any organization because this is the only guarantee that could safeguard us against deviations. The Palestinian justice minister added in his interview with MENA: We are also reorganizing and arranging the general prosecution and adding new branches to it. He said: We might turn to legal experts from sisterly Egypt for help in this task because until 5 June 1967 the prosecutor general was from Egypt. The Palestinian official said: We will also try to avoid the state security and military court. But there have been cases of spying. We are not talking about agents who have stopped their activities, but about those who opt to continue cooperating with the Israelis. We will not allow that at all. He said there are those who are putting pressure on us to form a military court. But President 'Arafat and I personally prefer to refer such cases to a civilian court. He clarified that this is a sensitive topic that we will address with wisdom. However, we consider the continuation of cases of spying for Israel a violation of the peace agreements. He affirmed that we will condemn any individual who causes the death of a Palestinian citizen, because such an individual will be working for a third party. Continuing his remarks in the interview, PNA Minister of Justice Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will begin from scratch. We need narcotics laboratories to analyze drugs so that all criminals will be brought to justice. We also need to conduct post-mortem examinations in homicides cases. We still do not have archives for fingerprints and criminal evidence. We need a lot of things. Abu-Middayn added: We have enough Palestinian qualifications, but we are still short of capabilities and material prerequisites. We are still just beginning and we are short of everything. We have been completely linked to Israel during its 27 years of occupation. There is no infrastructure in Gaza and we must be self-sufficient or we will remain tied down by the occupation. Europe and the United States must help us to face the circumstances. In his interview, Abu-Middayn said that Europe was rebuilt after World War II with the Marshall Plan. The West established Israel here. When [Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir nationalized the Suez Canal [in 1956], the French supplied Israel with atomic capabilities. But we are only demanding bread. Abu-Middayn asserted that the Europeans must understand that the Palestinian people are determined to make the Middle East peace a success. He added: However, we do not need peace on paper or artificial security. We need genuine peace. The new Middle East cannot be built at the expense of our rights. The world must help the Palestinians so that peace will be achieved in the region. We want to close the file on this cause. Abu-Middayn added: We are trying to tell the Israelis to leave the Palestinians alone so that new relations can be set up. We have offered 65,000 martyrs over the past 45 years. Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria also offered thousands of martyrs. This file must be closed. Abu-Middayn pointed out that the Israeli-Palestinian agreement is not the dream of the Palestinian people. It is also unfair. But it is the best that we can get. As regards the agents collaborating with Israel, the Palestinian official noted that those who ceased their cooperation with Israel after the signing of the agreement in Washington on 13 September will not be sought. He denied that there are 22,000 agents. We know all the agents, he added. Abu-Middayn said that anyone who kills Palestinians will be hanged. He was referring to the operation in which six Palestinians were killed on 25 April. Concluding his interview with MENA, Abu-Middayn said that Israel's agents will not enter Gaza. Israel will not be able to carry out operations with the aim of driving a wedge between the organizations because communications continue among them.
