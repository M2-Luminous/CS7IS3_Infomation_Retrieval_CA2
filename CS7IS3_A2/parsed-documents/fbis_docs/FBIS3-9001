Kiridjievska: "There Is No Free Privatization"] [Text] Will trade in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] transform itself painlessly or will it go in the directions it has started -- street trade, poor-quality goods, and jumbled assortment? These were the points on which yesterday's debate concentrated, on the subject: "Transformation of trading companies with state capital," held in Skopje and organized by the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce and the Transformation Agency. Besides scientists, it was also attended by a large number of outstanding economists from the commercial sphere. "We wanted to urge another initiative for faster transition, organization, and ownership restructuring in trade, as the priority task for the creation of new relations, which should lead to overcoming the present situation," the introductory speaker Duse Kotevski, vice president of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, said. While numbering the basic statistical indications about the real image of the situation in this economic branch, Kotevski located the roots of the problems in commerce. He said it was harmful to start liberalization without adequate solutions and organization, with illegal activities and disloyal competition. In concluding that the number of the legal subjects engaged in trade has significantly increased, he said that the modern shops with rich variety, catalogue sale, shopping centers, discount shops, and modern warehouses with terminal cashiers had been replaced by ugly sights in the streets, whose consequences will be long felt. According to Ariton Zivkov, professor at the Faculty of Economics, there was no recipe for the complex process of transformation, however only those who were really interested in becoming tradesmen would be able to attain it. In his opinion this process in trade did not begin with Ante Markovic's law, but started the moment sales were completed with postponed payment in conditions of high inflation. One should not forget the small trading companies supplied themselves from the state companies by postponing the payment of debts, and sometimes not paying at all. At the same time, the state sector, according to Zivkov, had to meet the requirements of the state, contrary to the private sector, which piled up its capital. Calling this manner of privatization forced, Professor Zivkov explained he was doing his best to save resources. In his opinion, there would be no real transformation in trade without real efficiency, finance, personnel shifts, selection, and regional orientation, because trade can drive the economy only if it is given a chance. Recalling some clarifications of the law on transformation, Miroljub Sukarov, manager of the Transformation Agency, said that priority could be given to nobody. "The process must begin with the concept of paid privatization, because our country is not rich, and there is no such thing as free privatization. If we do not form a body of financial resources, the social tensions will not be prevented, and the state must have money to maintain social peace. The law on transformation divides the companies into those that have, and those that have not started privatization, and it has to end in a period of two years." These were the words of professor Aleksandar Nikolovski from the Faculty of Economics. We must not wait and play tactics in transforming ourselves, because we are getting close to a deeper abyss. Bobek Suklev, professor at the Economics Faculty provocatively started his discussion by saying, "I shall start my job by giving assessments with the question of whether the company is yours, that is, whether you can prove it is your property. From previous experience I know that companies do not have such proof at their disposal and that will slow down the process of privatization. Thus, the assessment will have to be based on experience, on the feeling for each particular situation, and on the basis of a subjective evaluation." Joining the discussion, the economists showed interest in the fate of the shareholders' capital, the prohibition on selling objects with a value of over 50,000 German marks, as well as in putting a mortgage on objects when there is no capital turnover. They stated that it would be a great and unforgiving sin if this state took liquidation as the only prospect for the former state industry, but that would be inevitable if four conditions were not fulfilled. They are: a rigorous decrease in the gray economy, equal working conditions, an alteration to the Law on office space, computerization, but also a true division between the private and the state sectors. [Box, p 3] Seminar on Privatization Today and tomorrow a seminar will be held at the Faculty of Law with privatization as the subject. There will be 12 lecturers, nine of which are eminent professors of the Faculty of Law, and three are professors of the Faculty of Economics. Jane Miljovski, minister in the Macedonian Government, and Sofia Todorova, Minister of Development, will also present their views. The discussions will be concentrated on the privatization of state companies with 100 percent state capital that have not yet started the process of transformation according to the old laws. -- by V.C.
