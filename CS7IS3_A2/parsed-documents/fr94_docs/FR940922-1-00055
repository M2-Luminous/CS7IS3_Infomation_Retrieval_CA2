FR940922-1-00055 FR940922-1-00008 Regardless of whether EPA were to find that the ZEV sales requirement is a standard, EPA believes that incorporation of the sales requirement is not required for the OTC&hyph;LEV program to meet the requirements for identicality under section 177. Section 177 allows a state to adopt and enforce ``for any model year standards relating to control of emissions from new motor vehicles and *␣*␣* engines *␣*␣* if other such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.'' EPA believes that section 177 should not be read to require that once a state has promulgated one California standard for a particular model, the state must adopt all of California's standards relating to the control of emissions from all types of motor vehicles for that model year. The language of section 177 does not require adoption of all California standards for a given model year. Section 177 requires only that if a state adopts motor vehicle standards, such standards must be identical to California standards. Therefore, the identicality requirement only necessitates that the specific standards adopted by the state be identical to the comparable California standards. As long as the state adopts all standards that are necessary to implement a particular California vehicle program, 72 and as long as the state adopts all standards necessitated by the other requirements of section 177 ( e.g. , the state must not prevent a California-certified car from being sold in the state and must not create a ``third car''), the state need not adopt other standards that are not integral to the particular program being adopted. 72 EPA believes that all standards applicable to a segregatable program must be implemented in order to assure that specific vehicles required by a particular program are subject to the same emissions requirements (e.g. a state could not adopt only California's NMOG standards for a LEV without adopting the NO X and CO standards.) Thus, as discussed in the NPRM, EPA believes that adoption of the California LEV program does not require adoption of the California heavy-duty engine program. Similarly, EPA believes that section 177 does not require a state to promulgate standards that are clearly segregable from one another. EPA believes that the ZEV sales requirement is clearly segregable from the rest of the LEV program. The LEV program is essentially comprised of several requirements limiting the quantity of emissions that may be emitted from particular types of vehicles ( e.g. TLEVs, LEVs) and two requirements mandating sales of such vehicles. The first is the NMOG fleet average. The second is the ZEV sales requirement. Without implementation of either of these mandates, the requirements defining emission levels for types of vehicles are basically unenforceable because, unlike more traditional motor vehicle emission programs, the LEV program separates emission levels from mandates to buy vehicles meeting such emission levels. In other words, a statute defining the levels one must meet for a vehicle to be called a low emission vehicle may have little enforceable emissions value, unless there is an enforceable requirement to manufacture such a vehicle. The NMOG fleet average is the central provision of the LEV program to require manufacture of the low emission vehicles in the program and to obtain enforceable emission reductions from such vehicles. The ZEV sales requirement, on the other hand, is a technology requirement essentially designed to ensure the manufacture of technology-forcing vehicles. It is designed to create a new generation of vehicles. As noted previously, however, the ZEV sales mandate also provides NMOG evaporative and tailpipe NO X emissions reduction benefits separate and distinct from the NMOG fleet average requirement. Though the two mandates are complementary, they are not essential for one another. The designs of the vehicles in the LEV program will be based on the emission levels that manufacturers must meet. The mandates merely tell the manufacturers how many vehicles of each type must be built. Each mandate creates a fully functional and enforceable motor vehicle emissions program. Therefore, EPA believes that a LEV program designed to reduce emissions in the northeast that includes the NMOG fleet average may, but need not, include the ZEV sales requirement. EPA continues to request comment on whether state incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement is necessary to satisfy the identicality requirement of section 177. 4. Incorporation of Minor Provisions of the California LEV Program The OTC's initial recommendation to EPA does not specifically identify every component of the California LEV program that it intends to incorporate into the OTC LEV program; nor does the recommendation include proposed regulations. Instead the recommendation identifies the main elements of the OTC LEV program and the timeframe for the regulations. EPA believes that the implicit intent of the recommendation was incorporation of emission standards that were identical to the California LEV program and incorporation of all provisions of California's LEV program necessary to ensure consistency with section 177 for 1999 and later model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks (0&hyph;5750 pounds loaded vehicle weight). This intent is evidenced by the implicit language of the recommendation. The recommendation specifically notes that the OTC LEV program is to be applied ``[p]ursuant to the requirements of section 177.'' EPA believes that the listing of the most important provisions of the California LEV program to be incorporated was not meant to imply the exclusion of other provisions necessary to ensure consistency with section 177. The recommendation adopted the OTC LEV program ``including'' the listed provisions, implying that other provisions would also be included. EPA's interpretation of the petition is further supported by the Response to Comments document submitted with the recommendation (and in the docket), which clearly states, at page 27, that the recommendation has been made consistent with section 177 and 184 of the Act. The Response to Comments document also notes, at pages 6 and 33, that the provisions of the recommended program were constrained by section 177's identicality requirement. Another indication that the OTC clearly intended the program to be consistent with section 177 is the fact that the recommendation requests incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement only to the extent it is required for consistency. Thus, the OTC was willing to include this controversial provision if consistency depended on its inclusion. Moreover, the Executive Director of the OTC, Bruce Carhart, stated explicitly, in an April 15, 1994 letter responding to an EPA inquiry, that the OTC's ``intention is to maintain identicality with California as required by the Clean Air Act.'' Mr. Carhart also indicated that the OTC intended to incorporate secondary provisions in California's LEV program into the OTC LEV program. EPA believes that it is appropriate to use this letter as further evidence of the intent of the Commission. Where there is ambiguity in the OTC petition, EPA does not believe that its ability to review the OTC recommendation is limited to examining the explicit language of the recommendation. Certainly, EPA approval of the recommendation cannot include provisions that were not contemplated by the recommendation and do not naturally arise from the face of the recommendation. However, where the recommendation is ambiguous regarding a certain point, EPA believes that, consistent with its requirement to consult with the Commission, it may request clarification of the OTC petition. Further, under §184(c)(3), if EPA must interpret a recommendation in a certain way in order to ensure consistency with the Act, and such an interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the recommendation, then EPA is constrained to use that interpretation. For these reasons, EPA interprets the recommendation to require emission standards identical to California's LEV standards and to require promulgation of provisions that ensure consistency with section 177.
