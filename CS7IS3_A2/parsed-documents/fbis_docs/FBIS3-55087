Admittedly, now as a national martyr. To put it bluntly, this has been accomplished in a fairly original manner: Leading opposition publications have submitted for the public verdict a grand dedicatory anthem urging the nation not to stone yesterday's idol. The idea of his being stoned is a patent exaggeration. The purpose of the article is simple: A People's Front leader with a tarnished reputation makes the opposition unappealing, and without that appeal there is every indication that it will be hard to revive its lost image. Especially since parties and their leaders do not currently enjoy popular support. That is why they are trying to draw public attention to their "own persona." This is the light in which one should view the rumors of the alleged attempt on Elchibey's life, as well as opposition newspapers' articles against President Geydar Aliyev. Numerous articles are targeting the president's team. They interpret the failures on the Karabakh front as demonstrating the head of state's inability to ensure the people's safety and the hard lot suffered by the 1 million refugees is presented as the inevitable consequence of the "new Aliyev's" political course. According to one observer, the "newspaper war" is equal to the Karabakh war. The president's meeting with the leaders of political parties revealed an extremely dangerous trend: Parties have become isolated from the masses and gotten carried away by what is just political intrigue in the newspapers. In an attempt to shout one another down 200 newspapers are vying in denouncing the authorities for the most grievous offenses and trying to outdo their opponents in terms of "perspicacity." The hopes that Gaydar Aliyev would close down the political publications in anger have not been realized. In this respect the statement by a U.S. State Department spokesman, who rushed to shout menacingly across the ocean about alleged violation of press freedom in Azerbaijan, can only be compared to a "false alarm." No one in the republic intends to ban opposition newspapers. Things banned by the law on the press have been banned. Newspaper publishers and editors have been given strict warnings: Wartime conditions have to be taken into consideration -- they must not spread panic, engage in disinformation, or divulge military secrets. To that end the National Assembly has introduced military censorship. Georgia, incidentally, has done the same in the past. The law says that any fabrication may cause a publication to be suspended for a month. If they do not like various actions taken by the authorities, they can go ahead and criticize individual points and individuals based on facts, but not on fabrication. However, there is nothing mysterious about the articles carrying various rumors. There are definite forces behind each "custom-made" article: Some are dying for power, some are afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed. After all, a number of the recent denunciations in the republic relate to thefts on a particularly grand scale: the illegal export of hard currency, machinations with grain and food purchases, arms dealing. In a word, the "newspaper war" is least of all to do with an upsurge in political activity. Many political scientists think that the "unmasking" of every smart operator is accompanied by a "newspaper fusillade." But this time the opposition has miscalculated. The concentration of fire on "headquarters" has failed to hit its target: The authorities have not flinched, and the people have not rushed off to rallies. As for the dedicatory anthem to the ex-president, "Don't Stone an Idol," this work has disappeared without trace. A popular singer has translated it into English and sings it country-and-western style with a saxophone and flute accompaniment. It has been a real hit. As they say, it is just one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.
