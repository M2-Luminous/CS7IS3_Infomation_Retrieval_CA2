And so, finally, more or less specific decisions were adopted at the meetings of the NATO Council on 2 December and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council a day later in Brussels on the interaction of the once mutually hostile parts of the Euro-Atlantic space. The "Partnership for Peace," about which people began to speak following the October visit to Moscow of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, formed the basis of this interaction. The basis of the concept was laid, if we glance into recent history, by Russia in President Boris Yeltsin's message to the NATO Council session in December of the year before last, which spoke not of membership of the bloc but of the intention of full-scale cooperation with it in specific spheres. Then, when a number of East European countries--Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia--advanced the idea of swift and urgent affiliation with NATO, the Americans presented this concept, in new packaging, it is true. One way or another, it is an expansion of partner relations, not quantitative expansion, which has been approved by both NATO and the NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council]. For Russia this is important primarily because on these terms it will not be isolated from the process of Euro-Atlantic integration, which could have happened given NATO's reinforcement by former participants in the Warsaw Pact. Their overriding idea concerning affiliation to the North Atlantic alliance was not taken seriously in principle. Largely thanks to the active explanatory work of Russian diplomacy, incidentally. And now, according to Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, this idea has been buried. It is gratifying that the decision on the expansion not of the bloc itself but of specific partner relations among all states was adopted at the NACC session by consensus, having obtained support not only on the part of NATO and Russia but of the Central and East European countries themselves also. True, even now there is a difference in the approaches to the essence of this process. There is on the part of the alliance an attempt to interpret this movement by use of the "NATO plus" formula. It means that there is the NATO bloc, to which other countries conforming to NATO standards--transparency of the military budget and civilian control of the military department--should affiliate. As a counterweight to this, Andrey Kozyrev put forward at the NACC session his concept of the association and cooperation under the aegis of the CSCE of all leading regional organizations in the Euro-Atlantic space. The Russian idea is that NATO, the CIS, the Western European Union, the European Union, and such should become equal partners, among whom no one would occupy a dominating position. And the military-political and military-technical aspect of such partnership should be secured by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which, in Moscow's opinion, should be made an independent organization with its own secretariat and other support structures. Meanwhile, however, the NACC is a NATO lobby for the North Atlantic bloc. And if some people, as the head of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry said in his speech at the NACC session, "like to stand in the lobby and take the exam, this is the sovereign right of each state." Russia, however, will not do so. Answering the question of your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Kozyrev emphasized that, on the other hand, it would be stupid to refute the fact that NATO is a structure that actually exists, and much that is useful could be derived from cooperation with it. We can for this reason speak about the conclusion of an agreement between NATO and each individual country, and not an exclusive but complementary version is possible on this level also, as are both at the same time with the simultaneous strengthening of the structures of the NACC, which, incidentally, is the Russian idea, which all the delegations in Brussels greeted with interest. "The seed," Kozyrev said, "did not fall on stony ground." There are far fewer disagreements at the practical programs level. There is in the documents that were approved a substantial set of specific forms of cooperation from joint maneuvers through the training of peacekeeping forces. Even now Russia's Northern Fleet is conducting exercises together with NATO naval forces. In addition, as Boris Gromov, deputy minister of defense of the Russian Federation, said in conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, an agreement between Russia and NATO on joint military operations is being made ready for signature at the present time. It is also contemplated bringing the peacekeeping battalions in the former Yugoslavia, Russian included, under the jurisdiction of NATO, under the aegis of the United Nations, naturally, for greater efficacy. Generally, following the Brussels meeting there have come to be more conditions for cooperation. The Partnership for Peace concept is blazing a trail for itself, for which much of the credit goes to Russian diplomacy. Politicians expect a further expansion of it from the top-level meetings scheduled for January: of NATO in Brussels and of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in Moscow.
