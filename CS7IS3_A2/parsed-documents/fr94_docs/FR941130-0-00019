FR941130-0-00019 FR941130-0-00002 The FDIC generally expects proposed conversions to substantially satisfy the standards found in the mutual-to-stock conversions regulations of the OTS (12 CFR Part 563b). Any variance from those regulations will be closely scrutinized. Compliance with OTS requirements will not, however, necessarily be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes. A bank's notice to the FDIC will not be deemed complete until the State Savings Bank provides the materials required by the final rule, including any materials specifically requested by the FDIC after the bank's initial submission. The FDIC will notify the institution when the notice is complete. The FDIC will issue to the converting bank a notice of intent not to object to the proposed conversion, if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion would not pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the bank, violate any law or regulation or present a breach of fiduciary duty. The Interim Final Rule currently provides that when the FDIC intends to object to a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank it must do so within 60 days of receiving a complete notice of the proposed conversion. The FDIC, in its discretion, may extend the initial 60-day period by another 60 days. The Interim Final Rule also provides that, if the FDIC fails to object to a proposed conversion within those prescribed periods, an institution may consummate the proposed conversion. Upon consideration of numerous proposed conversions since the issuance of the Interim Final Rule, the Board has found that, in some cases, the maximum 120-day period prescribed in the Interim Final Rule is about to expire before the applicable state or other federal regulator(s) (who also must act on the proposed transaction) has or have acted on the proposed conversion. In order to provide the FDIC with sufficient time to act on a proposed conversion, the Board has included in the final rule an alternative time limit of up to 20 days after the last applicable state or other federal regulator has acted on the proposed transaction. 3. Appraisals The final rule requires that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank, and that the appraisal report be prepared by an independent appraiser and include a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, the justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. This includes a full discussion of the applicability of each peer group member and documented analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below) the converting institution may have from the peer group statistics. The FDIC requires a complete analysis of the institution's pro forma earnings which should include the bank's full potential once it fully deploys the new capital pursuant to its business plan. In reviewing appraisal reports the FDIC will continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines, if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS and the USPAP.
