Yuriy Khlebnikov, an official from the international department at the Kaliningrad region administration office, told journalists at a news conference today that the talks failed to bring results. The talks were headed by Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the group for the talks with the CIS and ambassador at large, and Harry Shmykhov, first deputy head of the Kaliningrad region. A joint protocol has been prepared by the group experts from both sides, which confirms Lithuania's intention to open a Russian transit corridor on her territory. Although no dates have been mentioned, it is expected however that the corridor could start functioning at the end of the current year. Places in Lithuania will have to be earmarked and the procedure on how this transit will be controlled will have to be defined. Lithuania is going to get acquainted with the experience of the West Berlin transit corridor, which was in operation until the Berlin Wall had been demolished. It was announced that Lithuania proposed to simplify the procedure of granting transit visas at the border crossing points to cargo vehicles carrying so-called national economy goods. It was announced at the news conference in Kaliningrad that all the Russian passenger trains except two would travel through Lithuania non-stop and without border checks.
