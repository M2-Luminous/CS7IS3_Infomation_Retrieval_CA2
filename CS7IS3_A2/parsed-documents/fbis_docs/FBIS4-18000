He noted that the Karabakh side agreed on Thursday [28 April] to cease fire during the last night, provided the mediator -- the Russian Federation -- receives a similar reply from the opposing side -- Azerbaijan. In the meantime, there was no confirmation of such a reply, Sarkisyan said. Besides, the diplomat stressed, the Azeri side massed combat materiel and weapons near the north-eastern border of Nagorno-Karabakh and was regularly shelling the Mardakertskiy district from artillery during the last night and this morning. Despite the cloudy weather, the situation is very tense at that section of the front, noted the adviser representing his ministry in Armenia.
