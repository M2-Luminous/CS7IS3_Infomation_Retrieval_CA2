Two regulations to be introduced in Jiangsu later this year will ensure a sound development of its fledgling property market, provincial authorities announced in Beijing yesterday. The move is part of the efforts to regulate its bustling real estate business and ensure a healthy economic growth, said Wu Tingxiang, deputy director of the General Office of Jiangsu. The first drafts of regulations on real estate management and development are now being examined by the Provincial People s Congress and the provincial administration. Meanwhile, a bill governing urban construction is likely to be endorsed next month, Wu said. The province also plans to expand its foreign-oriented production and foreign trade and speed up its infrastructure and basic industries. On Sunday, Premier Li Peng concluded a six-day tour of the province inspecting its progress in all spheres, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. The premier praised the province for a rapid economic development and remarkably improving urban and rural living standards, the report said. Last year, the gross domestic product of Jiangsu reached 255 billion yuan ($29.3 billion), an 18.5 per cent increase over 1992. According to Wu, Jiangsu is striving to expand its industries in all possible ways. In transport, projects are well under way for construction of the Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway, the Nanjing-Lianyung highway, and dredging the part of the Great Canal in Jiangsu. And it is also speeding up work on the new Nanjing Airport, the Yangtze Highway Bridge in Jiangyin and a new railway in Jiangsu. In infrastructure, construction is continuing on 10 state-level development zones, and 48 provincial-level development zones. Real estate, as one of the province's pillar industries, is now enjoying a boom in Jiangsu, Wu said. The number of real estate firms reached 2,400 last year, 27.5 per cent of which are joint-ventures. Last year, more than 13 billion yuan ($1.49 billion) was spent in the sector in constructing commercial and residential buildings, taking up 12 per cent of Jiangsu's investment in fixed assets.
