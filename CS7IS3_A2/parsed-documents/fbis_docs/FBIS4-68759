One of "yesterday's men who has surprisingly discovered the present and, in addition, has a pretty good views for the future. The smile of fortune or the art of political survival? What does Mr. Lucinschi himself think about this? [Romm] Brazauskas, Aliyev, Shevardnadze, Lucinschi.... One has the feeling that the former republics of the USSR have begun to pine for the leaders of the CPSU. Perhaps it is a question of the increased "buoyancy" of the former party leaders--they emerge from all scrapes? [Lucinschi] Forgive me, but who started these "scrapes"? No one today cares to recall the ideas we presented in those times. That same Brazauskas and Shevardnadze, how they came in for it in those days! I was hit also, and there was reason--just read our public speeches of that time. Yes, we wanted change, how everything turned out is another matter. Not the best it could have been, to be blunt. That which is new gradually grows out of the past. I do not believe that we are people of the old system because we not only proposed transformations but took part in them also. This is the first point. The second: In the old days also I was not so much appointed as elected, from the elections to the Kishinev University Hostel Council to election as secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. If people elect, consequently, they value. We change together with life. I do not recognize politicians of whom it is said that their position is unshakable. When a person goes out, and it is raining, he opens his umbrella. Is dressing for the weather a retreat from principles? Of course, there are constant human values: kindness, love of motherland, integrity, finally. Political reference points are conditioned by life's demands. In one case one thing is suitable, in another, something else. It does not seem to me that in the former republics of the USSR people are being racked by nostalgia for the former times. It is more a desire for stability. And we are required to satisfy this desire of the people. If we cannot, we will be replaced by others. [Romm] Today's political type and the Soviet political type--how much do they differ, in your view? [Lucinschi] The former was more beset by complexes and oriented toward restrictions, stereotypes. There could be no dissertation, no speech, say, without quotations from Lenin and Brezhnev. There was more of a bifurcation at that time: There was politics "on the job" and "domestic" politics. Although we, the last generation of politicians of the Soviet Union, adhered less to the canons and argued more. Now, however, a politician is more unfettered and more decisive not only in his views but in his actions also. True, many people are commenting that there is too much argument and far from always on a point of substance. The lack of inhibition sometimes exceeds all permissible bounds. Previously everyone understood that it was necessary to get along with those at the top. If you were held in some esteem there, your career was assured. Now, on the contrary, politicians orient themselves only toward those below them. Our members of parliament, say, it is quite difficult to unite them for collective action. Everyone tries to please his electorate first and foremost. [Romm] Does it not seem to you, Petru Kirillovich, that had you not fallen foul of the first putsch, you would have fallen foul of the second? [Lucinschi] Possibly. Too much is usually demanded of a politician--an instantaneous response to complex events. The national leadership at that time criticized us for our slow response to the events of August 1991. During the second putsch--rebukes once again, aimed at the Russian leadership this time. But this is life. And had things taken a different turn? Restraint is needed in such cases. Had I fallen foul of the second putsch, once again I would have been in no hurry. [Romm] Can you distinguish in yourself, as a politician, your strongest and weakest traits? [Lucinschi] My strong side is my weak side also--I do not form "my team," I rely on those with whom I happen to work. Trusting those around me, I have, of course, been "burned"--not everyone next to one is sincere. But it is better this way than trusting no one. [Romm] Whether it is true or not, it is said that you feel quite lonely on Moldova's political Olympus. [Lucinschi] Before becoming speaker of parliament, I held dozens of election meetings and socialized with thousands of people. Aside from planned meetings at enterprises, there was informal street contact also. It seemed to me that many people link their particular hopes with me. This restrains me each time it suddenly occurs to me to change the nature of my occupation. Am I lonely in this office? No, I do not experience loneliness. I experience another feeling--regret. It jars on me when our bureaucrat, having built a home and purchased a car, puts up one further little mansion and purchases yet another Mercedes--with dishonest money. Ours is a small republic, everything is in public view. If it is lonely, it comes from helplessness at being unable to bring order to bear. [Romm] What will it take for this? You once said that Moldova needs 1,500 laws. When will you have prepared and adopted them? [Lucinschi] A great deal of time will be needed, of course. But the present parliament, elected according to the proportional system, did in the first several weeks as much as the previous one did in six months. I said before the elections even that if one of the 13 parties that were fighting for seats in parliament were to obtain a majority, this would be the best thing. Otherwise we would once again be bogged down in intrapolitical struggle. I do not know of an instance in world practice of some member of parliament being answerable for having voted wrongly. It is usually the party that won the elections that is responsible. Had we not had a victorious majority here, we would have the same situation as in Russia, say. For what and to whom is Zhirinovskiy with his 22 percent of the vote responsible? Our Agrarian-Democratic Party, however, with which I am affiliated, has 54 percent of the seats in parliament. The parliamentary majority has formed a government accountable to both parliament and the people. An effective mechanism of power has come about. [Romm] It was this, evidently, which secured the swift ratification of the treaty on Moldova's membership of the CIS also? [Lucinschi] It was not so much politics as economics that prompted this decision. The manufacturers were telling us: Give us an outlet to the market. What kind of a parliament are we unless we create the necessary conditions for them? I was asked whether we would not be politically dependent on the CIS countries here. I replied: Of course we will be. What small countries are not politically dependent on big ones? This dependence does not frighten me, I failed to understand right from the outset why we had to reject the CIS. [Romm] Will this ratification change relations between Moldova and Romania, in your view? [Lucinschi] I would not say so. We have emphasized repeatedly right from the start that Moldova wants to develop as an independent state in friendship with neighbors and other countries. That some politicians of Romania view our decision as a sign of a cooling and even of a break with them altogether is another matter. But what there is in our common history, in the culture--this is here to stay. The common language itself presupposes closer human contact. The statements of our previous parliament and of a number of political parties were presented such that the people of Moldova want to unite with Romania. But sociological surveys have said that this is not so. It was no accident that the party that advocated unification with Romania mustered only 0.3 percent of the vote at the last elections. [Romm] We have heard in Moldova repeatedly: We are not Moldovans, we are Romanians. You do not consider yourself a Romanian? [Lucinschi] My parents and my forebears were Moldavians. Hence, I am a Moldavian also. And the majority of inhabitants of our state feels this way. After all, Moldova has had its own history since the 14th century. This was, as we know, the northernmost province of the Roman Empire, this was why the ethnonyms "Roman" and "Romanian" became prevalent. Some people call themselves Romanians now also. I am not allergic to this. If this is what you call yourself, so be it. [Romm] The previous parliament relinquished its authority on account of it being unable to untie the "Tiraspol knot." Will not the present parliament depart for the same reason? [Lucinschi] That corps of deputies was unable to handle any serious problem, specially such a major one as this. Now, however, we have quite a number of pragmatists who are not obsessed with extremes. The Tiraspol leaders themselves are saying that with the accession to power of the Agrarian-Democratic Party a real opportunity for resolving this problem has appeared. [Romm] And what have you personally done to bring the banks of the Dniester closer together? [Lucinschi] Inasmuch as the 14th Army is in the Dniester region, inasmuch as the self-proclaimed republic is supported by certain forces in Russia, and inasmuch as Russia is linked with this conflict in general, settling it without it is impossible. This is why I insisted that Russia appoint its representative, who would assume the role of mediator and be constantly up to date. Moscow agreed, and negotiating is now easier. [Romm] You are being called the future president of Moldova. Is there any basis for this talk? [Lucinschi] We will have presidential elections here in 1996 so there need be no hurry. When I began my work in parliament, the press began to constantly set Snegur and myself against one another. It would like, evidently, to organize some conflict. I believe, however, that since we have been elected, we should work together--otherwise it will be bad for everyone. In a word, all in good time. Who knows what the alignment will be in 1996? I have experience of how changeable society's affections are, and I am not forecasting my presidency--this would get in the way of work.
