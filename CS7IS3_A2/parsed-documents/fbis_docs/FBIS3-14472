For his part, Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah, in a similar interview to the paper, has stressed that the State of Kuwait was fully prepared to respond to any provocation or any reckless action the Baghdad regime might contemplate. Shaykh 'Ali said "the situation on the northern borders is changeable. It could be reassuring today and the opposite tomorrow; however, our armed forces are prepared to face up to all eventualities", pointing to the existence of coordination with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Egypt, and Syria. On the other hand, AL-WATAN has attributed to a high ranking Foreign Ministry source as having said that the Foreign Ministry had checked the reports circulated by the Iraqi opposition, and it was ascertained that the 10th Division of the Iraqi Army has moved from the marshes area to the north. The source stressed to the paper that the situation was under control, an aerial surveillance operation was carried out every two hours, all movements were monitored very closely and, according to available reports, the picture had not changed in 12 days. Iraqi opposition in Syria reported two days ago the existence of an Iraqi forces build up estimated at 180,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti borders.
