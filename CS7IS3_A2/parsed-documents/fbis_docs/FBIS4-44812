Their goal is to renovate virtually all forces by 2005-2010. Western manufacturers visiting Santiago, Chili, for the FIDAE'94 Show 21-28 March began to see visions of an enormous goldmine. Most Latin American countries, which were overarmed in the 1970s, now have only aging fleets of fighters, on their last legs, at their disposal. And for lack of financial resources, these several hundred combat planes will not be totally replaced until the next decade. Until then, upgrading is the solution of choice. The scope of South America's replacement and maintenance market had been limited until now by tacit agreements between the principal states in the region, which were anxious to maintain the existing balance of power. But Argentina upset this stability last December when it decided on a program to update its 36 A-4/A-4M Skyhawks and buy another 24 on the North American market. In response, Chili, whose short-term projects had been limited to the purchase of five Mirage 5s to accommodate increased staffing, issued a bid invitation to acquire 20 additional aircraft on the second-hand market. This rivalry has rekindled competition on all sides. In Chili, SABCA is offering a batch of 20-25 Belgian Air Force Mirage 5BAs updated by Sagem (MIRSIP), which are vying against a French proposal to sell 18-20 upgraded Mirage 5Fs taken from Air Force stocks (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1465). Meanwhile, British Aerospace is offering 15 former Nigerian Air Force Jaguars, which are being presented as virtually new aircraft, while Israel has proposed a fighter midway between the Kfir C-2 and C-7 to be manufactured by IAI. Former defense minister Rojas's preliminary decision in favor of the Belgian proposal will bring a Chilian military delegation to Belgium in early April. But despite the Army's continued influence, the final decision rests with the new government which took power last 11 March. As it happens, purchases of future weapons in Chili have run up against a Congressional challenge to the current law allowing 10 percent of the proceeds from national copper exports to be used to fund military acquisitions. Moreover, a parliamentary investigating committee is looking into accusations that the Chilian Army misappropriated funds. The stakes in Argentina are no longer purely military. Lockheed's proposal to update 18 of the Air Force's 36 Skyhawks at FMA (Fabrica Militar de Aviones) facilities in Cordoba seems like a first step toward a takeover of the company by the American aircraft manufacturer. The Argentine government, which is anxious to successfully privatize the military arsenal, seems so favorable to this eventuality that an agreement may be signed quickly in late May or early June. Lockheed's arrival in Cordoba would be a serious threat to all European civil and military manufacturers, starting with Dassault. The latter is negotiating a contract in Argentina to modernize the last 24 Mirages, extending their life to 2015-2020. The deal would be a considerable upgrade market, and would include the installation of a new radar system and "headup" and "headdown" displays. Lockheed is offering to supply the same type of equipment--without delay--on its updated A-4s. Europeans fear a repeat of this scenario in other Latin American countries, primarily Brazil, where there are plans to privatize the Embraer company in late May and distribute 60 percent of the company's shares to the private sector. European and American manufacturers are thus well aware of the need to establish themselves in all Latin American markets. Unable to sell highly sophisticated equipment for now, upgrades are just the entry ticket they need while waiting for better days. In this respect French equipment makers, who flocked to the FIDAE show this year, have a long way to go. Besides American domination, the South Africans and Israelis are strong competitors. The IAI has a solid foothold in Chili through its ongoing modernization of 15 Mirage-Panteras, six of which are already in service in the Chilian Air Force (FACH). In addition to aircraft and system upgrades, the South American market needs a certain number of operational "retrofits." In Chili, for example, FACH is studying the possibility of in-flight refueling of its Pantera fighters. To counter American and Israeli offers of Boeing refuelers and BAe's offer of VC-10s, the French group Intertechnique and SIDMI Co. are proposing an innovative, less onerous system that can be adapted to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It involves an 11,000-liter, removable on-board tank, which can refuel four to six airplanes by means of a standard boom running through the cargo door, closed in flight. The French firms may team up with the Chilian firm ENAER on the system, which they would offer to other regional air forces with in-flight refuelable fighters. Peru and its Mirage 2000s come to mind. The two companies are also teaming up on a ship-based, in-flight refueling system for helicopters (HIFR), which could be adapted to different types of machines, notably Chili's Super Pumas. All approaches are worth exploring. Sully Produits Speciaux, for instance, presented for the first time in Santiago a new single-piece windshield that is better suited to the large-angle use of HUDs on all type of Mirage IIIs and 5s and their spinoffs (Kfir, Dagger, etc.). Though equipment makers are involved in a front-line battle in South America today, aircraft manufacturers are beginning discussions for the future. Besides the traditional contest between Dassault (Mirage 2000), General Dynamics (F-16 A/B), and British Aerospace (Harrier), Sweden's Saab is eager to offer an export version of the Gripen JAS-39C by 1997-98. The Swedish fighter may be equipped with new engines, flight controls, and partly altered avionics in the meantime. Such a development may involve SNECMA [National Aircraft Research and Manufacturing Company] through its future M88-3 jet engine. The Russians--newcomers in this part of South America--revealed their ambitions by presenting their entire panoply of modern combat planes (MiG-29, Su-27, and Su-30) for the first time at FIDAE. Boxed Material: Equipment Makers' Strong Presence A healthy contingent of equipment manufacturers and maintenance companies dominated the eighth FIDAE (Feria Internacional des Aires y del Espacio), which was organized in Santiago, Chili by the Chilian Air Force (FACH). The largest showing was American. Little in the way of new equipment was exhibited at the show, which is mainly devoted to weapons, all kinds of systems, and equipment. With 22 companies represented, France ranked third among the 32 participating countries, behind the United States (90), and Chili (57). In addition, Israel, Italy, and Canada sent particularly large delegations. Inaugurated by Chili's new president, Eduardo Frei, the exhibition received greetings from American president Bill Clinton and a visit by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. On the French side, no member of the government or general staffs made the trip, and few high-ranking officials were present. In this respect the French delegation, headed by Edmond Marchegay (GIFAS/French Aeronautical and Space Industries Group), was politically underrepresented and supremely isolated.

Boxed Material: France's Position in South America Over the 1990-92 period, French aerospace companies wrote $859.8 million worth of orders from South American countries, and delivered goods worth $1.7 billion. The main beneficiaries were Aerospatiale's helicopter division (now Eurocopter), which delivered 75 craft; Airbus, which sold 15 aircraft despite 10 cancellations; the ATR consortium, which placed 7 planes (3 cancellations); Aerospatiale's missiles branch, which sold about 35 Exocets (different versions); and Matra, which took orders for several batches of "Magic" 2 air-to-air missiles (about 50) and sold a few surface-to-air "Mistral" missiles to Chili. Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, which took 72 percent of the deliveries and placed 66 percent of the orders, stand out from other countries of the region. Chili and Peru trail the pack, with 1 percent of orders and 7 percent of deliveries for the first, and 6 percent of orders and 4 percent of deliveries for the second. In late 1993, however, the Thomson-CSF group made a significant breakthrough in Chili by winning an important contract ($20 million) to supply a "Eurocat" 200 air traffic control system, slated to be up and running in late 1995 in Santiago. A second phase, worth a similar amount of money, is still under negotiation. The Franco-German group Eurocopter sold six "Cougar" helicopters to the Chilian Navy in 1993. The last of the batch will be delivered in early April. Other negotiations are underway with Brazil for Cougars and with Chili, where Eurocopter is offering the Navy the BK-117--in competition with the Bell 230--and two additional Bo-105s for border guards. To date, 65 of Chili's total 135 helicopters (including 44 Bells) are Franco-German made. However, Eurocopter has expressed fears that Chili will join the ranks of the local "common market" (NAFTA), which could add--as it has in Mexico--an approximately 20 percent tax to its imports. Despite recent successes, the French aerspace industry still lags behind its main competitors, notably the United States, in South America. The primary criticisms leveled against French suppliers are high prices, long delivery times, and seriously inadequate after-sales service. Boeing heavily dominates the civilian market throughout the continent, where ATR has nonetheless won significant victories. There is strong competition for the military market, in which Israeli and South African manufacturers have established themselves as upgraders.
