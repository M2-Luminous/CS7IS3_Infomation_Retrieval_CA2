The State Concern for bread products told TURAN that grain deliveries are delayed due to tension at the North-Caucasian railway. The same source also said that 200 cars with grain travelling to Azerbaijan are presently at that railway. On June 17 Turkey shipped 24,000 tons of grain to Azerbaijan. According to specialists, this grain delivery is unable to solve bread deficit in the country where every-day need in bread totals more than 2,000 tons. An employee of the State Concern for bread products said that those who live in villages come to Baku to buy bread since, actually, bread is not delivered to Azerbaijani republics [plural as received]. This fact worsens the bread deficit in Azerbaijan as well.
