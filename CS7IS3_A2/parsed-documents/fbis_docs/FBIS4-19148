FBIS4-19148 "drweu072_k_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 PORTUGAL Military Issues Reviewed Military Issues Reviewed 94P20639B 94P20639B CSO [Editorial Report] A number of issues dealing with the military have surfaced in the Portuguese press. Offsets for F-16's Writing in the 19 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, military affairs specialist Jose Vegar contends that the Ministry of Defense "inexplicably" gave up its right to more offsets in the negotiations for the purchase of 20 U.S.-made F-16 Lockheed fighter aircraft. While at the outset Portugal expected some $100 million, Vegar cites a "high U.S. official" as saying that the company will only pay $42 million. He also cites Ministry of Defense sources as stating that negotiations are ongoing and that Portugal expects offsets of about $90 million. The issue surfaced at the end of 1992, when the United States announced that Portugal would have to pay $173 million for the F-16 aircraft Washington refused to consider part of the payment for the use of the Azores' Lajes air base. Lisbon agreed, expecting that offsets would be offered by the manufacturer, "as is the practice," Vegar continues. However, Lockheed was "evasive" throughout 1993, prompting the Portuguese minister of defense to notify the company that unless offsets were not negotiated until 1 December 1993, the deal was off. Following a recent visit to Lisbon by a Lockheed team, which initially offered $18 million, the Ministry of Defense agreed to accept $42 million. Vegar cites an unidentified Portuguese high official involved in the negotiations as explaining the changes that took place in the ministry--notably the departure of State Secretary of Defense Eugenio Ramos--influenced the "final outcome," given that the Portuguese negotiators were "less familiar" with the issue, whose real importance they were not aware of. Vegar regrets that Portugal concluded the agreement, for the threat to cancel it was Lisbon's only trump card. Lajes Issue Revisited According to an article in the 22 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO, the Lajes cooperation agreement between the United States and Portugal will be signed at the end of July. The only issue pending at this time is the labor agreement, despite the fact that the United States has finally agreed that labor relations will be regulated on the basis of Portuguese legislation. Notably absent from the agreement is the issue of "financial offsets" for the Lajes base use, which will be the subject of two distinct formulations: the first will be in the context of NATO, while the second will relate to specific U.S. interests, with the use of the base reviewed case by case. Missiles, Machine Guns Acquisition Jose Vegar notes in the 12 March SEMANARIO that following the refusal by the United States to furnish Stinger missiles to Portugal as compensation for the Lajes base, the government will soon open the acquisition of ground-to-air missiles and target-detecting equipment to international bidding. According to Vegar, who contends that the Stinger missiles were already "antiquated," competition will be harsh, with the Short Missile System (SMS) British-French company formed by the Short and Thomson firms and the French Matra company already squaring off for the fight ahead. Meanwhile, bidding for the new 5.56 machine gun to replace the old G-3's is progressing, Vegar continues. The defense firm INDEP has already submitted its report to Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira, who has decided that the issue should be classified "top secret." The companies vying for the contract will be invited to detail the offsets they are willing to offer. According to Vegar, INDEP has evaluated the various types of weapons in the competition and is now awaiting Nogueira's "political" decision, which reportedly involves the U.S. Colt, the Israeli Galil, and the Austrian Steyr companies. Scarcity of Volunteers According to the 1 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, Fernando Nogueira's plan to limit compulsory military service to four months for all branches of the armed forces has run into difficulties because of the lack of volunteers. In addition, according to a military source cited by EXPRESSO, volunteers are refusing to serve in areas other than those where they reside. As a result, the government has decided to increase military service to seven months for recruits who will serve in the medical services. It should be noted that in general, military officials have disagreed with the reduction of military service on grounds that it is "technically impracticable."
