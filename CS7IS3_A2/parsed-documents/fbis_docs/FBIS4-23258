On that occasion, the Chadian head of state decided to upgrade the Aozou administrative post, the only locality in that 114,000-square-km desert area to subprefecture status. The Aozou Strip was handed over to the Chadian authorities yesterday after more than 20 years of Libyan occupation. For many people, Libya is trying, by that gesture, to gain increased African support in its efforts to get the United Nations to lift sanctions against it. [passage omitted]
