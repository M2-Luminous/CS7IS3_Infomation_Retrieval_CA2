FBIS4-46333 "jptot024__l94010" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 15 June 1994 INTERNATIONAL Further Details on Iranians Arrested in Attempted Bangkok Further Details on Iranians Arrested in Attempted Bangkok Bomb Daily Views Malaysia, Iran Role BK0806131694 BK0806131694 BFN [Editorial Report] Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June carries an editorial on the arrest by Thai police of three Iranian suspects in the foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in March. MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It urges the police to prove that the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not just scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as members of international terrorist groups, the government should, in order to give more weight to the arrest, seek cooperation from the Malaysian Government for more information on the suspects as it was found that they once lived in Malaysia. Cooperation from Malaysia would enhance Thailand's credibility in doing justice to the arrested terrorists," MATICHON says. It also wants the government to contact Iran on the issue. "Iran is another country which should be able to supply Thailand with information about the suspects who hold Iranian passports," says the editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we cannot expect much from Iran since it is natural that Iran would rather be cautious and try to demonstrate that it has nothing to do with activities by international terrorist groups." The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand," the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make that policy known to those countries which support international terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to come to Thailand.
