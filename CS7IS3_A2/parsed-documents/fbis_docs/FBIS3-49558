Asked if Poland seeks full membership in NATO or only its security guarantees, the president said that "paper guarantees" are good for nothing. An authentic security guarantee would be Poland's integration into European structures, including NATO. Walesa thinks that his meeting with the U.S. President will be "difficult" because Clinton will probably defend his program, which is kind of imposed on us. President Walesa will fly to Prague at 0615 GMT on 12 January, while Prime Minister Pawlak departs 45 minutes before the president. That same day in the evening, also separately, both politicians will return to Warsaw. According to the Belvedere and the URM [Council of Ministers Administration], the top state officials cannot travel together. The president and prime minister will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, who is already in Prague to prepare the meeting with Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The Polish delegation will first meet with Czech officials, and then with the Americans. During his meeting with Edward Moskal, chairman of the Congress of Polish Americans, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak thanked him for the support extended by that organization for Poland's seeking full NATO membership.
