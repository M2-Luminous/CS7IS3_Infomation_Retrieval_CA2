The letter to the Russian ambassador said that the irresponsible acts in throwing 900 tons of nuclear waste from a nuclear submarine base near Vladivostok into the East Sea of Korea on October 17, 1993 are arousing deep apprehensions among the Korean people and their neighbouring countries. The nuclear waste poses a grave threat to the health and existence of the peoples of Korea and neighbouring countries, the letter said, urging a stop to the dumping of nuclear waste in the sea for the stable life of mankind and for the protection of the ecological environment of the sea. The letter to the Japanese ambassador recalled that Japan started dumping radioactive substances in the sea from 1955 and had thrown 1,661 200-litre drums packed with venomous wastes into surrounding seas in the period from 1959 to 1969. It strongly urged an immediate halt to such dangerous acts.
