FR940804-0-00023 FR940804-0-00011 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 46&hyph;3&hyph;6525; FRL&hyph;5010&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of final rulemaking (NFRM). SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on January 12, 1994. The revisions concern a rule from the Sacramento Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). This rule is intended to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from degreasing (cleaning) operations. This final action notice will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate VOC emissions in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. On October 22, 1991, the sanctions and FIP clocks were started when EPA determined that the State failed to make a complete submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made a complete submittal. This final action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and stop the Federal Implementation Plan clock. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on September 6, 1994.
