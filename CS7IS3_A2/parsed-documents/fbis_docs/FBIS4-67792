The unfortunate part is that they are not showing any signs of improving mainly because Pakistan wants to internationalize the Kashmir issue which is essentially a bilateral matter. The proposed sale of 38 F-16 aircraft by the United States to Pakistan can by no stretch of imagination be seen as a measure to improve the ground situation and prepare for peace in the region. Proliferation cannot be prevented by delivery system for nuclear bombs. This will only trigger an arms race and divert funds from poverty removal and development programs so necessary for the malnourished and deprived population in both India and Pakistan. The Indian position has intrinsic merits and cannot be wished away or brushed off by Washington if it genuinely wants South Asia as a zone of peace. In the event of the sale of F-16's by waiving the Pressler Amendment coming through, the Indian reply could well be to have as many Agni [long-range surface-to-surface] missiles. Interestingly, Washington wants New Delhi to stop the deployment of Agni missile. Washington has to decide then whether it should show genuine concern for peace in this region or superimpose this with its concern for the prosperity of the domestic arms lobby which stands to rack in $800 million by selling the F-16's. If the United States is to be credible then its actions will have to match its words. At the moment, they do not appear to synchronize. And what is this capping of nuclear weapons capability by Islamabad that Washington is talking of? If media reports on Pakistan are to be believed, then the statement by General Beg at a recent seminar in Karachi is an eye-opener. He said that Pakistan has done the capping five years ago and that, too, without verification of nuclear installations by Washington. What is implied is that America should not go in for any verification now. Also if the capping has already been done by Pakistan, then the question that arises is why should the United States treat capping as a new concession and reward Pakistan with F-16's. Is this some king of massive hoax? In the circumstances, what Mr. Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, could try to do during his current visit to India is try to work for a verification package with India applying international inspection to check out if the use of fissile materials is really for peaceful purposes. Since Mr. Talbott's next halt after New Delhi is at Islamabad, he could repeat the same offer there also. Washington's contradictions are quizzing. It talks of human rights [word indistinct] of those very countries which are the worst perpetrators of human rights violations. It talks of democracy and then assists undemocratic regimes. It talks of peace and prepares a conflict situation. It knows that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir through armed secessionist groups. It knows Pakistan wants to grab Kashmir by force, something India will never permit. It knows that Pakistan disagrees with agreements signed by it like the Simla agreement. Since what was signed by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, one would have thought that his daughter Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would have thought seriously of implementing it, but America does little to persuade Pakistan to shed its belligerence and obstinacy. The observation that Pakistan was born in sin [as heard] and lives on hatred of India is not off the mark. Successive regimes in Pakistan have thrived on India-baiting and bashing. At various international forums, including the Human Rights Commission in Geneva where Pakistan suffered a major diplomatic fiasco recently, it has sought to target India and hide its own gross violations of human rights, deny the fundamental rights to the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and northern territories of Hunza, Gilgit, and Baltistan and the violent suppression of minorities like the Christians, Hindus, and the Ahmediyas.
