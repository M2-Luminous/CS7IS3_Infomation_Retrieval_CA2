FR940607-0-00073 FR940607-0-00017 Because application of present or future USPAP standards to federally related transactions may be inconsistent with maintaining the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the agencies have modified the standard on compliance with the USPAP. This modification makes clear that principles of safe and sound banking may require institutions to comply with stricter standards than the USPAP. Although the institution has the primary responsibility for obtaining a Title XI appraisal that meets its needs, the agencies may by regulation or guidance identify USPAP standards that are inappropriate for federally related transactions. For example, the USPAP allows an appraiser to appraise property even though the appraiser may have a direct or indirect interest in the property, if the appraiser discloses this fact in the appraisal report. The agencies believe, however, that federal financial and public policy interests are better served by requiring that an appraiser for a federally related transaction not have any direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the transaction or the property. The agencies have included this requirement in the section of the regulation that deals with appraiser independence. The minimum standards also permit regulated institutions to use appraisals prepared in accordance with the USPAP Departure Provision for federally related transactions. The Departure Provision permits limited exceptions to specific guidelines in the USPAP. Appraisers preparing appraisals using the Departure Provision still must comply with all binding requirements of the USPAP and must be sure that the resulting appraisal will not be misleading. The agencies believe that regulated institutions should be allowed to determine, with the assistance of the appraiser, whether an appraisal to be prepared in accordance with the Departure Provision is appropriate for a particular transaction and consistent with principles of safe and sound banking practice. The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed standard that requires appraisals for federally related transactions to be written. The modification makes clear that the written appraisal must contain sufficient information and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage in the transaction. The modification puts regulated institutions on notice of their responsibility to have appraisals that are appropriate for the particular federally related transaction. The agencies are aware that the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation has proposed changing the USPAP to expand the types of appraisal reports that appraisers may prepare. The agencies believe that the standard on written appraisals permits regulated institutions to take advantage of additional flexibility that may be available if the USPAP is amended, as long as the appraisal report contains information and analysis to support the institution's decision. The agencies are retaining from the prior rule the standard regarding deductions and discounts. The USPAP provision on this subject requires the appraiser to include a discussion of deductions and discounts only when it is necessary to prevent an appraisal from being misleading. Although commenters were divided over the need to retain this regulatory standard, the agencies have decided that it is appropriate to emphasize the need to include an appropriate discussion of deductions and discounts applicable to the estimate of value in Title XI appraisals for federally related transactions. For example, in order to properly underwrite a loan, a regulated institution may need to know a prospective value of a property, in addition to the market value as of the date of the appraisal. A prospective value of a property is based upon events yet to occur, such as completion of construction or renovation, reaching a stabilized occupancy level, or some other event to be determined. Thus, more than one value may be reported in an appraisal, as long as all values are clearly described and reflect the projected dates when future events could occur. The standard on deductions and discounts is intended to make clear that appraisers must analyze, apply, and report appropriate discounts and deductions when providing values based on future events. In financing the purchase of an existing home, there typically would be no need to apply any discounts or deductions to arrive at the market value of the property since the institution's financing of the project does not depend on events such as further development of the property or the sale of units in a tract development. In place of the proposed standard on market value, the agencies are retaining the prior standard that required the appraisal to be based on the definition of market value contained in the agencies' rules. Use of the standard from the prior rule is intended to emphasize that the agencies are not changing the definition of market value or the manner in which that definition is applied. The agencies are eliminating regulatory standards that parallel or duplicate requirements of the USPAP. The regulatory standards originally were put in place because of uncertainty about the content of the USPAP and its interpretation. Based on their experience with the USPAP, the agencies believe that the additional standards may be eliminated. Commenters generally agreed. The majority of commenters responded to three specific questions on the need for additional regulatory standards by indicating that it was unnecessary to adopt separate standards on: (i) Analysis of revenues, expenses and vacancies; (ii) valuation of personal property; and (iii) reconciliation of the three approaches to value. The elimination of regulatory standards that parallel USPAP standards should simplify the preparation of appraisals for federally related transactions and reduce regulatory burden. As proposed, the agencies are adding a new provision to make clear that all appraisals for federally related transactions must be prepared by licensed or certified appraisers. This requirement is mandated by Title XI of FIRREA and repeated in other parts of the appraisal regulation. § XX .4(b/c)␣Unavailability of Information [Removed] The agencies are removing the provision that required appraisers to disclose and explain when information necessary to the completion of an appraisal is unavailable. The USPAP currently requires appraisers to disclose and explain the absence of information necessary to completion of an appraisal that is not misleading. See USPAP Standard Rule 2&hyph;2(k). Moreover, when information that may materially affect the estimate of value is unavailable, the agencies believe that generally accepted appraisal standards require appraisers to explain the absence of that information and its effect on the reliability of the appraisal. Therefore, eliminating this provision does not result in a substantive change in the requirements applicable to appraisals for federally related transactions. § XX .4(c/d)␣Additional Standards [Removed] The agencies are removing a provision that merely confirmed the authority of regulated institutions to require appraisers they use to comply with additional standards. The regulation's minimum appraisal standards for federally related transactions do not prevent a regulated institution from requiring an appraiser to follow additional standards or provide additional information to satisfy the institution's business needs and it is unnecessary to restate this fact in the appraisal regulation.
