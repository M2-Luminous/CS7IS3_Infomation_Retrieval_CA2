The prime minister's office gave the president a high rating because he presented the principle and direction of the policy he will pursue in the second year of his administration. He was clear and full of confidence in his speech, and his appeal for concerted efforts at national development and improved standards of living was impressive, it said. Kim's stress on increased international competitiveness was a proper policy direction for the first year of an unlimited trade war under the Uruguay Round trade pact, it said. The National Unification Board said it was encouraged by the optimism that Kim expressed about the future of inter-Korean relations and expected his optimism to have a positive influence on the North Korean nuclear issue, which is in the final stage prior to solution. The Foreign Ministry, which is in charge of the North Korean nuclear problem, said it viewed Kim's remarks that he would do his best to solve the nuclear issue and to improve inter-Korean relations as the expression of a strong will to unravel pending issues with North Korea. Kim's positive view of the nuclear issue will help bring North Korea to the meeting table as there are indications that the North Koreans are moving to change their policy on this issue, a ministry spokesman said. The Defense Ministry said it was pleased with Kim's call on the people to support and encourage the armed forces in its process of rebirth under his military reform policy, which he said he would continue in his second year in office. But some ministry officials were worried about the possibility of a purge of the military under his reform policy this year. Members of Kim's Democratic Liberal Party, especially its conservatives, said they were very happy with the president's remarks that he, as president of the party, will not call a national convention in May and that he will keep DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil in place for at least the coming 12 months. Kim said politics should no longer be "a burden on the people" and that all political energy and resources should be focused on boosting the economy, especially on restructuring agriculture so that it can get over the hardships of farm market opening under the global trade pact, deputy party spokesman Cho Yong-chik, who belongs to Chairman Kim's conservative faction of the DLP, said. Under Chairman Kim's leadership, the party is firmly united to support President Kim in carrying out his policies, Cho added. The democratic justice faction, which is also conservative, attached less importance to President Kim's support of Chairman Kim's leadership, saying that President Kim stressed the need to place more emphasis on the economy than on politics this year. The opposition Democratic Party said that it was disappointed at President Kim's address, because he was not specific on pending issues. He failed to present any specific measures against inflation, though this is one of the most important problems to the people, and this reflects his easy-going attitude on the pressing issues, party spokesman Pak Chi-won said. "He also failed to provide any specific programs for internationalization and market opening, which he so emphatically talked about," he added. "He disregarded the people's right to know by refusing to discuss the progress in negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue." Pak said that not calling a national convention of his party this year reflected Kim's plan to neutralize politics by rejecting party activity and consolidating one-man rule. Rep. Mun Hui-sang, chief secretary to party chairman Yi Ki-taek, charged that Kim did not go beyond basic and general theories in discussing his policy. "For instance, he emphasized the need to increase competitiveness but he did not say anything specific about his labor policy...," moon said. "His agricultural policy also lacks specifics." Rep. Kim Pyong-o, chief policymaker of the party, said: "It's a farce that President Kim adorns his New Year press conference with rosy optimism in this era of international competition in which the law of the jungle prevails." He said he regretted that Kim failed to offer a plan for inter-Korean arms reduction, cultural exchange and economic cooperation when peace settles on the Korean peninsula.
