The chief executive said that his words had been misinterpreted. He emphasized that he does not have the "constitutional power to dissolve Congress." He added that he fully disagrees with any aggression against Congress. Wasmosy pointed out: "This is far from my intention." The president noted that when he said that "the people must mature" he meant the entire society (government officials, politicians, entrepreneurs, trade union leaders, journalists, and so on) and not specifically Congress. He added that the Paraguayan people are gradually changing their beliefs. Moving on, the president recognized the activities currently being carried out by congressmen. He described as normal the controversial positions that exist between the executive and legislative branches, bearing in mind the democracy prevailing in our Republic. President Wasmosy emphasized: "As we pursue the path of democracy, all of us are growing up." He claimed that it is normal to make mistakes. The president emphasized that he trusts these mistakes will be corrected in favor of most Paraguayan people. Laino Does Not Believe in Dissolution of Congress President Wasmosy last night received the European Union's Silver ECU, delivered by Franco Teucci, the European Union's representative in our country, to mark the Day of Europe. During the award ceremony Dr. Domingo Laino, of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, ruled out the possibility of a break in the democratic process. Laino pointed out: "I am not really acquainted with the remarks, but I do not see why he should worry about Congress, because Congress is not seeking to destabilize; quite to the contrary, Congress is trying to stabilize democracy." Laino emphasized: "A group within the Colorado Party has maximalist and fundamentalist attitudes. I believe the destabilizing trend involves this group. I believe the opposition, Congress, and other segments outside the ruling party are demonstrating a very mature and very thoughtful attitude."
