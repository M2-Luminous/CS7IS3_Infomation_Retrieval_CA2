Luis Sa, member of the Communist Party (PCP) political commission and leader of the party's list for the European Parliament elections, stated at a meeting in Funchal that PS views are generally too close to those held by the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). Only if the PS were to adopt new policies to differentiate itself from the government would the PCP consider a rapprochement. Sa added that joint lists had never been advocated for legislative elections but only for the Lisbon mayoral race, where the election of a leftist mayor depends on forming a a PS-PCP bloc. Responding to a question on eventual PCP support for Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio in a presidential race, Sa said it is still "too early" to discuss the issue, which could only be considered after the PS reaches a decision on a particular candidate. PS Views According to the 13 May issue of PUBLICO, PS officials also continue to affirm their party's "strategic autonomy" and reject an alliance with the PCP. The report speculates that the PS officials' statement may be related to recent poll results showing that an alliance with the PCP would boost the PS's percentages by only "1 or 2" percentage points.
