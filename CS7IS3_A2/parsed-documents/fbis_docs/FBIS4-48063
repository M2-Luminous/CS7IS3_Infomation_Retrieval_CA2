"Kigali will fall within a week," a UN military official predicted as rebels pounded a government camp near the airport with a heavy barrage of mortar and artillery fire, blowing up an ammunition depot. "The army is in increasing disarray and many soldiers are deserting," said the official, who requested anonymity. [passage omitted] Gunners of the Hutu-led army have relentlessly shelled rebel headquarters at the former parliament building since Tuesday. Military officials of the United Nations said the government forces were "very much on the defensive". Heavy fighting also raged around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri and in Bugesera, south of the capital, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said. General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the 400 remaining UN soldiers in Rwanda, drove across the battle lines in an armoured personnel carrier for separate meetings with rebel leaders and army officers in a bid to broker a ceasefire Tuesday. In Geneva, Canada called on the UN Commission on Human Rights to hold a special session to discuss developments in Rwanda. Paul Dubois, Canadian acting permanent representative to the commission, stated: "We believe effective action to prevent further human rights violations must be a central element of the overall UN response to the tragedy in Rwanda." UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the new rights commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso was in Burundi, neighbouring Rwanda, on Tuesday, seeking to obtain "impartial" information from a wide range of sources, and hoped to go Wednesday to Rwanda. A UN relief plane landed in Kigali on Tuesday after fighting forced UN officials to turn back an aircraft Monday. Aid agencies have criticised the world body for evacuating most of its soldiers after 10 Belgian UN soldiers were killed in the initial wave of bloodletting. Pressure is mounting for an international military intervention, but the rebels have warned that they will treat foreign forces as hostile invaders. Dallaire was to put ceasefire proposals to both sides within 48 hours. [passage omitted] The UN High Commissioner for Refugees appealed Tuesday for 56.7 million dollars in aid to assist 860,000 people who have fled Rwanda. "We are facing a refugee catastrophe unless enough food, clean water, shelter and sanitation are provided to the refugees packed into the Banako camp in Tanzania," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said. Philippe Gaillard of the International Red Cross said that the government's estimate that 2.5 million Rwandans were displaced was "not very far off the mark" but that fighting had prevented aid workers from reaching many of them. The Catholic aid group Caritas estimates that the bloodbath has put two million people at risk of famine in Rwanda and Burundi, which shares Rwanda's history of bitter feuds between the majority Hutus and the Tutsis, who form about 15 percent of the population in both countries.
