Szilagyi; place and date not given: "I Would Also Accept the Leadership of an Opposition Party"] [Text] [Szilagyi] Both the National Committee and the Executive Committee of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] have already discussed the political situation that emerged after the first round of the elections. How did you evaluate the election results? [Surjan] According to the leading bodies of the KDNP, despite the modest increase in votes compared with the 1990 elections, the first round of the current elections was a failure for the KDNP. The aforementioned increase in votes was not proportional with the organizational development of the KDNP. Our party obtained better-than-average results in areas where we succeeded in presenting a candidate who won the confidence of the voters, a confidence that exceeded the general support for our party. [Szilagyi] How do you intend to improve your position in the second round? [Surjan] The balance of forces between various parties was practically determined by the first round of elections. The KDNP suggests that the voters take primarily the candidates' professionalism into consideration, but they should not forget about the parties that have similar concepts with us either. Just like in the case of nominating candidates, local organizations decide on support. One thing is certain: There will be no written agreement with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], like the one signed in 1990, because an agreement on mutual withdrawal has already been achieved in the two districts where we remained opponents. [Szilagyi] Two days ago, you did not exclude an anti-leftist cooperation that would include the Alliance of Free Democrats, like an opposition roundtable. [Surjan] Reality shows that the opposition roundtable cannot be revived overnight, and there are no possibilities for the emergence of a five-party government. The gaps between the parties are too deep for this to happen. [Szilagyi] You clearly excluded the possibility of a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] earlier. Nor did you consider any cooperation with the SZDSZ as possible. In view of your election results so far, has your position changed? [Surjan] My answer is a firm no. The MSZP failed to come up with a principled declaration regarding the 1956 events, and their close contacts with the trade unions also makes our cooperation impossible. [Szilagyi] The KDNP Executive Committee postponed the detailed analysis of the election results until its next meeting. In your view, why did the KDNP fail to obtain the expected 12-18 percent of the votes? [Surjan] Many circumstances played a role in our failure. In the course of the governing burdens, the KDNP did not assign enough time and energy for the reorganization of its internal structure. The KDNP failed to operate the flow of information adequately within the party, it did not ask the members enough, and it failed in making the society aware of the party's concepts. We failed to make the people really aware of the successes and objective difficulties of the governing activity. [Szilagyi] The Executive Committee decided yesterday on convening the National Committee in July to carry out personnel changes. Your decision means that your election failure could have personnel consequences. What responsibility do you feel for your party's election results? [Surjan] Every party leader should think over what he could have done better. I do not have to evaluate my four-year activity; the relevant body will probably do this in the near future. In any case, as required by our statute, I will resign and thus give the opportunity for my party to decide whether to extend my mandate as party chairman. [Szilagyi] Do you also consider the possibility of leading the KDNP as an opposition party? [Surjan] I find an investigation necessary, so that we can continue our work calmly. The KDNP is preparing to play the role of an opposition party. Social justice and the protection of small people should determine our policy in the coming years, but we will not make use of any demagogy.
