And the situation is made worse by more and more cash-strapped doctors leaving the service. However, the system -- which still has the support of the majority of farmers -- is now seeking to finance itself. Rural authorities have been raising funds for the co-operative health care system using various sources including the State, institutions and individuals. The practice is paying off in Shandong Province, according to a survey carried out by the Medical, Public Health and Sports Sub- commission of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The rural medical co-operative system was initiated in the early 1950s. The service, staffed mainly by the "bare-foot doctors" -- largely urban-educated youths sent for re-education in the countryside during the "cultural revolution" (1966-76) -- helped to alleviate the shortage of medical workers in rural areas. More than 90 percent of the rural production brigades adopted the medical co-operative system in the late 1970s. But at the same time, the household contract responsibility system was being introduced to stimulate the rural economy -- and the reforms that accompanied that system have turned out to be unexpectedly detrimental to the collectively run co-operative medical care system. The central government's ban on 37 sources of revenue last March, aimed at reducing the financial burden on peasants, led to medical funds being held back. The rural medical service, which received 21 percent of the nation's medical care budget in 1978, received only 10 percent in 1991. In Shandong Province, for instance, some rural authorities have refused to fund their clinics. Other parts of the country have found themselves in a similar predicament. Many of the collectively funded clinics in Qinggang County in Heilongjiang Province are now penniless. The shortage of funds has thrown many rural medical services into crisis. Only 5 percent of the nation's villages now are able to afford the medical co-operative service, according to a report in the Legal Daily. The situation has been made worse by the exodus of rural doctors. Two-thirds of the rural doctors in Qinggang County want to leave the co-operatives and set up private clinics, the survey found. As a result of the disintegration of the co-operative system, the peasants are suffering. Once-rich farmers have become impoverished when they have to pay by themselves for an operation or medical treatment. The Medical, Public Health and Sports Sub-commission has recommended that the village-level clinics be funded by rural collectives. And qualified doctors should be encouraged to sign contracts with clinics, said the survey. To help the peasants, some areas in Shandong Province -- such as Weifang, Zhaoyuan, Changqing, and Anqiu -- are trying to set up a new type of co-operative medical system. More than 85 percent of the townships in the province are raising funds from villages and individual farmers to set up and run medical foundations. Individuals are required to pay between 2 and 10 yuan to join the foundation. Those who join get a 30 to 50 percent discount for their medical care.
