FR940203-2-00011 FR940203-2-00007 International Trade Administration Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 93&hyph;086R. Applicant: University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Polymer Science and Engineering, LGRT, Amherst, MA 01003. Instrument: Laser Light Scattering Goniometer System, Model ALV/DLS-5000. Manufacturer: ALV-Laser Vertriebsgesellschaft, m.b.H., Germany. Original notice of this resubmitted application was published in the Federal Register of August 12, 1993. Docket Number: 93&hyph;154. Applicant: University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Chemistry, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer, Model VG AutoSpec&hyph;3000 with Accessories. Manufacturer: Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to analyze samples of complex organic, inorganic and organometallic compounds and biochemicals to determine the molecular weight, molecular formula and structure of compounds having a molecular weight up to 5,000 Daltons. Application Received by Commissioner of Customs: December 20, 1993. Docket Number: 93&hyph;155. Applicant: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Curriculum in Marine Sciences, UNC-CH, CB-3300, 12-7 Venable Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599&hyph;3300. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer with Automated Gas and Gas Chromatograph/Combustion Inlet Systems, Model MAT 252. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for stable isotope ratio measurements on organic compounds, gases at trace concentration, water samples and minerals. The objectives of the investigation are to determine the mechanisms and rates of biogeochemical processes through combined use of stable isotopic measurements with other studies. In addition, the instrument will be used in the courses Marine Sciences 105 (Chemical Oceanography), and Marine Sciences 199 (Biogeochemistry), and Marine Sciences 145 (Geochemistry), providing necessary instruction and training for science majors. Application Received by Commissioner of Customs: December 20, 1993. Docket Number: 93&hyph;156. Applicant: University of Arizona, Tree-Ring Laboratory, Building #58, 105 W. Stadium, Tucson, AZ 85721. Instrument: Automated Microvolume Inlet System. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT GmbH, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument is an accessory to an existing mass spectrometer that is being used for stable-isotope ratio analysis of tree ring, soil and carbonate samples. Measurements will be used to develop relationships with environmental parameters (especially drought) which may be used to reconstruct paleo-environmental seasonal variation. The system represents an improvement in allowing small samples to be easily analyzed and permitting analysis in an automated mode. The instrument will also be used for educational purposes demonstrating the latest stable isotope ratio technology and research applications to graduate students in geosciences, hydrology, watershed management and ecology. Application Received by Commissioner of Customs: January 3, 1994.
