The protest, the first one in the tenure of new Governor Oscar Perassi, was organized by the State Unions Front, whose main leader is Carlos "Perro" Santillan, the municipal workers' leader. The workers, who are demanding that the 80-peso increase granted by the government be incorporated into their fringe benefits package and not be considered just a pay increase, were policed by a Border Guard unit because no policeman put in an appearance. The labor leaders who put themselves at the head of the protesters indicated today that on 27 April they will carry out a general strike in the province if the government does not give a concrete answer to their demands. Despite the fact that there were no incidents, the demonstration was held in an atmosphere of tension because the recent serious incidents in the beginning of the month still are on people's minds.
