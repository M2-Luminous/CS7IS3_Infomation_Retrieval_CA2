This is what the Russia's Democratic Choice Party is being created for," says the preamble to the programme of the new party, which was adopted as a basis today by its founding congress. The programme is an extensive document, which sets forth the stand of the new political organisation with regard to problems of the economic and social policy, the state setup, the anti-crime struggle, culture, arts, science, education and ecology. The economic section of the programme describes as vitally important the reduction of the share of state expenditures in the budget and the gross national product. The new party favours the adoption of a long-term programme of the military reform, which will provide for the reduction of the army along with the reduction of its budget to the level of 3-3.5 per cent. The new party finds it necessary to reform the tax system, to bring down the overall level of the income tax and lay emphasis on the taxation of land and immovables. In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, privatization is the main condition for achieving economic growth. The money received as a result of the selling of shares should be channelled not to the state treasury, but to enterprises themselves for their rebuilding, and investors should be given a possibility to buy the controlling block of shares. The new party believes that the agrarian policy should ensure by all means the support for private and cooperative enterprises in the sphere of the marketing and processing of farm produce, for a further liberalisation of agricultural markets, the creation of the agricultural crediting system and the formation of mechanisms of regulating the land market. In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, the social policy should be based on principles of stopping excessive state protectionism, on the state's responsibility for the unconditional granting of minimal social guarantees in the sphere of labour remuneration, pensions, public health, education and culture. As for the national security and foreign policy, the party believes that partner relations with industrially developed countries do not at all mean that Russia's interests will be "dissolved" in the interests of the West. "Even the closest allied relations provide for the active upholding of one's own interests. Under no condition will Russia agree to the role of a junior partner," the document says. The party believes that the restoration of a common economic space on the territory of the former USSR is one of the key tasks of Russia's policy with regard to the former USSR republics. It is pointed out, however, that this should not be done hastily and with too much fuss.
