While we are deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development, we should also pay attention to maintaining a stable social, economic, and political environment. We should make efforts to advance reform and development in a stable environment. We should realize a stabilized society in the long term through reform and development, thereby maintaining strong momentum in Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic development. Reviewing Tibet's achievements in economic development last year, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: We must integrate the CPC Central Committee's policy decisions with Tibet's actual situation, correctly recognize and handle the relationship between long-term and immediate interests, extensively mobilize and organize the masses of people to contribute to reform, and carefully make plans for launching and carrying out various reform measures. At the same time, we must pay close attention to agricultural and animal husbandry production to strive for another harvest in this year. We must focus on processing industry, foreign trade, tourism, and village and town enterprises; continue to do a good job in the construction of infrastructure in transportation, energy, communications fields; and vigorously improve the investment environment. As long as we follow the CPC Central Committee's plans and work in a down-to-earth manner, we will be able to close the gap between Tibet and other better-developed regions and create a brand new image for ourselves that will impress the entire nation.
