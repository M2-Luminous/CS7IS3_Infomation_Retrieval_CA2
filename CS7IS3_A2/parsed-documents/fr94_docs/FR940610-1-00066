FR940610-1-00066 FR940610-1-00008 The second provision eliminates the regulatory requirement for a specific type of edit check on daily meal counts contained in ยง210.8(a)(2) for schools where the most recent CRE review did not identify meal counting and claiming problems. Currently, the edit check provision requires that each school food authority compare each school's daily meal count with data such as the number of children eligible for free, reduced price or paid meals multiplied by an attendance factor. This check is intended to ensure that monthly claims for reimbursement are based on reasonable and accurate counts of meals offered on any day of operation to eligible children. The Department believes, however, that school food authorities that have demonstrated, through the CRE review, the accuracy of their meal counts and claims should be provided an optional approach to specific edit checks. This proposal would establish a system whereby these school food authorities could develop and implement their own systems of internal controls designed to ensure the accuracy of claims for reimbursement. This system would then be submitted to the State agency for review. If the State agency's review determined that the proposed method constituted an accurate internal control, no further action would be required, and the school food authority's own proposed internal controls would remain in effect. However, if the State agency concluded that the suggested system of internal controls was inadequate, the school food authority would be required to modify its procedures accordingly. In addition, if during the course of a CRE review or other oversight activity of the school food authority, it is determined that the internal controls were ineffective, the specific, regulatory edit check would replace their system until a future regularly scheduled CRE review indicates there are no meal count problems. This proposal would virtually eliminate the requirement for a specific edit check for school food authorities with accurate meal counts and claims measured by the CRE review and replace it with a more flexible procedure to allow these school food authorities to design and implement a system that is streamlined for their particular circumstances. However, this proposal also maintains the necessary specificity of an edit check for school food authorities found to have meal counting and claiming violations. Further it provides for State agency oversight of accountability procedures and a ready mechanism, if needed, to substitute a Federally-defined procedure to ensure accurate claims for reimbursement. The Department believes that program integrity must be maintained by requiring specific criteria when review results indicate problems or failure of the school food authority's alternative system. Section 210.8(a)(2) and (a)(3) would be modified to reflect these proposed changes. The Department is especially interested in receiving comments on this provision. Commenters should address the flexibility this proposed provision allows well-managed school food authorities and any implementation issues this poses. In addition, the Department would be interested in receiving alternative proposals that would accomplish the desired balance between local flexibility and sound accountability. The third area that the Department is addressing to reduce paperwork at the school food authority level is the requirement in ยง210.15(b)(4) that distinct records be maintained to document the nonprofit status of the school food service. These records are the accounts which any enterprise needs to maintain in the normal course of conducting business (i.e., receipts, costs, etc.). Therefore, since these kinds of records are a necessary part of a school food authority's own accountability system and, in many cases, are required by State laws, the Department does not consider it necessary for the program regulations to mandate this recordkeeping requirement. It is important to emphasize that the school food authority would still have to be operated on a nonprofit basis. This proposal is only amending the requirements for documentation of nonprofitability. This proposal would amend ยง210.14(c) and ยง210.15(b) to include this change. In the event that a question or dispute arises in connection with whether a nonprofit school food service has been properly operated, the burden of proof still be upon the school food authority to demonstrate that the school food service is being operated on a nonprofit basis. Length of Meal Periods As noted above, many commenters expressed concern that children be given sufficient time in which to eat, particularly if larger portion sizes are to be served. The Department also recognizes the need to balance the time for academics with the time to receive and eat school meals, especially lunch. Although the Department has no authority in this area, school food service directors are strongly encouraged to work with other school officials to ensure that adequate meal service times and facilities are provided. Likewise, the Department will continue to work with DOEd to solicit support in the education community to ensure that educators and school administrators understand the importance of students having adequate time to eat.
