Ye said that the "framework of national industrial policy in the 1990s (FNIP)", worked out by the State Council, China's highest governing body, laid down important policies on the direction and targets of the country's structural adjustment in the 1990s. He said China encourages direct foreign investment in infrastructure and basic industries. Investors in the transport sector are expected to be given first priority in developing real estate along the facilities they build. To promote trigger industries, China will increase input into technological advancement in electronics and machinery, oil and petro-chemicals, automobile and building industries. Those sectors will also enjoy priority in issuing bonds and shares, Ye said. China will also readjust import tariffs in accordance with the industrial policies to boost foreign trade, he said. Under the just-issued policies, the vice-minister said, China will also rationalize the industrial organization, promote technological upgrading, adjust economic location, continue to develop service sectors, and accelerate the growth of hi-tech industries. According to Ye, the State Council will, in the near future, spell out specific policies for such infrastucture and key industries as transport, telecommunications, construction, electronics and machinery, petro-chemical industry, foreign trade, foreign investment and technology, so as to speed up development of those sectors.
