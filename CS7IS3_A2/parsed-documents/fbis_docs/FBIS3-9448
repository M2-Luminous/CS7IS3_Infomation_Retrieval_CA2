The meeting between the president and the prime minister in the Belweder ended an hour ago. [Reporter Piotr Jazwinski] The Belweder talks lasted less than 30 minutes. The prime minister presented the president with the motion to appoint Dariusz Rosati to the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister and a request to accept it. The president did not accept this candidacy because, as [presidential spokesman] Minister Andrzej Drzycimski explained, it created a double risk. [Begin Andrzej Drzycimski recording] Mr. Dariusz Rosati may not sufficiently know the Polish realities. After all, his three years' absence from Poland does play an enormous role in these processes and the changes we were implementing, and this may make making difficult economic decision even more difficult. Also, too much may depend on secondhand information. And the second thing, the second risk that the president raised was the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund [FOZZ] case. The legal situation has not been completed yet. The investigation is going on, although there are statements by the justice minister. Nonetheless, the case is still being investigated, and there may be unnecessary connections in such a difficult situation we find ourselves in. [end recording] Dariusz Rosati was on the FOZZ Supervisory Board. Minister Drzycimski passed over in silence the question as to whether the failure to accept Rosati's candidacy would start a war between the Belweder and the Democratic Left Alliance. He added that the question of the president's signature on the Budget Law was still open. [video shows Walesa entering a hall and meeting Pawlak, Drzycimski speaking to journalists]
