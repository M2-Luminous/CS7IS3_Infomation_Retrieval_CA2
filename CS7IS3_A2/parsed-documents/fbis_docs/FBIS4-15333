He Thinks That the End Justifies the Means"] [Text] The number of potential candidates for the Republic's presidency is growing by the day, but the most probable rivals whose names are set to be included on the ballot are three: Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, [former] speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, and Aleksandr Lukashenko, director of a state-owned farm in Mogilev Oblast, who heads the government anticorruption commission. The candidates have already engaged in a struggle that sometimes takes on risky forms, with Mr. Kebich setting the tone. On the evening of 5 April, Aleksandr Lukashenko's office at Government House was sealed. This was done on the pretext that the ad hoc anticorruption commission had completed its mission and should be dissolved. At the same time, most commission members have announced that they are quitting it. However, there has been no Supreme Soviet decision on the subject. Mr. Lukashenko himself has promised to fight to the bitter end and is intent on staying on as commission chairman regardless of who its members will be. The incident of sealing the main corruption fighter's office was immediately described by Aleksandr Lukashenko's supporters as schemes by "a corrupt government." Mr. Kebich also made a harsh attack against his other dangerous rival, Stanislav Shushkevich. Colonel Zametalin, the prime minister's press secretary, issued a statement calling the former speaker's candidacy "the most controversial and inconsistent one, prone to political flirtation." Mr. Shushkevich was accused by the press secretary of "demoralizing the Supreme Soviet by having turned it from a legislature into a debating society." As an example, he cited the fact that the parliament has been unable to pass the Constitution for two years. Only upon the arrival of a new speaker was the Fundamental Law adopted. None of the candidates has a clear edge at this stage. The current prime minister's chances may receive a strong boost, however, if the money systems of Belarus and Russia are unified. The government is doing its utmost these days to accelerate the process.
