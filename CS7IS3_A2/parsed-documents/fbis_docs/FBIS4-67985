These reports include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews, commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI, AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and most issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B. Unless otherwise indicated, no further processing of the items summarized below has been done or is planned. This editorial report reviews the 22 April issue of AL-SHA'B. Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks Dialogue A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human right violations in prisons." The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people," originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms, renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to contain the crisis." The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut has discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic Group," the report says. Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which, protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and remains unaccountable. Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the truth is that these groups are against the government, not the people; they are working to overthrow the regime. The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide society and make violence the only effective approach. Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our original values are buried inside us." He adds that the policies of the present [word illegible] are merely fulfilling the aims of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form of financial and political support. Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the people instead of the West.
