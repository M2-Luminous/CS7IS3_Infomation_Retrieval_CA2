Suphap Phutthongsi, chairman of the Confederation for Democracy in Loei province, said kamnans (tambon chiefs) and village headmen in his province were hired by provincial officials to stage a pro-Chuan rally on Wednesday in front of the city hall. The allegation was not confirmed by local officials. He said kamnans received Bt[baht]300 each, while Bt200 was paid to the headmen. Car drivers who transported villagers to the site of the protest received Bt300. Suphap said he was in no doubt that, the payments had been made, because the kamnans and headmen had given him the details personally. He said the villagers who participated in the orchestrated show of support had received nothing and some did not even know what they were supposed to do when they arrived at the protest. Some of them only went because they already had plans to go shopping and the offer of a free lift was welcomed. "Some of them told me they were about to go to their rice fields but phuyaibans [village headmen] come to pick them up and take them into town straight away. They didn't even know why they had to go," he said. Suphap said the province had spent about Bt200,000 hiring kamnans and headmen to stage the mass rally against Chalat. Buawaeng Suphrom-in, village headman of Loei's Chiangkhan district, said he was ordered by an assistant district chief to take about 10 villagers to the city. He said the chief had promised to give him a big sum of money. But after the rally was over the money had been withheld. Buawaeng said he personally agreed with Chalat's protest for fuller democracy. Rallies in Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan and Rayong continued yesterday. In Nakhon Ratchasima, more than a thousand people from Wang Nam Khieo and Kham Thaleso district gathered to show moral support for Chuan through their chief district officers. Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Sucham Phongnua said he was very worried that there could be a violent confrontation between pro-democracy supporters and pro-Chuan demonstrators. He said he has warned Chalat's supporters to stop using a loud speaker which was apparently annoying people in Muang district. He said police would take tough action against anyone who incited violence in the province. In Nakhon Phanom, about 10,000 people turned up in front of the city hall to show their support for Chuan. It was not clear whether they had been paid to participate, but Governor Sucharit Patchimnan said the supporters had turned up spontaneously on their own free will. About 4,000 people rallied in front of Rayong City Hall and presented a bouquet of flowers to Chuan through their governor. Meanwhile, about a thousand people continued their vigil outside Parliament in support of Chalat as he entered the fourth week of his fast and came to the end of his "sit-in". Chalat's daughter Chitrawadi said the Democrat Party would be to blame if her father died. Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-araya said Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut had ordered him "to take control" of the situation in front of Parliament. Ari said Chalat might not die but could be permanently disabled if he continued his fast. National Police Chief Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin Santipraphop said he was worried about traffic conditions on Uthong Nai Road near the site of Chalat's protest. A group of about 10 people who called themselves "southern villagers" yesterday afternoon laid a wreath for Democrat MPs in front of Parliament. After Chalat's departure to the Police Hospital, popular entertainer Yunyong Ophakun continued singing to maintain the morale of those who had gathered to support Chalat.
