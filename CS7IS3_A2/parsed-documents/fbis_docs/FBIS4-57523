Of the four attorney generals who have left their post, three have fallen into disgrace. They were fired for their inability to fight drug trafficking and only one of them, Jorge Carpizo McGregor, obtained positive results. This served to promote him to a higher position: government secretary. In a PGR analysis of the administrations of the four attorney generals this institution has had and is expected of the fifth appointed in this six-year administration, it is noted that Carpizo McGregor was the one who achieved the greatest control of the PGR. He controlled "up to 35 percent," the remainder (65 percent) was controlled by the large drug trafficking organizations and the territories they managed. Of the other three attorney generals, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo was considered the most negligent. He never established any type of control of the PGR. During his administration, the drug cartels appointed and removed government officials. During Ignacio Morales Lechuga's administration, up to 15 percent was under his control, although he was forced to resign when that control dropped to 5 percent. During Carpizo's administration, control of the PGR rose to 35 percent, while during Diego Valades' administration, control was lost once again as he surrounded himself with officials who had "dubious" backgrounds. The percentage of control fell to 10. Humberto Benitez Trevino, the fifth attorney general, to a certain extent has been appointed to direct blows against drug trafficking, but his main concern is the electoral problems and the crimes that may arise. First Attorney General 1 December 1988 to 21 May 1991. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former Jalisco governor, was appointed attorney general by President Carlos Salinas. He took over the post on 1 December 1988. Without any control of the PGR, Alvarez del Castillo delegated the PGR's main duties to Javier Coello Trejo, who he appointed deputy attorney general in charge of combating drug trafficking. According to the PGR analysis, Coello Trejo gave support to cartel "A" in Tamaulipas led by Juan Garcia Abrego which competed with cartel "B" in the Pacific, led by Armando Carrillo Fuentes. In addition to the above, Coello Trejo and his police officers acted with impunity. The cases of rapes and kidnappings of women in which his officers were involved damaged even further his image. From 1989 to 1990, the drug-trafficking heyday continued until the murder of Norma Corona, the president of the Human Rights Commission of Sinaloa, on 21 May 1990. Citizens' pressure forced Salinas to organize a National Commission for Human Rights (CNDH). Salinas placed Jorge Carpizo, former president of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, at the helm of the CNDH. Salinas was forced to give total support to Carpizo. This in turn resulted in the fall of Alvarez del Castillo, who had lost control of the PGR, and Coello Trejo on 21 May 1991. Second Attorney General 22 May 1991 to 4 January 1993. Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the new attorney general, appointed Jorge Carrillo Olea to replace Coello Trejo. He was not appointed as deputy attorney general, however, but as coordinator in the struggle against drug trafficking. The new coordinator's struggle against drug trafficking took off until it confronted Hector Palma, alias "El Guero," who was engaged in a struggle with capo Miguel Felix. This resulted in a shoot out and a massacre among drug traffickers in Sinaloa and Tijuana, territories controlled by these gangs. At the same time, a confrontation took place between "El Chapo" Guzman and the Arrellano Felix gang when the former entered the heroin market in addition to stealing three cocaine shipments from the Arellano Felix gang. During Morales Lechuga's administration attempts were initiated to reduce capo Garcia Abrego's influence in the PGR, given that in the previous administration under Alvarez del Castillo, Garcia Abrego designated deputy district attorneys, delegates to the states, and distributed large sums of money. Although during Morales Lechuga's administration there was an attempt to reduce the drug cartels' influence, Garcia Abrego influenced PGR decisions at the highest levels, Arellano Felix at the mid-level, and Amado Carrillo at the lower level. Third Prosecutor 5 January 1993 to 10 January 1994 When Jorge Carpizo initiated his administration at the PGR, he left Carrillo Olea at the forefront of the struggle against drugs. Nevertheless, from day one it was noted that Carpizo would not follow in the steps of Ignacio Morales. He started by taking control of his office and learning the PGR reality, which he began to control. "With Carpizo at the helm, none of the PGR officials budged, they all walked a straight line -- at least that was the appearance. At any time, a special investigation group could surprise them and if any irregularity was uncovered they lost their jobs or they ended up in jail. This instilled fear in many of the officials," remarked one of the sources consulted. Everything went well for Carpizo until 1 January 1994 when the insurrection took place in Chiapas. Beginning in January, a "witch hunt and repression" was initiated in all the nation's police institutions as a result of this armed conflict. At that time, from the Center of National Security at the Government Secretariat, Fernandez de Villar attempted to involve Carpizo in this "witch hunt and repression." The attorney general, however, cleverly pointed out that the PGR had nothing to do with the Chiapas conflict, therefore, it was not its responsibility. Fourth Attorney General 11 January 1994 to 13 May 1994 Diego Valades, who came from the Federal District Prosecutor's Office, came to the PGR with the mission and with the same line of conduct as Carpizo. Nevertheless, Valades' problem was that he sought political posts with greater responsibility such as Queretaro Governor or a seat on the Supreme Court of Justice. This took up his time as well as much of the push Carpizo gave to the PGR. The PGR began to fall by the way side. Valades appointed to his work team deputy attorney generals who were publicly questioned for being corrupt such as Rene Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera. Moreover, he made important changes in PGR representatives at several institutions; this allowed drug trafficking to blossom. In addition to this, Valades made a mistake when he attempted to present new charges against Mario Aburto, Luis Donaldo Colosio's murderer, for "false testimony." Aburto had never declared he was telling the truth before any judicial authority. Valdes also made a mistake by fighting the National Action Party team that governs Baja California, while he conducted operations and made statements that placed the PGR's legality in doubt. This attorney general felt a great deal of pressure and anger, first because a Special Prosecutor's Office was not created for the Colosio case, and second for the creation of the National Public Security Coordinator, headed by Arsenio Farell. Fifth Prosecutor 14 May 1994 to ? Humberto Benitez Trevino took over the post of attorney general on Saturday. His main challenge is not the struggle against drug trafficking, rather it will be to combat electoral crimes.
