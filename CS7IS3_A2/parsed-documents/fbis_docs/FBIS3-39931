[Schaeuble] Well, despite some pessimistic predictions, at this party congress -- just as in Berlin half a year ago -- the CDU once again proved that it is cohesive; that with Helmut Kohl it is determined to continue leading this country into a good future, to complete Germany's unification, to overcome the economic problems, to create work for all, and to guarantee external peace and internal security. And we know that we can do this best with Helmut Kohl. [Reporter] This was also Helmut Kohl's party congress. Do you think that his charisma, which has attracted the party here in Hamburg, can also be conveyed to the outside? [Schaeuble] Quite certainly, quite certainly. Helmut Kohl is the chancellor of German unification. He has been the most successful German chancellor for 12 years. It was Helmut Kohl's party congress, and the CDU wants to win the 1994 elections with Helmut Kohl so as to continue its work for Germany's future.
