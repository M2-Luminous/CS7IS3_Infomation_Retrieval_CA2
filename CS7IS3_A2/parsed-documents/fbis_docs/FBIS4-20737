Thanks to the climate of confidence established in the country since the change, and thanks to the sunshine measures adopted with respect to the handling of collected funds, the programs launched by the FNS (2626) in 1993 were very successful. This success marks the emergence of an unprecedented spirit of solidarity in Tunisia which, with this unique experiment, has found the most efficient way to enable mutual aid and solidarity to take root among citizens, and to fight poverty wherever it may be. Already, the results achieved are more than satisfactory since 27 million dinars[D] were spent in 108 different towns on behalf of 141,600 destitute individuals and to start 272 projects. The projects, launched in the country's disadvantaged, remote, and isolated regions aim to improve the living conditions of citizens, in particular the underprivileged, to promote their integration in their respective environment, and to create conditions enabling them to settle down. This is why priority is given to infrastructure projects in these still underdeveloped regions, to provide them with electricity, drinking water, paved and unpaved roads, schools and medical clinics, and eventually to create stable jobs, especially in farming. In this respect, Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez, chairman of the FNS standing commission indicated yesterday, at a press conference, that "the sustained rate at which the first 1993 installment was completed provided a good argument in favor of an ambitious 1994 program." Besides, the restricted ministers council of 17 February took note with pleasure of the satisfactory completion of the FNS 1993 programs and of the new projects adopted for 1994, to which D35 million were allocated. All Regions Affected To assess the impact of the projects started in 1993, Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez enumerated the construction of 2,830 housing units, 18 primary schools, 29 clinics, and 257 km of roads of which 120 km were paved. All of the country's remote, isolated, and poor regions were affected by these programs. And the people in these regions, which could not be provided with water or electricity under ordinary government programs, can now measure the results of this beautiful instance of national solidarity initiated by President Ben Ali. To ensure that these people remain on location, special programs designed to improve their living conditions were already launched, and financing of up to D1.6 million was provided by the Rural Development Program. The 1994 program promises to be ambitious since it will affect 151,000 individuals and 142 towns, and will involve the completion of 302 projects. This program was prepared on the basis of objective criteria adopted after consultations with regional authorities and visits on location by members of the FNS standing commission. The Northwest and West Central Regions Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez announced that the second installment of the programs launched in November 1993 will be completed by next May. He added that cost control was an essential consideration in completing these projects. There is no secret in that, considering that contractors who take on FNS-financed projects cut their profit margins to a minimum, that technical studies are performed in the regions for free, and that FNS management is so flexible that construction companies are reimbursed for their expenses without delay. As far as the regional distribution of projects and credits is concerned, we can say that the northwest and west central regions were those that benefitted most from FNS projects. Assessment by Academics To fight poverty and the lack of infrastructures, the northwest region was granted a budget of D6.7 million in 1993; this amount was increased to D9.4 million in 1994. The west central region (Kasserine, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) will be allocated about D6.2 million in 1994. Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez indicated that, following the completion of the first 1993 program instalment, the standing commission invited academics and researchers from the Tunis University Center for Economic and Social Studies and Research to give their opinion on the methods used to establish priorities and select towns and projects, and to evaluate the impact of these projects on the beneficiaries. On the whole, the evaluation of these experts was satisfactory. Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez concluded by estimating that, in spite of the considerable effort made, there is still a long way to go, which means that the national solidarity effort must be consolidated in order to fight poverty efficiently. Besides, at the restricted ministers council of 17 February, the chief of state recommended to develop a plan so that the FNS could operate in all the dark areas within the next seven years. Actually, 1,780 dark areas have been identified to date, with a total population of 1 million; these zones include 18,258 slums and 79,730 poor families. A 1992 evaluation of the credits required to reach all these areas shows that at least D714 million must be found. Today, we have somehow completed the first few steps, which are also the most difficult. But now that confidence and sunshine methods characterize the allocation of these credits in the new Tunisia, the spirit of solidarity will be expected to express itself more strongly. Its scope and significance are of crucial importance and, with the confidence that now prevails in the country, it should find more than one way to thrive.
