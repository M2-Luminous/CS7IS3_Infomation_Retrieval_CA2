He is a graduate of the State Institute of International Relations in Moscow. He spent five years in Switzerland within the framework of the Soviet-U.S. talks on limiting strategic offensive weapons (START II) and another five years at the embassy in Washington. This "flying Russian emissary" (he spent over 300 hours flying last year) was vacationing in the High Tatra these days together with his family. On this occasion, he granted an exclusive interview to our daily. [Panik] A certain reorganization is currently taking place in your ministry and cadre changes are also being prepared. What are the causes? [Churkin] Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been saying for some time -- and quite justifiably, in my opinion -- that it is necessary to devote more attention to the CIS, to our closest and immediate neighbors. The aim of the current structural reorganization of our office is, therefore, to orient our activity to the greatest possible degree toward these states. Whereas, until now, the Baltic states were the only former Soviet republics under the jurisdiction of the European Affairs Department, following the reorganization, this department will also be in charge of relations with Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. The CIS department will then only deal with multilateral relations within the framework of this Commonwealth. Four regional sections will be established within the European Affairs Department. [Panik] According to the new Constitution, foreign policy is the president's prerogative. Nonetheless, the question comes to mind what influence the new parliament will exert on it? [Churkin] We would like to hope that our relations will be distinguished by a spirit of cooperation. Even regarding the old parliament, our ministry devoted considerable efforts to the search for constructive interaction with deputies. We were not too successful, however. [Panik] Mr. Zhirinovskiy has been active on the official Russian political scene for only a few weeks, yet his statements have already alarmed many states, particularly Russia's neighbors. On the other hand, they also cause unnecessary problems to your office, which will repeatedly be forced to react to his words. How do you intend to approach this problem? [Churkin] It seems that, after the elections of 12 December, foreign countries, in particular, have been struck by some kind of a shock, which finds its expression in the attribution of great significance to Zhirinovskiy's statements. One circumstance tends to be forgotten in all this -- that Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president. Even if we take a realistic look at the composition of the new parliament, we see that his party does not even have a majority there. Russia's Choice will, after all, be the strongest parliamentary group. [Panik] Yet Zhirinovskiy's electoral success is impossible to ignore. [Churkin] Certainly not. It is a fairly serious signal, one that should be taken into consideration by both Russian democrats and by foreign countries, that highly complex processes are taking place in Russia, that the continuing struggle for democracy is taking place under extremely complicated conditions. At the same time, however, I do not think that it is necessary to react from all sides and with an outcry to every statement Zhirinovskiy makes. For example, he spoke about some weapons. So what? What can he actually do? He is a man with a very peculiar and well-known manner of conduct. He is not averse to sensationalist statements; his main concern is to build up his popularity. If each of his statements triggers a minor storm the world over, it will only play into his cards, in my opinion. Therefore, I would suggest that the reactions be calm and prudent because, as I have already said, Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president and is not even a Russian politician who could influence certain decisions. Of course, should he raise some questions in parliament within the framework of constitutional procedures, we will respond to them. But we definitely do not intend to build our policy on some of his exotic statements. [Panik] But try to imagine yourself in the position of other states. In Bulgaria, for example, he called for the removal of President Zhelev.... [Churkin] This is exactly one of those cases where any commentary is unnecessary. This man simply does not hesitate to resort to such scandalous statements for the sake of popularity. How can you elbow your way to the front pages of newspapers in the East European countries, for example? In his opinion, it is simple: You just have to go there and call for the removal of the president. I repeat, if we were to oversensitively react to each of his statements and call a meeting of the General Assembly or the UN Security Council every time, we would look absurd -- if we get trapped by this quite simple political trick. [Panik] Sometimes it seems as if Zhirinovskiy were specially "made to order" of certain, possibly quite specific, aims of Russian foreign policy, so that these can be covered by his strong, and in [the Russian] society rather popular, ideas. This is particularly alarming when we consider a phenomenon such as the growth of Russian nationalism. Is Moscow, planning to change in any way its policy regarding the protection of the rights of Russians in the so-called adjacent foreign countries [reference to former Soviet republics]? [Churkin] No. [Panik] Not even modify? [Churkin] No. Another matter is that the December elections -- and also the way in which Zhirinovskiy exploited the thesis about the position of Russians abroad -- demonstrated that this problem really exists. Therefore, when we raised this issue on the premises of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, or the United Nations, it was no propaganda on our part, as some of our partners in the Baltic countries have been trying to interpret this, but the pinpointing of actually existing sore spots that must be dealt with. The elections clearly showed this. This is one of those issues, from which, as I hope, correct conclusions will be drawn. [Panik] This entire complex of questions is associated with the highly topical all-European subject of ethnic minority rights. Which view does Moscow endorse: Should uniform and universal standards of these rights be drafted within the framework of the entire European continent or should the so-called regional principle be applied? [Churkin] This is a very delicate issue. Our main principle, which we are trying to observe, is not to cause any damage. When ethnic minorities are concerned, a small problem can easily grow into a big one. As a matter of principle, we are of the opinion that the idea of drafting a charter of ethnic minority rights is not bad and must be assessed. However, we are opposed to proceeding in these matters on the basis of the bulldozer principle, as it were. [Panik] What does that mean? [Churkin] I am thinking of the formulation of some rigid principles and the effort to force them upon everyone. It is generally true, and the example of Yugoslavia showed this quite drastically, that any coercion is a very dangerous thing with regarding the issue of ethnic minority rights. Apart from the aforementioned principle, we are guided by yet another one: In every specific instance, Russia's demands concerning the rights of Russian minorities in the countries in question must not exceed their demands -- that is, the demands of these countries. [Panik] What did you have in mind when you said that it is necessary to assess the idea of drafting a charter of minority rights? [Churkin] Apparently, it will be necessary to formulate a set of certain universal rights. The question is how far-reaching and all-encompassing these universal rights should be. Would it be appropriate, for example, to treat as absolute the principle of federalization? I do not think so. In some instances, the creation of a federation can be the only way out of the situation, but in other instances this requirement can complicate the problem where it may not even exist, and where it could be resolved, for example, by the installation of road signs or street names in the language of the minority, as a supplement to signs in the state language. Hence, minority rights cannot be made fully universal. And there is yet another thing. I have the feeling that far from everything is stable in Europe in this regard and that not everyone understands that some demands that are being raised could be applied also against those who raise them, if one were to be consistent. Regarding Yugoslavia, for example, some countries are putting forward demands, which I am not at all sure they would be able to apply at home, once the Yugoslav conflict is settled. Therein lies a danger. Because when we resolve some problem at one place and lay down some criteria, an explosive mixture will come about when we try to apply the same criteria to other states. I assume that Europe is not interested in this. I repeat, certain general, universal principles of minority rights are necessary but, at the same time, exceptional sensitivity is needed when tackling problems with regard to each specific situation. [Panik] How would Moscow react if the real threat emerged in the south of Slovakia of the creation of territorial autonomy based on the ethnic principle? [Churkin] I would not like to comment on such specific issues. As a matter of principle, however, I am of the opinion that the fewer surgical incisions every specific decision will entail, the better. In other words, the smaller the number of changes and adaptations that are necessary for people to feel as citizens with full rights, the better. It is necessary to proceed according to the principle of minimization [princip minimalnosti]. For example, it is superb when it is enough to install [bilingual] signs and inscriptions and people will say that precisely that is what they found lacking. If more needs to be done to satisfy people -- for example, open more schools -- even that is fine. Overall, however, many things need to be taken into consideration. There are politicians, for example, who deliberately stir up people's emotions to be able to score additional points with the help of these emotions in order to obtain some political post. A Georgian politician once spoke with one of our diplomats about the position of the Russian minority in Georgia. He said that Russians have no problems there, live the same lives as Georgians, and have absolutely equal rights. He also said, however, that if all of a sudden some extremist politician from among Russians in Georgia started asking for autonomy, a problem would immediately emerge, as well as another conflict. We must beware of this everywhere. [Panik] Under what circumstances would Moscow not have any objections to the Visegrad Four countries joining NATO? [Churkin] We all will enter together.... [Panik] Who "all"? The entire Europe? [Churkin] No, why? The Visegrad group along with Russia. All together. Why not, as a matter of fact? Why? [Panik] Is that your answer? [Churkin] No, it is my spontaneous reaction, so to say. [Panik] And your answer? [Churkin] The problem is not in whether Moscow has or does not have objections. We have not objected to anything. But when this issue arose, we only came up with what I would rather call a plea: not to deal with this issue rashly, on a wave of emotions. This is because a whole number of issues is at stake that, in our firm conviction, have not been thought through yet -- by anyone. Not by you, not by the North Atlantic Alliance, and not by us. Incidentally, I am absolutely sure that, even if he had not said a single world and had sat silently like a fish, neither the Visegrad Four nor anyone else would have been admitted into NATO now. Simply because the North Atlantic Alliance itself is not ready for that. It is not ready because of what I have mentioned: that not all the consequences of such a step have been calculated. [Panik] What, in particular, do you have in mind? [Churkin] In my opinion, it is necessary to keep several factors in mind. In present-day Europe it is impossible to gain additional security while at the same time harming the security of other states. So there has to be equal security. Second, how would the admission of, let us say, only some East European countries into NATO be accepted by the other states of the region (and I am not thinking of Russia right now)? For example, in the past few months, when this dispute was going on, I quite clearly felt a certain tension arising among the East European countries themselves. Because some of them were interested not so much in their own NATO membership but, rather, they feared that someone might be admitted without them being admitted. This is a negative factor, and then will the East European countries' entry into NATO at this time resolve the actually existing problems in this region? Or is it something that is rather more symbolic and that does not resolve these real problems and may even create additional ones? How will this be reflected in the very foundations of European security? One of its pillars and, in my opinion one of the most important ones is the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. If four former Warsaw Pact member countries were now admitted into NATO, how would that be reflected in the treaty? I do not know.... [Panik] What do your experts say about that? [Churkin] They also raise this question and draw attention to the fact that the treaty had been worked out in blocks, that is, it was based on the number of weapons of 16 NATO states and seven Warsaw Pact states deployed on the European continent. Certain ceilings were set. Then the Warsaw Pact broke up. Still, we are observing the treaty. Even the Soviet Union has broken up but, still, we are observing the treaty. But what if there will not be 16 states on one side, but 20 states? What are we going to do with that treaty then? This is an unclear and unanswered question. Or take another matter: I have had a number of conversations with representatives of East European states and, to be candid, I do not have the feeling that from the purely financial viewpoint they have a clear idea of what NATO membership would cost them. After all, this is not such a simple matter. NATO is, of course, a solid organization; the people there are solid. I do not see in them any evil spirits who are conspiring against someone. That is not the point. We ourselves are prepared and want to cooperate with them. But they are no philanthropists either; they are not going to engage in any charitable activities. Entry into NATO is, therefore, a serious matter, which would surely require considerable material contributions and expenditures. Therefore, having pondered the issue and racked our brains, and, understandably, keeping in mind the interests of Russia and our already complicated internal political situation, we said: It will be better to ponder the problems of European security for another while. In this context, it seems to us that the idea of "Partnership for Peace" is a good one. [Panik] Evil tongues claim that it is more your idea than Washington's idea.... [Churkin] No. I think that it is the product of a dialogue, including our dialogue with the Americans. But in this case it would be immodest and incorrect if we tried to arrogate the authorship of this idea.
