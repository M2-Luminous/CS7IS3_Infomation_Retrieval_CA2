[Blix] Well, I came here to discuss first of all the arrangements of verification under a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. And of course, Iran was one of the first countries in the world to endorse this idea and I think we have created more understanding for the techniques and the system of verification that the agency offers now and the kind of enhanced verification system that would be needed under a zone. So I think we have accomplished what we hope to do, to spread better knowledge. [Correspondent] A few countries, and Israel in particular, have not yet signed the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Does not this refusal to sign the treaty threaten the international and regional peace and stability? [Blix] Well, I think the ambition should be that all countries which do not have nuclear weapons should join a nonproliferation treaty, either the NPT or the Tlatelolco Treaty for Latin America. We have seen a great deal of progress in the past few years. Argentina and Brazil have joined, South Africa has joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, Algeria has declared that it will join. [Correspondent] And finally, could you tell us about the IAEA's efforts to make a nuclear-free world, sir? [Blix] Well, it would be a little presumptuous to say that we are sort of instrumental in creating a nuclear-weapon-free world, but what I can say is that I think there is reason for a great deal of optimism at the present time after the end of the Cold War. We have seen how the United States and Russia have now agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals from some 65,000 warheads to 3,000 each. We can expect that there will be a treaty which will prohibit the production of nuclear material for weapons purposes and which very likely will lead to all the nuclear weapon states and India, Pakistan, and Israel submitting all their nuclear installations to agency verification. We can expect, perhaps within one year, a complete test ban agreement so that new nuclear weapons cannot be even tested underground. So there is, and added to that then, the possibility of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I think that we are taking giant steps towards a world, not free from nuclear weapons, but at least much freer from it than it is now. And for a world really free of nuclear weapons I think we must also foresee a much stronger United Nations and a much stronger security organization and that will not come about in one year or perhaps even 10 years, but will take a longer time. But there is ground for a lot of optimism at the present time and of course for us in the IAEA, although we are not the negotiating parties, the verification of all these agreements will be a very important factor. And I think we have acquired a lot of experience in the many years of this and we stand ready to take on these jobs. [Correspondent] Thanks Dr. Blix for joining the IRIB English news.
