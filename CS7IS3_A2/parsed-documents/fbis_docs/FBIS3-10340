He has said a devaluation was being announced. I believe Jose Andino did not realize the president said exactly the opposite. When asked about this, the president said it was necessary to strengthen our currency by increasing our production. He talked about increasing exports and improving the production of basic grains. This has a dual purpose: to guarantee our food supply and to reduce basic grain imports; this obviously strengthens our currency. Because this is such a sensitive issue, I felt compelled to clarify the issue; in addition, the issue of devaluation has been recently mentioned, and I think it is the result of confusion or misinterpretation, particularly among the media. In fact, I understand what has actually been mentioned, as a possibility, is the official implementation of an exchange rate that already exists in the market. In any case, if this is done, if it ever occurs, it will be the result of a decision adopted by Congress, the body that should decide this issue. Consequently....[pauses] I worry when the media handle carelessly these topics, which are so sensitive to our economy. This could give others wrong ideas, something that would be detrimental to us. A devaluation in this case is a very serious thing, and the president was quite emphatic and clear about that; on the contrary, he said the currency should be strengthened, and we should bear this in mind.
