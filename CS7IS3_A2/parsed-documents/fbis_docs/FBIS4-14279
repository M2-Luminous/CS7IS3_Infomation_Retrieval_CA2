Shohat told Voice of Jerusalem radio that the agreement was good, protected Israel's economic interests, and also permitted the development of a Palestinian economy. Shohat noted that Israel had rejected the Palestinians' demand for their own currency; however, the economic committee accompanying the negotiations would continue to discuss the issue until a decision acceptable to both sides was reached. Finance Minister Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head of the PLO's economic department, will sign the agreement regulating economic relations between the Palestinian autonomous areas and Israel at a festive ceremony in Paris this morning. In the event of discrepancies between the Paris agreement and the agreement that will be signed next week in Cairo, the latter agreement will be considered binding by both parties.
