When the State Council recently promulgated the "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties," people might not have anticipated that in the next decade, a comprehensive rural economic system integrated with agriculture, trade, industry, communications, construction, and service trades will gradually take shape to facilitate an all-around development of the rural economy; that the strains on infrastructure and basic industries will be greatly alleviated to help the national economy develop at a more solid and substantive pace; that along with the rapid rise of a number of pillar industries, many people will move into new living quarters and drive privately owned vehicles, telephones and family computers will no longer be in exclusive use by a small number of people, and foreign trade mix and conditions will be improved markedly and China will play a bigger role in the global economic and trade arena; that thriving high- and new-tech industries will bring about a noticeable improvement in the organizational structure and pattern of industries; and that there will be a big leap in the level of industrial technology. All of these will become materialized under the guidance of industrial policy, the target that the macroeconomic regulation and control is aimed at. China has launched an important program of applying industrial policy to guide the national economy to embark on the optimal course while bringing into full play the role of markets. I. To use simple language, industrial policy is aimed mainly at readjusting industrial structure. In any country, industrial structure always takes shape in a given stage of economic development. Take, for example, China's pace-setting industries: In the 1960s and 1970s, light industrial products consisting of dozens of components, such as bicycles, watches, and sewing machines, became the dominant groups of consumer goods. In the 1980s, machinery and electrical products consisting of several hundred components, such as color television sets, refrigerators, and video cassettes, were the vogues of the times. Since the beginning of the 1990s, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his talks during his southern tour, the Chinese economy has developed rapidly. What Chinese people on the street feel right now is that the traditional consumer goods are saturated and urgently need to be replaced by groups of higher quality capital- and technology-intensive consumer goods; and that electronic products, automobiles, residential houses, and other new products will become leading consumer goods. With the scale of the Chinese economy being multiplied several hundredfold as compared with the beginning of the PRC, the previous simple management system of a planned economy has become outdated, while the establishment of a socialist market economic structure is not yet complete. As a result, aimless development, redundant construction, and low efficiency have occurred from time to time. On the one hand, much new capital continues to be invested in traditional industries whose products have already saturated the markets; on the other, new industries which have not reached the threshold of large-scale production cannot turn out highly competitive products. Take the automobile industry, for example. China has over 120 automobile plants, more than the total number of plants in the world; however, its total output is less than that of a single model manufactured by a foreign automobile company. If such a situation characterized by laxness, chaos, and poor quality remains for a long time to come, taking part in international competition can only be an empty slogan. Under the circumstances of developing a socialist market economy, the government policymakers and economists are anxiously trying to seek a new, effective control and regulatory means. They are attracted by the experiences of other countries: A few newly developed nations, with foresight in the process of developing a market-oriented economy, have their central government draw up an industrial policy to standardize and encourage industries which can serve as the foundations and pacesetters for the national economy, thereby creating a healthy situation characterized by both competition and a clear-cut direction of development and making optimal and rational allocation of resources. For example, Japan and Korea have successively developed their automobile and electronics industries from weak foundations. However, both countries relied on the assistance and interference prescribed in the state industrial policy to concentrate national resources and prioritize the development of their industries. Through assiduous efforts, the Japanese and Korean automobile and electronics industries have come to dominate international markets while bringing along the rapid growth of the national economy and creating world-acclaimed economic miracles. II. Some people once suggested that since China wanted to introduce a market economy, it was not necessary to formulate an industrial policy as everything would be regulated by market mechanisms. However, more experts held that simple market regulation would inevitably lead to loss of resources and opportunities, which were precisely the things China should treasure. Besides, simple market regulation could not guarantee the long-term development of agriculture and infrastructure. Needless to say, the Asian countries with the same oriental cultural background as China's had their central government draw up a guiding industrial policy. Even the United States, which is known for its free market economy, drew up an industrial policy for developing space aviation and other high-technology several decades ahead of time. These two views finally converged on one point, that is, industrial policy and market mechanisms are complementary to each other. On the one hand, industrial policy aims to apply economic means to guide the direction of industrial development, to change relations between different relations so as to remedy defects and shortcomings of market mechanisms, to coordinate and accumulate necessary capital within a short period of time for carrying out some major projects having a bearing on the overall situation, and to promote the optimal allocation of resources. On the other hand, maintaining the normal operation of market mechanisms and promoting fair, equal, and open competition constitute the important functions of industrial policy. China first tried to formulate its industrial policy in the late 1980s. In March 1989, the State Council, in the light of needs at that time, promulgated the "Decision Concerning the Main Points of the Current Industrial Policy." The "decision" outlined specific names of projects which the government would support or restrict in the four areas of production, capital construction, technical transformation, and foreign trade; as well as a guarantee system. Strictly speaking, it was a policy aimed at achieving short-term targets at that time, but it still attracted extensive attention from many international organizations and economic sectors abroad. Since the early 1990s, the center of global economic development has shifted to the Asian-Pacific region. Along with China's further opening up and absorption of huge foreign capital, the country has become a new economic growth point of the Asian-Pacific region. Moreover, in the transition from a planned to a market economy, the central government has been required to conform with international economic trends in both macro and micro economic operational mechanisms to provide farsighted guidance for changes in industrial structure and to accelerate the pace of China's modernization toward the 21st century. Thus, the formulation of an industrial policy for long-term allocation of resources was placed on the State Council's agenda. In line with the State Council's decision, the State Planning Commission took the lead in studying and coordinating the formulation of an industrial policy. As the commission has been changing its functions from drawing up annual plans and allocating financial and material resources to drawing up medium and long-term plans, the study and formulation of industrial policy in the 1990s has become a major task of the commission. Since 1992, the State Planning Commission, in a bid to pool collective wisdom, invited economists and representatives from departments, localities, and enterprises to various forums; and convened a national industrial policy work conference. The State Council's leaders personally participated in discussions and listened to opinions at the conference. Using as reference foreign countries' successful experiences in formulating and implementing industrial policy and in the light of the actual conditions in China, the basic principles for the state industrial policy in the 1990s have been drawn up: 1) They conform with the objective law governing the process of industrialization and modernization; 2) they conform with the demand for establishing a socialist market economic structure; 3) they underscore the key areas and focus on solving major issues having a vital bearing on the overall situation of the national economy; and 4) they are feasible and can guarantee the implementation of industrial policy through economic, legal, and necessary administrative means. In the process of formulating industrial policy, experts conducted a host of research on verification of proof, data analyses, and prediction of trends. After revisions to 14 drafts, the current "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties" took shape. After discussion and approval by the State Council's 16th executive meeting, it was promulgated for implementation. III. The promulgated "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties" contains a group of documents, mainly consisting of two parts: 1) A framework of programmatic documents of a guidance nature, which involve only agriculture, basic industries, infrastructural facilities, and pillar industries, and which allow enterprises and the market to play their optimum role in the development of a number of key industries such as foreign trade; 2) a series of practical special industrial policies drawn up on the basis of the "outline." For example, the "Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry" and other special industrial policies on transportation, communications, construction, electronics, machine-building, petrochemical industries, and foreign trade, which will be drawn up successively. The entrepreneurs of several automobile groups from all parts of the country said: The "Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry" has enabled China's automobile industry to have a direction and basis for healthy development since its establishment over four decades ago. The annual production of whole sedan manufacturing plants shall not be below 150,000 units; encouragement of the policy of investment and financing through various channels; encouragement of the policy that individuals should buy automobiles; discouragement of the policy of depending on the state to buy automobiles; encouragement of the consumption policy of using small automobiles; overall planning for related industries; and other safety policies on roads, car parking facilities, and inclusion of teaching of traffic knowledge in elementary schools, which are stipulated in the industrial policy, will have a decisive impact on the reorganization and rapid development of China's automobile industry. Whether the state industrial policy drawn up by the central government in consideration of overall and long-term interests can be successfully turned into a giant motive force for the development of the economy in the nineties depends on a secure implementation system. According to the arrangements of the state, the implementation of the industrial policy will depend mainly on the departments in charge of various trades; however, it will be implemented under the overall coordination of the State Planning Commission. Meanwhile, the establishment of a secure system for the implementation of the industrial policy and a supervision, checking, and evaluation system should be speedily completed. Economic administrative departments dealing with planning, finance, banking, taxation, customs, foreign trade, securities, industrial and commercial administration, and management of state-owned assets will coordinate with one another to form a force to push forward the smoother implementation of the state industrial policy. According to a disclosure by an authoritative source, in the future when the state is drawing up economic policies, it will give preferential treatment to industries just as it gave such treatment to regions in the past. Morever, the state will render necessary support to important industrial projects being built in central and western China. The scientific guidance provided by the industrial policy will play a sacred role in stimulating the development of China's economy.
