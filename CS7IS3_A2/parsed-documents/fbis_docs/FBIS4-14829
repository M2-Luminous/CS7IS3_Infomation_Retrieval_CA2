Bobelis at yesterday's press conference in the Seimas [parliament], speaking about the work of its Foreign Affairs Committee. He regretted the failure to execute the Seimas resolution, adopted back in December, authorizing the Foreign Ministry to prepare a foreign policy concept and cooperate with the Foreign Affairs Committee in the closest possible manner. There is also a lack of cooperation with the president's "foreign policy design" office which provides no information at all. K. Bobelis said that "members of the committee do not approve of the isolationist policy conducted by J. Paleckis [presidential foreign policy adviser]. The information deficit evokes unnecessary differences of opinion in the committee. K. Bobelis said that the committee was currently considering a number of international agreements that would be submitted to the Seimas for ratification. The free trade agreement with the European Union that is being prepared by four ministries is of particular importance. The Foreign Affairs Committee has not yet seen the draft of this document. According to K. Bobelis, the committee approves of President A. Brazauskas' initiative to set up a Baltic Council of Ministers for cooperation between the Baltics and the Scandinavian countries according to the formula 3 + 5. At the same time, the speaker expressed his regret that even though both the Swedes and the Danes with whom he has talked welcome this idea, they believe that Lithuania is still to immature to undertake such an endeavor. "Everyone looks at us as an inferior and underdeveloped state. I do not know why," admitted K. Bobelis. The committee chairman reported that Lithuania would shortly open its embassies in China, Japan, and Egypt, and later in Canada. Discussions are continuing on whether an embassy or a consulate should be opened in Turkey. The committee believes that consulates in Kaliningrad and Seinai [Polish border town] must be set up immediately. Asked whether he had a chance to read the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, K. Bobelis replied that he saw the latest version before taking it to Warsaw. "This document is beneficial for Lithuania and it does not inflict any harm." However, the committee chairman does not approve of the Foreign Ministry's position not to show the treaty. [passage omitted] Summing up the work of Lithuanian politicians at international organizations, K. Bobelis said that they should participate both in the EC and UN structures more actively. Moreover, it is necessary to preserve the continuity of political activities, in other words, to create possibilities for members of the delegations to work a longer period of time rather than just one year. In K. Bobelis' opinion, as long as the current situation continues, casual participations in international events will be nothing but trips and a waste of money.
