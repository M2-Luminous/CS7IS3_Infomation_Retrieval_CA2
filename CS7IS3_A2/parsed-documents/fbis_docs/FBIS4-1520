Statistics show that foreign investment in the real estate sector amounted to 233 million U.S. dollars in contractual volume in the first two months of the year. Overseas investment concentrated on such fields as renovation or removal of dilapidated housing and building of hotels, villas, entertainment facilities and commercial buildings. Experts here observed that the real estate investment trend started last year. They say that cheaper land prices than in Beijing and Shanghai, a lack of high-level hotels and a convenient transportation system are contributing to this investment fever. According to officials, a large number of old houses within the city proper are still waiting to be razed to make way for construction of a five-star Shangri-La Hotel. A heavy industrial center in northern China, Tianjin is about two hours from Beijing. It is also an important seaport in northern China. The city's population totals over nine million.
