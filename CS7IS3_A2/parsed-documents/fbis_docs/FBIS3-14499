Based on information from commandos who returned from the operation, the communique confirms that the operation against the enemy forces targeted 15 Zionist paratroopers and infantrymen from the Engineering Corps. The communique says: When the enemy patrol arrived at the controlled area, our comrades detonated two explosive devices that resulted in the wounding of all of the patrol's personnel. Afterwards, our comrades ambushed the enemy patrol and showered them with bullets, grenades, and rockets. They took full control of the situation in which the enemy soldiers could not fire a single bullet. Afterwards, fatal bullets were fired at the enemy soldiers who ran away, trampling over their comrades' heads. More than 30 minutes later, the Zionist enemy sent out military rescue teams to the scene of the battle in order to remove the bodies of their soldiers. The enemy also sent out its tanks and infantry rescue teams to surround and chase our comrades. However, a number of antitank and antipersonnel mines blew up in the faces of the enemy forces, which further increased the enemy's losses. The enemy admitted that two noncommissioned officers [NCO's] were killed and that three of its soldiers were wounded. As it always does, the enemy tries to hide the number of its losses for well-known political and moral reasons. Then it attributes the killing of their soldiers to road accidents and other reasons. The communique continues to say: Hours after the al-'Ayshiyah operation, the enemy radio announced that a truck turned over, killing two soldiers and injuring three others. It later announced that three of its soldiers were injured when a missile exploded by mistake in the same area as the operation. Hours before that, it was announced that an NCO died of his wounds. We, in the PFLP-GC, stress that the enemy's losses exceed 15 soldiers and tanks--which like to kill women and children, to perpetrate massacres against our defenseless civilians inside Palestine, and to barbarically shell southern Lebanon and the camps inside it. Through the operations carried out in the past few days, it has been proven that the occupation army is unable to face the mujahidin on the battlefield and that it quickly collapses amid the crying and screaming of its soldiers. On this brave operation carried out by our heroic comrades in broad daylight, and in view of the sacrifices of our people inside occupied territories and the strikes by the national and Islamic resistances, we, in the PFLP-GC, reaffirm that the option of confrontation and jihad for the sake of liberation and of ousting the Zionist invaders is our one only option. We also reaffirm that the treasonous and capitulatory agreements in Oslo and Cairo will vanish. Moreover, this will also be the fate of the one who signed these agreements as this is the fate of all the treasonous ones in the history of the struggling nations. The massacres being perpetrated against our people inside the occupied territories will only add to our strength, solidity, and determination to continue the jihad until the liberation of land and man.
