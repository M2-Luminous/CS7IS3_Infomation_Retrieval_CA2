There have been very auspicious indications, and the government is committed to honoring its campaign promises. We find this very auspicious, because it is something the whole world is witnessing as a reaffirmation of the social role of the administration over which I am honored to preside. If you have any questions, I am more than willing to answer. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] in the short run, how can we end such a situation in our country? [Reina] I reiterate, we are undertaking enormous efforts, not only through international organizations but also through the National Social Welfare Board, as well as through other agencies involved in issues of child care. Numerous nongovernment organizations, the prestigious NGO's, are encouraged to cooperate in this endeavor. The number of children involved is quite significant, but I hope that by the end of my administration, we will have been able to demonstrate the social progress accomplished in this issue. [Reporter] Guillermo Molina Chocano, Secplan [Secretariat of Planning, Coordination, and Budget] minister, said a few minutes ago that the letter of intent will be signed shortly and that the elimination of subsidies to the transportation system is practically inevitable; likewise, he mentioned the situation of the groups involved in the distribution of crude oil. In this case, he was referring to fuel rationing. [Reina] I would like all of you to be aware of the enormous problems we are confronting. It is up to me to confront poverty, corruption, and the crisis, in addition to tremendous misunderstandings such as certain statements I heard this morning. If one does not have support from the media and the people, everything becomes more difficult. I am not about to waver in this struggle, but I need allies, and I hope I can rely on all good-hearted Hondurans. The letter of intent will be signed, and the details will be disclosed in due time. If we break with the international organizations, we would be greatly harming Honduras. You have just mentioned a classic example. If we allow distributors to fix fuel prices, prices will increase almost every day. If we stop them here and now, they will deprive the market of fuel. What do we do then? We would have no fuel, and we would continue to receive criticism from both sides. What has to be done is what is more convenient to the country, and that is exactly what we are doing; we are doing this with the individuals we believe are the most capable. On several occasions I have said I have chosen the most capable Hondurans as my advisers; after all, the art of governing is also knowing when to surround oneself with competent advisers. [Reporter] But, Mr. President, when are we going to witness those concrete decisions? The country is going through a tremendous chaos. We have an energy crisis and a crude oil crisis; in addition, the price of the family basket is constantly rising. When is your administration going to take concrete decisions? During your last presidential address you announced you would earmark 100 million lempiras for BANASUPRO [National Supply Agency for Basic Products], which has not yet come through. Then we have the issue of the closed fishing season, and the forests, and [words indistinct]. [Reina] The first concrete answer is the moral revolution. Every government official is under supervision. Is this or is this not the main answer? All government officials are under investigation. Why was this not done before? Because conditions were not given. What the people want to know are the measures; nonetheless, I can give you a very precise answer. We are going to create a consensus for these measures to be accepted by all. If we do it before the consensus is ensured, the undermined parties will turn on us. To govern is a very serious and difficult affair. [Reporter] But decisions must be taken in light of the numerous conflict of interests.... [Reina, interrupting] Honduras has progressed more during the first 100 days of my administration than during anytime in its history. I think this is what must be emphasized, not negative things. You are right, I have a program with specific measures, and I am examining it to gain the support of all the sectors. This week I will hold some meetings. This past weekend I also held meetings to present the specific measures. You shall see that the affected persons will react. You have seen the reactions we get every time we have said that the National Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE] will raise the fees of clients who spend more than 300 kilowatts! The same is true for oil distributors. The people think that it is just a matter of making decisions. First one must have the moral authority and be a legitimate government. When you say this is chaos, do you really believe this is chaos? [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Reina] This is a difficult crisis, but this government is legitimate and prestigious. Do you think Vice President Gore's visit to Honduras just happened? Do you think it is just a coincidence that the president of Honduras will be one of the important figures to attend the Cartagena de Indias Summit and the Miami summit? This is not chaos! This is a crisis, a crisis we inherited. This country has been looted on many occasions. My task is to rehabilitate the country and to turn it over in much better condition. We do not have to use terms that create much alarm; we must use appropriate terminology. When are we going to have specific measures? We are discussing them with the country's various sectors to gain general acceptance. Following the moral revolution, I proposed a convergence. We are planning to produce that convergence in four months. I am sure that the important sectors will accept it and support it. [Reporter] Some business sectors are already visibly desperate. [Honduran Chamber of Commerce President] Eduardo Facusse said in El Salvador, where he recently participated in a meeting of presidents of chambers of commerce, that the Honduran Government not only does not get started, it is also undecided. I interpreted this reference to a crisis as a reference to your leadership of the country. How do you respond to this? [Reina] It is absurd to put in doubt the people's mandate. No one is above the people, and the people gave me a mandate. Any questioning of this mandate means betraying the people. It is like saying: I am above that mandate. What happens is that some people use inappropriate terms, and this is what makes the news. The deputies issued a letter containing three inappropriate words, and those words were the news. Mr. Facusse has spoken in favor of the government on many occasions, but he makes the news the moment he utters this statement, which in my opinion was unwise, about the country not having a guide, about hesitation. How does he know this? He represents some interests, and the interests of that sector do not represent the interests of the entire country. He would like for me to have accepted the 10 percent-on-sales proposal from the very beginning. I am not going to do it. [Reporter] Are you upset over of what he said? [Reina] No, no, no. I do not want to get involved in any argument with individuals who are my friends. I am simply explaining in general terms how inadequate it is to use certain terms. Today a man who I believe is in Congress, said things in favor of seizing the government, as if this would resolve everything. This is simple-minded, a vulgarity. I am not going to continue using terms to describe this person. [Reporter] Who are you talking about, Mr. President? [Reina] About any person who uses terms that go against a legitimate government, against a president who deserves the respect of the Honduran people, a president who has national and international moral authority. When anyone makes a caustic remark against him, this is news, this is the source of commentaries and of questions. I think this shows a lack of maturity. [Reporter] Mr. President, you spoke about the country having been plundered. The people want to know who did the plundering, now that you have used this term. They want to see the looters in prison. Another question: The teachers want a 100-percent salary increase. This could become a trend and other labor unions could make similar demands. [Reina] Three things: The people know the names of the persons who have plundered this country. Right now there are legal structures for announcing those names soon. I assure you that soon a dozen names will be made known to you. Documents are being investigated. There is no reason to rush things and become impatient. About teachers wanting a 100-percent salary increase, I think they could be somewhat correct in doing so. The problem is: From where are we going to get 800 million lempiras to give them this increase? The matter is being negotiated sensibly, quietly, and very capably. The negotiators are seeking equity to give teachers a reasonable increase within the government's possibilities. Regarding the last part of your question, we are about to announce a salary increase that I think is fair, and not only the minimum salary will be increased. This is part of the national consensus. Everything is on the path toward improving this country. Everything is on the path that indicates the respect Honduras has acquired in the international community will be advantageous to our people. I will never fail my people. [Reporter] Good morning. As for the current energy crisis, it is said your government has been negligent to a certain extent, especially in light of the Canadian atomic plant and the Chinese plant. [Reina] There are two separate issues here: Canada and the atomic plant. Do you know what it would mean to build a nuclear plant in Honduras? Those who have criticized me have no idea of what they are saying. What would we do with the toxic waste? Would we send it to the poor people of Honduras, as was the case when industrialized nations wanted to send us toxic waste? They wanted to send us toxic waste to finish poisoning us. Where are the technicians to build this atomic plant? My name always appears in the newspapers linked to all kinds of ridiculous things. [Reporter] What about the Chinese plant? [Reina] As for the Chinese plant, bringing one from China would cost a fortune and would take too long. [Reporter] And Mexico? [Reina] A plant is already coming from Mexico, and I have already thanked the Mexican president. Two plants are coming. We are wisely and carefully facing these problems. The impatience... [pauses] these hesitations are not hesitations. I have no doubts whatsoever that I am doing the right thing. Should I have any doubts, I would hesitate. [Reporter] Is it possible to negotiate with China to have China finance the shipment of the plant, because the Chinese are willing to donate it to us? [Reina] I believe it is negotiable. However, our country must find its own solutions. There are many countries that are willing to assist us, and capable people are reviewing this assistance. I am about to review the membership of certain commissions to guarantee their efficiency. [Reporter] [words indistinct] was already covered? [Reina] This is a question that I [words indistinct] part of the measures we are going to take. We cannot continue to appraise the value of the dollar. We can no longer accept high levels of inflation, which must be controlled, because this is the worst tax levied on the poor people of Honduras. These are the measures I will announce at an important news conference I will hold in the near future. [Reporter] How soon? [Reina] Be patient. [Reporter] That is very kind of you, Mr. President. [Reina] [words indistinct] [Moderator] This concludes President Reina's news conference. [Reporter] Could you ask President Reina what he thinks about the statements by Byron Suazo, La Paz Department Liberal deputy, who has charged Jorge Arturo Reina is doing nothing for this government? Suazo maintains that Jorge Reina only goes to the National Congress to collect his paycheck, and he also questions the moral revolution, which he has called the mortal revolution. Suazo says only friends and relatives of the Reina family are reaping benefits. He also has claimed that the country is on its way to anarchy, because the current administration is only helping its friends and relatives. [Reina] I give you my word that these charges are false, but I do enjoy Suazo's comments. [Reporter] The media today reported that your environment minister has personally benefited by placing the Environment Ministry in a building he owns. [Reina] This happened in the previous administration. He requested my permission to remain there -- in a building that meets all requirements. I gave him my permission. [Reporter] How do you view Suazo's remarks on the moral revolution? [Reina] He belongs to another party. There can be no complicity, because the contract for the building is valid. [Moderator] [words indistinct] The president has said he will answer no more questions.
