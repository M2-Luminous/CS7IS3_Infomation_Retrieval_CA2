An armed Russian convoy escorting governmental mail was taken-off a Moscow-Kaliningrad train because the Russians did not have permission to carry weapons on Lithuanian territory. Lithuanian border guards disarmed the Russian soldiers and handed them over to the police. The convoys explained that they were supposed to deliver the mail by plane, but their flight was canceled and they had to take a train. The Russians were given back their weapons and were allowed to board another train. Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the Lithuanian Border Defense Service, discussed the incident with representatives of the Russian troops stationed in the Kaliningrad region. Dragunaitis emphasized the need to put a stop to violations of armed servicemen transit regulations. The Lithuanian official said the rules of transporting weapons through Lithuanian territory must be strictly observed. He noted that Lithuanian border guards will never make any concessions to anybody and will always act in accordance with the law.
