This will be the fifth joint operation carried out under the 1993-94 plan. During this fifth joint operation, technicians from both sides will investigate plane crash cases and look into information about American nationals the U.S. side believes are still alive. They will also conduct surveys and excavations at a total of nine sites in the two provinces. This is the largest number of sites surveyed and excavated since the first instance of cooperation. During the planned joint operation, technicians from both sides will be divided into three groups -- two excavation groups and one investigation group. The joint operation team is expected to complete its work in these two provinces before moving on to work in other provinces. The Lao side has done its best thus far to uphold its obligations in accordance with the plan agreed to by the two sides.
