The volunteers are considered to be the best fighting men in the army. They are distinguished by their good organization and ability. They are capable of performing any combat mission with small forces, using a small amount of military equipment, and with minimal losses. No matter what you say, experience accumulated over the years plays its role. The majority of these boys, who responded to the first call to protect the Armenian borders and to go to Artsakh--are bonded to one another by strong friendship and have been tempered by the harsh experiences of war. They are the eagles of the Gayduk detachments who, recognizing the need for a regular army, at the end of 1992 entered into contractual service. There is no doubt that sometimes in the "detachment," group sentiments show through, but they do not seem to impede service in the army any more. For many of the old volunteers the main thing is responsibility and self-sacrifice, and their families have already become accustomed to this. The same task of protecting the Armenian land from enemy encroachment during the last year and a half has brought dozens of men of various ages to the army to serve in it on a voluntary basis. But among those who have signed up as volunteers, obviously, the largest number are people who have been forced to take this step because of their difficult socioeconomic position, and they hoped to use their pay to feed their families. The military unit leaves an infinitely sad impression. The barracks, built during the forties, are unattractive. The soldiers' uniforms are worn out and have holes in places. Soon they will replace people who are in combat positions, although it is apparent that they have not had a chance to rest properly. Wounded men who have not fully recovered and even certain Azatamart members who have been given certificates of disability will be sent there. Such is the life of the volunteers, which for many of them has gone on for six years now. By the admission of the commanders, certain of them are not fit for combat duty. Understandably, a contract army is something new for us. But slowness and obvious incompetence in solving the most important problems here are simply unforgivable. The contract system leaves the impression that it is a package of documents that has absolutely not been worked through. The volunteer signs a contract without having an opportunity to finally clarify his rights, responsibilities, and privileges. The commander is also left in confusion because his "rites" of command are not clear. Social problems--the miserly pay, uniforms, treatment, medications, apartments, family, and a multitude of other concerns--are constantly producing anxiety and disturbing the soldier. A sense of being unprotected follows him into combat positions as well, where he cannot feel at ease about his family, who are far away and have been cast to the will of fate. True, there is a certain edict from the president of the republic concerning privileges and benefits for families of deceased and wounded Azatamart members, soldiers who have participated in combat activities, which the president mentioned again literally a couple of days ago. But this involves such insignificant privileges and benefits that all this gives the impression of being nothing but a nice gesture. And at the same time, problems are quite obvious in a contract army. If the objective is indeed to create a professional, well-trained army, then conditions generating an interest in the service become especially important here. Patriotic zeal can keep a soldier going only during the initial period of his service, and in unfavorable social conditions with time it gradually burns out, which is being felt even among the volunteers who are devoted to military service. Is it not surprising that even under conditions of ubiquitous unemployment and a helpless socioeconomic situation, people very rarely volunteer for military service? There is no doubt that opportunities in Armenia are not great today, but one cannot say that there are absolutely no factors that provide incentive for service in the army. The volunteer who risks his life is offered an insignificant price in the material sense. But the soldier has a family and children, and to take care of them is also his permanent and sacred duty. In Armenia today it is possible to buy an apartment, according to a modest calculation, for one day's revenue from a small store. Moreover, there are many apartments that actually belong to no one. At the same time many military servicemen who are protecting the homeland are living in dormitories and basements, under unfavorable conditions. At least this part of the army should be provided with apartments, and in general the provision of an apartment should be the best incentive for contract military service in Armenia. During the course of their service soldiers lose years when they could have been living in a different way. After service in the army it is exceptionally difficult to become accustomed to civilian life and to acquire a new specialty. And ultimately it is no secret that service in the army, especially in a war situation, to put it mildly, does not contribute to the development of intellectual capabilities. Sooner or later our military servicemen return home, but what will they do there? This problem exists even today. Many volunteers are continuing their service simply because they do not see how they could make a living in this life, especially under conditions of a market economy, which are completely unknown and incomprehensible to them. In addition to material difficulties, in the future military servicemen will also experience psychological embarrassment and frustration. And a once strong, vital man gradually develops the feeling of inadequacy. There will be a new stratum in the society--superfluous people who have served and fought for anything but this. High wages, an apartment, education--these are obviously important factors which could bring about competition among those who want to enter the army and thus stimulate the process of creating it. In addition to the material incentive, there is also another important condition--state propaganda. Let us pay attention to the "respect" the soldier enjoys in Armenian reality. As distinct from the Soviet soldier, whom the people accepted into their homes as a native son, giving him warm hospitality everywhere, the Armenian soldier today meets with reproof and censure even when taking advantage of his right to free travel on city transportation. Moreover, the soldier's uniform has become somehow offensive to the eyes of those around him. Soldiers who are protecting their native land, cruel as it may be, are considered frivolous, rolling stones, somehow idle and limited people. Herein lies one of the main reasons why people try to avoid service in the army, and this will continue as long as state propaganda is so far removed from the national ideology. The temporary shelter for draftees into the army and reservists who have been called up for three months constitutes the same unknown quantity. They spend a month here, after which they are sent to a military training base. Without mentioning the failures of the first draft, one must say that this time there has been progress in the matter of organizing the daily life of the soldiers. The new uniforms are issued right away. Those people who are mobilized are fed three times a day and given the necessary nutritional norm. The bedding is clean and the bathing problem has been solved. There is always electricity in the military unit and the television sets work. Theoretical training lasts for one or two hours but practical training is inadequate because of the shortage of equipment. After noon those who wish to may leave the unit--under the condition that they return at a certain hour. Many prefer to stay in the unit where they can keep from getting bored. So in the modern situation in Armenia the conditions created for military recruitment can without exaggeration be called favorable. The purpose of the active duty training is to familiarize men from 25 to 45 years of age with at least the fundamentals of military life and teach them to protect their native home. Obviously, this is a sacred task, but how have we prepared the most important thing for carrying it out--the training base? The military unit does not even have enough models of the most common weapons for instruction. There is only one firing range for target practice, and it is used by draftees from all seven regions of the capital. Firing practice is put off under the most diverse pretexts--on the first day the base is occupied, on the second day--the ordered transportation did not arrive, the next day--there are no cartridges. Cases like this exacerbate uncomplimentary ideas about the army, from the very first day of service weakening the vigilance and the composure of those who have been called into the army. We do not know what awaits people who have been mobilized into the army after a month, at the military training base. But if this kind of situation prevails here, the effectiveness of recruitment is greatly threatened. We are not talking about questions of forms and methods of mobilization that flout human rights. Nor are we talking about the political objectives that are realized and the means that are applied, but as for elementary military training of the Armenian man--a most important and necessary matter of state importance--here we cannot close our eyes to the frivolous, antistate attitude toward this matter. A former volunteer, speaking of the sad and difficult realities of the army, which, if they seem harmless and less than dangerous in the rear, become a cause of losses on the battlefield, noted sadly: "It is necessary to do something so that today's heroic battles are not regarded by future generations as mere moral victories."
