Applicant's ``track record''/evaluation plans: Applicants should demonstrate a history of successful programs, including responsible fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past research grants, where applicable. The Center will consider the past performance of prior grantees and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. Grantees must be willing to comply with evaluation requirements of the granting institution. 7. Cost-effectiveness: The overhead and administrative components of grants, as well as salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible. All other research costs should be necessary, appropriate, and justified in the budget narrative. 8. Cost-sharing: Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private support as well as direct funding contributions (such as full-time salaries) from their institution.
