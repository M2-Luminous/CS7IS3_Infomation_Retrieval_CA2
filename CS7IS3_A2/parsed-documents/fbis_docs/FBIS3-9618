Following the talks the U.S. ambassador held a news conference, at which he said that the aim of his visit to Knin was to invite Krajina to join a peace process initiated by the signing of the Washington agreement and to reintegrate into Croatia so that it could join the building of a democratic society and avoid isolation. As another reason for his visit to Knin, the ambassador mentioned the cease-fire because, as he said, the time for it has come. This is a path, as Galbraith explained, toward reintegration into the Western world, in the political, security, and economic sense, which leads to the building of a democratic society. However, that path and goal is inevitably leading the republic of Serb Krajina, through reintegration, into the Republic of Croatia, the U.S. ambassador said. He added that the first step in that process is a cease-fire, and then economic and other measures leading to reintegration into the Western world. An alternative for the republic of Serb Krajina is isolation, the U.S. ambassador said. He recalled the U.S. stand that Krajina is a part of Croatia, provided that the people living in the UN-protected areas (a name for the territory of the republic of Serb Krajina) are granted full human rights and a considerable degree of autonomy. The mentioned process of reintegration into the Western world has also been offered to the Bosnian Serbs through their relations with the Muslim-Croat federation, while such possibilities are open to Serbia and Montenegro as well, the U.S. ambassador said. Dwelling on the last round of cease-fire negotiations in Zagreb and their resumption on Tuesday, Galbraith expressed the hope that an agreement on the cessation of hostilities will be achieved in the light of the fact that both sides -- the Croatian and the Krajina sides -- have shown flexibility and readiness for a compromise. President Martic described the talks with the U.S. ambassador as useful. He expressed Krajina's readiness for the restoration of peace. However, as regards the reintegration of Krajina into Croatia, Martic highlighted the well-known principle of the right of a nation to self-determination regardless of U.S. and Russian standpoints, which consider the republic of Serb Krajina part of Croatia. Martic said that in this regard he proposed a referendum to be held in the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia at which people would say whether they want to live together or not, but added he has no doubts about the negative outcome of such a referendum.
