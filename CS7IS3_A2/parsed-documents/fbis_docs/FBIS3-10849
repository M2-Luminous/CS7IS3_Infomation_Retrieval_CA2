FBIS3-10849 "drlat049_q_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 Paraguay Peasant Leaders Reject Wasmosy Remarks PY1203212994 PY1203212994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish on 12 March publishes on pages 2 and 3 three articles on peasant leaders' reactions to comments made by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in Santiago, Chile, about problems causing social unrest among peasants in Paraguay. On page 2, a 200-word article by reporter Robert Figueredo from Coronel Oviedo notes that local peasant leaders consider the comments by Wasmosy "inappropriate." The leaders furthermore believe, according to the article, that "Wasmosy's intention is to divert international attention from the real problems affecting the majority of peasants." Leader Rafael Ruiz Diaz, who is coordinating the mobilization of peasants for a demonstration in front of Congress in Asuncion on 15 March, is quoted as saying: "This is the type of comment that shows the government's negative attitude toward listening to our demands, but it gives us greater unity, more enthusiasm, for the large demonstration to be held in front of Congress on 15 March." On page 3 a 300-word article by reporter Adolfo Traverssi from Villarrica notes that the main peasant leader in Caazapa, a Mr. De los Santos Vazquez, said that Wasmosy's comments are "not true." He added: "If the president said that the peasant leaders have not planted a single square meter of cotton, I will say of him that he is a tourist president. Thanks to peasant leaders like us, he is always travelling." Santos said he was astonished that while Wasmosy was abroad he had discredited the peasants who are doing miraculous things to produce more for the benefit of the country. He added: "Instead of discrediting us, our president should seriously think of changing his government policy and aiming his cooperation toward the rural areas, where the Paraguayan economic potential is located." Also on page 3, an unattributed 300-word article notes the comments made by Tomas Zayas of the Alto Parana Agricultural Association. Zayas said that Wasmosy's comments are "shameful, as he is unaware of the real situation of his own people." Zayas added that anyone could see just by looking that there has been a 50 percent reduction in cotton production, and not 5 percent, as indicated by Wasmosy. Zayas said: "The president and those responsible for the country's agricultural policy are irresponsible, because that figure was disclosed by officials of the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry." Zayas also rejected Wasmosy's comments that the peasant leaders are agitators. He said they are peasants living in a land that had been expropriated by Congress and vetoed by Wasmosy. Zayas concluded by saying: "The president has shown once more his irresponsibility in looking for agitators, subversives, guerrillas, communists, and atheists among the peasants."
