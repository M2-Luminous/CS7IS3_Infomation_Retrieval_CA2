Concurrently with such appointment, a new federal mutual association was formed, [name of de novo institution], and the Resolution Trust Corporation was appointed Conservator of the [name of de novo institution] (the ``Conservator''). Most of the assets of [Predecessor Institution] were acquired by the Conservator in consideration of the assumption by the Conservator of some, but not all, of the liabilities of the [Predecessor Institution]. The Conservator DID NOT, however, assume the obligation to continue to fund your loan { , and as you were informed in another letter the Receiver for [Predecessor Institution] has repudiated the loan agreement and terminated any obligation to continue to fund your loan } . 1 You may have a claim against the Receiver of [Predecessor Institution] for the unfunded loan amount. You must follow any instructions from the receiver regarding the filing of such claim. 1 To be used when a repudiation occurs. Notwithstanding that the Conservator has no obligation to continue to fund your loan, the Conservator has the discretion to provide funds to you through a new extension of credit, when the Conservator determines, in its sole discretion, that it is in the best interest of the Conservator to provide those funds. However, the Conservator has decided not to provide funds to you. Because you are a non-defaulting commercial borrower of [name of the predecessor institution], section 21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act provides you with an opportunity to appeal this adverse credit decision of the Conservator. You must submit your appeal in writing to the hearer of the appeal, set forth below, within 60 days of receipt of this notice, stating the grounds for your appeal. In support of your appeal, you may submit documentary evidence, which must be submitted at the same time as your letter of appeal. The hearer of the appeal will conduct no evidentiary hearing. A copy of the RTC's policy on borrower appeals is attached for your information. You should know that the hearer of the appeal may only reverse the adverse credit decision if the hearer determines that to do so would reduce, or would not increase, the overall losses to the RTC as Conservator. Your appeal should be submitted to: [Name of Hearer of the Appeal ] [Address of Hearer] Attention: XXXXXX The filing of an appeal with the hearer of the appeal does not preserve your claim with the receiver of [Predecessor Institution] or affect in any way the right of the Receiver to repudiate your credit agreement. Sincerely, [Managing Agent or other official]
