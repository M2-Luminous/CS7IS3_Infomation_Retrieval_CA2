That is the highest number since the war, and another half a million people will lose their jobs in 1994. What are Germany's weaknesses as a center for business? [Rexrodt] One problem is that we have lost our "monopoly" in technology and training. Second, we can no longer keep up with costs. Third, we have far too many regulations and too much bureaucracy. Fourth, we must find new markets, and that should be viewed as finding new opportunities and not just as a risk. We know what has to be done. The point now is to translate that into practice. [Neuschwander] When you took office a year ago, you said that German companies had become complacent. Now, when you presented the annual economic report, you gave the impression that the crisis was over. [Rexrodt] Companies had become complacent, and incidentally, that was also true of the public sector. Adjustments are being made in the economy, and that is why average unemployment in 1994 will be higher than in 1993. However, I expect things to ease in 1995, even if only moderately. Germany will come out of this adjustment crisis strengthened. [Neuschwander] You have called for intensive research and development work, but while you have been in office this budget has not risen and has in fact declined in real terms. [Rexrodt] I too am hardly delighted that funds for research have been frozen. This is counterproductive. However, I would warn against linking research and innovation in Germany solely to growth in the federal budget. Industry faces a challenge, and it must once again place more emphasis on high technology and translating the results of scientific research into practice. [Neuschwander] How can one motivate companies? [Rexrodt] I cannot dictate anything, I can only see to it that there is an appropriate framework. The economy must be given clear signals for the future with regard to subsidies for research and the areas on which there will be emphasis, in, for example, defense. As far as the technical standards for products and investment in future technologies are concerned, the economy will have to find the appropriate resources by itself. [Neuschwander] New jobs can be created in the industries of the future above all. What industries are those? [Rexrodt] That is something that industry itself must know. I do not want to decide on its behalf. However, they undoubtedly include the aerospace sector and microelectronics. We also have to maintain our top position in chemicals and recover that position in genetic technology. We should not abandon engineering but exploit our traditional strengths in this field. In the good years, industry failed to make the appropriate decisions -- that was the case in one or two areas though not overall. [Neuschwander] In the past, the industries that were subsidized were above all the old industries, mainly steel and coal. Has the subsidizing of key technologies been neglected? [Rexrodt] We have put billions into key technologies. If more is said about coal and steel that is because of the public debate, which is very much inclined to focus on the social problems experienced by the people working in those sectors. [Neuschwander] Japan above all has scored successes with its industrial strategies. Can Germany learn anything from Japan in this respect? [Rexrodt] The Japanese Economics Ministry is in the process of abandoning its previous industrial policies and adopting the kind of approach that we use. It is a mistake to pretend that the state can decide what kind of research should or should not be pursued. It can do that in its basic research institutions and universities, but not in industry. The end result is like the Kalkar plant, a disaster. Billions have gone into microelectronics in Germany! We possess first-rate technology, and Germany can produce microchips of the most advanced kind! As for research in our institutes, universities, and many companies, we are among the world leaders. Our problem is turning research into products: Frequently, we cannot produce in a quantity and with a cost structure that would make us competitive internationally. This is an area in which we have to catch up. [Neuschwander] Statistics on patents show that we are not even leaders in basic research. Between 1987 and 1992, there were 216 German patents in the microelectronics field compared to 12,688 Japanese ones. [Rexrodt] Statistics on patents are only an indication and not proof of the technological maturity of an economy. We register patents differently than in other countries. In the United States and especially Japan, every second- and third-rate invention is registered. That does not say anything. However, in our country, registering patents is too expensive and takes too long. [Neuschwander] It is regularly argued that Germany is in danger as a center for business, because of a costs crisis. Is the pressure of costs one reason why innovations cannot be translated into products? [Rexrodt] The costs crisis would not be so pronounced in certain areas if we had high-tech products above all. However, an economy cannot just produce high-tech products. Most products and processes are standardized, but we can still produce a standard product, an armchair or a table, using high-technology processes. As far as the costs crisis is concerned, the facts are that we are a high-wage country with wage increases that exceed the growth in productivity. Ancillary wage costs are a very heavy burden on our companies and our unit labor costs are the highest among all developed countries. [Neuschwander] If one lowers ancillary wage costs, that affects the social welfare safety net, and if one lowers wages, it affects what the employee has in his pocket. You can expect to encounter considerable resistance. [Rexrodt] It is precisely our policy to overcome rigidity and change structures. We do not want to dismantle the welfare state and become a low-wage country. We want to shift the emphasis. The social welfare system accounts for a third of gross national expenditure. We have reduced the social welfare budget by 15 billion German marks, that is, 1.5 percent. Thus, no one can talk about dismantling the welfare state. [Neuschwander] It is supposed to be a first step.... [Rexrodt] ...and if it were followed by further steps, which is not something that I am announcing, the welfare state would still exist and would still be the most extensive welfare state in the world. If, over a period of two or three years, there is no further redistribution with respect to wages and real incomes even decline or stand at their 1989 levels, this does not mean that there will be poverty in this country. [Neuschwander] Germany lacks 5 million jobs. What does full employment mean today? [Rexrodt] It would probably be possible to achieve a certain degree of full employment today if labor as production input were completely mobile, but labor also means people and ties, and it is not possible to achieve this kind of mobility. That is why I fear that we will no longer be able to achieve full employment in the classic sense of the 1960's. However, we cannot allow ourselves to have 5 million unemployed people on a long-term basis, and that will not be the case. [Neuschwander] How do you intend to create new jobs? [Rexrodt] To tackle unemployment, we must also make adjustments to the employment system that will be of financial significance. Those who receive social assistance must be given an incentive to transfer to the regular labor market, because they will earn more there. [Neuschwander] If one looks at the low wages in East Europe in, for example, the Czech Republic, can adjustments to wages have any kind of effect whatsoever? Should the emphasis be on structural reorganization? [Rexrodt] The emphasis is on structural reorganization. We, that is, the parties to collective agreements, must achieve changed conditions in the form of more flexibility and the appropriate wage agreements for the time being. By transferring certain forms of work to those countries, we even have a chance to make a contribution to overcoming the costs crisis. Things will only become dangerous if we can no longer keep up and transfer so much that our integrated industrial structure, our industrial network will suffer. [Neuschwander] Collective agreement opt-out clauses have become fashionable in eastern Germany. Will they become customary throughout Germany? [Rexrodt] I am sure of that. There will be more room for maneuver, and in a few years we will have a labor market that cannot be compared to the present one, a more flexible labor market in the sense that people will be able to work 10 hours a week, or 20, or 50, or 70. Whether working hours are to be extended or reduced will become completely a thing of the past. [Neuschwander] Anyone who banks on courageous innovations and investment finds it difficult to obtain capital in Germany. What has to be changed? [Rexrodt] We have start-up capital and other assistance programs. In providing capital, the banks perform a traditional risk assessment and then make a slight deduction, but that does not.... [Neuschwander] ...so one's own home is the necessary security...? [Rexrodt] ...exactly. However, I am by no means criticizing the banks. Unlike a country such as the United States, there are not enough private sources of venture capital on our venture capital scene. This not an institutional, but a psychological problem. I do not have a recipe for that. [Neuschwander] Incentives can be created in the form of higher depreciation? [Rexrodt] That is exactly what we do not want, because it means that the risk is borne by the state, whereas the risk should be borne by the private sector. [Neuschwander] You advocate an intensive dialogue between political, business, and scientific circles. What has been lacking until now? [Rexrodt] In the past, dialogue was better with the trade unions than with business, better in any case than dialogue with the top business organizations. There was something of a communication problem between business and the state as a result of personal animosities on the part of certain representatives. Those have been overcome, even though I still see that there are problems. In the case of scientific circles, discussion was unfortunately confined to financial problems and qualitative issues were talked about too little. I support as a matter of urgency the introduction of qualitative standards for colleges and institutes that would enable one to link the funds allocated to a college or institute to its performance, or a system under which the pay of professors or scientific personnel would be based more on performance. [Neuschwander] So, how will Germany's economic structure change by the year 2000? [Rexrodt] The services sector will undoubtedly expand, and the role of manufacturing will decline. Mining will also definitely decline. Steel will have to make adjustments. There will definitely be a structural slimming down in certain areas of manufacturing. Some areas will be transferred to low-wage countries. All sectors connected with the environment will experience an upswing, and that will also apply to transportation, aviation, the railroads and the automobile industry. Above all, we will experience a boom on an unprecedented scale in the telecommunications industry. [Neuschwander] What status will the trades have in a German economy with an emphasis on technology? [Rexrodt] If one knows a trade, one will always be able to make a living, and that is equally true of both production and services, because they are geared toward people's immediate needs. Things will always be repaired, renovated, and produced. That is why I believe it is more likely that the trades will increase their share of the national product.
