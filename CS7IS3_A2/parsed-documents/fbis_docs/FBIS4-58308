Before leaving Sanaa international airport, the Egyptian envoy made a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', in which he stressed the need for wisdom and logic to overcome the political crisis that the Yemeni Republic is passing through at this important phase in the Arab nation's history. He said: At this phase, in which Yemen is passing through hard times for both Yemen and every Yemeni, we wish Yemen peace and tranquility. We must all remember that the recent incident in 'Imran between the soldiers of the one homeland should not forces us to deviate from the path that we all started with democratic discussions to proceed toward the goal that is dear to every Yemeni and Arab; namely, the preservation of the homeland's unity and its people's cohesion. Ambassador Badr Hammam also stressed the need to provide a calm and appropriate atmosphere to start serious and programmed action to implement the pledge and accord document. He said the document is the correct path to establishing the state of unity with its institutions and constitutional and executive agencies so that Yemen and its people can begin a new era of security and stability in the young Yemeni Republic, under which progress and the comprehensive social and economic development can be achieved. Hammam was seen off by Brother Ibrahim al-Sa'idi, Foreign Ministry under secretary; a representative from the Presidential protocol department; and Brother 'Ata Harun, the Egyptian ambassador in Sanaa.
