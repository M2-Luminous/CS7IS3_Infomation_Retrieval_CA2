(d) In addition to paragraphs (a) and either (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the following information must be furnished: (1) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making a normal takeoff, in accordance with §23.51(a) and (b), and §23.53(a) and (b), and the subsequent climb, in accordance with §23.65 and §23.69(a). (2) Procedures for abandoning a takeoff due to engine failure or other cause. (e) In addition to paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category multiengine airplanes, the information must include the following: (1) Procedures and speeds for continuing a takeoff following engine failure and the conditions under which takeoff can safely be continued, or a warning against attempting to continue the takeoff. (2) Procedures, speeds, and configurations for continuing a climb following engine failure, after takeoff, in accordance with §23.67, or enroute, in accordance with §23.69(b). (f) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, for commuter category airplanes, the information must include the following: (1) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making a normal takeoff. (2) Procedures and speeds for carrying out an accelerate-stop in accordance with §23.55. (3) Procedures and speeds for continuing a takeoff following engine failure in accordance with §23.59(a)(1) and for following the flight path determined with §23.57 and 23.61(a). (g) For multiengine airplanes, information identifying each operating condition in which the fuel system independence prescribed in §23.953 is necessary for safety must be furnished, together with instructions for placing the fuel system in a configuration used to show compliance with that section. (h) For each airplane showing compliance with §23.1353(g)(2) or (g)(3), the operating procedures for disconnecting the battery from its charging source must be furnished. (i) Information on the total quantity of usable fuel for each fuel tank, and the effect on the usable fuel quantity, as a result of a failure of any pump, must be furnished. (j) Procedures for the safe operation of the airplane's systems and equipment, both in normal use and in the event of malfunction, must be furnished. 56. Section 23.1587 is revised to read as follows: §23.1587 Performance information. Unless otherwise prescribed, performance information must be provided over the altitude and temperature ranges required by §23.45(b). (a) For all airplanes, the following information must be furnished_ (1) The stalling speeds V SO and V S1 with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted, determined at maximum weight under §23.49, and the effect on these stalling speeds of angles of bank up to 60 degrees; (2) The steady rate and gradient of climb with all engines operating, determined under §23.69(a); (3) The landing distance, determined under §23.75 for each airport altitude and standard temperature, and the type of surface for which it is valid; (4) The effect on landing distances of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under §23.45(g); and (5) The effect on landing distances of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component.
