FR941207-0-00101 FR941207-0-00016 37 CFR Part 259 [Docket No. 94&hyph;3 CARP] Representation for Claiming DART Royalties in Musical Works AGENCY: Copyright Office, Library of Congress. ACTION: Waiver of interim rule; and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is waiving the rule that requires a performing rights organization to have written authorization in order to represent its members and affiliates for 1993 and 1994 DART royalties in the Musical Works Fund. At the same time we waive the rule, we seek comment on whether a performing rights society should have separate, specific, written authorization from its members to collect DART royalties for its members or affiliates. DATES: The waiver of ยง259.2 is effective December 7, 1994. Written comments should be received on or before February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Fifteen copies of written comments should be addressed, if sent by mail, to: Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), P.O. Box 70977, Southwest Station, Washington, D.C. 20024. If delivered by hand, copies should be brought to: Office of the General Counsel, Copyright Office, Room LM&hyph;407, James Madison Memorial Building, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, D.C. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn J. Kretsinger, Acting General Counsel, Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), P.O. Box 70977, Southwest Station, Washington, D.C. 20024. Telephone: (202) 707&hyph;8380. Telefax: (202) 707&hyph;8366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Parties that import and distribute in the United States or manufacture and distribute in the United States any digital audio recording technology (DART), either a device or audio recording medium, must deposit royalties with the Copyright Office under the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA) for ultimate distribution to interested copyright parties. The AHRA defines ``interested copyright parties'' as copyright owners and any association or other organization representing them. 17 U.S.C. 1001(7). If the parties do not reach distribution agreements among themselves, copyright arbitration royalty panels (CARPs), administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office, determine what joint or individual claimants receive. In order to qualify, copyright owners must file a claim in January or February of each calendar year for royalties collected during the preceding year. 17 U.S.C. 1006(a)(2), 1007(a)(1). The DART Funds are divided into the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works Fund. This interim rule deals only with the Musical Works Fund. II. Representation by Performing Rights Organizations Until it was abolished on December 17, 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) prescribed the ``form and manner'' for filing DART claims. Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304 (eliminating former Chapter 8 of 17 U.S.C.). Shortly after the October 28, 1992, enactment of the AHRA, an issue arose concerning the filing of claims to royalties. That issue was the extent of proof that performing rights organizations were required to present in order to demonstrate proper representation of their members and affiliates. The CRT invited public comment in an Advance Notice of Rulemaking. 57 FR 54542 (Nov. 19, 1992). On January 29, 1993, the CRT adopted a rebuttable inference that performing rights organizations represented their respective members and affiliates (hereafter ``members'') in royalty proceedings. 58 FR 6441, 6444 (Jan. 29, 1993). The interim regulations also directed the parties to file a report, by June 1, 1993, on the issue. Subsequently, on October 18, 1993, the CRT published final regulations requiring such organizations to submit separate, specific, and written authorization to represent their members. Notice Adopting Final Regulations to Implement the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 58 FR 53822 (Oct. 18, 1993). On November 3, 1993, the performing rights organizations_the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and SESAC, Inc. (SESAC) (hereafter Performing Rights Organizations) filed with the CRT a petition to reopen for reconsideration the rulemaking proceeding that resulted in the CRT's final rule. On December 3, 1993, the CRT officially held the petition in abeyance. Order, dated Dec. 3, 1993, In the Matter of Digital Recording Technology Act; Implementation, CRT Docket No. 92&hyph;3&hyph;DART. On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (CRT `Reform Act'). Effective immediately upon enactment, the CRT Reform Act eliminated the CRT and transferred its responsibilities to ad hoc CARPs. The new act directed the Librarian of Congress to convene CARPs to adjust rates and distribute royalties. See 17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 116, 118, 119, and chapter 10.
