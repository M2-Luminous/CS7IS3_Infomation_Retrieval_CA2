The officials said China rejected Japan's request for an increase in the number of flights to Beijing, insisting Japan accept the same number of Chinese flights to Tokyo's international airport at Narita. Japan told China it is physically impossible to accept the Chinese demand because Narita airport is equipped with only one runway, they said. Currently, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways operate twice-weekly regular flights to Beijing while Japan Air System hopes to join them. Two Chinese airlines, which now fly into Narita, Osaka and Fukuoka, want to increase their flights on the lucrative Narita route, the officials said. No resumption of negotiations is possible as long as China insists on increasing flights to Narita, the officials said.
