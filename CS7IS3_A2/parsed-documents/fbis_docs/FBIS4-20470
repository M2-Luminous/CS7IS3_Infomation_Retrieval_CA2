The Asia-Europe fiber optic cable project was first proposed and launched by China's MPT. In 1992, the nation's along the [proposed] route signed an ``Agreement to Construct an Asia-Europe Fiber Optic Cable'' [see FBIS-CHI-93-069, 1 Mar 93 p 2] and formed an Asia-Europe Fiber Optic Cable Management Commission. The cable runs from Shanghai (eastern terminus) through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey, Ukraine, Poland, and Germany up to Frankfurt (western terminus), with a branch leading to Tajikistan -- a total length of 16,000 km. Completion of the project and operational date are now set for the first quarter of 1996. Within China, the cable links Shanghai with Xian, Lanzhou, Urumqi, and the Kazakhstan border; so far, the line from Xian eastward has been completed, while that from Xian westward is now under construction and can be completed next year. The Asia-Europe fiber optic cable member states are to meet in Germany in June this year to negotiate Asia-Europe fiber optic cable sales and usage by the various countries.
