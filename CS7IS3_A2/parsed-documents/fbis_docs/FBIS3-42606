Why has everything happened in such a strange way? Why did we learn about his death only several days later? [Advadze] Because he himself lied all his life. And so his death also ended up wrapped in lies. [I.M.] Did Gamsakhurdia's wife ask that he be buried in Tbilisi, on the territory of the estate? [Advadze] I do not know. There were such reports in the Moscow press, but to the best of my knowledge nobody made such a request officially to the government of Georgia. Again, everything is on the level of rumors. The same rumors have it that Manana Gamsakhurdia allegedly said that she is afraid that his grave in Tbilisi would be defiled and therefore wants to move his body and rebury it in Groznyy. [I.M.] This dragging the body from one grave to another resembles Abuladze's famous film. It looks as if the director had a tragic foresight regarding the future of his people. If Gamsakhurdia is indeed buried in Tbilisi, would it have any repercussions on the political situation? [Advadze] No. The funeral may attract a crowd of gawkers and people who remain fanatical supporters even after what he has done to Mengrelia, after the fratricidal war he plunged Georgia into, after the rampage of his gangs. There are not too many people left, however, who would even die shouting "Zviad! Zviad!" and they will no longer be able to influence anything. The Georgian government learned of his death from Russian information, and this also says a great deal. First of all that his own confederates--the people who most likely did him in anyway--kept a lid on the news of his death. His entourage got tired of his whims and of the defeat. It appears that those who had been counting on coming back to power on his coattails, whose hopes were dashed, eventually disposed of him. [I.M.] Which peculiarities in the popular psychology, in the nation's historic fate, was Gamsakhurdia able to exploit? [Advadze] There are two kinds of nationalism. There is constructive nationalism, capable of taking a nation on the road of progress. This is the sense of national dignity. And there is an aggressive, animalistic, destructive one. It is the latter kind that Gamsakhurdia exploited, and, unfortunately, many fell for it, for the slogan "Georgia for Georgians!" One can find an explanation for it: when people over a period of two centuries are deprived of statehood, dream of it, and suddenly get a real opportunity to attain it, speculative ideas easily gain support. Time helps us see their real value. As to the "recognized leadership," these figures--some say 95, some say 87 percent--that constantly are being brought up with respect to his election as president, are also a complete lie. It was an unprecedented falsification. Ballots were switched, voting took place under submachine guns aimed at people, and many other things occurred. Even on the wave of the prevailing mood there could not be more than half of the population who would have voted for Gamsakhurdia. We, the Union of National Accord and Revival of Georgia, published a memorandum, "Democratic Elections: Myth and Reality," in the TBILISI newspaper on 20 April 1992, in which we proved that no democratic election could possibly take place, and that all the so-called data are a result of skillful falsification. On 5 May we reprinted it in SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA--the most popular newspaper in Georgia--and invited opponents to disprove our arguments. Nobody responded! Nobody! His one-year rule proved that both he and his Roundtable were simply incapable of running the state. Suffice it to recall the absurd economic policy--for instance, declaring an economic blockade of the USSR? Can you think of anything more stupid? And when he was already on the run, the entire campaign of civil disobedience, all the explosions, sabotage, the war against his own people? Who could still harbor any illusions? Then the march on Samtredia and Kutaisi--bringing with them foreign marauders, together with whom his "army" plundered, killed, and destroyed. [I.M.] Some commentators--Yevgeniy Kiselev of "Itogi" among them--say that with Gamsakhurdia dead, the idea of, so to say, an official opposition on which much could be blamed also died, and now Shevardnadze will have to deal with a real and strong opposition in the parliament, which has its own score to settle with the authorities. [Advadze] The current parliamentary opposition has long lost its "Gamsakhurdia" colors. Many of them retain, however, what I would call a "Roundtable" mentality: anti-Russian leanings; rejection of the idea of joining the CIS; the hope that the West will show concern over the fate of Georgia, despite the fact that the West is in no hurry to open its arms to us--or to Russia for that matter. I think that to a certain extent this opposition can be explained by the desire to stand apart, to "shine" in the public background, to not get lost. Most of the time their complaints about the authorities are vague, their proposals not thought-through, and they still do not have any idea how the economy functions and why we need ties with Russia. This is not serious. For instance, Natadze, chairman of the parliament's commission on defense and security, says we should declare a war on Russia over Abkhazia and that we could even win it. [I.M.] There was this funny Georgian joke about Guria deciding to declare a war on China, and how the next morning all the women in the little Guria put on their mourning clothes and got ready to bury a billion Chinese. It is frightening when a joke holds the threat of becoming a tragedy. That the tragedy is real, that the situation is unstable, one can see from the constant clashes taking place, for instance, in Tbilisi. [Advadze] These are clashes between mafia groups who are dividing the spheres of influence and redistributing profits. To call things by their proper names, this is rampant gangsterism. We have to put an end to this runaway gangsterism, plundering and violence against the civilian population. [I.M.] How? [Advadze] By force. [I.M.] The army? [Advadze] The army. But a hired one. Since a Georgian militiaman finds it difficult to shoot a Georgian gangster, and since everybody is armed to the teeth, we have to invite those who will be able to bring it under control. [I.M.] The Russian Army, for instance? [Advadze] The Russian military, but on a contract basis. This is not the Russian Army. [I.M.] But this will only complicate relations between Russians and Georgians inside the country. [Advadze] No. If they work on contract, and on top of that in tandem with the Georgian militia or army, this is normal. [I.M.] A new round of negotiations has begun in Geneva. What is your forecast? [Advadze] I do not expect anything to come of it. The Abkhazian side behaves like the winner; they are intent on attaining Abkhazian independence. The world community--and not even the world community, but specifically Russia--can stop them. Russia must openly recognize the territorial integrity of Georgia and demand the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. But Russia is still behaving in a vague manner. Actually, it is difficult to demand a firm position of Russia right now, and I understand this. And while everybody is vacillating and negotiating, the Georgian population in Abkhazia is being literally exterminated in the physical sense. True genocide. [I.M.] Georgia is not going to reconcile to the loss of Abkhazia. Does this mean war? [Advadze] There is a political solution to this problem. The key to it is in the hands of Moscow.
