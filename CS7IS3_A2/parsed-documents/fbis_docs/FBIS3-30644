The need of a transport and communications infrastructure skirting the territory of the former Yugoslavia was on the agenda. The Bulgarian delegation returned from Vienna today. According to Mr. Churov the meeting was a success, at least in the short term. "In a longer-term prospect, things are a little bit more complicated because funding is involved," he said. "Still, I think that the Bulgarian priorities were accepted at the meeting," the deputy foreign minister said. The Bulgarian projects concerning the overloaded border crossings, could be arranged in nine to twelve months time, as Mr. Churov put it. "As to our longer-term proposals, it all depends on what the EU members of the G-24 will decide, and specifically whether funding will be provided within a reasonable period of three to five years."
