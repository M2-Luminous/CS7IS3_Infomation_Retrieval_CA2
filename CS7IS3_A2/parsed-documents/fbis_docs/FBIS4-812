FBIS4-812 "drafr074_d_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola MPLA Troops Shell Bie MPLA Troops Shell Bie MB1704071394 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro in Portuguese 0600 GMT 17 Apr 94 MB1704071394 Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro Portuguese BFN [Text] Unable to face the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops and disappointed that their parachutes should be falling in UNITA-controlled areas, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, forces went on the attack and started shelling Bie [Cuito] yesterday. Civilian sources in the area of Bie have told the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, that large explosions were heard in the city. Despite the worrisome situation, sources in humanitarian aid organizations in Huambo have told Vorgan that World Food Program aircraft carrying aid have been able to land at Bie. Those sources also said that the UNITA armed forces in Bie have been instructed to remain calm, but the situation could deteriorate if Luanda does insist on bombing the city. Two MPLA-PT attempts to provide parachute assistance to the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola were thwarted this week. It would seem, though, that Luanda wants to expand the area it controls. Such a move would not appear to be peaceful.
