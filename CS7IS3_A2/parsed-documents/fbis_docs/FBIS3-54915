The teams are coming to Belarus to inspect the former USSR bases housing short- and medium-range missiles. According to General Major Viktar Vakar, head of the National Agency for Control and Inspections, before the opening of the facility, U.S. teams arrived via Moscow, which contradicted Belarusian sovereignty, as in those cases U.S. experts were accompanied by Russian military officials, while Belarus had to pay for their airfare.
