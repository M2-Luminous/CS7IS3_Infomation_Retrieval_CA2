"My father is not suffering from any illness and is in good shape," she said Wednesday during a visit to a charity, the Hope Project, which helps educate children in poor regions. The report in the YOUTH DAILY added that Deng Rong gave the charity 15,000 yuan (1,700 dollars) -- the sum she recently won in a court judgement against a publisher accused of illegally printing copies of her biography of her father. Deng Xiaoping has not been seen in public since February, when television pictures showed him at a Lunar New Year ceremony. He seemed in physical decline, with dull eyes and a shuffling gait.
