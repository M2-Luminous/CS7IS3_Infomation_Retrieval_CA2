Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theoretician, and the great leader of our entire party, entire armed forces and all nationalities throughout the land. He performed immortal feats in the founding and development of our party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA], in the victory of the revolutionary cause of the people of all nationalities in China, in the founding of the People's Republic of China, and in the development of China's socialist cause. He made major contributions to the emancipation of the oppressed peoples of the world and to the cause of human progress. Today, when the socialist modernization of our great motherland is striding proudly ahead, is thriving, and is constantly winning great victories, when the Chinese people are filled with pride and elation, are becoming more prosperous with each passing day, and are proudly and steadfastly taking their place among the people's of the world, we more deeply cherish that great son of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. We will forever remember the arduous pioneering work and the great achievements in China's revolution and construction performed by the older generation of proletarian revolutions represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. From the time he was a young man, Comrade Mao Zedong devoted himself to the Chinese revolution, and he fought for it his whole life long. Comrade Mao Zedong was one of the founders of our party, and the principal founder of our glorious People's Liberation Army. Following the collapse of the Great Revolution [1924-1927], he led the Autumn Harvest Uprising [1927] forces into Jinggangshan, where he founded the first rural revolutionary base under leadership of the party. During the most difficult days of the Chinese revolution, he found the correct revolutionary road, formulated a correct overall strategy, and gradually fashioned a whole body of correct theories and tactics. Thus, he turned defeat in the revolution into victory. Beginning with the Tsun-i Conference in 1935, Comrade Mao Zedong became the nucleus of our party's first generation central leadership collective, thereby ensuring that the Chinese revolution went steadily from victory to victory. We shall never forget that but for Comrade Mao Zedong there would be no new China. In China's struggle to gain a magnificent victory in the new democratic revolution, it was Comrade Mao Zedong's correct leadership, the Communist Party of China that he headed, and the tremendous theoretical bravery and spirit of courageous struggle that opened a road that led from the countryside surrounding the cities to ultimate victory throughout the country. It was he who led the whole party and the people of the whole country through 22 years of arduous and brilliant people's revolutionary war that included the great land revolution war, the War of Resistance to Japan, the war of liberation, and ultimately the overthrow of the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratism for the opening of a new era in China's history. In his connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping paid high tribute when he said: "Without Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding leadership, it is extremely likely that the Chinese Revolution would still not be victorious. Thus, ...our party would still be struggling painfully in darkness. Therefore, to say that without Chairman Mao there would be no new China is no exaggeration at all." The founding of New China marks the Chinese' people's farewell to 100 years of humiliation. It marks the time when the Chinese people stood up. This immortal contribution of Chairman Mao Zedong will forever be the pride of the Chinese people. We can never forget that without Comrade Mao Zedong, socialism would not have been founded in China. It was under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong that Chairman Mao Zedong and his comrades in arms took advantage of the economic and political conditions for making a transition to socialism that victory in the new democratic revolution provided for the adoption of a policy of simultaneous socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and a concrete policy of a gradual change in private ownership of the means of production. They were able to solve both theoretically and practically the daunting task of building a socialist system in such a populous and both economically and culturally backward large oriental country. This was the most profound and most magnificent socialist transformation in China's history. It greatly emancipated social production forces, and it lay a solid foundation for China's progress and development, thereby enabling new China very rapidly to gain a foothold immediately following its founding, and to initiate great socialist undertakings. Regarding this magnificent historical achievement of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The success achieved in our socialist transformation is very wonderful. This is a major contribution to Marxism-Leninism of Comrade Mao Zedong." These two major acts of leading the Chinese people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population, in standing up, and leading the Chinese people in taking the socialist path influenced and changed China's and the world's historical course. This was Comrade Mao Zedong's most outstanding historical achievement for the people of China. Comrade Mao Zedong also led the entire party and the people of the whole country in exploring a path of socialist construction suited to China's circumstances. Following founding of the people's republic -- and particularly following the decisive victories gained in socialist transformation -- as large scale economic construction unfolded and experience was gained, and as some shortcomings, mistakes, and the taking of a tortuous road came to light in the USSR's economic construction, acting on the basis of China's circumstances and our party's experience in consistently maintaining independence and keeping the initiative in its own hands, Comrade Mao Zedong courageously suggested using the Soviet Union's experience as an object lesson in the task of exploring a path of socialist construction suited to China's circumstances. In early 1956, he proceeded from investigation and study, gathering together the wisdom of the entire party to propose the correct handling of 10 major relationships, which emphasized the rallying of all positive elements to build China into a powerful socialist nation. In 1957, he raised social contradictions of two different characters in socialism that must be correctly differentiated and handled. He made correct handling of contradictions among the people the main theme in the nation's political life. In 1958, he further called for a change of work emphasis to technological revolution and cultural revolution. He said, "self-reliance is primary; gaining foreign assistance is secondary. The eradication of superstition, maintaining independence and keeping initiative in our own hands in carrying out a revolution in industry, agriculture, and technology, and a cultural revolution, overthrowing a slavish mentality, burying dogmatism, and diligently studying good foreign experiences while also studying bad foreign experiences -- using them as object lessons -- is our line." It must be said that this analysis was correct at the outset. Putting forth these ideas was valuable and it held long-term guiding significance. Unhappily, because of an overestimation of the effect of international and domestic class struggle, and because of the arrogance and anxiousness to succeed that a succession of tremendous victories engendered, guided by mistaken "leftist" ideology after the last half of 1957, the application of this analysis was not successful, and even veered in a wrong direction. Both the party and the people paid a grievous price for this. However, emphasis on taking a socialist road of construction in keeping with China's circumstances as a basic spirit and fundamental direction remains a principle that we should forever follow. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great man of the age, but he was not a perfect man. During the later years of his life, he made serious mistakes, but they were, after all, mistakes that a great proletarian revolutionary makes. Moreover, even during the final several years of Comrade Mao Zedong's life, when his mistakes were already very serious, he still kept a watchful eye on the motherland's independence and security. He correctly grasped new changes in the world situation; he led the party and the people in withstanding all hegemonist pressures; and he produced a new pattern for China's foreign relations. The Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee made a full and penetrating evaluation of Comrade Mao Zedong's historical position in "Decisions on Various Historical Problems Since Founding of the People's Republic." It said that "Taking his life as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far surpassed his errors. His accomplishments are primary; his mistakes are secondary." His historic contributions, and his scientific writings and correct ideology have struck deep roots in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people throughout the country. Today, our whole party, whole armed forces, and all nationalities throughout the country solemnly commemorate Comrade Mao Zedong's centenary. This is a response from the heart of the Party, the heart of the armed forces, and the hearts of the people. He will forever be revered and remembered by the whole party, the whole armed forces, and all nationalities throughout the whole country. In commemorating Comrade Mao Zedong's centenary, more important than recalling his immortal contributions and expressing reverence for him is the maintenance and development of Mao Zedong Thought to expand and develop the endeavors he did not complete. The Mao Zedong Thought of more than half a century is a scientific guiding ideology fashioned by the CPC, of which Comrade Mao Zedong was the leading representative, according to basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to meet China's circumstances. It is a product of the blending of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with concrete practice in the Chinese revolution. It is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China. It is the theoretical principles pertaining to the Chinese revolution validated through practice and the summarization of experiences. It is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the CPC. Numerous outstanding CPC leaders have made major contributions to its formation and development. Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific works epitomize it. Mao Zedong Thought is an integrated scientific system that is extremely rich in substance, including philosophical, political, economic, military, cultural, educational, and diplomatic theoretical principles, precepts, and scientific methods. In particular, its theories on new democratic revolution, its theories on policies and tactics, its theories on ideological and political work and on cultural work, and its theories on party building are all innovative theoretical enrichments and development of Marxism-Leninism. They are the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought. They are the standpoint, the point of view and the methods that run through all of the foregoing integral parts. They have three basic aspects, namely, seeking truth in facts, the mass line, and maintenance of independence and retaining the initiative in one's own hands. They are the concrete application of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to all proletarian political party work, and they are the distinctive standpoints, points of view and methods of Communist Party of China members formed through long and arduous struggle in China's revolution. As scientific truths, the standpoint, points of view, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought will always be our guide for action. Numerous of their important points of view and expositions combine basic Marxist-Leninist principles with China's concrete realities. They are the thoughts behind the creation of China's own path of revolution and construction. They are the thoughts behind the Communist Party being the leadership nucleus for the people of the whole country and that only socialism can save China. They are the thoughts behind the founding and consolidation of a CPC-led people's democratic dictatorship republic. They are the thoughts behind the correct handling of contradictions among the people, for rallying all positive elements, for uniting all forces that can be united, and for building a great socialist power. They are the thoughts behind the founding and development of a patriotic united front. They are the thoughts behind maintenance of independence and retention of the initiative in one's own hands, for self-reliance, for arduous struggle, for unceasing efforts to become stronger, and for standing on one's own two feet among the people's of the world. They are the thoughts behind the people being the power that creates history, for maintenance of unity and reliance on the masses of people, and for wholeheartedly serving the people. They are the thoughts behind maintaining and carrying forward the linking of theory and practice, for the superb work style of maintaining close links with the masses, and for criticism and self-criticism. They are the thoughts behind comprehensive improvement of party building, particularly improvement of the party's building of ideology. They are the thoughts behind the people's armed forces and people's war. Today, they still radiate truth. They still play an extremely important guiding role in our work today and in the future. Mao Zedong Thought is our party's precious spiritual wealth. During the course of long struggle, comrades throughout the party have drawn wisdom and strength from Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured generation after generation of party leaders and large numbers of cadres. It has educated the people of the whole country and, in the course of transforming China, it has become a tremendous material force. Therefore, we must treasure and cherish the precious spiritual wealth that is Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Generation after generation, we must raise high and safeguard this glorious and magnificent banner. Generation after generation, we must use correct and complete Mao Zedong Thought to guide our whole party, our whole armed forces, and our whole people, and to advance victoriously the cause of the party and socialism, and the international communist movement. Moreover, to do this, we must diligently study and apply the standpoint, point of view, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought to the study of new circumstances that occur during practice, to solve new problems, using new principles and new conclusions consistent with realities to enrich and develop our party's theory to ensure that our activities continue to move forward on the scientific path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, our party has maintained and developed Mao Zedong Thought in the active exploration of a road for building socialism that meets China's circumstances, making tremendous achievements thereby. The most important of these achievements has been finally finding the way to build a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism that Comrade Mao Zedong sought but did not find during those years, and to fashion Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. This is a process of combining Marxism and Chinese realities. It is continuing to find ways for China's new democratic revolution to bring about the second historical leap after the first historical leap. Taking our own road to build a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is a road that must be taken for the development of China's society. It is a road that China must take to move toward prosperity, wealth, strength, and to stand on its own two feet among the people's of the world. Right now, diligent study of the newly published Volume 3 of Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works, to striving to understand Deng Xiaoping's theories about the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism, and translating them into a tremendous "material force" to win new victories in the cause of building a socialism that is distinctively Chinese is to use real actions to maintain and develop Mao Zedong Thought. Fifteen years ago, the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee formed the Central Committee leadership collective of which Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the nucleus. This collective set the guiding policy of emancipating thinking, using one's head, seeking truth from facts, and uniting as one to look ahead. It firmly rejected the mistaken "leftist" policy of "taking class struggle as the key link," which is not appropriate to a socialist society, and it changed the party's and the state's work emphasis to economic construction, thereby bringing about a great historical change that ushered in a new era in the development of the socialist cause in China. The most distinctive feature of the new area is reform and opening up to the outside world. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the architect of China's socialist reform and opening up to the outside world, and its modernization. As the nucleus of the party's second generation leadership collective during the new era of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialist modernization, his most outstanding contributions have been not only leading our party and nation out of the profound catastrophe of the Great Cultural Revolution, but also using his profound understanding of contemporary China and the world to put the party and the national again in the forefront of the trend of the times, and drawing up a brand new and magnificent blueprint for the Chinese people to take their place among the peoples of the world with greater strength. His feet firmly planted on the good earth of China, he oriented toward the world. He looked squarely at China's present realities and cast his eyes on the future. In the process of studying new situations and solving new problems, he conceived and designed with great foresight a whole development strategy that is distinctively Chinese in character. In brilliantly leading the Chinese people in reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization, he conducted an arduous and unflagging theoretical exploration. He respected practice, and he respected the masses. He was always concerned about the rights, interests, and hopes of the broadest masses of people. He was adept at capsulizing the experiences and creativity of the masses. He keenly understood the pulse and the moment of the times. He both continued what predecessors had done and broke with outmoded conventions. He exhibited tremendous political courage in opening new roads for the building of socialism, and tremendous theoretical boldness in blazing new realms of Marxism to make major historical contributions to the founding of distinctively Chinese socialist theory that brought Marxist theory to new heights in contemporary China. He is the originator of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism occurred under historical conditions in which peace and development became the main themes of the age. In the course of China's reform and opening up to the outside world, and its modernization, he summarized the historical experiences of socialist victories and reverses in China, and borrowed from the historical experiences of the waxing and waning, and the success and failure of socialism in other countries to fashion and develop this theory. It is a product of Marxist-Leninist basic principles and contemporary Chinese realities combined with the character of the age. It is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the whole party and the people of the whole country. It has a distinctive character of the time. This theory provides, for the first time, a preliminary answer fairly systematically to a series of basic questions such as how to build socialism in a country that is as economically and culturally relatively backward as China, and how to consolidate and develop socialism. It employs new ideas and points of view to carry on, enrich, and develop Mao Zedong Thought. It is the newest product of the linking of Marxism to Chinese realities. It is contemporary Chinese Marxism. It was under guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism that China's reform and opening up to the outside world, and its socialist modernization during the past 15 years scored tremendous achievements that attracted the attention of the world, that the people's standard of living improved markedly, and that the party's endeavors increasingly gained the support of the people. It was because practice showed this theory to be correct and a scientific guide for our activities, that the 14th Party Congress explicitly made it the party's guiding thought. The 14th Party Congress' call for the use of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm the whole party is urgently required for moving ahead with the great undertaking of reform and opening up to the outside world, and socialist modernization. It is an important measure for enhancing and improving the building of the party in the new era, and it is also a basic guarantee for maintaining the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years. The recently published third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and the second volume, which was published 10 years ago, assemble the most important and the most original works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in shaping and developing the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. They provide the finest teaching materials and the most powerful weapons for our further use of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm the whole party, to educate cadres and the people, to unify ideology, to strengthen confidence, and to actively, completely, and correctly carry out the party's basic line. How diligently we study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and profoundly understand and master the basic experiences accumulated, the basic theories created, and the basic lines formed by the second generation of the CPC leadership collective, of which Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the nucleus, in undertaking entirely new endeavors will have a major effect on whether we will be able better to complete the tasks of the 1990's and advance victoriously into the 21st century. The crucial issue in our study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and in studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism lies in firm mastery of the quintessence, which is emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth in facts, and linking the ideological realities and the work realities of all battlelines for the conscientious overcoming of all ideological restraints to enable a confluence of ideology and practice, and to enable a confluence of the subjective and the objective. From Mao Zedong Thought to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism are the two historical leaps generated in the course of persevering in the great cause of combining Marxism with China's realities by members of the Chinese Communist Party represented by Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Although the two leaps occurred in different historical periods, and have the characteristics of different historical conditions and times, and although they faced different historical contradictions and historical tasks and gained different historical victories; nevertheless, the two leaps were permeated with a common essence and substance. This was that they adhered to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, and followed China's own road of revolution and construction. Adherence to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts and taking China's own road of revolution and construction are the most basic historical experiences of all the historical experiences summarized in Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. They successfully transform the scientific tenets of Marxism into a complete system of new ideas, new theories, lines, plans, policies, and realistic operating principles for guiding practice in China's revolution and construction. Thus, they enabled China's revolution and the building of socialism to become a great scientific practice and a successful reality. All the history of our party shows that perseverance in combining Marxism with China's realities must proceed from national circumstances and the character of the times. It requires a thorough knowledge of the spiritual nature of Marxism to carry on and develop Marxism. This requires, in turn, the emancipation of thinking, the seeking of truth from facts, and diligent investigation and study of Chinese realities to induce new ideas and points of view, and new methods of solving problems. It means one cannot copy word for word the books and prescriptions of Marx, or mechanically follow the models and experiences of other countries. Failure to understand these points would have rendered impossible the creation of China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution theories, and it would have rendered impossible the creation of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. The most fundamental experience of adherence to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts and taking our own road of revolution and construction enabled both Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism of our party to express the distinctive features of the times and the character of China, and to be imbued with the essence and the substance of universal Marxist truths. This is another reason why Mao Zedong Thought is a continuation and a development of Marxism. It is the reason that the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is the most substantive embodiment of the continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always upheld Mao Zedong Thought. He deeply understands the ideological essence of Mao Zedong Thought's seeking of truth from facts. He also developed the ideological essence of the seeking of truth from facts of Mao Zedong Thought. He proposed the concept of emancipating thinking. He made the emancipation of thinking a part of the party's ideological line. He emphasized that the emancipation of thinking is of extreme importance in upholding the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts. The emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts are parts of a piece. Only by emancipating thinking can the seeking of truth from facts be attained. Only the seeking of truth is facts is a true emancipation of thinking. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is a paragon of upholding the Party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts. He is a paragon of adherence to and development of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized that "emancipation of thinking and seeking truth from facts" is the essence that permeates the entire point of view of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. In studying the new volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must grasp this essence, and clutch this substance firmly. We must adhere to practice being the sole criterion for testing truth. In the course of practice, we must adhere to truth and develop truth. We must reject dogmatic interpretations of certain Marxist principles and Marxist writings; reject understandings of socialism that are not scientific or that distort it; reject incorrect ideas about skipping the preliminary state of socialism; resolutely oppose erroneous points of view that basically repudiate Marxism; and uphold the use of the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in analyzing and solving problems. We must constantly improve our perceptions as history advances, as times develop, and as practice deepens. The achievements we have made stem from the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts. If we are to make even greater achievements in the future, we must likely depend on the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts. New situations and new tasks are placing new requirements on our emancipation of thinking and seeking of truth from facts. We must continue to emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts so that our ideas and understandings meet constantly changing situations. This is a matter that we must understand before studying the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. In studying the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, not only must we profoundly understand that the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts are important ideological premises for maintaining and developing Mao Zedong Thought, but we must profoundly understand and grasp that on a series of important issues -- particularly basic issues such as what is socialism and how to build socialism -- how Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism building is a continuation and development of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "In carrying out reform and opening up to the outside world and in placing the work emphasis on building the economy, we have not abandoned Marxism, Leninism, or Mao Zedong Thought. We cannot abandon the forefathers!" He also said: "Following the Third Plenary Session, we revived the correct things of Comrade Mao Zedong, we studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a correct and integrated way . The basic points are still the same. In many ways, today we are still doing things that Comrade Mao Zedong proposed but did not do. We are doing things well that he did not do well. For a fairly long time to come, we will be doing well these things and we will also be developing, but we will also have to continue to develop." He also noted that "True Marxist-Leninists must, based on current circumstances, understand, continue, and develop Marxism-Leninism." This is because "the world is constantly changing. In particular, modern science and technology are developing very rapidly. What used to be done in the old society in several decades or as much as a century or even a longer period is done in a single year nowadays." Therefore, true Marxists must make their thinking catch up with and meet rapidly developing circumstances. They cannot fall behind. This is like "the reason Lenin is a truly great Marxist is that he found the revolutionary road not in books but in reality, logic, philosophical ideas, and communist theory. The great Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong, did not seek in the books of Marx and Lenin the way to win victory in the new democratic revolution in backward China. Could Marx have predicted that the October Revolution would occur in a backward Russia?" Could Lenin have forecast that the use of rural villages to surround the cities could be used to attain victory in China?" Therefore, true Marxists must boldly pioneer and innovate. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is both a continuation of what those who have gone before have done and an opening up of a way to the future. This theory holds both very strong real pertinence and the distinctive character of the times. It is pertinent to today's rapidly changing world situation, and it is pertinent to the basic situation in China. It is also pertinent to various mistaken points of view that have existed for a long time in the understanding of socialism. It addresses the main issues in basic socialist theory, namely what is socialism and how to build socialism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put forward a series of new ideas, new points of view, and new concepts. They include new ideas, new points of view, and new concepts about the innate character and basic tasks of socialism; about the initial stage of socialism; about the standards for judging the "three facilitates"; about the economic development strategy of proceeding in three steps to accelerate development, the national economy moving a new step upward every several years; about science and technology being the primary productive force; about reform being China's second revolution; about China's development being inseparable from the rest of the world, opposing self-confinement and isolation; about the existence of no fundamental contradiction between socialism and a market economy; about how political system reform must correspond to economic system reform; about doing many things simultaneously and working with might and main; about one nation, two systems; about adherence to socialism, halting disturbances, and preventing peaceful evolution; about the need for vigilance against the right, and mostly guarding against "leftism"; about adherence to the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points" for a hundred years without wavering; about peace and development being the two main themes in the contemporary world; about taking the five principles of peaceful co-existence as the standard for building a new international order; about the need for dispassionate observation of the international situation, securing one's position, and dealing with matters calmly; about the key to China's problems being doing a good job within the Communist Party; and about greater building of clean government and opposition to corruption. This series of new ideas, new points of view, and new concepts are a creative development of Mao Zedong Thought. They are a major contribution to Marxist theory. It is the innovation of such theories that has brought about today's vigorous development of socialism in China. The facts show that we are true Marxists only because we both continue our forbearers' breaking of outmoded conventions and dare to pioneer and create the future. It is only by consciously understanding this point that we may be considered to have truly reached the ideological heights of modern Chinese Marxism, and to have more profoundly comprehended and truly grasped Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. Therefore, when we read the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we should study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas and theoretical points of view, and diligently study his scientific attitude and creative spirit in employing the Marxist standpoint, point of view, and methods for use in studying new situations and solving new problems. Comrades, only by adhering to contemporary Chinese Marxism -- Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to guide our ideology and every endeavor -- will our cause have a bright future. Only in this way will our country be able to prosper, become rich and wealthy, and our people prosper and flourish. As Comrade Jiang Zemin said in his speech at a public lecture on the study of the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, "Doctrine may be likened to a banner." When the CPC was first founded, it solemnly wrote the words Marxism-Leninism on its banners. Following the Yanan rectification and the 7th Party Congress, it solemnly made Marxism-Leninism and practice in the Chinese revolution a unified ideology -- writing Mao Zedong Thought on its own banners. Beginning with the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, and on through the 12th, 13th, and 14th Party Central Committees, our party has solemnly written Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism on its banners. This is an extremely precious spiritual wealth for which our party paid a tremendous price. It is a scientific summarization of the new historical innovations of our party and people. It is a great banner of our development of the socialist cause. It is a powerful spiritual mainstay of our nation's advance and development. In contemporary China, only by having this banner, and having this spiritual mainstay can a large party of 50 million members and a large country with a population of 1.1 billion have greater cohesiveness, combat strength, and creativity. The 15 years of reform and opening up to the outside world and the socialist modernization since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee fully demonstrates that "adherence to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism is true maintenance and development of Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought." So long as we continue in the direction and along the road charted by this theory, and follow the "movement in three steps" development strategy all the way into the middle of the next century to attain the level of a moderately developed nation in the world, a wealthy and strong, democratic, and cultured modern socialist China will certainly be able to stand lofty and firmly in the Orient. Comrades, as the largest city in China, Shanghai holds an important position in China's revolution and construction endeavors. It received a high degree of attention from Comrade Mao Zedong. Prior to his death, Comrade Mao Zedong had more than 50 important activities underway in Shanghai. He gave numerous important instructions about work in Shanghai, and he left a glorious imprint and a great ideology. Back in March 1919, in seeing off the students for part-work part-study in France, he began his earliest contact with Shanghai. During the period of the party's founding, Comrade Mao Zedong came to Shanghai several times to seek truth for rescuing the nation and the people. He actively launched revolutionary activities, and did much work in founding the party. He attended one of the first Chinese Communist conferences convened in Shanghai, thereby becoming one of the founders of the CPC. When the CPC established a democratic revolutionary program of opposition to imperialism and feudalism for the founding of the democratic united front, Comrade Mao Zedong was appointed by the party to go to Shanghai to take part in the work of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. He actively promoted the first cooperation between the KMT and the CPC, and did much work "sowing the seeds" of the subsequent grand and spectacular first great revolution. Following defeat of the great revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong left the city to found revolutionary bases in the villages. Using the single spark of a red regime, he encouraged and supported the people of Shanghai in arduous and tortuous struggle. Following the party's Wayaopao Meeting [in December 1935], the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong looked after and guided the work of the Shanghai underground party organization, thereby making Shanghai one of the main bastions of China's workers's movement, revolutionary cultural movement, and the patriotic and democratic movement of various democratic strata in the Chinese democratic revolution. When the war of liberation was on the verge of success and the CPC Central Committee decided to shift the party's work emphasis from the rural villages to the cities, showing great foresight, Comrade Mao Zedong personally drew up the strategic policy of "both the need to annihilate the enemies defending Shanghai, and the need to preserve Shanghai intact." He also personally drafted nearly 20 telegrams in the name of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Committee as part of the strategy for Shanghai's liberation and takeover. He drew up a series of plans and policies that permitted Shanghai, the largest city in China, to revert intact to the hands of the people. Right after Shanghai's liberation, faced with a grim situation of blockade by the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek, bombings, sabotage by enemy agents, rampant speculation, and countless tribulations, the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong adopted a series of important policies for guiding the people of Shanghai in rapidly overcoming all difficulties to win a tremendous victory in transforming the old Shanghai and building a new Shanghai. Later on, thanks to the guiding spirit of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, Shanghai rationally readjusted existing industry and commerce and smoothly carried out a full revival of Shanghai's national economy. After three years of economic revival and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and handicraft industries, as well as the planned building of socialism, Shanghai's industrial production rapidly revived and developed. With the full launching of socialist transformation and construction, Comrade Mao Zedong personally visited Shanghai several times to explore avenues for building Chinese socialism. He went down to the grassroots, inspected industrial plants and enterprises, and contacted cadres and the masses to learn about events. He met with people in all walks of life and listened to statements from all quarters. He personally made a report to Shanghai cadres announcing the party's plans and policies to promote work in every way in Shanghai. In January 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong visited Shenxin Plant No 9 where he told everyone that after the USSR took power, capitalist property was taken over by the state with a single order, but that China had adopted the method of gradual transformation. This was done in view of China's circumstances. Soviet methods were not rigidly copied. He also warned everyone to rely on the working class to look after the factories. Around this same time, Comrade Mao Zedong also visited Shanghai port and the Jiangnan Shipyard. On 5 November 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong boarded "Gangshen Lun," for a zestful inspection of the port's new appearance. He also said significantly that Shanghai is China's largest port; it is an international port; and it is a port that has development potential. We must take good care of it. He also said to accompanying leading cadres that Shanghai cadres should study management skills to meet needs in building socialism. At the Jiangnan Shipyard, he was ecstatic upon learning that this 100 year-old shipyard was able to build submarines. When an accompanying municipal CPC committee official said that not only was it necessary to learn Soviet techniques but to surpass them, Comrade Mao Zedong said in great agreement: "We must have this kind of courage." In July 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong visited the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. When Comrade Mao Zedong learned that within seven years after liberation, Shanghai-produced grinding machines were being supplied to the whole country to support construction everywhere, he said: "This kind of plant is needed for construction." After hearing that the plant was now designing its own grinding machines instead of making the former copies, he said delightedly: "We must take the independent design road," and he emphasized the study of advanced foreign experiences "for our own use." During this period, Comrade Mao Zedong used a large amount of investigation and study to shape many new approaches to the building of socialism in China. Comrade Mao Zedong personally urged along the cadres and people of Shanghai saying, "Shanghai has a future. It must be developed," to point out a direction for Shanghai's construction. He directed Shanghai to set up a "completely useful and rationally developed" industrial construction plan. During the 10 years of beginning the all-out building of socialism, Shanghai brought into play the potential and the strengths of its old industrial base, providing powerful support for the economic construction of the whole country. During the period of his visits and guidance to Shanghai, Comrade Mao Zedong also frequently associated with the people. He had extensive contacts, intercourse, and even communications with people in all trades and professions, and all strata in Shanghai. He was profoundly concerned about the feelings and hopes of the masses. The Shanghai working class will never forget Comrade Mao Zedong's hopes for the working class. Comrade Mao Zedong often went among the working people of Shanghai. He had cordial talks with them and learned about their circumstances. He encouraged everyone to contribute to the building of socialism. He was particularly solicitous about and cherished model workers. He instructed cadres in the need to pay attention to making the most of the role of model personnel as mainstay cadres, leaders, and bridges. In March 1960, he also personally invited to dinner Shanghai's innovators and labor model representatives, and he encouraged everyone to suggest ways and means for the technological revolution, and to contribute their energies to it. He also pointed out that "Revolution is no easy matter. Remember this truth when you are making technological innovations. No testing means no failures, and no successes! Everything must be tested and experience gained through failures making later success possible." He emphasized the need to train college students, train engineers, and train writers from among the workers. It was because of Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy and concern that the first group of worker engineers was born in Shanghai. A number of labor models entered university, and advanced model personnel in every trade and industry spurred technological innovation and a technological revolution campaign throughout the city. Comrade Mao Zedong was concerned about the production and the livelihood of Shanghai's peasants. On many occasions, he issued instructions on the need for concern and assistance. He warmly endorsed and recommended the experiences of Songjiang County in convening meetings of delegates from all walks of life during the early liberation period. He also personally wrote comments on the reports of five agricultural production cooperatives, including one from Hongnan Township in suburban Shanghai, and it was included in a book titled "High Tide in China's Rural Socialism." Comrade Mao Zedong was solicitous about the growth of Shanghai's young people. In April 1950, despite being busy with a political campaign, Comrade Mao Zedong took the time to write a few words of encouragement for the Shanghai Nanyang Model Middle School student wall newspaper, QINGFENG, that urged the students to learn skills to serve the people. In reply to a request from the Shanghai QINGNIAN BAO, he sent the powerful inscription, "March On, March On, On!" to encourage the embattled Shanghai youth who were overcoming difficulties. When visiting the Shanghai Machine Tool plant, he noticed that most of the people in the workshops were young workers. He happily instructed, "This is the newly rising force that you must nurture." "You have so many young people; you will certainly be able to run the plant better!" This expressed Comrade Mao Zedong's ardent hopes for and confidence in youth. On several occasions, Comrade Mao Zedong met women delegates, which left unforgettable memories for the women of Shanghai. When Comrade Mao Zedong saw quite a few women workers on the frontline of production when he visited plants, he shook hands warmly with them. He was sincerely proud of the emancipation of China's women, and he said approvingly: "Now that women have been liberated, they can run machine tools too. Things that male comrades can do, female comrades can also do." His encouragement and praise encouraged the broad masses of women in Shanghai to play a "hold up half the sky" role in the building of socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong always paid close attention to the building of the people's armed forces. On numerous occasions, he visited and encouraged units stationed in Shanghai. In February 1953, when Comrade Mao Zedong inspected navy vessel units for the first time, he boarded the Chang Jiang, and the Luoyang. He also said that "We are determined to build a powerful people's navy to oppose imperialist aggression." Comrade Mao Zedong also personally wrote the well-known "Eighth Company Eulogy," which praised the model deeds of "the good Eighth Company of Nanjing Road." All the party, all the armed forces, and all the people were called upon to study it. On numerous occasions, he met notables in the fields of education, science and technology, health, literature and the arts, and news and publication, as well as delegates from commerce and industry. He befriended them and showed great concern for their ideology and livelihood. Thus, they sincerely revered this leader of the people, and they felt the warmth of the party in living expression of the party intellectuals policy and united front policy. After founding of the people's republic, Shanghai was also an important site for the CPC Central Committee's and Comrade Mao Zedong's state activities. Under his personal sponsorship, the CPC Central Committee convened numerous important conferences in Shanghai, which produced numerous major policies and decisions. In addition, he conducted numerous important foreign affairs activities in Shanghai where he received important heads of state and international friends from numerous countries. The birth of the Shanghai Communique was a major victory for Mao Zedong's diplomatic line. It lay the foundation for our opening up to the outside world of today. All of this encouraged the entire party and all of the people of Shanghai to struggle to build socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought and leadership style left a profound impression on the hearts of the people of Shanghai. The people of Shanghai will forever cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong. Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, the older generation of revolutionaries, including Comrade Deng Xiaoping, have exhibited extreme concern and expectations for Shanghai. Shanghai's every construction achievement has been the coacervation of the guidance and support of the Central Committee leaders and the older generation of revolutionaries. In recent years, in particular, Comrade Xiaoping has made a fairly concentrated and profound exposition of Shanghai's development problems as part of his macroeconomic strategy of accelerating China's economic development. In 1990, in talking with Central Committee comrades in charge, he said: "Take Shanghai, for example, which is considered a major case. Shanghai is our king card. Getting Shanghai going is a shortcut." When he visited Shanghai in 1991, Comrade Xiaoping said that development of Pudong "is not just a Pudong matter. It is a matter affecting the development of Shanghai. It is a matter of the use of the Shanghai base to develop the Chang Jiang Delta and the Chang Jiang Basin." In discussing finance as the nucleus of a modern economy, he also noted that "for China to achieve international standing in the finance and banking field, Shanghai will have to be relied upon first of all." During his visit to south China in 1992, Comrade Xiaoping said in his important remarks that Shanghai holds a marked advantage in human resources, technology, and management, which influences a wide area. "Right now it has all the conditions for acting faster." In this connection, he called upon us "not to miss opportunities." We should emancipate thinking a little bit more, be a little bolder, and act a little faster. He said that we can only move ahead but not retreat in the development of Pudong today, and that you have no retreat route. Pudong's late development is bad, but it is also good. You can benefit from Guangdong's experiences to do a better job, and to be more modern. The starting point can be somewhat higher. Later on, you can rest; I believe this. He said, Shanghai people tend to be agreeable. This is a boundless force for the building of socialism. Look at Shanghai with so many changes in a single year. In three years, it will have greater changes. Comrade Xiaoping stressed doing many things at the same time and working with might and main. He asked Shanghai to issue two questionnaires, one on economic construction and the other on spiritual civilization. He said that by the end of the present century, Pudong in Shanghai and Shenzhen in Guangdong will have to answer the question whether what you have done is socialist or capitalist, and both of you will have to be role models. You must pay attention to overall national strength, but at the same time you have to pay attention to spiritual civilization. Comrade Xiaoping's important instructions and earnest hopes provided enormous spiritual motivation for Shanghai's progress. The third generation of party leaders in which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the nucleus also showed deep concern and provided warm encouragement to work in Shanghai. Not long after the 14th Party Congress, Comrade Zemin conducted an inspection in Shanghai during which he said that historically Shanghai's commodity economy has been fairly well-developed. It has multiple advantages, including the human talent needed for the development of a socialist market economy. He called upon Shanghai to take the lead in building a socialist market economy operating mechanism. He ardently supported the development and opening to the outside world of Pudong. During his inspection of Shanghai during April 1993, he acted personally, night after night drafting speech drafts reiterating that the Central Committee's development and opening to the outside world of Pudong is firm and unshakable, and the Pudong policy is unchangeable. He also directed many times that Shanghai should take the national lead in the building of spiritual civilization. As a socialist international metropolis, Shanghai should have things such as a symphony orchestra and a ballet, highly refined arts that express Shanghai's level of civilization. The expectations for Shanghai of the CPC Central Committee and the older generation of revolutionaries make every cadre and party member in Shanghai feel a heavy sense of responsibility. Today, when we solemnly commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth, in addition to expressing the respect and reverence of cadres and the public in our entire city, more important is the use of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm our minds, to guide practice, to seize opportunities, to accelerate reform and to hasten development. This is also the best commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's centenary. The key in using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism to arm the mind, and full and correct implementation of the party's basic line of "a single center and two basic points" lies in firmly grasping the essence of the emancipation of thinking, seeking truth from facts, and proceeding from realities in all affairs. Comrade Xiaoping, who occupies a commanding position in the times, and who brilliantly analyzed the international and domestic situations, stressed on several occasions the need to seize opportunities to develop productivity. He said, "Development is a firm principle." An essential feature and fundamental task of socialism is the development of productivity. Without the development of productivity, changing of our impoverished and backward state is impossible. Neither can the masses standard of living be improved nor the superiority of socialism be demonstrated. He stated clearly that "poverty is not socialism." At the same time, he brilliantly pointed out that "too slow development is also not socialism." If socialism is to gain an advantage comparable to capitalism, it must "realize the proper speed of development." "Slow speed is tantamount to a halt, or even to regression." This is not just an economic problem; in reality, it is a political problem." "Therefore, those who can develop should not stand in the way. Places having the conditions must do all possible to work faster. So long as they stress returns, stress quality, and operate an export-oriented economy, they have nothing to worry about." The 1990s are Shanghai's "last opportunity" for development. The CPC Central Committee has made the development and opening to the outside world of Pudong a strategic emphasis for China's reform and opening to the outside world during the 1990's. We must seize this difficult to obtain historical opportunity, clear away all interference, work singlemindedly, and devote ourselves wholeheartedly to building the economy. We must proceed from Shanghai's realities to focus on three strategic points, namely building the city's infrastructure, tertiary industries, and high and new technology. We must accelerate building of the city's infrastructure, give priority to the development of tertiary industries, and energetically develop high and new technologies to fashion high and new technology industries and a new generation of mainstay industries, to raise the overall quality of Shanghai's national economy and its international competitiveness, and strive to realize the established goal of making Shanghai prosper during the 1990s. Hastening development means taking the road of reform. Reform is the road that must be taken for the emancipation and development of productivity. Reform is "fundamentally changing the economic system that hampers the development of productivity, setting up a socialist economic system that is imbued with vim and vigor to advance the development of productivity." The 14th Party Congress decided that the goal of reform of China's economic system is the founding of a socialist market economy system. The decisions of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee systematized and gave substance to this goal that the 14th Party Congress set as the basic framework for building a socialist market economy system. It is our operating program for hastening reform and accelerating development. We must hasten the pace of reform in Shanghai on the basis of the requirements for building a socialist market economy system. We must make a transition from the planned economic system that was practiced for a long time to a socialist market economy system. Combining the socialist market economy system with the socialist basic system is a pioneering undertaking without parallel. In moving ahead, inevitably difficulties and problems of one kind or another will be encountered. We must adhere to a spirit of seeking truth from facts, proceeding from reality in all endeavors, and using reform measures to solve them. Only whatever helps develop socialist social productivity, helps increase the socialist country's overall national strength, and helps improve the people's standard of living should be boldly practiced. Experiences should also be constantly summarized to move ahead steadily. Fifteen years of reform and opening to the outside world have infused enormous vitality into Shanghai's economy. They have changed Shanghai's appearance daily, and they have constantly improved the livelihood of Shanghai's people. Consequently, reform and opening to the outside world have gained the full support and hearty endorsement of the masses. So long as we are adept at linking the spirit of the Central Committee with practice in Shanghai under leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and go about our work in an innovative way, we shall certainly be able constantly to bring about a new situation in Shanghai's reform and opening to the outside world, and its modernization. Reform and opening to the outside world require a stable social environment and strong moral support. The glorious cause of vigorously developing Shanghai and developing Pudong, has produced an unprecedented centripetal force and cohesion in people throughout the city. It also places higher demands on people's ideology and morality, and their scientific and cultural attributes. This requires that we proceed from the heights of full implementation of the party's basic line in truly working with might and main, steadily intensifying the building of socialist spiritual civilization. The basic task of building spiritual civilization lies in the nurturing of a new socialist man possessed of ideals, virtue, discipline, and culture. In addition, it is necessary to improve socialist democracy and the legal system, to make science and culture flourish, and to promote all-around social advance. In a situation of reform and opening to the outside world and the development of a socialist market economy, resisting the corrosion of decadent capitalist and feudal ideology and doing a good job of building spiritual civilization is both an extremely daunting and complex piece of systems engineering, but also a strategic task that has a bearing on success or failure in socialist modernization. We must pay great attention to doing a solid job, steadily move ahead with the building of spiritual civilization in Shanghai, making a satisfactory response to the material civilization and the spiritual civilization that the CPC Central Committee and the older generation of revolutionaries such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping have passed along. Today, we can thank Comrade Mao Zedong and countless older generation revolutionaries for Shanghai's present political stability, economic development, and social tranquility under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The situation is very good in every way. Throughout the city, cadres at every level and the far-flung masses are diligently studying Volume 3 of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and the Decisions of the 14th Party Congress. They are taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively socialist China as a guide in carrying out the "Decisions" of the 14th Party Congress in order for Shanghai to take the lead in building a socialist market economy operating mechanism. They are striving and fighting to attain the 14th Party Congress goal of Shanghai becoming "a turnkey" and "three centers." Comrades, from now until the end of the present century is the magnificent historical period for realization of the second step of the strategic goal of building socialist modernization. It is an important historical period in Shanghai's vigorous development to become a "turnkey," and "three centers." It is a great time to be alive. We all feel proud and honored in shouldering this important historical task. Let us unite closely around the CPC Central Committee in which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the nucleus. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a distinctively Chinese branch of socialism, let us steadfastly uphold the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points," study and carry forward the glorious accomplishments and ideological model of Comrade Mao Zedong and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, work hard to blaze new trails, do solid work, and make the contribution we should make to realize Shanghai's reform and construction goals, and to realize the magnificent cause of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism.
