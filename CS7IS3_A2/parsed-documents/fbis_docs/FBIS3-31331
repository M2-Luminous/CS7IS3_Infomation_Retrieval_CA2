Mediha Colo has the details: [Begin recording] [Colo] At today's meeting of deputies of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina who have remained in Sarajevo, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, informed the deputies about the basic characteristics of the latest Geneva negotiations. [Lazovic] [word indistinct] delegation persistently insisted that the only thing that should be talked about are borders, and, as he put it, not borders of future republics within the union, but of independent states, that is, a Serbian state that would have the right to form links with other independent states and above all with Serbia. Of course, our delegation kept refusing this, being of the opinon that one should remain within [changes thought] that the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina exists and that one should be talking about the internal setup within that framework. It is interesting that even Owen did not persist in keeping to his plan, but offered our delegation the freedom to present its new ideas. These new ideas, that is, of Bosnia-Herzegovina (?with) 17 cantons, as had also been presented at our assembly, were expounded by Ivo Komsic along with the map that was (?in the hall) for the first time and that really caused much attention. It is interesting that Karadzic's delegation agreed to talk about (?it). On the last day, Owen's proposal to continue the talks on the Owen-Stoltenberg plan was nevertheless accepted, taking into account some changed situations and perhaps some new ideas, but this plan remains as a basis. All participants in the talks agreed with this and this is the only truth about the end of the Geneva negotiations. [Colo] Miro Lazovic also expressed his opinion about the latest negotiations in Geneva: [Lazovic] A small move has been made, a move in the sense that an atmosphere was created that respected these different opinions without any aggressive statements, above all by Karadzic's delegation. There has emerged a clear readiness to reach peace, that is, that it is necessary to stop the war as soon as possible. One more thing is interesting and that is that the awareness seems to be gradually prevailing that a global political solution must be sought that extends beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic even presented us with an offer, demanding that we did not get surprised or laugh, to join Yugoslavia. We rejected this [word indistinct], that is, Haris Silajdzic resolutely said that we do not want to join a greater Serbia, but one may speak about Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign state possibly forming some links and relations with other states on the territory of the former Yugoslavia through the European Union or through certain relations and links for which there is a certain mutual interest. [Colo] Many deputies present at today's meeting insisted that our delegation to future negotiations must exclusively present the policies that have been adopted by the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic finally also clarified.
