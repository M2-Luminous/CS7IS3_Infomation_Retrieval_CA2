[Murayama] We favored political reform bills and they were subsequently approved by the Diet. It is natural that a general election should be held under a new election system if a new constituency map is made. However, this does not mean that the Diet cannot be dissolved unless a new constituency map is drawn up. When pending problems at home and abroad cannot be solved, there is no other way but a general resignation of the cabinet or a dissolution of the Diet. To listen to the will of the public, the supreme leaders, and to make a fresh start, without a mere rotation of the reins of government through dissolution, are regular procedures of constitutional government. Some people label those who favor dissolution of the Diet and a general election under the current multiseat constituency system as people who are intent on crushing political reform. However, the nation will suffer a misfortune when the current minority administration comes to a standstill but general elections are prevented from taking place under whatever circumstances. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ submitting a no-confidence motion against the cabinet? [Murayama] We will make our judgment after fully grasping how the Hata administration conducts the affairs of state. We are not bound by the fact that we voted Mr. Hata prime minister. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the Hata administration? [Murayama] So long as the Hata administration takes over the reformist line of the Hosokawa administration and promotes it, we are ready to cooperate with it where cooperation is possible. However, if the character of the Hata administration changes, that will alter the case. We will take responsibility for the budget bill and the bills related to the budget that we drew up jointly when we were in the coalition government. As to matters thereafter, we will adopt a free and unbiased policy. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What does the change of character of the Hata administration mean specifically? [Murayama] In addition to the remarks of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, a succession of remarks by the foreign minister and the chief cabinet secretary about the right of collective self-defense and a national emergency law is symbolic of the fact that the Hata administration as a whole is undergoing a change of character, whatever the prime minister may say. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Then, you have no intention of rejoining the coalition government? [Murayama] The answer is no. If we rejoin the coalition government now, it looks as if we have a lingering desire for ministerial posts. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is the SDPJ's next administrative strategy? [Murayama] We aim at forming a nucleus that can assume the helm of state affairs by marshalling forces known as social democratic liberals. We are ready to cooperate with forces that have a democratic government in mind. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ reconsidering its platform and policy? [Murayama] We must transform ourselves so that we can cope with the changing times. However, we do not need to change our doctrine or judgment formed on the basis of the spirit underlying the SDPJ's creation to form a coalition government. What a coalition government must do is agree on concrete policies for the time being through mutual concessions. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Can you join forces with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? [Murayama] Joining forces with the LDP does not lead to a change of politics. The Japanese people are expecting a change in politics. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms? [Murayama] One-sided propaganda is much in vogue: Japan has no alternative but to cooperate with the United Nations when negotiations fail to solve the nuclear issue and when the United Nations decides on sanctions against North Korea. There are means for further negotiations and it is natural that we should search for those means. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about tax reform? [Murayama] In an aging society, we will face the problem of how and who will bear the expenses for pensions, medical care, nursing, and welfare. It is impossible to cover the increase of burdens by income taxes alone. We have to pay attention to assets and consumption to make the sharing of burdens just and fair. We will have to discuss the best form of indirect taxes. We will watch the moves of the tax reform council of the ruling parties and draw our own conclusion.
