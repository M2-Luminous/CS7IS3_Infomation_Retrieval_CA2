Failing To See This Today Means Bringing the Dark Ages Closer...in Houses and Plants"] [Text] Perhaps there is no need to explain to anyone what energy resources mean to Ukraine and its economy at present, or to explain that our entire standard of living depends more and more perceptibly on the cost of electricity, coal, gas, and fuel oil. A conference of the leaders of the basic sectors of Ukraine--the power industry, metallurgy, and the coal industry--held a few days ago by the Cabinet of Ministers indicated that there would not be an easy solution. While there was a general consensus to the effect that prices for products should be reasonably restricted, the approaches themselves to establishing price scales for energy resources got a mixed reception. This is how Vasiliy Kotko, deputy chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Nuclear Energy, clarified the position of the employees of the nuclear power industry. [Kotko] The nuclear power industry was virtually the only sector of the national economy of Ukraine to finish out the year 1993 with a noticeable increment in the volume of production. Nuclear power stations generated a total of 75.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, or more than one-third of all electricity generated in our country. This came close to the maximum volume in the history of the operation of Ukrainian nuclear power stations. These results are all the more significant because they were achieved in an environment of mounting economic crisis. They testify to the great potential of the nuclear power industry, its high level of viability and stability. Nonetheless, the situation that has now emerged in the industry is not just difficult, but we might say catastrophic. All nuclear power stations are facing a most difficult economic situation. Beginning in the second half of 1993, virtually no fresh fuel has been purchased because of a shortage of funds; in 1993, two times less fuel was purchased than in 1990. Spent nuclear fuel has not been shipped out for long-term storage, once again because of a lack of funds. Contractual relations between many suppliers and nuclear power stations with regard to equipment, spare parts, and scientific servicing of nuclear installations have actually been severed.... [Rassokha] However, the nuclear power industry operates by way of complete self-recoupment and supports itself by proceeds from energy generated. How could the industry have virtually gone bankrupt financially with those kind of increments in volume? [Kotko] This is due to the fact that the nuclear power industry generated electricity and sold it to the state, but the state has not fully settled for it. There are two reasons for this. The apparent reason is that our main and only consumer, the National Dispatching Center of the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, does not pay for the electricity received from us, or pays late. At present, the ministry is in debt to the nuclear power stations to the tune of 550 billion karbovantsy, approximately enough for one month of our operation. However, this is the surface of the issue. The main reason is rooted in the rate policy of our government. The government is trying to contain the overall growth of prices in all sectors of the national economy, i.e. inflation, through fixed prices for power, coal, and gas. I will note that after the beginning of 1993, the rate for nuclear power stations remained unchanged for almost half a year. The introduction of each of the new rates was delayed by one to two months. As a result, inflation has not been stopped, but the resources of the power industry have been thoroughly undermined. Right now it is hard to even assess the damage. [Rassokha] What does the rate for electricity from nuclear power stations come to at present? [Kotko] It now stands at 118 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour. On the whole our rates during all of last year were at the very least two times lower than those of thermal power stations. Nuclear power stations stand for efficient power generation. In May 1993 the government raised the rate for our electricity by a factor of 10 all at once. However, prior to this we gave up the electricity almost free of charge for a long time, for example, in April--at 10 percent of its actual cost. In all of this, electricity is not the kind of product that one may produce, deposit at a warehouse, and wait for its price to grow. We have sold it, it is gone, and it is not possible to recover the funds anymore. [Rassokha] Given this economic array, why have you not succeeded in persuading the government that a change in its rate policy is necessary? [Kotko] The government has officially acknowledged the need for a change in the rate policy. Moreover, the government laid down in a decree that prices for electricity should change automatically if prices for energy sources grow by more than 20 percent. However, the Cabinet of Ministers is not acting on its own decision. [Rassokha] Why? [Kotko] Because it understands that an increase in prices for energy sources and electricity will be followed by an increase in prices for everything else. So it is trying to hang on to previously established prices for a while longer. Understandably, no one wants to raise prices for bread, butter, and even that same electricity--neither the population nor the government. However, this unpopular decision will have to be made later after all, but with more difficult consequences. [Rassokha] How much longer can the nuclear power stations continue if this rate policy continues? [Kotko] I believe that we have now reached the extreme limit and have depleted the resources of the industry. If this policy is continued, irreversible processes will begin. This means that even if we do get the funds, we will no longer manage to turn them around because our standard reserves have been cut back to the limit. First of all, we will not have time to buy fuel and will not be able to go on operating. Our suppliers do not have fuel reserves either. They begin to produce for us only after the receipt of prepayment. The manufacturing cycle lasts no less than half a year; taking into account the difficulties we have in converting and transferring payments, we may receive the fuel even later. I believe that if the situation is not changed right now, a condition may develop as soon as tomorrow whereby the shutdown of some power units, or perhaps of all the power stations in succession, will become unavoidable. First of all, our rate should now be revised immediately; it should come to no less than 300 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour. It should change with inflation and with the cost of energy resources taken into account. These are, at minimum, two necessary conditions. Last year the personnel of the nuclear power industry kept their word and did a lot to prevent the energy crisis from mounting. We are geared toward giving much of ourselves, too, if we are given an opportunity to work normally and produce electricity. However, we want our labor and our products to be paid for accordingly.
