FR940728-2-00042 FR940728-2-00035 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;325&hyph;000] Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff July 22, 1994. Take notice that on July 20, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) tendered for filing Ninth Revised Tariff Sheet Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 which are proposed to become effective August 1, 1994. Panhandle states that its filing implements, in accordance with Section 18.7 of the General Terms and Conditions of First Revised Volume No. 1 of Panhandle's FERC Gas Tariff, the recovery of certain of its Gas Supply Realignment (GSR) Costs by means of GSR Reservation Surcharges applicable to service under Rate Schedules FT, EFT and SCT and the comparable component applicable to interruptible rates under Rate Schedules IT and EIT. Panhandle states that the costs included for recovery herein are costs which resulted from Panhandle having to terminate and assign its existing gas supply contracts in connection with implementing Order No. 636, et seq., which, among other things, required Panhandle to restructure its services and operations to provide its sales customers the choice of reducing and terminating their obligations under their existing sales contract. Panhandle states that the costs encompassed by its filing, which total $14,368,766, consist of actual payments made by Panhandle for terminations and assignments of its gas supply contracts, all of which became stranded upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function in conjunction with customer elections under 18 CFR 284.14(d). Also included are certain Account No. 165 costs incurred for what would have been recappable take-or-pay had Panhandle continued its merchant function and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay buyout and buydown agreement which had been subject to a three year amortization. These latter gas supply transition costs also became stranded upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function. Panhandle states that the amounts included for recovery as GSR Reservation Surcharges under Rate Schedules FT, EFT and SCT and the amounts included for recovery under Rate Schedules IT and EIT have been calculated using the methods set forth in Section 18.7 of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff and are consistent with the Commission's orders and pronouncements regarding the recovery of GSR Costs. Carrying charges have been calculated in accordance with Section 154.67(c) of the Commission's Regulations and Section 18.7 of Panhandle's Tariff. Panhandle states that a copy of this filing has been served on all customers affected by this filing and the respective state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 29, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18432 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
