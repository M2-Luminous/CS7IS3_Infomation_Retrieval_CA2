Linkevicius Withdraws From Seimas National Security Committee"] [Text] National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius has stated that he considers his further presence in the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee "unnecessary." In his application to Seimas Chairman C. Jursenas and J. Karosas, leader of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, the minister requests to be removed from the list of committee members and expresses the desire to return to the Foreign Affairs Committee. L. Linkevicius said in an interview with a BNS correspondent that he did not approve of the committee's work methods and the understanding of its functions in many cases. The minister thinks that the interpretation of the principle of parliamentary control is not always correct in Lithuania. "This is not leading someone by the hand and adopting decisions for the executive sector," said the minister. He admitted that he himself had a chance to experience such deputies' ambitions. Concerning his desire to return to the Foreign Affairs Committee, in the minister's opinion, his work at the National Defense Ministry is closely linked with foreign policy.
