This morning, the Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters arranged the work for the post-flood period. The following is a report just sent back by this station's reporter on the Bei Jiang front: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] This morning, Guangdong Province's Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters held a series of meetings to arrange flood-fighting work after the flood peak had passed. Commander in Chief Ou Guangyuan [also vice governor] demanded that the leaders of various branches maintain a high degree of alertness, prepare work well, and guard against slacking off and becoming careless. He stressed that dams often collapse not when the river is rising but when it drops, and that each shift must be strengthened to detect problems promptly. He said: It is unlikely that the flood will pull down the main dam; it would be worse if we were slow to discover a dangerous situation. He demanded that, before the water drops to safe levels, there must be round-the-clock patrols, no one must slack off, and flood-fighting materials must be further supplied to various positions. Ou Guangyuan said earnestly that the work has touched the hearts of the central leaders, the provincial and city leaders, and the cadres and people throughout the province. He added that, due to their unique importance, we must ensure that the areas along the Bei Jiang and Guangzhou City remain perfectly safe. This is a report from Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the front of the battle against the flood in the Bei Jiang. [end recording] According to Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the Bei Jiang front of the flood battle, the State Council's joint relief work team arrived at the Bei Jiang this morning to give instructions on fighting the flood and providing relief. The work team spoke highly of the Guangdong people's high degree of alertness against the flood and their skill in combating natural disasters. It also pointed out that the flood peak had only just passed through the Bei Jiang, that a difficult battle remained to be fought, and that the water level was still high and a high degree of alertness must be maintained to strive for overall victory in the battle against the flood in the Bei Jiang. The work team today arrived at (Shi Qiao), (Xia Lin Zhou), and other dangerous areas to inspect the flood prevention work. Its members said: Guangdong has done a great deal of work in flood prevention and relief and has an admirable ability to resist natural disasters. The leaders at various levels pay attention to work and give sensible orders, and the people's minds are at ease. From the party, the government, and the military down to the ordinary people, everyone has pulled together to fight the greatest flood in 50 years. Had it not been a contingent with such a high degree of awareness about fighting floods, such a great flood would have submerged many areas. At present, the flood peak has just passed safely, and this can be considered a victory. The water level is still high, and the typhoon season will come in July and August; therefore, Guangdong must maintain its high degree of awareness, must not slack off or become careless, and must continue to prepare materials for fighting floods, so as to achieve an overall victory in relief work and in the fight against the flood in the Bei Jiang.
