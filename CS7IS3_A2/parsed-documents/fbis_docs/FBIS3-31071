Thus began the competition whose prize is admission to the Atlantic Alliance. Officially, it was stated that all six East European countries had equal chances in the starting line. In reality, judging only on the basis of the agenda of the meetings of President Clinton during his recent visit to Europe, this is not the case. Indisputably, the Czech Republic starts out a big favorite. It is a small country in the heart of Europe, a champion of reform, without any disputes with its neighbors and a favorite of Western investors. Close by, there is Poland, which, despite its leftist government and and economic difficulties, continues to have a strong and, especially, a "faithful" diaspora, both literally and figuratively. Paradoxically, Hungary, the country with the best image in the Western media, starts off with a big handicap. The strong point of the Budapest government, the exacerbation of the issue of the respecting of the rights of the Hungarian minorities dispersed in Romania or Slovakia, has given some trouble to the Western offices. In the competition for admission to NATO, the "minority issue" has proven to be a two-edged sword. Probably believing that one Yugoslavia is enough for Europe at the end of the century, the West seems to have closed the door to Hungarian diplomacy. Budapest's control over the ethnic parties on the territory of other states and the temptation to advocate autonomy, including territorial autonomy, of the zones controlled by these states have been viewed with alarm by Western politicians. Without being obliged to use diplomatic language any more, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker recently stated, in plain and clear language, that "Hungary cannot be admitted to NATO since it supports separatist manifestations in Romania and Slovakia." As they say, he who sows the wind.... At any rate, favorites or outsiders, the competition remains open for any result. The winner will be the one who will be ready to make the most sacrifices. Human sacrifices. Participation in the peacekeeping forces as stipulated for the partnership can mean loss of human life, in addition to training and review. In Bosnia, the Americans do not want to send ground troops, and the French, frightened by the losses suffered, will soon be withdrawing their soldiers. What East European state will agree to put its troops into the battle of elite Serbian, Croatian, or Muslim marksmen? Material sacrifices. The alignment of Eastern weapons with NATO military standards is also envisioned in the partnership. In order to reach the Western military high tech level, the East European countries would have to invest billions of dollars each year. And this is in a situation in which Romania, for example, which, prior to 1989, had an arms industry which covered 60 percent of the foreign debt, found, in 1994 [as published] only enough resources to satisfy 2 percent of the technical conditions for arms orders. To ensure that the signature of Mr. Melescanu in Brussels does not remain a dead letter, the key issue is the pragmatic treatment in Bucharest of the demands of the Partnership for Peace. Because, even if the genuine desire of Bucharest to win the competition cannot be disputed, one might discover that the price which must be paid is not small.
