Discussion: How Can We Help Georgia?": "Argumentum ad Rem"] [Text] This item derives from part two of National-Democratic Party Chairman Giorgi Chanturia's final speech at the National-Democratic Party's open conference in Tbilisi on 19 February 1994. In brief, then, we can formulate what we have to do this way: begin to build statehood, convert to the market economy, establish law and order, create an army, restore Georgia's territorial integrity, stabilize the economy, convert to a national currency by strengthening the coupon, and establish a strong government. (This latter ranks first in importance, because without a strong government any restoration of statehood is out of the question). It is very difficult to accomplish these tasks, especially given our objective problems, but we declare in all seriousness that it is possible, and if we want to exist we have to accomplish these tasks. As to the ways by which all the problems must be solved and how Georgian statehood is to be built are things we have our own view of, and it is already known to many, but we still deem it necessary to set forth a few of our ideas again, schematically at least: A) THE ECONOMY. CATASTROPHIC describes the situation in the national economy. Incorrect economic policies have brought it about that not only normalization of society's socioeconomic situation but also our statehood is in doubt. The government has clearly failed to realize that the country's political safety and independence depend vitally on its economic security, whose foundation has to be an independent national economic system. Yet the creation of such a system has hardly even been started--in fact, what we see is the reverse. For a Georgia left without a system of economic security, state independence can only be symbolic. Incorrect economic policies have also had an adverse effect in the country's social infrastructure. One might say that what is at work in Georgia today is not the "economic growth" principle but rather the "one-sided distribution" principle that is widespread in some developing countries. In order to realize the "economic growth" principle, the following stimulating factors are needed: the institution of private property, free enterprise, and competition. At a time when these factors are absent, when ownership by the "Reds" (which is called state ownership) holds a monopoly position, no real new national wealth is being created, and what there is is distributed in favor of a tiny segment of society in close contact with state structures and official or unofficial militarized groups. As a result, a very tiny segment of society is growing rich rapidly, while the standard of living of the majority is declining catastrophically, which creates a fine context for social upheaval. The situation is further aggravated by uncontrolled inflation resulting from the government's mistaken monetary-credit policy. Inflation, of course, has its most devastating impact on the low-income and socially least protected segments of society. If the present economic system remains unchanged, great cataclysms can be expected, which, given the absence of flexible socioeconomic levers, can only be averted by the use of physical force, and this would make any democratic civil society in Georgia a mere fantasy. Georgia's economic strategy should be oriented toward the creation of an independent national economic system, which requires the formation of a unified Georgian market, unified economic space, and an autonomous monetary-credit system. At this point we must address the provocatively introduced theme of Georgia's entry into the so-called "ruble space." Quite aside from the fact that the advocates of the Russian "ruble" never bother to adduce arguments or any competent, scientific reasoning to persuade their opponents and the people but rather attempt to accomplish their aim through demagoguery and naked populism, the point lies elsewhere: there is no such thing as a "ruble" zone, there is only the ruble of the Russian Federation, used by the subjects of that Federation. All the countries and semi-countries which introduce the Russian "ruble" officially become de facto members of the Russian Federation. The fact that the Russian ruble is unofficially in circulation here means nothing; we have dollars in circulation also, yet the state, if it wishes, can easily make the coupon the sole medium of payment (this can also be done by means of administrative organs) and solve the problem. They are also ignoring the fact that the coupon and the ruble are qualitatively the same currency, the only difference being the rate of decline in value (this difference itself will soon disappear in connection with the virtual halt of reforms in Russia). From the economic standpoint, then, there can be no justification for introducing the Russian ruble, and it will not improve the people's situation in the slightest. It will be solely a political move designed to destroy Georgian statehood totally and turn Georgia into a de facto part of the Russian Federation. (Similarly, some people think that instead of 100,000 coupons in pay they will receive 100,000 rubles; in reality, however, they will get an amount in rubles corresponding to the exchange rate of 100,000 coupons, and our people's financial resources will remain the same as today--at best.) Again, all this talk about "restoring old ties" is nonsense, because it is impossible to restore "old ties" without resurrecting socialism, and restoring socialism is inconceivable. We can talk about establishing ties with our old partners, so to speak, in Russia and the CIS countries, but these will be qualitatively new ties and will not give those who wish for the restoration of the "old ties" the effect they are hoping for. Nobody is against such ties, but, we repeat, unless we establish our own economic system and implement the correct economic policy, these ties will yield no benefits. The goal of an economic policy must be solid economic growth, a stable monetary system, solutions to problems of employment, and a balance in foreign economic relations. This will require: the advent of a reform government (no reforms can be carried out by persons who spent decades building a socialist economy and are still today talking about "old" ties, which is to say, a parasitical economy)--the kind of government which will carry out comprehensive reforms, in all spheres of life and, in particular, the economy, following the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and other authoritative international organizations, with no populism and no toying with the public; --it will require the transformation and rationalization of present management structures; --a legal foundation for economic reforms; --genuine property ownership reform in all sectors of the economy; --implementation of a rigorous monetary-credit policy in order to stop inflation, form capital and halt the capital drain, and ensure a stable monetary system; --implementation of a state policy fostering private enterprise and small businesses; --liberalization of foreign economic ties--rationally--and measures to make Georgia a country having an open economic system. Georgia used to be dominated by the myth that we could prosper by Borzhomi water and tea alone, which proved destructive. Now a second myth is coming into being, namely that we are doomed and that if Russia doesn't save us we will perish; this is no less dangerous to us. We have to realize that with a team of reformers and by converting to the market economy without populism, by making wise use of our resources, through purely economic contacts--including with the countries of CIS (but without any political subtext--and, most important, through honesty and labor we can bring the country out of its economic crisis and create the conditions necessary for a normal life. B) LAW AND ORDER. FIRST OF ALL, the structures of authority need to be cleansed of clans, representatives of bandit gangs, and dope addicts. Certain types of narcotic substances ought to be legalized in order to strike a blow against the narcobusiness that is beginning to take shape. Even though we are in principle against the death penalty, we believe it is acceptable, temporarily--for a span of two to three years--to make use of the supreme penalty against dope peddlers and distributors, terrorists, and kidnappers. Of course, the appropriate changes will have to be made in the Criminal Code. The Internal Affairs Ministry will have to change radically, stop being a politicized institution protecting the authorities and turn into a structure protecting citizens and their rights. All parties, including those who support the authorities, must be disarmed. All unofficial military formations must be abolished. Any weapons held by security workers and persons who need protection must be registered in the Internal Affairs Ministry. The war against crime must be more than just a campaign; it needs to be purposeful, and it ought to start "from the top" rather than "from the bottom," the way it is today. There are other specific questions which also need specific approaches and solutions. C) FOREIGN POLICY. THE STATE must resume its pro-Western course, but it must be genuine rather than merely declarative. At the same time, we have to take account of Russia's geopolitical interests and be willing to compromise--though not at the expense of our own sovereignty and state interests--to establish normal relations with Russia (it also needs to be pointed out that not everything depends on us, and the most important thing, still, is just who is going to be in charge "up there." Yeltsin, who has already embarked on the path of derzhavizm and has even, in effect, buried economic reforms, will certainly share Gorbachev's fate if he carries out such a course, because it is not going to satisfy either the democrats or the extreme nationalists. We have to have an interest in seeing Gaydar and other true democrats come to power in Russia, but today's authorities there--specifically, Chernomyrdin's government--are objectively laying the groundwork for a quite different regime, and Zhirinovskiy will be at its head). Georgia must cooperate actively with the UN, the Eurocouncil, and other international organizations. We need to have especially close ties with NATO's military-political bloc, and we must certainly join the Cooperation for Peace initiative. Georgia has to work actively in the North Caucasus, but, at this stage, on the level of people's diplomacy. Finally, any correct and fruitful foreign policy necessarily requires a top-to-bottom reorganization of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and substantial cadre changes (which should include our diplomats as well, with rare exceptions). We need to work out a serious foreign policy conception, define our priorities, and work purposefully on the basis of that conception. D) CERTAIN DIRECTIONS OF DOMESTIC POLICY. THE MAIN THING is relations with the national movement, reports of whose demise are greatly exaggerated. Quite the contrary: if everything goes on as it has, the national movement will gain new forces, find ways to make use of social activism, draw the old, not-all-that mistaken, appropriate conclusions from the past, and take shape as a very solid and meaningful entity. In the interests of statehood, it is essential that men of the national movement--in general, "new men"--come into power. It is a little embarrassing when the people who speak of the destructive force of the national movement are those who for years destroyed the country themselves, sold off the lands, and squandered state property, especially considering that the one year of Gamsakhurdia's rule which people have been harping about was not a year of national-movement government. In fact, Gamsakhurdia started his "deep statehood" activity by fighting the national movement's supreme organ--the National Congress (we could also mention Beso Gugushvili's ideas and decisions of convergence and other anti-national notions). The national movement has never been in power, and even if it did fervently desire to destroy anything it couldn't do so. There may be many who do not like the national movement, but at least its representatives have never given away credit. You may look at the national movement in various ways, but it wasn't the national movement which brought in one-dollar wheat at one dollar and thirty cents--it was the person who is the Vice Premier today. It isn't the national movement that has been eating up the humanitarian aid, and it did not lose Abkhazia. And, of course, admitting a few representatives of the national movement to power just to prettify the facade does not mean that the national movement has come to power. The national movement has made mistakes--quite a few. But let him who has never done any wrong to his own people, and is infallible, throw the first stone. Hence, we have to stop laying blame, and entrust the nation's fate to those who are capable of building the state and, in particular, those who wish to. Today, the authorities are on the brink of anarchy, while anarchy is ready to take power. According to Lichtenberg, order is the prerequisite of any good thing, but is anything leading us to order? Is it going to be necessary to give up on democracy and establish a dictatorship? No, it is not, because it is possible to achieve order through democratic structures as well. Almost every democratic country has gone through a "democratic Caesarism" phase--that is, a period in which the rulers, in order to create strong democratic structures, have resorted to certain restrictions and other temporary measures. But in such a case, as in the case of carrying out reforms, the rulers have to enjoy the people's trust, and they must not abuse that trust. "Democratic Caesarism" implies strong presidential rule, though with a strong parliament and, as we have stated, with a large store of trust. We must never forget for a moment that the problems of Abkhazia and Samachablo are still unresolved, and until they are there can be no question of order and stability. The people are aware of our party's views on these matters, so we will just add one thing: we need a differentiated approach to both problems, because while it is possible to make effective use of peaceful measures in regard to Samachablo and preserve our territorial integrity through reasonable compromise, in the case of Abkhazia, unfortunately, we will have to first shift the emphasis to partisan warfare and then, after an army has been formed, resolve the conflict through large-scale military operations. The business of building an army and military industry has to be turned over to civilians and politicians, while professional military men must be in charge of military operations and other specific spheres (as in all normal countries). E) HOW SHALL WE BEGIN? DESPITE objective factors, the government and all its component parts cannot dodge responsibility for the country's ruin and destruction. In order to escape responsibility, one ought to have to resign from one's position or, perhaps, even quit politics. If this does not happen voluntarily, we have stated repeatedly that it will happen by force, either through social upheaval or by mass actions, because the people have no other remedy, and there has been no light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while. Georgia truly cannot stand such cataclysms, and this is why it is all the more urgent that our leadership be changed by peaceful means. First of all, a new election law must be passed and extraordinary parliamentary elections scheduled (a Constitution can be adopted simultaneously with the elections, and no one will give us the time to put off elections until Abkhazia is regained). The elections must be organized on the basis of party rosters, and with a 5-percent barrier for the parties (a 10-percent barrier for blocs). This way, we will have two or three really solid parties in Parliament. Then the winning party, or a coalition of parties, can put together a government, and, finally, a "new generation"--that is, persons of a non-socialist mentality--will come to power. Election day must be announced quickly, but meanwhile (today, one might say) the Cabinet of Ministers ought to step down (and not on grounds of the budget). Instead of the old party hack or former factory director, the government should be headed by a politician who has the support of both the majority and the minority in Parliament. Because the country's very existence is at stake, we must all rally our forces and share responsibility. A national-salvation government will have to be made up of representatives of both the majority and the minority in order to achieve a consolidation of political forces, ensure that reformers and honest persons are in charge and that in addition to personal and party responsibility there is an increase in collective responsibility of the sort that we are so sorely in need of. Such a government will have just one drawback: because of the diversity of its make-up it will not be a team; on the other hand, however, it can unite the country, ensure the inviolability of the country's sovereignty until elections are held and carry out reforms. The national-salvation government is our common responsibility in the land we call Georgia, the land we all must save and build regardless of our party affiliation, creed, or social status. We have a choice then--to join together, to face together the numerous problems threatening to engulf our people, or to keep on tearing at one another and giving Georgia away piece by piece to the forces "which have been, are, and will for a while continue to be" the test of our faith and our strength.
