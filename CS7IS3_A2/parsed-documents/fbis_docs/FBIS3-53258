Immediately upon arrival in Ibb, Salih met in the governorate's center with the brother officials in the governorate, the ulema, leading figures, and representatives of the political parties and organizations as well as mass organizations in the governorate. In the meeting, Salih noted that his visit to Ibb this time differs from his previous visit because it comes amid this regrettable crisis. He said: I highly appreciate what I heard today from the orators and poets whose sincere speeches came from their hearts, reflecting the pain of our people because of this crisis which has been going on since 19 August 1993. We were expecting to begin a new year and to leave behind the previous year with all its tragedies and its political, social, and economic mistakes, and turn over a new leaf. The crisis is not among the united Yemeni people but is a crisis of confidence among certain leaderships that pursue their own interests to the detriment of public interests. There are some who speak of the masses and their problems while at the same time trying to realize personal gains. I say that we must uphold the interests of the homeland and rise above the interests of the rulers and officials in all centers and departments and on all levels. The president said: Unity was realized because of the struggle by all the Yemenis. It is not just a gain for Yemen but a gain for the entire Arab nation. Unity has brought together the one Yemeni family. We had hoped that some of our colleagues and comrades in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership would be logical and reasonable and would let dialogue prevail rather than allowing other options to prevail. We hope that the Dialogue Committee will carry out its responsibility and speedily end its discussion of the problems and points on its agenda in order to enable the country to come out of the current impasse instead of this delay and waste of time. The conditions in the country are getting worse and the citizens conditions are deteriorating. There is a plan to create unrest among the citizens and to instigate riots and sabotage similar to what happened on 9 and 10 December 1992. There are those who are planning for the return to the old partition system, which we buried on 22 May 1990. Salih said: All noble and sincere voices must be raised and all the forces, organizations, and political parties must oppose those who call for returning to the past. They must say: No to partition, yes to unity and peaceful dialogue, yes to security, stability, and peace. Salih said: We must remember our people's suffering during the partition, especially in this governorate, Ibb, which suffered so much from the afflictions of partition. As officials, we must remember the suffering of our people. We must remember the poor and the powerless who are suffering because of the rise in prices as a result of the expanding and escalating crisis. The voice of right must be raised to tell the wrongdoer: You have erred. The problem is not the problem of 'Ali ['Abdallah Salih] and 'Ali [Salim al-Bid] but is connected with the responsibility of those who do not want our people to come out of this crisis, this affliction. We have made concessions and given our consent to all the proposed solutions and showed ourselves to be keen on finding a quick way out of this crisis, whose origins our people know full well -- the people behind it, and those who stand to gain from it. We have consented to all the points and demands made by our partners -- the YSP -- and have responded to the ulema's call to put things right. If I knew that any concessions on my part would keep my country and its unity from going down a hazardous and slippery road I would do it. The one thing that remains for me to do is to offer to resign my post as head of state -- something I am prepared to do for the sake of keeping the unity intact. If that is the problem, let brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid or the YSP come forward. The chairman of the Presidential Council reviewed numerous issues and developments on the national scene, indicating that he intimated his approval of the system of local government and the enactment of legislation to regulate it so as to ensure decentralization and curb centralization. But the provincial system demanded by some amounts to a scheme to carve the country into mini-states and sultanates. We have united the Yemeni family and we should rally it together. So, how can we accept taking steps backward? We will not be responsible for sacrificing unity and will not allow infighting. We stand for responsible and objective dialogue. He pointed to certain erroneous practices that have been detrimental to unity and to the problems that have befallen the interim period. From this place, I call on brothers of the YSP to engage in dialogue, notwithstanding all the statements made against the president by some of its officials. I am an understanding person. To all of them I now say: May God forgive you. Let us turn over a new leaf and rise above our personal concerns, and work for the sake of our people's and country's supreme interests. I also call on the population of the Ibb Governorate and all our countrymen to help us maintain security, stability, peace, and unity. Meanwhile, speeches made at the meeting expressed our people's anxiety over the political crisis our country is going through and the deep negative impact it has had on the citizens' economic, social, and psychological well-being. The speakers urged the political leadership to work to find quick solutions to this crisis, which is beginning to pose a threat to the homeland and the unity of the people who have made generous sacrifices for its sake. They emphasized that the Yemeni masses, who have been unstinting in their sacrifices for the sake of unity, are willing to make further sacrifices to preserve the homeland's unity and defend the gains of the revolution. The speakers urged the political leadership to be receptive to the call of the masses, submit to reason and the country's supreme interests, get together to work out a solution to this crisis, and address its repercussions. The meeting also heard a statement issued by the governorate's population, which urged a reactivation of the government's various institutions so that they may discharge their national duties free of party, regional, personal, or confessional affiliations. They called for all violators of the duties and functions of public office to be called to account.
