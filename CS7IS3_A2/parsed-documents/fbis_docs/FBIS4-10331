I cannot say anything more than we are still consolidating the organization of the Government Ministry which I head and its many departments. Working with me is Deputy Government Minister (?Erwin Quesada) who was sworn in just 48 hours ago. I am not trying to make excuses or rationalizations; I am just pointing out the facts. I am grateful, therefore, to the honorable Congress of the Republic for this opportunity to explain to the Guatemalan community how we are dealing with these problems that are fostering anxiety, and, moreover, to inform the people of the mechanisms through which the ministry will establish increased security in the short-term, restore the people's confidence and safety, allow them to live their lives normally, and counteract the people's lack of confidence in those officials who have failed to do their jobs. 1. After 17 straight days of continuous work or 12 working days, the Government Ministry's employees have assessed the country's security situation as critical. I repeat, the situation is critical, because it affects all sectors equally. It is critical because many cases of individual and collective violence are being reported throughout Guatemalan territory for a variety of reasons. This violence completely undermines the legal framework that is the foundation of the de jure state. If you carefully examine these circumstances, you will discover two relevant facts -- a shortage of funds and a lack of justice because of the strike by certain members of the bureaucracy who work for the security services. You will also notice there is a shortage of equipment primarily due to a lack of maintenance, and you will also see that the population is rightfully demanding an end to social confrontation and violence, while calling for true security that will improve life in Guatemala. 2. The Government Ministry, charged with providing internal security, has an insufficient budget, which has not been made effective for reasons already mentioned. The ministry's personnel are working hard but without proper training. Their morale has become weakened and jaded as the result of the distorted way in which some groups continue to deal with the value of general principles of human rights. A great deal of equipment has proved to be inadequate and obsolete. Please let me read the assessment made by myself and Col. Merida -- the other deputy minister who assumed office 17 days ago and who is with me today. This basic assessment made within the past few days, as I said, should show you what, in fact, the National Police are, and what they should be. Again, this is not the Government Ministry's sole concern, but something which, as I said a short while ago, can be viewed as a touchstone for the ministry. If the police force works -- in other words, if there is security -- the people tend to forget that the Government Ministry performs many other functions. Therefore, I will refer specifically to the current state of affairs within the National Police. Following a detailed review of all procedures, functions, members, equipment, and support, we wish to report on the current status of the National Police. A. Organization. The current organization of the National Police includes a number of departments and agencies that are broken down as follows: Directorate. The General Directorate is in charge of outlining policies and delegating responsibilities to all of the National Police's administrative agencies. This includes the director general and all of the organization's personnel. Currently, the Directorate is headed by Salvador Figueroa, an experienced lawyer. It is necessary to give you this explanation, because even historically the government minister is believed to be a [words indistinct] minister. You must remember, however, that procedures, instructions, reports, and [words indistinct] must be directed to the National Police Directorate. Of course, there is a deputy director, who is in charge of implementing all guidelines issued by the director. This position is held by Armando Orellana Flor, a systems engineer. The inspector general is the third in command. He is in charge of controlling and ensuring that the deputy director's guidelines are met. The person in charge of this is Inspector General Roberto Marroquin Rivas, a professional soldier. It is also necessary to point out that the police have a Joint Operations Center that is in charge of coordinating the activities of all agencies. It has a headquarters, a statistics section, a communications section, and a section.... [recording ends in mid-sentence]
