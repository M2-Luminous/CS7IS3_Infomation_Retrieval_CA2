"Ominnyon" told a news conference it would file the complaint with the Seoul district prosecutor's office Friday, adding that 321 victims of the May 18 civil uprising will be plaintiffs in the complaint. "We decided to file the complaint against the 35 people because we considered it impossible to achieve true democratization and harmony in the country, as well as cherish the spirit of the May 18 civil uprising, without eliminating those forces who want to dilute the spirit of the uprising to maintain their vested interests," said an organization spokesman. "The Kim Yong-sam government cannot achieve true reform unless it brings to light the true picture of the massacre during the uprising and takes judicial action against those responsible for the massacre," said the spokesman, criticizing a situation in which the victims themselves must take legal action. In the meantime, an organization of bereaved families of the uprising's victims said in a statement that the anniversary should become a national event, fostering a mood in which President Kim and government officials could visit Mangwoldong cemetery where those killed in the Kwangju civil uprising are buried.
