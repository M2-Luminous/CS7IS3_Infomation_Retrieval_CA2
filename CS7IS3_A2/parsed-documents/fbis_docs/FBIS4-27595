Since his inauguration, many have thought he would place more priority on "cabinet harmony" than on action, comparing him with his predecessor Yi Hoe-chang, who actively sought his share of the job as the second man in the administration. Yi is now making "quiet waves." He is meeting as many people as possible. As part of this, he met low-ranking government officials over lunch about a week ago. And yesterday, he held a meeting to discuss ways to restore social dialogue in the wake of shocking murder of a mother and father by their son. About a week ago, a millionaire Oriental medicine distributor and his wife were found stabbed and burnt to death at their home in southern Seoul. And to public shock, police announced Thursday that the murderer was their 23-year-old son. In a government effort to find the out causes of the social malady represented by the malicious and cold-blooded, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok held a meeting to discuss ways to restore social health. At the meeting, Prime Minister Yi stressed the need for preventive measures for the mental health of the younger generation, reminding the participants of the White House Conference on Youth and Education held 30 years ago in the United States. "There are lots of causes making our youths mentally ill. There are the hell-like college entrance examination, human relations ridden by morbid egoism, moral cynicism, and unlimited competition," said the former pedagogue. He analyzed that the murder was to be expected in a situation where deviation and pathological symptoms have already reached a dangerous point. "We must not hesitate any more. Efforts to heal the illness, however hard they may be, or even if they are nearly impossible, should be initiated right now," Yi emphasized. He called for the participants to pursue free discussion so that plans of what they should do and where they should begin to solve "the shocking problem" would emerge. "I think the solutions which will be found in the process of this meeting will require efforts of individuals, family, school and society, and especially the share of the efforts taken by the government will be much larger," Yi said.
