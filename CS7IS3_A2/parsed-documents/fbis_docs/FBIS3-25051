[De Klerk] I think, maybe because time is becoming of the essence, it is just possible that a form of accommodation and settlement can be reached. Even if it does not take place, then it is not impossible that Inkatha, as an active party with a sound organization, might still decide to take part. I really and sincerely hope so. That is what democracy is about, that is what parties should do. [Snow] Now there is already a residual level of violence in South Africa. Do you fear that if Inkatha does not take part that violence might inevitably escalate? [De Klerk] I think that there might be a definite risk of escalation, we will go out of our way firstly to prevent that and were it does occur, to handle it firmly so that there can be free and fair elections. [Snow] Now, what about the white right-wing. Can you be sure after the elections that the Armed Forces in particular, will respect the results and will not in any way rally to the cry of those on the white right who might want to wreck things? [De Klerk] Our Armed Forces have a very proud history of being apolitical, they, especially in terms of the new constitution, are safeguarded in that regard. We have excellent cooperation, for instance of the Army, with regard to the fusion of the Army and other so-called armed forces which fought against them for many years, and this fusion is taking place as planned and we have the cooperation of the Army. So therefore, while there might be individuals and while there might be quite a number of individuals in the Army and the police, the Conservative Party and the far right, I am convinced that discipline will be maintained and the basic loyalty of the forces to the state, as opposed to any party, can be and will be maintained. [Snow] Can I ask you now about the National Party's campaign itself. How do you persuade, particularly black and colored people, that the party which after all oppressed them over the past 50 years is suddenly going to work in their interests. [De Klerk] Well it is not really so difficult to persuade them to do that because they know that it was I, while Mr. Mandela was still in jail, who made the speech of 2 February 1990. They know that even before negotiations with the ANC [African National Congress] got off the ground we were still in the initial stages. I repealed all discriminatory legislation, the group areas act and all the other apartheid laws, and wherever I go I am engulfed with warmth and friendship from black South Africans, and they come up to me even if they are ANC in some instances, and shake my hand and say: We admire you. They are friendly toward me, they accept that the National Party is a newly National Party. Our congress today has proved it, my walkabouts proved it. [Snow] Let me just interrupt you there, because surely it would be fair to say that quite a lot of these rallies, as in many other countries, are very staged events. People say that large numbers of black people in particular, are shipped in to give the appearance of a much more multiracial party than really exists. [De Klerk] No, some of the meetings which I have, for instance when I do, as we call it, a road show. Yes people come to a prearranged venue, but much of it is absolutely spontaneous. I go, for instance, to a market place -- I walked into a vegetable market the other day, nobody expected me, there were no posters up, nothing, and I took a mike and I stood up and spoke, and there were up to 600 people. They all came to shake my hand and I had the chance to spread my message. It was not a put-up job at all. [Snow] What then is your realistic expectation of how you can come out of all this? What sort of percentage do you think you are going to get? [De Klerk] I am not quoting percentages, I am saying we are working and we are very serious about it. I say it as an old campaigner, it is achievable to get the biggest percentage of the vote. That does not mean getting more than 50 percent, it means getting the biggest percentage out of 100 of the vote -- that is first prize, we are working for that, and we truly believe that it is achievable. If we can gain some significant support from black South Africans, and by the day I am becoming more and more convinced that we can, we will be the biggest party in South Africa. [Snow] Mr. de Klerk are you in end the greatest pragmatist of the 20th century, or do you really believe it all? [De Klerk] I really believe it all, I am a realistic idealist. I do not walk with my head in the clouds, I have my feet firmly on the ground, but I am an optimist and I believe we can make South Africa a much better South Africa. I think we can unlock it's tremendous potential, and I think there is widespread enthusiasm for this vision of the future. [Snow] One is bound to ask somebody who grew up steeped in the apartheid idea, who then saw the need for change, whether even after this process, you will still find it easy to treat black politicians with absolute equality? [De Klerk] I have no problem whatsoever, I have been doing it for the past years. We opened our party's membership more than two years ago to all South Africans. I now have in my parliamentary caucus more people of color than white people and there is a wonderful spirit of unity at this congress of ours. Black and white took hands and spontaneously sang together. There is no racism left in the National Party and I have no inhibitions whatsoever in associating with them and calling them my partners, my colleagues, my brothers. [Snow] Mr. de Klerk, thank you for talking to us.
