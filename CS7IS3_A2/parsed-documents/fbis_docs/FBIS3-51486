Speaking Sunday at a special convention of his ruling People's Action Movement (PAM) which forms the government with the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), Simmonds said his administration would continue to promote economic development to make the twin island state a land of opportunity for all citizens. General elections last November 29 produced no clear winner but PAM which won four seats -- the same number as the main opposition St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- teamed up again with the NRP which won one seat to form the government for a fourth consecutive time. The Labour Party, which polled a higher percentage of votes than both partners in the coalition government, says PAM and NRP have no moral authority to govern and is continuing a campaign to force fresh elections. Simmonds told PAM supporters his government was "constitutionally, morally and properly constituted" to run the affairs of St Kitts-Nevis. "The opposition has the right to move a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly or demonstrate peacefully if they wish, but order must be maintained and the laws of the land will be respected," he added. For a no confidence vote to succeed, Labour would need the support of the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens Movement which won two seats in the November 29 poll, but turned down approaches from both PAM and NRP to form a coalition government. Simmonds said PAM was formed to unite the nation and erase what he said were the memories of victimization and suppression by the Labour Party when it was in government, especially against the people of Nevis. He said his government would not be intimidated by threats of violence.
