He added that he is also prepared to accept a devaluation of the dinar provided that practical measures are taken to help improve productivity and reduce the unemployment and inflation rates. During this meeting, Mr. Benhamouda also confirmed that 200,000 workers could be made redundant in the next two years. He added that a significant number of jobs would be made available in 1995, particularly in the sectors of public works, construction, irrigation, textiles, and food industries. This, he said, will reduce unemployment by a considerable extent. Regarding the efficiency of the unemployment fund, Mr. Benhamouda indicated that this resides in the possibility for redundant workers to receive social benefits, such as social and health security during the legal period, in addition to the unemployment benefit which could range between 2,000 and 5,000 dinars. This, he added, will reduce the deficit which the social security fund and the pension fund are complaining about. The UGTA secretary general also talked about the positive aspects of early retirement which would alleviate the burden caused by a surplus of workforce, and other burdens which are weighing down the enterprises. He added that the success of the early retirement scheme depends on the existence of a firm economic and investment policy which would provide the conditions for growth. Massoud Ramdani interviewed Abdelhak Benhamouda and asked him about the agreement recently signed with the government. [Begin Behamouda recording] We regarded the agreement signed on 17 January as a beginning for organizing future negotiation. For example, in the context of the 17 January agreement we said that we will not open the wages file. We agreed to the minimum because there must be stages and a gradual progress. If we do not define a secure minimum national level for wages, we will not be able to open the wages file. [passage omitted] We have agreed on the issue of an unemployment fund but we have not yet finalized it. The same applies to an early retirement fund. We have also talked about a national fund for social services. We have agreed on all these issues but we have not agreed on the details. [end recording]
