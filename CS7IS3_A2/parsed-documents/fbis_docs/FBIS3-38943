The KKE Political Bureau also demands the immediate convening of the Chamber of Deputies to debate the situation. KKE's assessment is that military intervention has been in preparation for a long time and it holds the government responsible for putting its signature on the latest decision by the European Union's foreign ministers, which it describes as criminal.
