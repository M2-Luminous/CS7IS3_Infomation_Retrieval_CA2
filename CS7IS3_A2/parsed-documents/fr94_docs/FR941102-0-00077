FR941102-0-00077 FR941102-0-00021 NHTSA's decision not to adopt the cumulative haze provision should allay industry concerns regarding the lack of test data to continue recertifying existing designs using covered reflex reflectors, but it may have the effect of necessitating an optical coating on any polycarbonate reflex reflectors which previously relied on an outer lens to prevent the formation of visible haze. The SAE haze task force had also considered applying the 7 percent haze limit to plastic headlamp lenses as well as reflex reflectors, but it decided that more work was required to define the safety needs of headlamps. The revision of SAE J576 left the headlamp lens requirement unchanged from previous versions. It states that ``plastic material used for forward road illumination devices, excluding cornering lamps, shall show no deterioration.'' It is not clear whether that specification is meant to be more restrictive than the 7 percent haze limit for reflectors, but it has the same effect in practice as the visual inspection requirement had for reflex reflectors. NHTSA notes that in Standard No. 108, plastic lenses of replaceable bulb headlamps are subject to an abrasion resistance test, and that most, if not all, lenses must be given an abrasion resistant coating to meet it. It has been the agency's assumption that the hard coating would also protect headlamps lenses against excessive haze. Standard No. 108 does not require the abrasion test for plastic sealed beam headlamps, but NHTSA believes that it is industry practice to coat plastic sealed beam lamps. To pursue the subject of haze limitations for headlamp lens material, NHTSA requested that commenters address five specific issues. Ford was the sole commenter on the first four issues. These issues and Ford's comments follow: (1) Whether there are any replaceable bulb headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating to achieve abrasion resistance. Ford's headlamps of this type all employ a hard coating. (2) Whether all abrasion resistant coatings also prevent the formation of more than 7 percent haze on samples of plastics used in headlamp lenses which are subjected to the 3-year test. In Ford's experience, coatings prevent formation of haze that exceeds 7 percent. (3) Whether there are any sealed beam headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating for either haze or abrasion resistance. Ford used headlamps of this type in two model lines for one model year each a decade and a half ago. The lamps used an acrylic coating to prevent yellowing of the polycarbonate lens.
