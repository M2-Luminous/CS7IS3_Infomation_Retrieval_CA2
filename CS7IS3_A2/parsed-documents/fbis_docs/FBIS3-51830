This accord may be finalized within two months. [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe that it will be completed before the year is over. We expect to complete this accord in a couple of months. We are aware that Cuba does not have a drug problem on the scale of Argentina's but we believe it will be useful since the world is growing smaller; international tourism brings both advantages and disadvantages. The accord is a contribution we will like to fulfill. [end recording] Cuba has signed similar agreements with 21 countries and the accord with the Argentine Presidency Secretariat for Drug Addiction Prevention and Fight Against Drug Trafficking is another effort of the Cuban Government to join international programs against drugs.
