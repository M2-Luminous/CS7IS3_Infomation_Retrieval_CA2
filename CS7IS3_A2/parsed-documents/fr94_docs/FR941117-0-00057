FR941117-0-00057 FR941117-0-00010 The waivers were issued to these drivers following an individual determination of each driver's capability to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safely. This individual determination consisted of a review of each individual's vital statistics, employment history, status of driving privilege as recorded on the licensing State's MVR and the license status for the past three years, and expert medical opinion by an ophthalmologist or optometrist attesting to the visual acuity of each driver and its effect on his or her ability to perform the driving task safely. Once a driver was granted a waiver, he or she was, and is, required to submit monthly driving reports and be examined annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist and submit the results of that examination to the FHWA. Failure to report timely as required will result in the initiation of a process to revoke the waiver. Moreover, the FHWA's contractor periodically verifies the waived drivers reported accidents and citations through each driver's State motor vehicle record (MVR). Medical reports are also verified. The drivers holding waivers from the Federal vision standards, as is true of all drivers in the general population, are not immune from State or Federal enforcement or licensing sanctions by virtue of their participation in the waiver study, and are subject to the penalty provisions of the commercial drivers' license regulations (49 CFR Part 383), State and local licensing sanctions, as well as the penalty provisions set forth as conditions of the waiver. In addition, the FHWA believes that the continued employment of individuals with proven safe driving records is in the public interest. The comments to the docket reflect several instances where companies employing waived drivers rely heavily upon their waived drivers because these drivers are consistently safe operators of CMVs. Permitting waived drivers to continue operating in interstate commerce is also consistent with the public interest policy of employing persons with disabilities, which is evidenced in both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Status of the Study The agency believes that the observations made by the Advocates, the ATA, the IIHS and others regarding flaws in the current research method have merit. In addition, several experts reviewed the studies and data upon which the FHWA based its ``consistent with safety'' determination and were unanimous in finding (1) the waived drivers as a group would be expected to perform as well as or better than a group of equal size drawn at random from the general truck driving population because of the preselection criteria and conditions; and (2) the data developed by the study will never answer the question as to what the standards should be. Consequently, the FHWA has decided to develop and implement, with the input of these commenters and others, a new research method that will address the concerns of these commenters. The FHWA will undertake comprehensive research to develop parameters for performance-based visual standards for all commercial drivers. The agency anticipates that any new vision standards will consider at least three critical aspects of visual performance: static acuity, dynamic acuity, and useful field of view. The vision standard found at 49 CFR §391.41(b)(10) will remain in effect until the completion of this research and the implementation of any new standard. The agency's ultimate goal is to adopt driver physical qualification standards that are performance-based; that is, they will reflect the actual physical requirements that fosters safe operation of commercial vehicles. Development of standards will begin with an analysis of the existing body of knowledge, including knowledge gained from this project when completed, and from analogous applications of visual standards in other environments (e.g., Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Aeronautical and Space Administration). The final standards will be developed in careful consideration of the practical constraints of driver vision testing, cost, examiner training, testing time, and requirements for development of new testing equipment, all of which will be balanced against projected safety improvements. The FHWA will proceed within the following framework: •FHWA will develop a sound methodology, based on accepted experimental and statistical practices, for developing visual standards. •The development process will include consideration of the collected accident experience of commercial vehicle operators, including the drivers holding vision waivers. •Before a final method and design for developing standards is determined, FHWA will announce its proposed method and design for discussion at a public meeting to be held in the Spring of 1995. The proposed method will be open to public scrutiny. The final methodology will be published in the Federal Register . •The FHWA will announce the results of the study, the proposed standards and a proposed plan for implementing the standards at the completion of this study. Public Hearing on Vision Standard and Waiver Program As mentioned earlier, the FHWA intends to announce its proposed revisions to the research method at a public hearing to be held in Spring 1995. The FHWA is eager to gain a broader perspective of the public's viewpoint concerning other studies, data and experiences which will enhance the agency's knowledge on the subject of a performance-based vision standard. The FHWA is also interested in sharing its data with other researchers and agencies which may undertake useful analyses and initiate studies leading to new approaches in establishing future physical qualification standards, standards that are both necessary and valid to increasing opportunities in the truck-driving profession while ensuring that society's high expectations of CMV safety are realized. Notice of the hearing will be published in the Federal Register and will contain further questions to which the agency seeks responses, as well as directions on how to obtain information about the data collected during the vision waiver study. Conclusion Based upon the comments to the docket and the empirical evidence gathered to date, the FHWA will allow those drivers currently holding waivers from the Federal vision standard to continue to operate in interstate commerce until March 31, 1996. This permission is conditioned upon each driver's continued compliance with the reporting requirements outlined in the Federal Register on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31458) and again on October 6, 1994 (59 FR 50887) and such further conditions and monitoring as may be imposed by the FHWA in the interest of safety. Waived drivers also remain subject to State or Federal enforcement or licensing sanctions. Additionally, the FHWA will concurrently undertake research to develop comprehensive, performance-based visual standards for all commercial drivers. This proposed analysis and research method will be presented at a public hearing to be held in Spring 1995, and the public will be invited to comment on the research method. And finally, the FHWA, within the next 60 days, will complete a review of the performance data on the waived drivers to develop criteria which will form the basis for further conditions which will be imposed directly on the waiver holders and will further reduce the safety risks to these drivers and highway users.
