The government also resolved to continue to cooperate closely with the United States and the rest of the world community in the effort to rectify North Korea's violation of the denuclearization declaration. At a unification and national security policy coordination meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, the government decided to continue to maintain the existing policy of linking inter-Korean economic cooperation to the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question. A Unification Board official said that the meeting, however, decided to make flexible conditions for such linkage depending on the attitude of North Korea. He said attendees shared the view that it is not proper to discuss the issue of reconsidering the denuclearization declaration at the present stage. Regarding North Korea's demand for the replacement of the existing military armistice agreement, the meeting reaffirmed the government policy that such a replacement should be discussed between the two Koreas once confience-building is fostered in the areas of politics and military between the two sides. "Attending officials affirmed that the linkage of economic cooperation to the nuclear issue cannot be withdrawn," said Kim Hyong-ki, spokesman for the National Unification Board. The attendees also expressed concern about a situation in which North Korea may refuse to provide nuclear transparency, challenging South Korea's efforts to abide by the denuclearization declaration, Kim added.
