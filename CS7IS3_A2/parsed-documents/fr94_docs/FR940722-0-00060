FR940722-0-00060 FR940722-0-00014 The commission may waive the reimbursement obligation under the conditions described in [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1) (b) and (c)] if it finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. The State regulations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1) (b) and (c) describe the following two situations that can trigger an applicant's obligation for reimbursement of the cost of SOAP assistance: b. The applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after receiving the approved report from the qualified public or private entity [performing SOAP services]. c. The applicant fails to mine after obtaining a permit. Thus, under the State proposal, the commission may allow a ``good-faith waiver'' of a SOAP applicant's reimbursement obligation only if the applicant's obligation was triggered by the situations described at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1) (b) or (c). No such good-faith waiver is allowed if the applicant's reimbursement obligation was triggered by something other than those specified situations. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b) allows the program administrator [regulatory authority] to waive the reimbursement obligation if he or she finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. Since waiver of the applicant's reimbursement obligation is a matter left within the discretion of the State regulatory authority under the current Federal regulations, North Dakota's proposed change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) is not inconsistent with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b). Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed rule. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments 1. Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, no hearing was held. 2. Federal Agency Comments Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on North Dakota's proposed amendment from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the North Dakota program. By letter dated November 10, 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation stated it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;04). By letter dated November 16, 1993, the Soil Conservation Service stated it had no specific comments pertaining to this amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;06). By letter dated November 19, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that the amendment did not conflict with any of MSHA's current regulations (30 CFR parts 0&hyph;199), and therefore, it had no comments concerning the proposed changes (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;07). By undated letter received November 29, 1993, the Bureau of Indian Affairs stated it had no objections to the proposed amendment because it did not affect Indian lands (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;09). By letter dated November 30, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;10). By letter dated December 1, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it did not anticipate any significant impacts to fish and wildlife resources as a result of the proposed amendment and, therefore, did not have any substantive comments to offer (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;11). 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). None of the revisions that North Dakota proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. However, OSM still requested EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;03). By letter dated November 10, 1993, EPA responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. EPA also stated it did not believe that there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;05). 4.
