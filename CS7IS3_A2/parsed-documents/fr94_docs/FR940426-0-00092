FR940426-0-00092 FR940426-0-00020 Applicability of AAFs to Various Section 8 Programs AAFs established by this Notice are used to adjust Contract Rents for section 8 program units. The following provides a general description of how AAFs apply under the several section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs. The specific application of the AAFs should be determined by reference to the HAP Contract and to appropriate program regulations or requirements. In certain cases, AAFs are not used to adjust Contract Rents. AAFs are not used for the section 8 Voucher program. In addition, AAFs are not used for section 8 Certificate program units subject to 24 CFR 882.110(d), which applies to units in certain otherwise subsidized projects that are rented to section 8 Certificate program families. (The housing assistance payment for such a unit is equal to the difference between the subsidized rent and the rent payable by the eligible family. Adjustments to the subsidized rents are made in accordance with rules and procedures governing the particular subsidized housing program involved.) In addition, AAFs are not used for units placed under HAP contract in recent years under the section 202/section 8 program. Instead, those rents are based on a HUD-approved budget for the project. Contract Rents for many projects receiving section 8 subsidies under the Loan Management provisions of 24 CFR part 886, subpart A, and for projects receiving section 8 subsidies under the Property Disposition provisions of 24 CFR part 886, subpart C, are adjusted, at HUD's option, either by applying the AAFs or by adjusting rents in accordance with 24 CFR 207.19(e). Under the section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, the public housing agency (PHA) should use the base rent, not the Contract Rent, to select the correct AAF to apply to the base rent. AAF Areas This year's AAF areas incorporate the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) revised definitions of metropolitan areas. OMB released revised definitions based on 1990 Census data, effective as of December 31, 1992 and further modified on June 30, 1993 (OMB Bulletins Nos. 93&hyph;05 and 93&hyph;17). Last year, HUD announced in the January 13, 1993 publication of AAFs that the OMB definitions were being evaluated to determine their use in the next round of published AAFs. HUD conducted this evaluation in conjunction with the FY 1994 section 8 Existing Program Fair Market Rent (FMR) cycle, and, with the few exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs, accepted the OMB definitions. The HUD exceptions for AAF purposes are for six large metropolitan areas, where HUD considers the area covered by the revised OMB definitions to be larger than appropriate for use as a housing market area definition. HUD therefore modified the definitions for these areas by deleting some of the counties that OMB had added to its revised definitions. The following counties are deleted from the HUD definitions of AAF areas: ‚ê£ 1Metropolitan area 1Deleted counties Atlanta, GA Carroll, Pickens, Spalding, and Walton Counties. Chicago, IL DeKalb, Grundy and Kendall Counties. Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH&hyph;KY&hyph;IN Brown County, Ohio; Gallatin, Grant and Pendleton Counties in Kentucky; and Ohio County, Indiana. Dallas, TX Henderson County. New Orleans, LA St. James Parish. Washington, DC Berkeley and Jefferson Counties in West Virginia; and Clarke, Culpeper, King George and Warren counties in Virginia. Separate AAF schedules are listed in this publication for the above counties and are identified with an asterisk (*) next to the area name. The asterisk denotes that there is a difference between the OMB metropolitan area and the HUD AAF area definitions for these areas. Each AAF applies to a specified geographical area and to units of all bedroom sizes. AAFs are provided for the metropolitan parts (exclusive of CPI areas) and the nonmetropolitan parts of the ten HUD Regions. AAFs, developed from local CPI surveys, are provided for 103 separate areas. Program participants should refer to the Area Definitions at the end of Schedule C to make certain that they are using the correct AAFs. Units located in metropolitan areas with a local CPI survey must use the corresponding AAFs listed separately for those metropolitan areas. Units that are located in metropolitan areas without a local CPI survey must use the appropriate HUD Region Metropolitan AAFs. Units located in nonmetropolitan counties must use the appropriate HUD Region Nonmetropolitan AAFs. The AAF Area Definitions shown in Schedule C are listed in alphabetical order by State. The associated HUD Region is shown next to each State name. Within each State, areas whose AAFs are determined by local CPI surveys are listed first. All CPI defined areas have separate AAF schedules and are shown with their corresponding county definitions or as metropolitan counties. Listed after the CPI defined areas (in those states that have such areas) are the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties of each State. In the six New England states, the listings are for counties or parts of counties as defined by towns or cities. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands use the HUD Region IV AAFs. All areas in Hawaii use the AAF schedule for Hawaii, which is based on the CPI survey for the Honolulu metropolitan area. The Pacific Islands use the HUD Region IX Nonmetropolitan AAFs. The Anchorage metropolitan area has its own AAFs based on a local CPI survey; all other areas in Alaska use the HUD Region X Nonmetropolitan AAFs.
