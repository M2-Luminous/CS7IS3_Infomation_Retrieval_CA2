The BP chief executive, David Simon, said yesterday that under its new leadership British Gas was more open to new ideas, including joint investment in new ventures. He said the gas company had excellent pipeline technology which would fit well with BP's exploration expertise. "It's high time we worked together." He added that he knew the British Gas chairman Sir Richard Giordano well, because they were both members of the Grand Metropolitan board. Mr Simon was commenting after announcing a surprise leap in profits and a shock dividend increase for the first quarter of the year. On the normal historic cost basis, pre-tax profits fell from 700 million pounds in the first quarter last year to 577 million pounds. But this was due to losses on oil stocks because of the fall in oil prices. On a replacement cost basis excluding these stock factors, the operating profits rose from 585 million pounds to 601 million pounds. Lower interest costs following the heavy debt reduction programme also helped to stimulate cash flows, which showed a net inflow of 461 million pounds, including more than 100 million pounds from selling businesses. Encouraged by the recovery in profits and cash flows despite the low oil price, the BP board decided to increase the dividend for the first time since it was cut dramatically in the summer of 1992. A 20 per cent increase pleased investors, and the company's share price rose by 16.5p [pence] during the day. Mr Simon was keen to stress that this rate of increase could not be expected in future quarters, however. "It has been an encouraging quarter," he said. He denied that BP had been under pressure from shareholding institutions to increase the dividend. BP's surprisingly buoyant results were due to a spectacular leap in profits from its UK operations, due partly to higher production of gas from the company's UK fields. UK profits, on the replacement cost basis, soared from 105 million pounds in the first quarter of last year, to 306 mi11ion pounds this time. Most of this profit came from oil and gas production, but UK refining and marketing moved from a small loss to profit of 41 pounds million. The chemical operations reversed a 19 million loss to a profit of the same amount. U.S. production profit slumped because of maintenance work on Alaskan wells, but U.S. refining and marketing moved into profit.
