FR940830-0-00033 FR940830-0-00006 The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 4 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission. 4 Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of Section 110(a)(2). To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Libby, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held a public hearing on November 15, 1991, to address the local air pollution control program and the Libby SIP. Following the public hearing, the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM 10 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the SIP to EPA on November 25, 1991. The SIP submittal was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated April 29, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. Due to EPA comments regarding PM 10 SIPs for other Montana nonattainment areas, the State included commitments with the November 25, 1991, Libby submittal to address statewide deficiencies (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test methods, and an operating permit program), along with Libby-specific commitments regarding revising the attainment and maintenance demonstrations to properly handle background concentrations and to correct wood-burning program calculations, clarifying that the state emergency episode plan applies in Libby, and adopting contingency measures. In an October 7, 1992, letter from Doug Skie, EPA to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA notified the State that its commitments would need to be taken through the public hearing process, which would delay EPA's approvability determination. The State held a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and resubmitted the commitments as an official Governor's submittal in a letter dated January 13, 1993. On March 19, 1993, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held a public hearing to entertain public comment on revisions to the Libby PM 10 SIP to satisfy several of the Governor's commitments, as discussed above. Following the public hearing, the revisions to the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM 10 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the revised SIP to EPA on May 24, 1993. This submittal was deemed to be complete six months later on November 24, 1993. The Acting Administrator of EPA Region VIII sent a letter to the Governor on January 4, 1994, documenting that the submittal was deemed to be complete, and that EPA did review the May 24, 1993, Libby PM 10 SIP submittal and found that it met the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The Governor's submittal letter stated that this new submittal should replace the November 25, 1991, SIP submittal. Subsequently, the State has fulfilled all remaining Governor's commitments. EPA is preparing separate actions on submittals addressing the statewide commitments (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test methods, and an operating permit program). A detailed description of the Libby commitments is contained in the TSD for this action. In this final rule action, EPA is announcing its approval of the revised Montana PM 10 SIP submittal for Libby, as dated May 24, 1993 with final technical corrections dated June 3, 1994, with the exception of the contingency measures (which EPA will address separately). 2. Accurate Emission Inventory Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539). Libby's base year emissions inventory was developed for October 31, 1987, through November 30, 1988. The results were as follows. Annually, area sources account for 70.8% of the PM 10 emissions, with re-entrained road dust the largest contributor at 62.4%. Residential wood burning, another area source, accounts for 7.6% of the PM 10 emissions in the Libby area. The Stimson Lumber Company 5 sawmill and plywood plant is the largest point source, contributing 29.2% of the Libby area emissions. Two-thirds of its contribution is attributable to fugitive dust. 5 Formerly Champion International. The facility was sold and renamed Stimson Lumber Company in early 1994, after the State submitted this SIP revision for the Libby, MT, PM 10 nonattainment area. All existing permits relating to the facility remain in effect.
