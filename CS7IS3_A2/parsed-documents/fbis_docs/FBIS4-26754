Since the beginning of this year, the financial system has resolutely implemented the principle for the financial work of "continuing the consolidation of the financial order, steadily pushing forward the financial reform, strictly controlling the total volume of credit, and earnestly strengthening supervision over finances" put forward by the State Council. How has the financial situation been over the past few months? What progress has been made in financial structure reform? A few days ago, our staff reporters interviewed Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China, on these issues. [Reporter] People from all circles of society are very concerned about financial operations. Will you please give us an account of the current financial situation? [Zhou] On the whole, the current economic and financial situation is continuing to develop in a favorable direction, and the financial situation is stable and healthy. This is manifested in the following aspects: First, currency continues to be withdrawn from circulation. From January to April, a net total of 5.07 billion yuan of cash was withdrawn, while a net total of over 30 billion yuan was put into circulation in the same period last year. The withdrawal of currency from circulation was mainly attributed to the increase in bank savings and the good situation in the sale of state treasury bonds. Second, bank deposits have increased by a relatively large margin. In the first four months, various kinds of bank deposits at state banks increased by more than 260 billion yuan, over 110 billion yuan more than the same period last year, of which deposits of enterprises increased by 100 billion yuan. The payment ability of enterprises has further increased, and their funding difficulties have been eased further. Third, loans granted by state banks have greatly increased. This has effectively met the funding needs for industrial production enterprises and key state construction projects. From January to April, the amount of loans granted by state banks increased by more than 75 billion yuan, 20 billion yuan over the same period last year, of which loans to provide working funds for industry increased by nearly 10 billion yuan. According to statistics from the People's Construction Bank of China, by the end of April, loans for key state construction projects accounted for 63.4 percent of the total in plans for loans already issued. Funds for key construction projects were delivered in good time. Fourth, the payment ability of state banks has increased. Fifth, the sales of state treasury bonds have progressed smoothly. By 28 May, 64.8 billion yuan of state treasury bonds had been sold (of which three-year bonds accounted for 41.8 billion yuan and two-year bonds accounted for 23 billion yuan). Some provinces have fulfilled the sales plans assigned them. Sixth, the reform of the foreign exchange structure has been carried out smoothly. The exchange rate of the renminbi has basically been stable at a ratio of about $1 to 8.6 yuan. The operation of foreign exchange business among banks is normal, and the state's foreign exchange reserve has increased considerably. [Reporter] In the beginning of this year, the reform of the economic structure in our country had already gotten started in the areas of finance, banking, foreign exchange, foreign trade, investment, and the enterprise system. Please tell us about the progress of financial structure reform. [Zhou] As is known to all, in accordance with the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the implementation of the plans for reforming the financial structure and for reforming the foreign exchange management structure officially began at the beginning of the year. Various quarters have reacted favorably to the new measures for reforming the financial structure since their implementation. To ensure the smooth implementation of measures to reform the financial structure, the People's Bank of China has, with the approval of the State Council, formulated and promulgated a series of new management methods and rules, such as the "Interim Methods for the Management of Credit funds," "Interim Monitoring and Control Indexes for the Management of Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks," "Interim Rules on the Capital and Assets Insurance Weight of Commercial Bank," "Interim Rules on Settlement, Sales, and Payment of Foreign Exchange," and so on. The State Development Bank and the China Import and Export Bank have officially been organized and established, and preparations for the establishment of the China Agricultural Development Bank are in full swing. This is one step toward separating financial business of a policy nature from that of a commercial nature and is of great importance to guiding the orientation of the input of society's funds, to implementing the state industrial policy, and to the rational distribution of economic resources. Besides, to improve macroeconomic financial regulation and control, we have set up a central bank open market trading office in Shanghai, and, in order to coordinate with the reform of the foreign exchange structure, we have set up the China foreign exchange trading center. At present, various branches of the People's Bank of China are, in accordance with the arrangements of the headquarters of the bank, further strengthening their functions and roles in "financial supervision and management, investigation, statistics, and analysis, horizontal money supply regulation, management of state treasury, procurement and allocation of funds, foreign exchange management, and settlement among banks," and are shifting their emphasis from the division of funds and the division of scale to doing a good job in macroeconomic regulation and control, strengthening financial supervision and management, and conducting investigation and study. On the whole, various financial reform measures are being energetically and steadily implemented. In the course of steadily pushing forward financial reform, we have attached great importance to drawing from the experience and lessons of similar efforts in the past. While making clear and adhering to the orientation of market reform, we have put special emphasis on always proceeding from reality, paying attention to coordinating financial reform with the progress of reform in other aspects, and adopting steady progress as the reform strategy. Practice over the past few months has proved that we are on the right track. The smooth progress of reform in various aspects has also confirmed this. [Reporter] The summer harvest has begun. What policies and measures have the banks adopted to ensure sufficient funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products this summer? [Zhou] In recent years, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed that banks should ensure the supply of funds for the procurement of grain, cotton, edible oils, and other agricultural and sideline products and that "IOU" notes should never be given to peasants. To ensure that sufficient funds for procurement will be available at the right time this year, the People's Bank of China, along with various special banks, has energetically organized investigation and study in April and has made concrete arrangements for the supply and management of funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products this summer. We have primarily adopted the following measures: 1) Continue to implement the responsibility system of raising funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products through various channels under the unified leadership of governments at various levels. Various banks are being asked to cooperate closely with local financial departments, procurement enterprises, and other departments concerned to seriously ensure that various kinds of funds are available. 2) Continue to implement methods for the management of special accounts of funds for the procurement and sale of major agricultural and sideline products. Loans earmarked for procurement can only be used for procurement, and misappropriation of such loans is prohibited. In view of the establishment of the branches of the Agricultural Development Bank this year and in order to avoid affecting the summer harvest, we have made concrete arrangements in the division of work and responsibility. The general principle is that institutional reform should never be allowed to affect the supply of funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. 3) Energetically give play to the supervisory role of banks. The departments concerned should be urged to have funds for procurement available at the right time. Regarding procurement enterprises which have misappropriated procurement loans, banks should withdraw the loans and should ask them to pay, as a fine, interest for the loans misappropriated. 4) Demand that all banks at various levels adopt effective measures to strengthen the procurement, allocation, and regulation of funds to ensure the supply of funds for procurement and try every possible means to overcome difficulty of funds in the course of procuring agricultural and sideline products. [Reporter] At present, some state enterprises have encountered some difficulties. How do you look at this issue? What policies and measures will the banks adopt toward it? [Zhou] We have organized various banks to coordinate with the departments concerned to conduct an investigation into the current difficulties of state enterprises. Viewed from the situation reflected in the investigation, the number of state enterprises that have stopped production or are running at half-capacity is still small, and they are mainly small and medium enterprises. However, from January to April, the profits of state enterprises increased instead of decreasing, and their losses decreased instead of increasing. The growth rate of production in state industrial enterprises rose from 2.2 percent in the first quarter to 5 percent in April. The causes of difficulties encountered by some state enterprises are many. For example: the excessive growth of investment in fixed assets, the failure to raise funds, and the misappropriation of working funds; the serious phenomenon of delay in the payment of debts among enterprises; and the excessive production capacity of some trades, the improper internal management of enterprises, the products that could not be sold, and the increase in idle funds used to stockpile products. These problems cannot be solved merely by increasing the money supply or increasing loans from the banks. To fundamentally solve the problems, enterprises can only take the road of "deepening reform, transforming mechanisms, making efforts to improve internal management, and increasing economic results." On the whole, the national economy is still growing at a relatively high speed, and the economy and finances are developing in a favorable direction. However, the pressure of inflation has not yet been fundamentally eliminated. Therefore, the financial departments should continue to implement the principle of exercising strict control over the total credit volume formulated by the State Council, and in particular, over loans for fixed assets. They should never increase the scale of loans fixed by the state. They should continue to consolidate the financial order, should resolutely stop arbitrary fund-raising activities, borrowing money, increasing interest, or setting up financial organs, and should put a halt to operations that go beyond their business scope. They should earnestly strengthen financial supervision and management. In the second half of this year, they also should make special arrangements for consolidating the settlement order, strictly enforce discipline in settlement, and solve problems of putting bills and notes aside and misappropriating or retaining customers' funds. Regarding the current difficulties of some state enterprises, banks have adopted some policies and measures in accordance with the arrangements made by the State Council: Loans should be granted in good time to all state enterprises whose products can actually be sold and which can produce good economic results, and banks should energetically support and help money-losing enterprises which have reduced their losses or have started making profits. For those state enterprises that have stopped production and are having difficulty paying wages to their workers and staff members, banks should coordinate with the local governments and grant some loans to solve their actual difficulty on the condition of giving play to the role of the social security system. Besides, local governments or departments in charge of these enterprises should pay the appropriate interest and help such enterprises resume production and overcome their difficulties. Regrading enterprises which have no hope to stop losing money and whose assets cannot be used for a mortgage, preparation should be earnestly carried out for declaring them bankrupt according to law by stages and in groups. Experiments should first be carried out before this practice is made widespread. The tasks of macroeconomic financial regulation and control are still heavy. To do a good job in financial work, we have demanded that leaders at all levels of the financial system go deep into the grass-roots units, pay close attention to changes in the local economy and finance, report on the situation in good time, and put forward methods and suggestions for strengthening and improving macroeconomic financial regulation and control. I believe that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and with the concerted efforts of the entire financial system, the tasks in the financial work for the whole year will certainly be successfully fulfilled.
