Worries about Russia's relations with the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics took center stage at a two-day meeting on strategic and military issues where William Perry made his international debut as U.S. defense secretary. Perry sat between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the German Defense Minister, Volker Ruehe, at the gathering of defense ministers, politicians, officers and defense experts, which he was to address Sunday. Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, was quoted last month as saying Russia should keep troops in former Soviet republics to protect its vital interests. Many people worry that the Russian Government, under pressure from ultranationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, could start bullying the new countries of the former Soviet bloc to get its way. William S. Cohen, a Republican senator from Maine, thinks this is starting to happen already. "We have to keep a very close eye on what the Russian military is up to," Cohen said. "They have been engaged in a protectionist racket by bringing governments to their knees and rushing in with aid, provided they join the Commonwealth of Independent states, which is under the protection of Russia," Cohen said. Malcolm Rifkind, the British defense secretary, said NATO's immediate priority must be to agree on a strategy for dealing with any attempt by Russia to "regain hegemony" in areas of the former Soviet Union. "One not only hears from the Zhirinovskiys" the demand for greater Russian influence, he said. "One hears it also from those who speak in much more measured tones." Kozyrev has "made speeches of that kind," Rifkind said. Kohl said the West must avoid doing anything that would make Russia feel internationally isolated, since that could jeopardize efforts by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to make greater strides in democratic and economic reforms. He said Yeltsin had written him recently to assure that he "will not listen" to those who call for renewed Russian expansionism. But it's unclear whether Yeltsin can withstand nationalist pressures, Kohl indicated. He cautioned Russia not to act aggressively against the former Soviet republics: "We expect Russia to continue a foreign policy marked by constructive participation in solving international problems." The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, issued a blunter statement in a speech Friday night in Bonn. He demanded Russia respect its borders and said the Russians could expect a cutoff of aid if they stopped economic reforms. Kinkel demanded the full pullout of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia by the end of August and upbraided Russian leaders for using the term "near abroad" to describe the former Soviet republics. "It implies an inferior status for Russia's neighbors that is not acceptable," Kinkel said. The term is commonly used by Russian politicians and newspapers. Kinkel said the resignations of Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov last month "threaten to destroy trust" in Russia's economic future, as reflected in large-scale capital flight. "If Russia's economic policy can't even keep Russian capital in the country, how can Russia expect inflows of foreign capital?" Kinkel said. Germany has provided 90 billion marks (about dlrs 52 billion) over the past five years to Russia, more than half of all Western contributions. "There won't be more money for less reform," he said.
