The political and economic results of the Second World War effectively put democratic development in the states of Central and Eastern Europe on hold. Now is the time to give democracy a renewed push in the right direction by dealing in a practical way with border and minorities issues. We share the view of the European Union that it is better to open these questions for discussion, to talk through the difficulties and reach practical solutions rather than to ignore the problems or worse, to suppress their existence. For this reason, we welcome the Pact on Stability in Europe as a way to resolve the problems at hand. We believe this Pact is a tool through which we can implement the principles upon which the Council of Europe and the CSCE are founded, a process which, ultimately, will enhance stability on the continent. Mr. Chairman, when the Pact for Stability was first introduced, we were eager to use it as a means to reach a final consensus on our own border question. As you know, the Russian Federation does not recognize the Tartu Peace Treaty which is so far actually the only international treaty constituting the border between our two countries. In the course of negotiations over the text of the Pact, the formulation used in referring to border questions has evolved considerably. If in the beginning we spoke of the consolidation of borders, then today we are approaching the question on the basis, and I quote from Pact, "of inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity and respect of existing borders, according to the principles of the Helsinki Final to be seen as a whole" (end of quote). Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I request the participating states to note that Estonia regards existing borders to be those fixed by international treaties concluded between states. I would further ask you to note that borders fixed by international treaties can only be changed by other international treaties which supersede the previous ones. Under the terms of the Helsinki Final Act, borders are considered inviolable but they may be changed, and I quote, "in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement" (end of quote). It is exactly this peaceful and law-based approach to resolving border questions that we have sought to operationalize within the Pact for Stability. We recognize that a problem exists, and we want to solve it. But discussion is necessary in order to create the conditions for resolution. Unfortunately, some states have taken an unconstructive approach to this question, thus far refusing to talk about the matter with us, either within the framework of the Pact or in other fora. We remain hopeful that in the interest of stability, the other interested party will eventually come to the table and agree to talk with the European Union and with us about the problem. The second basket of the Pact concerns minorities. I am happy to report that the question of minorities has found a liberal solution in Estonia, in keeping with the civic traditions of our society. Last autumn, our parliament passed a law on Cultural Autonomy, which was based on our 1925 law providing national minorities numbering at least three thousand persons with state support for schooling and churches in their mother tongue as well as cultural self-governments legally equivalent to local governments. The CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, Mr. Max van der Stoel, made a point last summer of praising this law as an example for other states in protecting minority rights. But we have not stopped there. A bilateral agreement is ready to be signed with Belarus extending our Law on Cultural Autonomy to Belarusians who live in Estonia but are not numerous enough to qualify as a national minority group. There is one more issue in this basket worth noting. As we all are aware, a myriad of other problems stem from the resettlement of peoples for political reasons by the Soviet central authorities during the annexation of Estonia. Here, the key issue is to integrate into society people who may never decide to opt for Estonian citizenship. For this reason, we have decided to treat questions of integration separately and parallel to minority issues within the Pact for Stability. Central elements here include practical assistance in processing applications, language training, information exchange and matters of education. I think all parties should be interested in resolving these practical problems that are key to enhancing stability in our corner of the world. Finally, I would say a few words about the round-tables which, alongside continuing bilateral negotiations, are intended to be the actual instruments through which to attain the goals of the Pact. From the start of talks on this Pact, we have lobbied to establish a concrete Baltic round-table, to follow the lines of the Council of Baltic Sea States and to be supplemented by other interested states. We saw the idea of a Baltic round-table as an innovative and creative way of fleshing out the general round-table idea. Through greater regional specificity, we believed the Baltic round-table would have a more focused approach that would lead to more effective and concrete solutions. I do not wish to reiterate--knowing well that the Pact does not directly deal with military and security issues--but I would not be honest if I did not call your attention to the fact that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994 would be essential for maintaining stability and democracy in the region. Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude my remarks by thanking French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur for having initiated the idea of this Pact. I also wish to thank the European Union for having taken an active interest and a leading role in resolving the delicate questions of the day. Estonia remains hopeful that the intervention of the Union, alongside other European institutions, in particular the Council of Europe and the CSCE, will, in fact, lead to enhanced stability on our continent. Thank you.
