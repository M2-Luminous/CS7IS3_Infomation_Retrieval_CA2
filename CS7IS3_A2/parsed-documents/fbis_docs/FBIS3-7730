In a statement to the Kragujevac radio, Jovanovic warned that a strategy of forming an alliance between the two Bosnian peoples against the third (Bosnian Serbs) would lead to further escalation of the crisis and the continuation of war. The Yugoslav foreign minister lent support to any effort towards narrowing differences between any of two peoples in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, except those motived by the formation of alliance against a third people. Jovanovic said he was confident that on the Croat side those forces interested in peace are stronger than those which would like to seek their chance in some new war adventure. At the initiative of Washington, the talks between Croatia, the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on a common Bosnian Croat-Moslem state opened on Saturday. [passage omitted]
