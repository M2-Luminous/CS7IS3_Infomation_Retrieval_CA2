At present, there is no Chinese public security organ in Hong Kong to handle such issues. Before attending today's meeting of the PWC Legal Group, Shao Tianren was asked whether foreign residents of Hong Kong can apply for Chinese citizenship in order to meet requirements to be senior officials in the special administrative region [SAR] government. He said: Hong Kong is Chinese territory, but the territory has not been governed by China for the past 100 years or more. Therefore, applications for Chinese citizenship by foreign residents and people without nationality in Hong Kong has become a new issue. In addition to the fact that no public security organ can handle such matters there now, this is an issue China should consider how to deal with. He said that China may have to formulate certain policies and regulations for handling the nationality issue of such people after careful consideration and it was hard to comment for the time being. He said: After the establishment of the SAR, Hong Kong will be a territory under China's jurisdiction, and this issue will become the same as in other parts of China. At present, foreigners in Beijing may submit applications to public security organs if they want to attain Chinese citizenship, but no Chinese public security organ now exists in Hong Kong.
