The monitoring may be specified for a FIPS COBOL subset, for any of the optional modules, for all of the obsolete language elements included in the processor, or for a combination of a FIPS COBOL subset, optional modules, and all obsolete elements. The monitoring may be specified for any FIPS COBOL subset at or below the highest subset for which the processor is implemented and for a level of an optional module at or below the level of the optional module for which the processor is implemented. The monitoring is an analysis of the syntax used in the source program against the syntax included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules. Any syntax used in the source program that does not conform to that included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules will be diagnosed and identified to the user through a message on the source program listing. Any syntax for an obsolete language element included in the processor and used in the source program will also be diagnosed and identified through a message on the source program listing. The determination of the need to flag any given source program syntax in accordance with these requirements cannot be logically resolved until the syntactic correctness of the source program has been established. The message provided will identify:
