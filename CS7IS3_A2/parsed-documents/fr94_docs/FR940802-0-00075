SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time To File Comments Adopted: July 15, 1994. Released: July 15, 1994. By the Chief, Domestic Facilities Division: 1. On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 94&hyph;59, released March 28, 1994, adopting rules to establish a federal policy regarding calling number identification. Public notice of this action appeared in the Federal Register on April 18, 1994, 59 FR 18318. Petitions for reconsideration of the Report and Order were filed May 18, 1994, and notice of the filing of these petitions appeared in the Federal Register on June 23, 1994, 59 FR 32430. 2. On July 11, 1994, the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission for the State of California (``petitioner'') filed a motion requesting that the time for filing replies in the above-captioned proceedings be extended from July 18, 1994, to August 17, 1994. In support of its request, the State of California and the California Public Utilities Commission states that due to the voluminous record on reconsideration and the complexity of the issues involved in the proceeding, a grant of the requested extension is likely to improve the quality of the replies filed and assist the Commission in its consideration of pending petitions for reconsideration. 3. As set forth in Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. Section 1.46, it is our policy that extensions of time not be routinely granted. We find, however, that the State of California and the California Public Utilities Commission have shown good cause for the requested extension. In reviewing the record to date in this proceeding, we agree with the State of California and the California Public Utilities Commission that the public interest will be best served by granting a 30 day extension of time to file replies to oppositions to petitions for reconsideration in this proceeding. Accordingly, we will grant the requested relief. 4. Accordingly, It Is Ordered that the Request for Extension of Time filed by Petitioners Is Granted . 5. It Is Therefore Ordered that the date for filing replies to oppositions to petitions for reconsideration in this proceeding IS EXTENDED to August 17, 1994. 6. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in Sections 4 (i) and (r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. 47 U.S.C. Sections 4(i) and 303(r) and Sections 0.204(b), 0.283 and 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. Sections 0.204(b), 0.283 and 1.46. 7.
