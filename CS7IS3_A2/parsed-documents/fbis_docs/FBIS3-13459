Michel 'Awn by Bisharah Shirbil in France; date not given] [Excerpts] [Shirbil] How does General 'Awn feel five years after the liberation war? And has his assessment of the bitter experience the Lebanese went through changed? What has changed since that war? ['Awn] Without doubt, the atmosphere of the general crisis Lebanon went through has not changed. However, big changes have occurred inside the Lebanese people, in their awareness of the problem and view of the future, that is if they can participate in achieving this future. They can now determine their choices clearly, whether inside the country, with neighbors, or with the world. This view is now very clear, because the liberation war has removed all the masks from the faces of regional and international players and accentuated the realities through the experience which the Lebanese people witnessed after 13 October 1990. There are no longer false slogans that can be sanctioned in Lebanon, nor international stances that deceive citizens. The Lebanese now know when a major international authority is lying and when he is telling the truth. They can tell whether a regional authority is really an enemy of their traditional enemy or a friend of his, pretending to be their friend merely to implement certain schemes. The Lebanese people are now very vigilant, and their experience -- however harsh -- is useful with regard to future choices. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] Are you preparing for a new liberation war? Assuming you arrived in Lebanon now, would you launch a new liberation war? ['Awn] The situation is different now. We are in a pressing regional situation. Lebanon is occupied. Elements should be different.... [Shirbil] As resistance is the principle, if you consider Lebanon occupied, then a new liberation war is a natural outcome.... ['Awn] Of course. But that depends on the balance of power. Lebanon is now in an unstable position, but this position does not prompt armed resistance, because there is regional and international pressure on the region. They do not want anything to sabotage the peace process. Lebanon has now been handed over to others, and I am out of the game. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] Are there any political messages between you and the Syrians? ['Awn] Many of the visitors who deal with them offer me plans which I consider imperialist. And I conclude from them that the Syrians still have the mentality of the seventies. [Shirbil] Did anyone bring you a real offer? ['Awn] I received many offers, but I do not believe they are serious as long as there are no direct contacts between me and them. [Shirbil] Are you willing to deal with the Syrians if they open up to you? ['Awn] On one condition: One thing is not negotiable between me and them, and that is Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. Anything else can be discussed. The sovereignty and independence condition cannot be subject to interpretation. [Shirbil] Those who support the Syrians in Lebanon say that the Syrian presence secures sovereignty and independence... ['Awn] Many people talk about modesty when they are themselves naked. [passage omitted]
