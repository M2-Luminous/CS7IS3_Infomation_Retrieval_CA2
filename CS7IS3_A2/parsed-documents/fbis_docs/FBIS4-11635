The United States abstained on two points: The definition of the occupied territories as Palestinian (paragraph 2) and the statement that these territories include part of Jerusalem (paragraph 6). Washington's argument is that these territories are still subject to negotiations and consequently, they cannot be considered as Palestinian before the negotiations are over. This is because the negotiations may result in giving them to Israel. Washington's position deserves deep thought because it sheds light on developments that have escaped our attention regarding what is being planned for the future final resolution of the Palestinian issue. Washington's position implies that everything on which there is no agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis must be left open regardless of the existing Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 242, which is the basis of negotiations. The preamble of Resolution 242 notes the "inadmissibility of seizing others' territories by force." Since Israel is occupying the land, this means that the United States, a cosponsor of the negotiation process, accepts the Israeli interpretation on any issue where there is no Palestinian-Israeli agreement, even if this is contrary to the opinion of the entire world community and the other Security Council members. Based on this logic, the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories are not necessarily illegal and thus they do not necessarily need to be removed. Therefore, their presence is not necessarily against the law. [passage omitted] The fact is that it would have been difficult for the Clinton Administration to accept Israel's position that Jerusalem is the unified and eternal capital of Israel had it acknowledged that all the occupied territories in Palestine are Palestinian, because East Jerusalem is occupied land and is in fact Palestinian. Hence, it is clear that Washington's positions on the Palestinian territories and even Clinton's recent remarks on Jerusalem were not just a slip, but have a basis and are consistent. The United States, like Israel, proceeds from the premise that the occupied territories must not be organically linked to the Palestinians and that their status must remain "open." This is because to acknowledge in advance that the land is Palestinian implies questioning the legitimacy of Israel's existence in the first place and that Israel is a lawful state (etat de droit) [preceding words in French as published]. Thus, in order for the Hebrew state to have irreversible legitimacy it is necessary from the start not to acknowledge that the territory of Palestine has a primarily Palestinian-Arab identity. The U.S. position on Resolution 904 shows the kind of argument that Israel is expected to use in the final stage of negotiations. The prevailing thought is that the Gaza-Jericho First formula is the first stage of a Palestinian entity that is ultimately expected to include most, if not all, of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. It is true that Israel has always emphasized that it will not change its stand that Jerusalem is its eternal capital. It is also true that it has continued to build settlements relentlessly. But the parties' continued commitment to Resolution 242 was construed to mean that "exchanging land for peace" could apply in the end to all fronts, including the Palestinian front. But the U.S. vote on Resolution 904 now shows that this premise may not be true and that the "interim period", scheduled to last for five years at least, is meant to delay a decision on the Palestinian issue until the other aspects of the conflict are settled. The purpose of this is to separate the Palestinian issue from the other fronts so that Israel can impose its views in full. The question we need to ask in this regard is: Why is the United States standing firmly against the intervention of the UN and the world community in the administration of the occupied Arab territories even after the occurrence of such appalling crimes as the Hebron massacre? In the meantime, the United States has just as firmly backed intervention in other tense conflicts such as Somalia, Bosnia, etc. Why presume from the start that Israel's "right" to administer the occupied territories until it gets a peace formula it considers acceptable is an "absolute" right?
