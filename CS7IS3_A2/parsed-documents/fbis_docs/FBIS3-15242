It is obvious, however, that our countries can act, rather, as catalysts of the peacemaking process, whose success is unlikely without cooperation with all the other interested states. It is no coincidence that President Boris Yeltsin has proposed holding a meeting of major heads of state devoted to the prospects for resolving the conflict in Bosnia. At the same time, as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has explained, the composition of the summit need not be limited to the five countries named by the president. Nor should it be forgotten that an extremely great deal depends on the good will of those actually involved in the civil war and on sincere moves by them to end the bloodshed. The stand taken by the official leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] in recent days is reassuring in this sphere. B-H Prime Minister Silajdzic declared in Washington, after signing the agreement setting up a Croatian-Muslim federation, that he intends to come to Russia in the very near future. In Moscow he intends to discuss the prospects for implementing the new plans for the B-H state structure and options for cooperation with the republic's Serb population in this process. Without Russia, the premier admitted, a Bosnian settlement is impossible. But his viewpoint is certainly not shared by everyone. Some leaders of that same Bosnia, and also outside the former Yugoslavia (in Turkey, for example), are cautious about Russia's participation in lifting the blockade of Tuzla Airport. They perceive this almost as a buildup of our country's military presence in the Balkans. Although such accusations and fears are totally groundless. As Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs and the Russian president's special representative, explained, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense has not even been entrusted with the practical fulfillment of the provisions of the agreement on opening Tuzla Airport. Representatives of the Ministry for Emergencies and civilian specialists are being sent to Bosnia. According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russia endeavors not to react to sundry accusations, realizing that many statements are made in an extreme situation and in a state of psychological shock caused by war and combat operations. As for the plans to create a Croatian-Muslim federation and the prospects for subsequently forming a confederation with Croatia, the Russian Foreign Ministry views them with cautious optimism. This optimism is founded on the assessment that this agreement, being included in the overall picture of a Yugoslav settlement, can produce positive results. But it is cautious because there have already been quite a few splendid plans which have never reached the stage of implementation (take the Vance-Owen plan). The point is that a federation, as reported previously, provides for unified control over foreign policy, joint leadership of the economy, and also the formation of joint armed forces. Troops which are still fighting each other today will have to unite. (Incidentally, the "unidentified" aircraft which bombed the Muslims and were downed by U.S. aircraft had actually taken off from Croatian territory, so Croatian Foreign Minister Granic has admitted). In addition, territorial demarcation is a stumbling block in the present plans, just as in the previous ones. Carrying it out essentially means feeding both the wolves and the sheep. But who or what will be the "dinner"? For it is obvious that we cannot manage here without casualties or, at any rate, compromises.... Not only Russia and the United States have their interests in the region but also Germany, France, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Each country has its own historical and political allies, whom they support and whose interests they are prepared to champion persistently. So a successful outcome to the Bosnian crisis can come about only in the event of harmony throughout the international "choir" and not just as a solo part for the U.S.-Russian "duet."
