It is necessary to ensure that the Serbian troops be withdrawn from the town and that its shelling -- an excessive response to the provocations of the Muslim side -- be ceased, said the Russian minister. We also consider the NATO air strikes to be an excessive reaction. However, at this point it is important to stop this chain of developments, to define the borders of the security zone in Gorazde, to bring there UN observers and to observe the cease-fire not only in Gorazde, but also on all Bosnian fronts, so as to avoid repeated duplications of such crisis situations in different areas. I am glad that our approach coincides in principle with the position described by President Milosevic. The important point is that these steps -- lifting the blockade of Gorazde, removing all the problems which have emerged with the personnel of the UN forces, the observance of the regime of the security zone and the comprehensive cease-fire -- all these steps should be implemented in practice. Such implementation will create a solid foundation for firmly raising the issue of lifting the sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, the Russian minister emphasized. Asked what Russia would do should there be another breach of the procedure of the use of force by NATO against Bosnian Serbs, Andrey Kozyrev said: Within the last 24 hours, in spite of the crisis in Gorazde, we applied serious efforts to prevent new air strikes. I maintain that now all will depend on the implementation of the complex of measures outlined at my meeting with President Milosevic. At the forthcoming meeting in Pale between the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs and the UN representatives, with the participation of Russia, it is necessary to have the borders of the security zone clearly defined and the issues of bringing there UN observers discussed. The adherence to these accords, the complete cessation of the shelling of the town and the lifting of the blockade of the UN personnel -- all these steps will make redundant the issue of the air strikes.
