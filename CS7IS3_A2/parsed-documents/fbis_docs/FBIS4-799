FBIS4-799 "drafr074_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Said Still Resolved To Capture Kigali RPF Said Still Resolved To Capture Kigali LD1704222794 Paris Radio France International in French 2130 GMT 17 Apr 94 LD1704222794 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Excerpts] In Rwanda, fighting grew more intense in the capital today. Fighting between the armed forces and the Patriotic Front [RPF] even reached the center of Kigali. UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] reported intense fighting with light weapons and shells lasting for about two hours. Dug in at the old parliament building, which dominates the east of the town, the RPF leaders repeated to the few journalists there that they were still fully resolved to take the town if the killings did not stop. According to our colleague from AFP, the conversation was punctuated by deafening artillery fire coming from right next to the building and aimed at targets the rebels refused to identify. The RPF has still not taken control of the strategic points because the time is not yet ripe, they said during this news briefing, and indeed the three large military camps are still held by the regular army, even if the one in the north has been surrounded by the rebels, they said. According to the UNAMIR head of military operations, the time for the RPF to take Kigali is not far off. Finally it must be noted that the RPF shelled the pro-government free radio, Mille Collines, today, accusing it of incitement to murder. After having demanded its closure in vain, this morning it reduced it to silence. [passage omitted] The nomination of a new chief of staff, Augustin Bizimungu, today will not make things any easier: he is an extremist, says the RPF, and his appointment to head the army makes the situation more dangerous. The UN mission on the ground, however, is not giving up; it is continuing discussions with the two sides separately in the hope of trying to arrange a meeting.
