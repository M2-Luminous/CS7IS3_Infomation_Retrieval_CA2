In his turn, the Kirgiz president said the current visit by the Chinese State Council premier to Bishkek was to open good prospects for the Republic. As concerns issues of border territories, the two leaders noted they would be solved in the spirit of mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations. Expressing sympathy with the Kirgiz people that suffered greatly in recent natural calamities, China intends to provide humanitarian aid to the Republic and a 50 mln yuans credit. On Sunday, the Chinese premier had a rest on Kirgizia's famous lake Issyk-Kul. Li Peng is to return to the Kirgiz capital tomorrow and visit the Chinese Embassy. He will go to the airport at 1530 to fly off to Alma-Ata [Almaty].
