When awarded the European Charlemagne Prize in Nuremberg today, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's Party) described the expulsion as one of the "great unjust deeds" of this century. Addressing about 200 participants, Mock rejected all efforts to "justify the resettlement of the Sudeten Germans with previous Nazi crimes." Also, its cannot be explained with the argument of the "collective guilt" of the Germans, Mock stressed. He stated that it is "quite understandable" that the Sudeten Germans want to open a "new chapter" in the relationship with their old home. The minister added: "I do not believe that one should discard the sincere attempt to restore dialogue as a 'provocation'." Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus used this term when reacting to the invitation of the Sudeten Germans to attend their meeting. Theo Waigel, leader of the Christian Social Union and finance minister, stated: "The future between Germany and the Czech Republic can only be shaped by the awareness of historical truths." Prior to an entry into the European Union, the Czech Republic must be willing to "accept the European house rules." Reconciliation is not possible without the integration of the Sudeten Germans. The opening of the Whitsun meeting of the Sudeten Germans, which will continue on Sunday, was disrupted by three German women who described themselves as trade union activists. They carried banners with the slogans "No to the Munich agreement" and "Cheb must remain Czech." After some tussling, the women were pushed out of the hall by ushers and are now facing charges of illegally entering the hall. They pointed out that their action was intended as a protest against the demands of the Sudeten Germans.
