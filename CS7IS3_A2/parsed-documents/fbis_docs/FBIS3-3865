Through their mediation, they have prevented 76 crimes or suicides, which might have cost 22 lives, the officials said. According to the officials, some 35 percent of these disputes were related to matrimonial or love affairs, from which quarrels easily arise and worsen into crimes. The officials said disputes arising from unreasonable behavior in house decorating, noise from home karaoke performances and other entertainments also accounted for a large share of the mediators' work. While applying traditional morals and laws, the officials said, the mediators also used psychological skills in clamping down on short-tempered displays by those involved in quarrels. The mediators also helped resident committees organize entertainment, sports or mere talks between neighbors to promote understanding, harmony and friendship in communities, the officials added.
