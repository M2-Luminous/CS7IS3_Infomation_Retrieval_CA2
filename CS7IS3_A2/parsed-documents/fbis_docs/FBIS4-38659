These wishes were presented to the leaders of the Murmansk region on Monday by Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), at the beginning of a two-day visit to Murmansk. Prime Minister Aho arrived in Murmansk with an official delegation and a large trade delegation on Monday afternoon. He was met by Jevgeniy Komarov, governor of the Murmansk region. Aho and Komarov held a brief discussion on Monday before rushing off to a seminar dealing with current and future cooperation projects. This seminar was attended by Finnish officials and business people. Governor Komarov, who held the opening speech at the seminar, pointed out that Aho's visit to Murmansk was the first one made by a Finnish prime minister. It was, according to him, no coincidence that the visit came so soon after President Martti Ahtisaari's visit to Moscow. Aho also stressed that the multiple visits this year had been instrumental in developing relations between Finland and Russia. Aho had already visited St. Petersburg and Carelia. In his opinion, these visits are indicative of Finland's genuine interest in a cooperation with its neighboring regions. The visit is a response to the constructive criticism made earlier by Governor Komarov concerning the Finns' interest in the Murmansk region. This is why the prime minister's working visit includes a business delegation of 20 persons with management representatives from small- and medium-sized companies. According to Aho, Finnish companies want certain basic infrastructures in Murmansk to improve. He mentioned the issue of transport communications, a relaxation of border controls, more efficient banking and financing systems, and better data communications. In addition, Aho said that Finnish companies have two general requests. First, they want more information about the development plans of the Murmansk region and the possibility for enterprises to use foreign currency in trading. Second, they need information about direct foreign trade opportunities. Aho stated that the Finns are potentially interested in the utilization of the Murmansk region's natural resources. After the seminar, Aho and a small part of his delegation set off on a fishing trip on the Ponoj river in the East of the Kola Peninsula. Investment Guarantees Martin Saarikangas, CEO of Kvaerner Masa-Yards and head of the commercial delegation, also wanted guarantees for foreign investments. Such guarantees could take the form, for instance, of natural resources or land areas. According to Governor Komarov, a regulation with regard to the protection of invested capital in the Murmansk region is being prepared. Finnish business leaders at the seminar were pariticularly interested in the natural resources of the continental shelf, more particularly, the presence of natural gas in Sjtokmanovskoje [as received]. Neste CEO Kai Hietarinta pointed out that the issue was not only oil or gas, but also transportation, ship repairs, and terminals. Hietarinta said that the Finns are cooperating with the autonomous region of Nenetsia [as received] and expressed his hope for an increased cooperation between Nenetsia and the Murmansk region. Neste Ships Under Russian Flag Neste also has shipping plans in the Arctic area. On Monday, the board of Neste decided to charter one of the company's ships to a joint venture enterprise in Murmansk to sail under Russian flag. A law is being prepared in Russia which will give Russian ships the sole right to Arctic transports, and Neste's strategy therefore is to put its ships under Russian flag.
