FR940720-2-00069 FR940720-2-00057 [Investigations Nos. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;360 and 361 (Final)] Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from India and Israel AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. ACTION: Institution of final countervailing duty investigations. SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of final countervailing duty investigations Nos. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;360 and 361 (Final) under section 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. §1671d(b)) (the Act) to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from India and Israel of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings, 1 provided for in subheading 7307.93.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 1 The imported products covered by the scope of these investigations consist of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than 14 inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Such pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). The subject pipe fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows'', ``tees'', ``caps'', and ``reducers''. The edges of the finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. Pursuant to a request from petitioner under section 705(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. §1671d(a)(1)), Commerce has extended the date for its final determinations to coincide with those to be made in the ongoing antidumping investigations on certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France, India, Israel, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. Accordingly, the Commission will not establish a schedule for the conduct of the countervailing duty investigations until Commerce makes preliminary determinations in the antidumping investigations (currently scheduled for August 8, 1994). For further information concerning the conduct of these investigations, hearing procedures, and rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts A and C (19 CFR part 207).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background These investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by the Department of Commerce that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 703 of the Act (19 U.S.C. §1671b) are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in India and Israel of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings.
