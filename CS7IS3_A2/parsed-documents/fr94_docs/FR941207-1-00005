FR941207-1-00005 FR941207-1-00002 List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Boeing: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;159&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 737&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes; line numbers 1 through 999, inclusive; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (h) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced structural integrity of the outboard chords, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes on which the upper outboard chord has been replaced in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53&hyph;1088: Prior to the accumulation of 30,000 total flight cycles since replacement of the upper outboard chord, or within 4,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform close visual, pulse echo shear wave (PESW), and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at Body Station (BS) 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A , in accordance with Part I of the Accomplishment Instructions of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994. (b) Repeat the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD as follows, until the optional terminating action described in paragraph (g) of this AD is accomplished: (1) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, the airplane has accumulated 27,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 50,000 flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection within 15,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 15,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more flight cycles since the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (b)(2) of this AD. (2) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, the airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 60,000 flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection within 7,500 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 7,500 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 60,000 or more flight cycles since the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (b)(3) of this AD. (3) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, the airplane has accumulated 60,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 70,000 flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection within 5,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 70,000 or more flight cycles since the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by paragraph (b)(4) of this AD. (4) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, the airplane has accumulated 70,000 or more flight cycles since replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection within 3,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. (c) For airplanes on which the outboard chord has not been replaced or on which only the lower outboard chord has been replaced in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin: 737&hyph;53&hyph;1088: Perform close visual, pulse echo shear wave (PESW), and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A, in accordance with Part I of the Accomplishment Instructions of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994. Perform these inspections initially at the time specified in paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4), as applicable. Repeat these inspections thereafter at the intervals specified in paragraph (d) of this AD. (1) For airplanes that have accumulated 27,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 50,000 total flight cycles, as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 4,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD.
