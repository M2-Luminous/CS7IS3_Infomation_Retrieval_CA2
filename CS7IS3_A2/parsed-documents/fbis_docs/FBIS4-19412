After all, in a country that is at the mercy of the most nightmarish horrors and where nothing is certain any longer, the warring factions have equally scant regard for the conventions associated with diplomatic relations as they do for their fellow Rwandans' right to live. But with the immediate, and justified, concern regarding several hundred Belgian nationals whose lives were threatened, and who had to suddenly drop everything and leave a country in which many of them had been giving of their best for many years, too little attention has probably been paid over the past few days to the plight of the local population. Indeed, no aircraft have been arranged to carry them off to some safer place. The takeover of power by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) does not mean that an end to the misery is in sight. The RPF has never bothered about human rights and democracy in the field and nobody believes that its leaders will suddenly change their tack in this respect. This development is a cause for great concern. The fear is justified that the RPF ranks will in turn commit horrific acts of revenge, causing even greater bloodshed, this time Hutu blood. On the other hand, the stream of refugees that has formed over the past few days will continue to grow. This new, endless stream of refugees means that in the not-too-distant future, an entire region risks being completely disrupted, and new outbursts of ethnic violence are highly probable. The unease in Belgian Government circles is just as real as the evacuation plans for the neighboring country, Burundi. The caution with which the government is reacting to such a catastrophic scenario is understandable. Hopefully it is not in for any nasty surprises and just like the rest of the international community, it will recognize the signals of a further change in good time and take action accordingly. By deciding to close the embassy, the government has thrown in the towel. It is powerless and recognizes as much. At the same time, losing Rwanda marks the failure of a particular political approach. When Belgium considers where it stands in political terms, realism and pragmatism must be allotted a prominent role. The ambitions of a small country like Belgium must not outstrip its means. However, before it reasserts its presence, Belgium is entitled to demand guarantees from the Rwandan counterpart, not only regarding security, but also any joint action. However, so far things have been going rather wrong.
