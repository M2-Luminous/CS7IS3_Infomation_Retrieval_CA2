On the Doorstep: A System for Using Technical Information''] [Text] With respect to coverage of the fields of science and technology, economic branches and regions, the USSR State System for Scientific and Technical Information (GSNTI) had no precedents in world practice. The centralization of the processing of the principal types of scientific and technical documents made it possible to avoid multiple duplication in the purchase and intellectual processing of literature, especially foreign literature and to reduce expenditures by branch and territorial systems substantially. However, the declared objective of exhaustive coverage of the world scientific and technical literature was never attained. About 1,500 of the most important foreign periodicals were not received in the country and the transactions of important scientific conferences, foreign reports and dissertations were received only from time to time. Now many of the information centers constituting parts of the USSR GSNTI are suffering a pitiful existence. The bonds among them have been weakened or completely broken. The purchases of foreign scientific and technical literature have been sharply reduced. The Russian State Library does not receive and therefore is unable to make many national periodicals available to readers. The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian Federation (RF) is trying to maintain ``fragments'' of the USSR GSNTI, by tradition more or less uniformly distributing crumbs from the state budget among them. Meanwhile commercialization is strongly intruding in the activity of the scientific and technical information (STI) services. For example, the State Public Scientific-Technical Library of Russia has already introduced pay for servicing of enterprises and organizations with literature on interlibrary loan, although its funds come exclusively from the state budget. Thus, there is actual privatization of that which has already been paid for completely by the taxpayers. A decree of the RF government, No. 16, dated 6 January 1993, strengthening the strictly centralized management of the territorial STI centers in the republics, krays and the oblasts of the RF, was a questionable attempt at reanimating a part of the USSR GSNTI. The structures whose principal objective not long ago was the servicing of the oblast and kray committees of the CPSU, are continuing to be controlled from Moscow without participation of the governments of the republics and local administrations, be it in Yekaterinburg, Kazan or Yakutsk. Among the great variety of problems to be dealt with the first one was by far not the most important and it was solved in the spirit of the old traditions. It must be stated that there is no clear concept with respect to the organization and development of a STI system in the Russian Federation either in the government or in the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. What should be the state policy of the RF in the STI field in order to ensure the most complete and efficient use of the information resources available in the country and beyond its borders? In the process of changeover to a market economy in the RF the appearance of private (including commercial) STI centers also was inevitable. However, there should be complete or partial (50-60%) state financing of STI centers and scientific-technical libraries servicing economic sectors vitally important for the country but not yielding a direct profit. It is necessary to embody in the law and realistically ensure the right of each citizen-taxpayer to free access to any information: socio-political, scientific, technical, commercial and other, collected or created using the resources of the state budget. Payment can be levied only for additional services with an added cost for covering the actual expenditures for rendering these services, but without receiving a profit. The reliability of an information servicing system is predetermined primarily by the completeness of coverage and routineness in processing of the world flow of STI. The most effective means here is the centralization of collection, systematization, referencing and indexing of all the scientific and technical information appearing in the world. It is important to guarantee the receipt in the country, at least in a single copy, of all publications which may be of interest for Russian scientists and specialists. Databases (DB), usually constituting electronic versions of printed publications, that is, newspapers, journals, encyclopedias, reference books, etc., are becoming an increasingly more important type of STI sources. In 1992 throughout the world there were more than six thousand generally accessible DB with an annual increase in their number by more than 20%. However, there is not even one well-developed country which can be completely reliant on the physical or electronic supply (importation) of foreign DB because this would put it in increasing dependence on the supplying countries. The STI system also must include a service for the rapid preparation and delivery of copies of original sources to readers. In order to meet the needs for information with minimum expenditures it is necessary to have integrated information systems: they are based on the one-time processing of STI sources and the input of the corresponding data into a computer with their subsequent repeated use. A matter of concern of countries should be the supply of information to small and intermediate enterprises and companies. Since such enterprises are usually incapable of maintaining their own STI services, the state must ensure the preparation of the information which they require and favorable conditions for acquiring it. An increase in the information literacy of scientists and specialists also is becoming an important prerequisite for the efficient use of STI. Taking into account what has been said, it appears that the STI system in the RF must be organized in the following way. The state, public and private STI centers, scientific-technical publishing houses, libraries, intermediary and consultation companies should form the national network of STI agencies. The STI centers, libraries and other information structures servicing spheres vitally important for the country and therefore financed from the state subject should be combined into a State STI System (GSNTI RF) whose operations are organized on a nonprofit basis. The GSNTI RF should include the following principal types of information agencies: STI functional institutes and centers, carrying out the most complete possible collection of publications and unpublished documents, their intellectual processing, preparation of DB and information publications (in electronic or printed form) and their dissemination, thematic STI centers whose principal function would be the selective dissemination and retrospective subject-thematic information and document search--predominantly in a remote dialogue access mode--on the basis of use of DB made available by licenses or acquired from those organizing them, a center for the routine issuance of copies, a translation center and ``brain centers'': administratively independent scientific research organizations, preparing under special order predictions of development, analytic reviews and summaries. The territorial STI centers, scientific-technical libraries in the republics making up the RF, and also in the krays and oblasts, must be established, maintained and controlled by the governments of these republics, the authorities in the krays and oblasts. The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian Federation can be seen as the principal coordinator of development and implementation of state policy in the STI field. It could rely on an interdepartmental STI committee.
