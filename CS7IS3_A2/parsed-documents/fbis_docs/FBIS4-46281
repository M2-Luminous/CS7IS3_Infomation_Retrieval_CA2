The incident left two resistance men injured, one of them seriously, and he died soon afterwards. The source said that it was surprising that the UNIFIL force in the area was placed on alert afterwards and set up checkpoints and ambushes in a provocative way. They also fired at a Hizballah envoy who was going to the UNIFIL checkpoint in al-Tayyibah to discuss outstanding incidents. He was hit in the foot and received shrapnel wounds in his face. Active contacts are under way to address the incident and its repercussions.
