[Stastny] Does our policy of reinforcing the Czech units follow some long-term objective, and when will the name of our officer who has been appointed commander of the South Sector units be published? [Novotny] Our Republic was officially requested to commission an officer to assume command of the South units on 30 April 1994. The officer's name will be released as soon as the appointment is approved by the appropriate UN bodies. I believe that it shows an appreciation of the work of our soldiers in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and recognition of the fact that our battalion has operated in the region since the beginning of the conflict. At this time, we have in Yugoslavia a chief of staff, Taichman, whose work is highly valued. [Stastny] Did the reinforcement of Russian units to double the original strength take place at the request of the UNPROFOR command, or did the initiative come from the Russian side? [Novotny] According to my sources, the Russian side offered its units, and the UNPROFOR command accepted the offer. All of the other activities, including the transfer of Russian units to other territories, are conducted at the request of the command. I believe that these units are subordinated to the UNPROFOR command like all of the others. This body expressed its agreement to their transfer to the Sarajevo region and, as far as I know, additional paratrooper units have also been offered, but that is a matter for UNPROFOR to comment on. [Stastny] Have you been consulted regarding Minister Baudys's initiative? [Novotny] At the time this idea was taking shape, I was abroad--with our soldiers in Serbian Krajina. Moreover, a subordinate cannot assess the work of his superior.
