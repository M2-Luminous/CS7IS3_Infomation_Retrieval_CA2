FR941007-0-00062 FR941007-0-00016 It has come to our attention that the provisions at existing §403.504, particularly paragraph (d) of that section, have caused confusion because they do not clearly reflect the above process. (Some interpreted paragraph (d) as indicating that there was a two-step process involved in applying for the grants. That is, that a State applied for and was awarded a basic grant and that, if there were additional funds available, the State submitted another application and a subsequent award was made.) This rule revises §403.504 to more clearly reflect the award process. D. Limitations In accordance with section 4360(c) of OBRA '90, this rule retains existing §§403.508 (a) and (b), with editorial changes. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide that a State that receives a grant under this program may, with one exception, use the grant for any expenses incurred in planning, developing, implementing, and/or operating the program for which the grant is made. The exception applies to a State that receives a grant to supplement an existing ``substantially similar'' program. In this case, the State must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial award of the grant and funded through other sources (including in-kind contributions), but must maintain the activities of the program at least at the level that those activities were conducted immediately preceding that date. (States will be required to provide information to document their maintenance of effort and funding levels.) E. Reporting Requirements In accordance with section 4360(e) of OBRA '90, which requires the State to submit to us an annual report on its ICA program, this rule provides that a State that receives a grant under this program must submit at least one annual report to us and any additional reports we prescribe in the notice of grant award. It further specifies that HCFA will advise the State of the requirements concerning the frequency, timing, and contents of the report(s) in the notice of grant award that it sends to the State. This rule removes existing paragraph (d) (``Annual report'') from §403.508 and establishes a new §403.510 (``Reporting requirements'') to set forth the reporting requirements as described above. F. Administration of Grants This rule adds §403.512(a) to identify those provisions that control the administration of the ICA grants. Section 403.512 specifies that health insurance ICA grants are administered in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR part 403, subpart E; certain provisions of 45 CFR part 74 (``Administration of Grants''), 45 CFR part 92 (``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments''), the terms of the solicitation, and terms of the notice of grant award. Section 403.512(a) also specifies that, except for the minimum funding levels established by §403.504(b)(1), in the event of conflict between a provision of the notice of grant award and any provision of the solicitation, subpart E of 42 CFR part 403, or of 45 CFR part 74 or part 92, the terms of the notice of grant award prevail. This rule adds §403.512(b) to state that HCFA provides notice to each applicant regarding HCFA's decision on an application for grant funding under §403.504. This rule adds §403.512(c) to enable States to appeal, under 45 CFR part 16, HCFA's determination regarding its grant application. 45 CFR part 16 contains procedures for appealing a final decision to our Departmental Grant Appeals Board. G. Technical Change_Definition of ``State'' This rule revises the definition of ``State'' at §403.500(c) to correct the inadvertent omission of ``the 50 States'' from the definition.
