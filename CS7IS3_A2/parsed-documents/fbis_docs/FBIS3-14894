Korobov, chairman of the Social Justice Party of Crimea, by L. Pirozhenko, under the "Parties and Social Movements" rubric; place and date not given: "Another Party"] [Text] The Social Justice Party of Crimea (SJPC), registered as No. 13 by the Ministry of Justice of Crimea on 7 February 1994, has been presented in the conference hall of the Crimean Consumers Union. [Korobov] The goal of our activity is to protect the economic, political, and social interests of all citizens of Crimea, regardless of nationality, religious beliefs, or social affiliation. Here we are primarily concerned with the socially unprotected segments of society and those engaged in the production and processing of agricultural output, those who are striving to saturate the consumer market of the republic with essential commodities and foodstuffs. [Pirozhenko] Vladimir Ilich, V.M. Negulyayev and G.N. Prigornitskiy were selected as your deputies. In the Presidium we have A.V. Oleynikov, N.M. Bramatkin, and other well-known people who work in the system of the Crimean Consumers Union. Does this not mean that the SJPC is an occupationally affiliated party, that is, affiliated with workers in the consumer cooperatives? [Korobov] No, it does not. The party charter states quite definitively that our party is established not according to an occupational principle, but rather a territorial one. Any individual can become a member who agrees with its program and is prepared to support and implement it. Though it is true indeed that consumer cooperative workers brought the party into existence-- lower-echelon consumer cooperative workers. [Pirozhenko] How large is the SJPC membership? [Korobov] Right now we have over a thousand applications, and they continue to come in. Primary party organizations have been established in all the rayons. This demonstrates that our new organization enjoys mass popular support and that its aims and objectives conform to the interests of the workers. The Social Justice Party of Crimea intends to become a party of the parliamentary variety, joining the membership of the Supreme Council. It will support the programs of other parties and join with them in unified blocs if their social objectives are similar.
