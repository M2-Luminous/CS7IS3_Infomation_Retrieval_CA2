FR940304-1-00058 FR940304-1-00011 (5) Data Submittals: Two weeks prior to system start-up, BSC must notify in writing the Section Chief, Delisting Section (see address below) when stabilization of the dewatered filter cake will begin. The data obtained through Condition (1)(A) must be submitted to the Section Chief, Delisting Section, OSW (OS&hyph;333), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 within the time period specified. The analytical data, including quality control information and records of ratios of lime kiln dust and fly ash used, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of five years. These data must be furnished upon request and made available for inspection by EPA or the State of Maryland. Failure to submit the required data within the specified time period or maintain the required records on site for the specified time will be considered by the Agency, at its discretion, sufficient basis to revoke the exclusion to the extent directed by EPA. All data must be accompanied by a signed copy of the following certification statement to attest to the truth and accuracy of the data submitted: ``Under civil and criminal penalty of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Federal Code, which include, but may not be limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 42 U.S.C. 6928), I certify that the information contained in or accompanying this document is true, accurate and complete. As to the (those) identified section(s) of this document for which I cannot personally verify its (their) truth and accuracy, I certify as the company official having supervisory responsibility for the persons who, acting under my direct instructions, made the verification that this information is true, accurate and complete. In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA in its sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete, and upon conveyance of this fact to the company, I recognize and agree that this exclusion of waste will be void as if it never had effect or to the extent directed by EPA and that the company will be liable for any actions taken in contravention of the company's RCRA and CERCLA obligations premised upon the company's reliance on the void exclusion.'' If made final, the proposed exclusion will apply only to the stabilized filter cake generated during the treatment of dewatered filter cake produced by BSC's Sparrows Point, Maryland facility. In addition, if made final the exclusion will apply only to the processes and waste volume (a maximum of 1100 cubic yards of stabilized filter cake generated annually) covered by the original demonstration. The facility would require a new exclusion if either its manufacturing or treatment processes are significantly altered beyond the changes in operating conditions described in Condition (4), such that an adverse change in waste composition ( e.g., if levels of hazardous constituents increased significantly) or increase in waste volume occurred. Accordingly, the facility would need to file a new petition for the altered waste. The facility must treat stabilized filter cake generated either in excess of 1100 cubic yards per year or from changed processes as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted. Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relieved from subtitle C jurisdiction upon final promulgation of an exclusion, the generator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of the waste in an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility, either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively, the delisted waste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaims the waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling, or reclamation. III. Effective Date This rule, if made final, will become effective immediately upon final publication. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here, because this rule, if finalized, would reduce the existing requirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective date six months after publication and the fact that a six-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes that this exclusion should be effective immediately upon final publication. These reasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately, upon final publication, under the Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). IV. Regulatory Impact Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must conduct an ``assessment of the potential costs and benefits'' for all ``significant'' regulatory actions. This proposal to grant an exclusion is not significant, since its effect, if promulgated, would be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction would be achieved by excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional impact due to today's rule. Therefore, this proposal would not be a significant regulation, and no cost/benefit assessment is required. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has also exempted this rule from the requirement for OMB review under section (6) of Executive Order 12866. V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities ( i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however, if the Administrator or delegated representative certifies that the rule will not have any impact on any small entities.
