Residents in Gangbei village said they had yet to be notified when the men would be released. They were arrested during the anti-corruption riot in which police fired more than 10 rounds of tear-gas. The men's families say the four are being held in the PSB office in Zengcheng, and that they have been seriously beaten and barred from seeing visitors. The village, which is about 70 kilometres from Guangzhou, has returned to normal although undercover PSB officers are still stationed in the area and passing vehicles are checked. However, residents say the peace is superficial. PSB officers have systematically summoned villagers for questioning. Most residents are staying indoors, not daring to go out. "I am very scared," a villager said. Officials in Shitan county, where the village is located, are investigating the case. "The county government is checking the account by the village committee and the result will be announced later. If any official is involved in corruption, we will handle it according to the law," an official notice in the village states. The riot among the 3,000-strong crowd broke out over inadequate compensation for farms taken for urban development. Residents also accused village representatives of corruption, of taking compensation assigned to the area but not passing it on. They claim it dates back to the economic reforms which started in the early 1980s. "There are more than 200 hectares of farmland in the village, but since the start of economic reform, more than two- thirds of it has been taken by the government for urban development. "The government sells it to foreign investors, mainly Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen, but we have yet to receive any compensation," said villager Shan Fu. Villagers' incomes have been sharply cut because of the land takeover. "Even worse, we still have to pay the agriculture tax of 500 yuan [about HK$444] every year," he said. The angry villager pointed to new Spanish-style houses: "The officials have taken our compensation and built these houses for themselves. It is very corrupt here." The mounting discontent flared when villagers learned that only 800,000 yuan was left in the village's public account. "There should be millions of profit from the land sale. Where has the rest of the money gone?" angry villagers asked. The entire community gathered in the main street, waving banners bearing the words "anti-corruption". Shortly afterwards dozens of PSB officers arrived and fired tear-gas to curb the protest. "It was just like a war, I was really scared. Tear-gas was everywhere," one eye witness said. Shan Yuexin, whose son Sin Sanguang was arrested during the riots, said he was caught only because several Hong Kong reporters were in his restaurant when the protest broke out. "They pulled my son out of the restaurant and beat him up with a police stick, they were so cruel," he said. "They said my son had hidden Hong Kong reporters, but it was a fact the journalists were interviewing villagers in our restaurant." There were three Hong Kong reporters in the establishment when the disturbance started, and it was reported the crowd prevented the police arresting the journalists. "I went to the PSB office but they didn't allow me to visit my son. I was told that he was beaten again," Mr Shan said. Another three young villagers, two of whom were brothers, were also detained. The brothers' mother burst into tears when she spoke to the Sunday Morning Post "I don't like to talk anymore, I am very scared. I am afraid they [the PSB] will give my sons trouble again," she said. Village representatives deny the allegations. "We have invested the money in some enterprises and villagers can get their money back after they make a profit," said one, but who refused to give his name. Meanwhile, the peasants have been scraping together the little spare cash they have to help win the release of the four still detained, even though their families have not been notified of the conditions for their release. In a bid to appease the angry villagers, the authorities also announced that every villager would get 200 yuan compensation for their loss of farmland. But residents said the amount was far from enough and added they were considering taking their case to the Guangdong provincial government. "It isn't even enough for us to live for a month," one said. Newspapers and Guangzhou Television have reported the case without mentioning the riots, saying there was only some discontent among villagers. Locals set up an anti-corruption movement last year after complaining of official graft concerning land compensation. This latest outburst over land and corruption is the fourth this month in Guangdong. A farmer of Baigang village, in Huiyang county, was shot in the leg on April I after scores of angry villagers clashed with PSB officers over land compensation. Three days later 200 Xinhua villagers protested to Huiyang county officials over the amount of compensation being offered to farmers. They also accused village representatives of corruption. And residents of Xiaqinwei village, in Danshui city, also complained of corruption among their village representatives. But this may not be the end of the story. A Guangdong People's Congress delegate, Wang Zhutian, said he was worried such outbursts would continue if no settlement was made. He said the disturbances were mainly due to the misunderstanding between peasants and the government over land resumptions. Mr Wang added some corruption might be involved and the government should attack any malpractice. An official in Guangdong Land Department, who refused to be named, said all land in the mainland was state-owned, and peasants only had the right of use. "When we sell the land to foreign investors we have to spend a lot of money on basic facilities in the area like road links, water and electricity supply," he said. "That is the reason for the big difference between the sale price of the land and the compensation to villagers." He said the provincial government was highly concerned about the cases, and was discussing ways of finding a solution.
