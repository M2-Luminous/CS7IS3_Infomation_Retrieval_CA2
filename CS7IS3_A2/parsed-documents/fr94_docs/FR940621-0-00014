FR940621-0-00014 FR940621-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 24 CFR Parts 905 and 965 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1676; FR&hyph;3275&hyph;F&hyph;02] RIN: 2577&hyph;AB21 Lead-Based Paint Liability Insurance Coverage for Housing Authorities AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (collectively, housing authorities or HAs) conducting lead-based paint testing and abatement activities need to assure that they have adequate liability insurance coverage to cover the hazards inherent in these activities, in order to comply with insurance requirements of their Annual Contributions Contracts with HUD. This rule prescribes the nature and quality of liability insurance to protect HAs and contractors performing this work for HAs. The rule is being issued to comply with directions in the Department's appropriation act for Fiscal Year 1992 to adopt regulations specifying the nature and quality of insurance to cover HAs in the performance of this work. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Comerford, Director, Financial Management Division, Office of Assisted Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;1872. A telecommunications device for hearing or speech-impaired persons is available at (202) 708&hyph;0850. (These are not toll-free telephone numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and approved under OMB control number 2577&hyph;0187, which is valid through August 1994. II. Background A. HUD Contract Requirements for Insurance Under their Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) or Mutual Help Annual Contributions Contract (MHACC) with HUD, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) (hereinafter referred to as HAs) must carry adequate (1) owner's, landlord's, and tenant's public liability insurance; and (2) manufacturer's and contractor's public liability insurance (both now combined and referred to by the insurance industry as commercial general liability insurance). When the conditions of the ACC or MHACC were formulated in 1969, it was not anticipated that there was any reason to address the issue of bodily injury due to the ingestion of lead-based paint, since the health hazard of this chemical was not well-known. Also, at that time, no pollution exclusion in the general liability policy was thought to apply to claims of this nature. However, during subsequent years, as environmental claims started arising, insurance companies began to exclude pollution and environmental liability; and it is the opinion of most insurance companies that, since lead is a chemical which is included in the definition of a ``pollutant'', claims arising from lead poisoning are excluded from current policies. However, some courts have differed with the insurance companies' position on pollution exclusions. HAs are engaging in lead-based paint testing and abatement, often funded by HUD under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program or Comprehensive Grant Program, which support rehabilitation work needed to improve the condition of public housing units. The Department published a document in the Federal Register to guide these activities, entitled ``Lead-Based Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public and Indian Housing'' (55 FR 14556, April 18, 1990, and revised 55 FR 39874, September 28, 1990, and 56 FR 21556, May 9, 1991). Use of these guidelines is the subject of other program regulations and notices of funding availability, and it is not addressed in this rule. B. Appropriations Act The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992, Pub L. 102&hyph;139, 105 Stat. 736 (approved October 28, 1991) (``1992 Act'') included an express provision concerning selection of insurance to protect against the liability hazards involved in the testing and abatement of lead-based paint, at 758 and 759:
