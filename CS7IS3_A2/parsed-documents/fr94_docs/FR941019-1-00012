A new §50.67 is added to read as follows: §50.67 Shutdown and low-power operations. (a) Applicability. This section applies to all holders of operating licenses for commercial nuclear power plants. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section: Cold Shutdown means that plant state in which the reactor is subcritical, K Effective is less than .99, the reactor coolant system temperature is less than or equal to 200 ○F, and all reactor vessel head closure bolts are fully tensioned. Low Power Condition means that the plant is operating with the reactor critical and the main generator isolated from the grid because the output breaker connecting the unit to the utility power grid is open. Midloop Operation means that plant operational state in which the plant is in a shutdown condition, fissionable fuel assemblies are present within the reactor vessel, and the reactor coolant system (RCS) water level is below the top of the flow area of the hot legs at the junction with the reactor vessel. Outage Plan means that written plan of activities to be conducted during a shutdown or low power condition. Refueling Condition means that plant state in which the reactor is subcritical with fissionable fuel assemblies present within the reactor vessel, and one or more reactor vessel head closure bolts are less than fully tensioned. Shutdown Condition means that plant state in which the reactor is subcritical with fissionable fuel assemblies present within the reactor vessel.
