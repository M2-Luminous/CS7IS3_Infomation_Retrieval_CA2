Bassam Jarrar, a leading Ramallah dignitary, has said that "Israel is interested in providing protection for its agents." He pointed out that giving guarantees that no harm will befall collaborators with the occupation in exchange for the release of detainees held by the authorities aims at "encouraging those individuals and others to collaborate with Israel." He added: This will set a dangerous precedent that will help Israel to continue recruiting collaborators even after the self-rule accord is implemented. [passage omitted]
