Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told Interfax that the two men had "agreed on holding off air strikes in light of the diplomatic efforts being made by the Russian side in recent days." According to Kostikov, the U.S. President "highly appreciated President Yeltsin's diplomatic initiative which resulted in defusing the crisis around Sarajevo." "It was confirmed that decisions on the situation around Sarajevo will be made only in the framework of the UN," Kostikov told Interfax, and affirmed that over the short term consultations in search of a settlement to the Bosnian conflict will continue . He maintained that Boris Yeltsin's Sarajevo initiative reduced the dangers of a crisis which threatened to engulf the entire world and made a peaceful resolution of the conflict a realistic probability. This initiative, he told Interfax, scored a large diplomatic victory for Russia on the European and world arena. "Without firing a shot or threatening anybody, or jeopardizing the lives of its soldiers or spending a ruble Russia won a major battle for its international status," Kostikov said. "Not only did it return to the sources of its historic policy and role in the Balkans and protect Serbs, who are our kin in religion, culture and national spirit, Russia also showed the scale of its influence in Europe and the world," the press secretary said. He said that UN and NATO diplomacy "nearly brought the world to the brink of a world crisis which could have developed into a war in which large countries would be involved." Kostikov said that, unlike his opponents, Yeltsin did not make much noise, but showed who is the undisputed leader in Russia.
