FR940328-0-00014 FR940328-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Part 248 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1513; FR&hyph;2978&hyph;I&hyph;04] Prepayment of a HUD-Insured Mortgage by an Owner of Low-Income Housing: Technical Amendment AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This notice amends the definition of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO), as set out in 24 CFR 248.101, in response to a change in the definition of a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) in the Department's HOME program. In its conference report, Congress requested that the definition of a CBO conform to the definition of a CHDO to the extent practicable. Subsequent to the original publication of the CBO definition, the CHDO definition was changed; as a result, an otherwise acceptable CBO with official CHDO status may not be an eligible CBO under the April 8 interim rule. This notice amends the definition of a CBO by omitting the requirement that the governing board of a rural multi-county CBO be required to contain low-income neighborhood residents from each county of the multi-county area. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 27, 1994.

No. 943, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess.) Congress indicated its intent that, to the extent practicable, the definition of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) should conform to the definition of a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO). Because the definition of a CHDO has been revised to eliminate the requirement that the board of directors of rural, multi-county CHDOs be composed of a representative from each county the CHDO encompassed.
