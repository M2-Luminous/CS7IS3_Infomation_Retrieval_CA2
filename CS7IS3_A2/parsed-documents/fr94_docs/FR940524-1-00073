FR940524-1-00073 FR940524-1-00010 As shown in Figure 1 of this section, the blower crank is replaced by a wooden drum, a (13 cm. (5 inches) in diameter is convenient). This drum is wound with about 12 m. (40 feet) of No. 2 picture cord, b. A weight, c, of sufficient mass to rotate the blower at the desired speed is suspended from this wire cord. A mark is made on the cord about 3 to 4.5 m. (10 to 15 feet) from the weight, c. Another mark is placed at a measured distance (6&hyph;9 m./20&hyph;30 feet is convenient) from the first. These are used to facilitate timing. To determine the torque or horsepower required to operate the blower, the drum is started in rotation manually at or slightly above the speed at which the power measurement is to be made. The blower is then permitted to assume constant speed, and then as the first mark on the wire leaves the drum, a stopwatch is started. The watch is stopped when the second mark leaves the drum. From these data the foot-pounds per minute and the torque may be calculated. Figure 1_Apparatus for measuring power required to operate blower. (42 CFR part 84, subpart J, §84.146) Note: Figure 1 does not appear here, but is identical to the one that appears in 30 CFR 11.124&hyph;3. The full text will be included and printed in the final rule.] §84.147 Type B supplied-air respirator; minimum requirements. No Type B supplied-air respirator shall be approved for use with a blower or with connection to an air supply device at positive pressures. §84.148 Type C supplied-air respirator, continuous flow class; minimum requirements. (a) Respirators tested under this section shall be approved only when they supply respirable air at the pressures and quantities required. (b) The pressure at the inlet of the hose connection shall not exceed 863 kN/m 2 . (125 pounds per square inch gage). (c) Where the pressure at any point in the supply system exceeds 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch gage), the respirator shall be equipped with a pressure-release mechanism that will prevent the pressure at the hose connection from exceeding 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch gage) under any conditions. §84.149 Type C supplied-air respirator, demand and pressure demand class; minimum requirements. (a) Respirators tested under this section shall be approved only when used to supply respirable air at the pressures and quantities required. (b) The manufacturer shall specify the range of air pressure at the point of attachment of the air-supply hose to the air-supply system, and the range of hose length for the respirator. For example, he might specify that the respirator be used with compressed air at pressures ranging from 280&hyph;550 kN/m.2 (40 to 80 pounds per square inch) with from 6 to 76 m. (15 to 250 feet) of air-supply hose. (c) The specified air pressure at the point of attachment of the hose to the air-supply system shall not exceed 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch gage). (d) (1) Where the pressure in the air-supply system exceeds 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch gage), the respirator shall be equipped with a pressure-release mechanism that will prevent the pressure at the point of attachment of the hose to the air-supply system from exceeding 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch gage). (2) The pressure-release mechanism shall be set to operate at a pressure not more than 20 percent above the manufacturer's highest specified pressure. For example, if the highest specified pressure is 863 kN/m.2 (125 pounds per square inch), the pressure-release mechanism would be set to operate at a maximum of 1,035 kN/m.2 (150 pounds per square inch). §84.150 Air-supply line tests; minimum requirements. Air supply lines employed on Type A, Type B, and Type C supplied-air respirators shall meet the minimum test requirements set forth in Table 8 of this subpart.
