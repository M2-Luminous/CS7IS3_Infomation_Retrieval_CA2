Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance is cautiously assessing the feasibility of allowing overseas branches of Taiwan banks to do business with overseas branches of mainland Chinese banks, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said Monday [22 May]. Li made the statement at a seminar on Mainland China's economic and financial affairs, which was jointly sponsored by the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the banking institute. Under the proposal, however, direct links between Taiwan banks and mainland Chinese banks would still be banned. The vice minister noted that five domestic banks -- Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, Chiao Tung Bank, and the International Commercial Bank of China -- have applied to the ministry to do business with overseas branches of mainland banks. The banks must submit information concerning what the relationship between their overseas branches and overseas mainland banks would be, including agreeing to a place outside of Taiwan, Mainland China, or Hong Kong where legal disputes could be settled. Hua Nan Bank, which maintains a branch in Hong Kong, is very likely to become the first Taiwan bank to forge a cooperative relationship with mainland counterparts, including the Bank of China, once its application is approved by the ministry, Li elaborated. MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian said that increased cross-Strait banking ties would expand funding channels for Taiwan investors on the mainland, but that whether the proposal gets final approval is dependent on the extent to which it would help make Taiwan more competitive and how it would affect indirect cross-Strait trade.
