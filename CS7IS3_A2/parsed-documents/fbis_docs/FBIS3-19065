However, he expressed the view that one cannot speak of significant progress in the negotiations. Speaking after a meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis this morning, Lamb noted that even the people who oppose aspects of the confidence-building measures should realize that the proposals for the measures are a reality and that these proposals are on the negotiating table. Responding to a question, though, on the end-of-March deadline for conclusion of an agreement on the confidence-building measures, Lamb was unclear about maintaining it. He said that the procedure must advance quickly but with care. Time, he noted, is an important aspect but all should feel comfortable in the negotiations and there should be no feeling that the process moves hastily. The target, Lamb said, is not so much the deadline but for progress in the procedure as quickly as possible.
