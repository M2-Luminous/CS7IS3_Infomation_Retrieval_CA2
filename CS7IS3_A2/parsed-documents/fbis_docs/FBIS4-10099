The government will not hesitate to resort to the law." Thus, he referred to peasant leaders who held a group of IBR technicians hostage in the settlement of General Resquin on 7 April. The minister said: "Sometimes people are too intolerant, but no one can take the law in their own hands. No one can impose his own kind of justice," the minister warned. Podesta said we are faced with "a public offense" and the government will act accordingly. The minister added it is the responsibility of Attorney General Luis Escobar Faella to bring those responsible to trial. Asked if the situation will interrupt the negotiations currently underway between the government and peasants, Podesta said: "The peasant leaders siting at the negotiating table with the government cannot be held responsible for what other peasants do on their own." Asked about the announcement that peasants will again close roads, the minister said: "The police will enforce the law. If there is a court order, we will use force, without a doubt." Returning to the issue of the General Resquin "kidnappers," Podesta said: "Those responsible have names and we will press charges against them, without doubt." Supreme Court Justice Jose Alberto Correa agreed with Podesta. He said the incident is a public offense, adding that the crime of kidnapping is clearly defined in the Penal Code. Correa also said the attorney general may very well act on its own to seek justice when laws are violated.
