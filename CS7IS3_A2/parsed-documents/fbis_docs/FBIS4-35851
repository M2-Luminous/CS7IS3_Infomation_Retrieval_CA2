Dr. al-Majali also spoke about where the government stood on regional developments. House Speaker Tahir al-Masri, told journalists after the meeting that one of the topics that figured prominently at the session was the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. The prime minister, said al-Masri, underscored the importance of these ties and Jordan's keenness to maintain coordination that advances, first, the Palestinian cause and the new Palestinian situation and, second, the interests of the two countries. The prime minister said the present level of coordination fell short of expectations and has not been as effective as we would have liked. The prime minister, added al-Masri, stressed that Jordan was committed to a role of support for the Palestinian cause, no matter what the obstacles, and free from any ambitions or any attempt to dominate. The prime minister, according to al-Masri, had paid tribute to Jordanian-Egyptian relations. He emphasized that the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee had helped solidify these ties. Relations with Syria also have a special significance, given that the two countries' stands were similar and complementary on the negotiations and the potential for bilateral and regional cooperation. The prime minister also said at the session that Jordan stood for a halt to fighting in brotherly Yemen and a hands-off policy. Jordan was against taking sides and for legitimacy and unity. Al- Masri further noted that the prime minister had vigorously denied 'Ali Salim al-Bid's contention that Jordan was extending assistance to the Yemeni Government in Sanaa. He regretted that such an unjust charge should have been made by al-Bid against Jordan, which had given his majesty the king a mandate to take whatever measures he deemed would advance Yemen's unity. All that Jordan did was to airlift Jordanian and other nationals from Yemen on purely humanitarian grounds to spare them the risks involved in a war situation, explained the house speaker. The prime minister, went on al-Masri, reported to the deputies on the state of the negotiations between Jordan and Israel and the agenda of the meeting to be held in Washington tomorrow. He stressed that Jordan adheres to its declared constants. There will not be a separate deal on the Jordanian front, the prime minister was quoted as emphasizing by the house speaker.
