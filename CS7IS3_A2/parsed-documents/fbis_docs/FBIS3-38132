Demand is being slowed down by three factors: "zero wage rounds," growing unemployment, and increasing public expenditure with stagnating social benefits cutting purchasing power. This has been pointed out by research institutes the Ifo and the German Institute for Economic Research [DIW], as well as the Association of German Retailers (HDE). Gross wages and salaries are expected to go up by an average of 1.6 percent in 1994, the latest weekly report of the DIW says, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in 1993. The Munich-based Ifo Institute expects similar figures: In view of growing pension contributions and other fees, employees' net take-home pay will be 1.5 percent down on last year, a cut of 10 billion German marks [DM], the researchers say. This takes into account declining employment figures, which will result in an estimated loss of earnings of some DM20 billion, according to the Ifo. The HDE thinks that this means bleak prospects for their trade: "Contrary to various graffiti in the toilets [Latrinengeruschte], existing conditions will not allow the retail trade to recover quickly from the trough," HDE manager Hubertus Tessar said before the "Premiere" trade fair in Frankfurt. After a decline in turnover by a nominal 2.5 percent, a real 4.5 percent, to DM760 billion, he thinks that the 1994 figures will not show much improvement: "The purchasing power of German consumers will decrease below the 1990 level." Owing to this development, some 30,000 jobs will be lost in the retail trade by December. Tessar does not think much of Bonn politicians. Not only does the state plunder the purses of private households by means of higher taxes, but the latest deregulation plans -- especially yesterday's decision to abolish the rebate law and the relaxation of shop-closing regulations -- "encourage concentration and endanger innumerable medium-size retail shops." In connection with the risks to the economy resulting from this, the Berlin-based DIW warns against a "zero round" in wage policy. In contrast to "expected wage settlements of approximately 2 percent," this would result in "declining demand, and thus a fall in capacity utilization." This "will not make companies step up investment." In addition, the government's austerity policy aggravates the slack demand, and monetary policy does not do much in terms of countering this by way of cutting interest rates. On the other hand, says the DIW, in the event of a "zero round," prices "would not go up much less than with the expected wage settlements, owing to the great impact of administrative price increases and rent increases." The Ifo Institute is somewhat more optimistic. It says that the economic climate has improved recently. Equipment and capital investment should go up by 2 percent in 1994. West German exporters could expect gains "particularly in markets outside West Europe." In private consumption, the Ifo expects a real decline of 1 percent.
