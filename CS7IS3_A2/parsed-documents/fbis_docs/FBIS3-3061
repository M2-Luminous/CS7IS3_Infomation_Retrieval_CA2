The meeting, sponsored by the CPC Central Committee Organization Department [CPCCCOD], focused on how to explore new ways to improve organizational work through investigation and study under the conditions of developing a socialist market economy. CPCCCOD Director Lu Feng and Deputy Director Zhao Zongnai spoke at the meeting. Principal leading comrades of Jiangsu Province, the Wuxi Party Committee, and the Wuxi Government attended the meeting. As reform is deepening in all fields of endeavor, and as a socialist market economic system is being gradually established, a large number of new situations and problems have arisen in organizational work. Appropriate measures desperately need to be adopted through investigations and studies so as to further usher in a new situation of organizational work and to provide organizational guarantees for the establishment of a socialist market economic system as well as for reform, development, and stability. To this end, the CPCCCOD convoked the meeting to specially study how to further improve organization departments' investigations and studies as well as their macroeconomic guidance. At the meeting, Comrade Lu Feng delivered a speech on how to energetically encourage the practice of conducting investigations and studies, how to provide better macroeconomic guidance, and how to practically improve organizational work under the new situation. First, he pointed out: Organization departments at all levels must have a clear understanding of the situation; must familiarize themselves with the overall situation of the work of the entire party; must proceed from the overall situation of the work to consider how to improve organizational work; and must deepen reform of the organizational and cadre systems through further emancipation of their minds and changes of their concepts. Energetically increasing efforts to conduct investigations and studies and to provide better macroeconomic guidance by organization departments at all levels is a fundamental measure for the improvement of organizational work as well as a basic method for the improvement of work style and for the enhancement of the level of organizational work. Lu Feng stressed: While conducting investigations and studies, and while endeavoring to provide better macroeconomic guidance, organization departments must always firmly bear in mind the theme of strengthening and improving party building as well as party leadership. They must succeed in integrating the emancipation of the mind by seeking truth from facts under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; must discuss and handle important affairs by taking into consideration the overall situation; must spend time on gaining an in-depth understanding of the real situation so as to familiarize themselves with the situation, find out exactly where the problems exist, and come up with practical measures for improvement; must display initiativeness and creativeness; and must pay attention to grasping a few conspicuous problems and dealing with them until they are solved so as to create new experiences. Leading comrades of organization departments at all levels must take the lead in conducting investigations and studies so as to gain the initiative in carrying out their work. Lu Feng urged comrades of organization departments to have a strong sense of responsibility and a strong sense of having undertaken a mission; to boldly explore, work industriously, increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies, and provide better economic guidance; and to usher in a new situation of organizational work. At the meeting, Zhao Zongnai delivered a speech entitled "Study New Situations and Solve New Problems With the Spirit of Reform in Order To Provide Organizational Guarantees for the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System." He pointed out: An important historical mission of our organizational work is to provide organizational guarantees for the establishment of a socialist market economic system. If the organization front wants to shoulder this historical mission and continuously usher in new situations, it must make efforts in many areas. A very important one among them is to increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies as well as to provide better macroeconomic guidance. He urged organization departments at all levels to energetically encourage the practice of conducting investigations and studies; to integrate such investigations and studies with the establishment of rules and regulations; and to turn the achievements scored from conducting investigations and studies into measures, methods, rules, and regulations for reform. At the meeting, 10 provinces and municipalities--including Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Shandong--gave briefings on their experiences in conducting investigations and studies; they also conducted extensive exchanges at group meetings. As a result, comrades attending the meeting gained a further understanding of the necessity and importance for organization fronts to increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies and to provide better macroeconomic guidance; they also decided on the tasks for their respective studies with full confidence. Among those who participated in the meeting were comrades in charge of organization departments of the party committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government across the country; directors of research offices under the party committees mentioned above; comrades in charge of or research office directors of organization departments of party committees of 10 cities; and comrades in charge of the organization, personnel, or research departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Personnel, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
