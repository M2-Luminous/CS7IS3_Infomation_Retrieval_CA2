FR940516-2-00100 FR940516-2-00068 [Docket No. 40&hyph;8681] UMETCO Minerals Corporation Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Notice is hereby given that by Petition dated January 13, 1994, Thomas W. Clawson, on behalf of Envirocare of Utah, Inc. (Petitioner), requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) hold an informal hearing concerning the August 2, 1993, approval of an amendment to Umetco Minerals Corporation's (Umetco) materials license pursuant to 10 CFR 2.1205 and institute pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 a proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Umetco's materials license, pending the preparation of either an environmental assessment pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) or an environmental report under 10 CFR 51.60, and while a determination is made whether the amended license complies with controlling Commission rules and with the standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, as required under 42 U.S.C.A. 2114(a)(2). As basis for the request, the Petitioner asserts that the Commission has allowed Umetco to convert the White Mesa Mill facility into a major commercial byproduct materials disposal facility without a current environmental analysis in violation of NEPA and the Commission's environmental regulations and which does not have to comply with current environmental protection standards. By Memorandum and Order of the Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board dated March 4, 1994, the Petitioner's request for an informal hearing pursuant to 10 CFR 2.1205 was denied. Accordingly, the Petitioner's request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards. As provided by ยง2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable period of time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 3rd day of May 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Robert M. Bernero, Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
