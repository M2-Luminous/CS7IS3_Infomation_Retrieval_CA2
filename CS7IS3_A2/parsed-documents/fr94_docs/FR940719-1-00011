FR940719-1-00011 FR940719-1-00003 (ii) That seizure and forfeiture would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States. Section 12.39, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 12.39) currently describes the role of the ITC in determining whether an importer has engaged in unfair methods of competition or practices, and the actions the ITC can order in response to the finding of such practices. Among those actions are exclusion from entry and entry under bond of articles imported in violation of fair trade provisions, both of which are cited in §12.39(b). The authority of the ITC to exclude articles from entry into the United States under section 337 is described in §12.39(b)(1). Section 12.39(b)(2) permits excluded articles to be entered under a single entry bond pending the finalization of the ITC determination. Finally, §12.39(b)(3) requires, among other things, that district directors notify each importer or consignee of articles entered under bond pursuant to §12.39(b)(2) when the determination becomes final, and indicate that the entry of articles is refused. This document proposes to amend §12.39(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 12.39(b)) to reflect both the authority of the ITC to issue seizure and forfeiture orders against articles and like articles for which exclusion orders have been issued under certain conditions and the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce those orders. The proposed amendment also sets forth the procedures that Customs, on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, will follow when enforcing the order. The proposed procedures provide that when the three statutory conditions are met that allow the ITC to issue a seizure and forfeiture order, and the ITC notifies the Secretary of the Treasury of the issuance of such order, the Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Operations, will notify all ports of entry of the order and identify both the article subject to the order and the owners, importers or consignees who are subject to the order. These seizure orders would be issued by the ITC against specific importers, or their agents and consignees, and would apply only to articles which have been denied entry, and for which the importer has been notified in writing. The proposed amendment also contains procedures that are to be followed by parties having a proprietary interest in articles which are seized pursuant to ITC seizure orders and who wish to file a petition for relief. Comments Before adopting the proposed amendment, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), §1.4, Treasury Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and §103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street NW., Suite 4000, Washington, DC. Regulatory Flexibility Act For the reasons set forth in the preamble, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq .), it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Executive Order 12866 This amendment does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 12866.
