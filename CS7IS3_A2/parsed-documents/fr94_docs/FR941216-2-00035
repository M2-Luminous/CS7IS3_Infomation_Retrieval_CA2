SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 15, 29, October 21, 28 and November 4, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 F.R. 36168, 38586, 53141, 54169 and 55256) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities, military resale commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities, military resale commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action will not have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities, military resale commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities, military resale commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities, military resale commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Napkin, Table, Paper 8540&hyph;01&hyph;350&hyph;6417 8540&hyph;01&hyph;351&hyph;2150 Military Resale Commodities Broom, Corn M.R. 960 Mop, Deck M.R. 961 Mop, Roller and Refill M.R. 930 M.R. 940 (refill) Services Janitorial/Custodial, Federal Complex, Floors 6, 7 and 8, Raleigh, North Carolina Janitorial/Custodial, Naval Ordnance Center, Pacific Division, Detachment Port Hadlock, Port Hadlock, Washington Janitorial/Custodial, Federal Building, Huntington, West Virginia Janitorial/Custodial, Sidney L.
