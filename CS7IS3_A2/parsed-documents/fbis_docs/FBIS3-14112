In a cable sent to leader President Saddam Husayn on the Nauruz festivities, the Political Bureau added that the Kurdistan Democratic Party seizes the opportunity granted by this noble occasion to extend to his excellency the leader president the most sublime, sincere, and heartfelt congratulations, and beseeches God Almighty to go grant him continued good health, to protect him as an asset for all free people, and to render the Nauruz a feast on which the will of the well-meaning Kurds will triumph against the forces of agentry and deception associated with the United States, the enemy of mankind. The clique of agents and traitors has flouted all honorable values. It is indifferent to the harm caused to the Kurdistan Region and the Iraqi people, and to the injustice and wrong done them. The Political Bureau of the Kurdistan Democratic Party added: On Nauruz, Jawal Haddath, a righteous son of the Kurdish people, brandished his sword in the face of the tyrant Izdahak al-Dahhak to end his tyranny and bring about security and stability throughout Kurdistan. At present, you are the hero of the age. You have set an example for free men of the world. And here you are brandishing your sword, the sword of right, in the face of the unscrupulous tyrants, atheistic infidels, and all misled agents and traitors in defense of not only the Iraqi people, but also tortured humanity and free people of the world, who are suffering at the hands of the tyrannical ones. You have triumphed against them. Hence, the eternal annals of history will document your bright and heroic feats. The cable went on to say: It is true that the agents have rendered the situation in Kurdistan intolerable due to the lawlessness and sabotage they have caused to serve their masters. But, it remains to be said that your Kurdish people will continue to honor their pledge. They will remain sleepless until Kurdistan restores its security and stability and kicks out traitors and their masters so that it may return to the laps of the homeland, joyful and proud. The day of victory is imminent. Neither the unfair embargo, nor the machinations of colonialists, or the treason of traitors are capable of bringing your Iraqi people, be they Arabs or Kurds, to their knees. The Iraqi people will continue to hold their heads high. The banners of pride, glory, and dignity will continue to flutter throughout Iraq as long as you are its leader.
