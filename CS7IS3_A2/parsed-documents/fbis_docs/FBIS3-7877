With the adoption of the programme for early elections, the date of which has not been set yet, the MKDH became the first party in Slovakia to have such a programme. Bugar said the programme reacted to the current political situation and to the creation of the independent Slovak state which is not dealt with in the previous programme. Bugar said "we want to live in Slovakia, but we need clear legislative guarantees. We expect to be equal partners of Slovaks enjoying equal opportunities.... There is no reason for the Hungarians to stress their loyalty to the state more than the Slovaks." Bugar called President Michal Kovac "the only constitutional official trying to understand the Hungarian ethnic minority." The congress was also attended by Geza Entz, the Hungarian Government's political state secretary and head of the Government Office department for Hungarians living abroad, and Surjan Laszlo, Hungarian Social Welfare Minister and deputy chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union.
