It also analyzed the impact of tax reform on production and opertaion of Qinghai enterprises. The State Council decided to introduce tax reform throughout the country beginning 1 January this year. It is a comprehensive and overall structural reform. The purpose of this reform is to establish a new taxation system which corresponds with China's national conditions and international practice, gives expression to market economic demands, is beneficial to macrocontrol and regulation, and is favorable to economic development. To ensure the smooth implementation of the new taxation system in Qinghai, taxation departments in the province have run many training courses since October last year for taxation cadres, factory directors and managers, as well as financial and taxation personnel. These training courses have enabled most taxation cadres to understood the importance of the current taxation system reform and the main content of this reform. Now a new taxation system is being implemented. Because the current taxation system reform involves a wide range of work and is being carried out on a large scale, taxation departments in the province have conducted propaganda among the people. But some people still think that the introduction of this new measure will cause price hikes. Some individual traders have also raised their commodity prices, and this has caused unhealthy results. A person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau explained: The current taxation system reform is mainly aimed at adjusting the tax structure, but the overall tax rate is not rising. In a socialist market economy, organizing revenue for the state still remains the most important and basic task. As the state is facing financial difficulties at present, delegating powers to the lower levels and allowing more profit retention for them are difficult to avoid. Therefore taxation system reform is conducive to strengthening the central authorities' macrocontrol and regulatory ability and is beneficial to increasing the two proportions [expansion unknown]. The current taxation system reform will, in varying degrees, cause a change in the composition of tax sources and revenues. To put it more specifically, revenues will change between tax categories, revenues in different tax categories will increase or decrease, and taxation rates in different trades will also increase or decrease. Naturally, taxation rates in different enterprises will increase or decrease, too. All these are normal, and this kind of structural adjustment is inevitable. Merging some old tax categories, adopting some new tax categories, and reforming some of the existing tax categories so that categories and sources will change and tax collections from different trades will also change are structural adjustments which will not affect the total volume of taxation. Therefore, taken as a whole, the total volume of taxation will not increase, thus, enterprises' tax burden will not increase, either.
