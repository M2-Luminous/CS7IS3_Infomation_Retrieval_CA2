The plan was to meet Boris Yeltin in Moscow en route for New York, but now Nursultan Nazarbayev has canceled that, we were told today by the Kazakhstani president's press service. Andrey Kondrashov reports. [Kondrashov] This latest rejection by the president of Kazakhstan is not, as it seemed, linked to the upcoming visit to Almaty by Andrey Kozyrev. The Kazakh leader canceled his talks with the Russian president much earlier. In addition, the arrival of Russia's Foreign Ministry chief in the republic will not by any means resolve all the problems between the two states. Observers put this down to Kazakhstan's unwillingness to hold talks on military cooperation in particular. The stumbling block, as before, is Baykonur. Kazakhstan does not want to lease it to Russia on the previous terms. Having declared the space site to be its own property, the republic wants, I quote, to hive off only the military part of it for the Russian military, leaving the civilian part for itself to put to commercial use. Since Russia continues to maintain all of Baykonur, it quite naturally sees this option as unacceptable. Moreover, the duration of the lease on Baykonur and the cosmodrome's status have yet to be decided. In addition to this, the very presence of Russian military units on Kazakhstan territory is a breach of the constitution. And, Kazakhstan has still not elected a parliament settle the issue. It looks as if Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty has simpler aims. Even before his arrival, Nursultan Nazarbayev announced that Kozyrev will not get him to introduce dual citizenship. However, the president of Kazakhstan has in advance drawn up a compromise for Russia. Instead of dual citizenship, he intends to propose to Andrey Kozyrev a simplified procedure for Kazakhstan's ethnic Russians to obtain Russian citizenship.
