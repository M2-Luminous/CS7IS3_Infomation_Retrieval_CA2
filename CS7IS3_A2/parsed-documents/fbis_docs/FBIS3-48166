Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with visiting Deputy Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Tom Hubbard and shared concern that North Korea not be allowed to delay much longer in inspection negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He asked that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher ask China to exert active influence on North Korea on the nuclear issue, Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, said in the post-meeting briefing. Christopher and his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, are due to meet in Paris this week. Hubbard had come to Seoul Sunday after accompanying Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on an Asian tour. He is the top U.S. representative to regular contacts with North Korea in New York. The U.S. official worried at the delay in North Korea-U.S. inspection talks and declared there will be no negotiations of any sort between North Korea and the United States without the Pyongyang-IAEA agreement first. Hubbard called China's role so far as having been constructive and promised to seek Beijing's powerful influence on North Korea at the Paris meeting of the foreign ministers. Hubbard left for Washington after afternoon talks with South Korean Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and chief Presidential Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong Chong-uk.
