FR940106-2-00049 FR940106-2-00031 Sections 201 through 903 of the act (21 U.S.C. 321 through 394) contain numerous grants of authority to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). The Secretary has, in general, delegated this authority to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs with authority to redelegate to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations and other officers of FDA (see 21 CFR 5.10 and 5.20). The authority conferred in section 306 of the act is delegated to the Commissioner, even though the legislation formally names the Secretary. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations (21 CFR 5.20(b) and 5.20(g)(1)). The notice of proposed debarment and opportunity for a hearing letter received by Mr. Brancato on December 12, 1992, was issued legally under authority delegated to FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. The decision to propose debarment of Mr. Brancato was appropriately based upon the following relevant considerations: (1) The nature of the conviction (a felony under Federal law) and (2) the conduct underlying the conviction (conduct relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products) (see section I. of this document). Because the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, an authorized designee of the Secretary, considered the relevant factors in making the determination to propose debarment, Mr. Brancato's claim that the notice of his proposed debarment does not reflect consideration by the Secretary or his designee fails to raise any issue as to the validity of this proceeding and fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. C. Mr. Brancato's Conviction Subjects Him to the Mandatory Debarment Provisions Not to the Permissive Debarment Provisions Mr. Brancato further contends that the conduct for which he was convicted is more appropriately conduct subject to permissive debarment under 21 U.S.C. 306(b)(2)(B) of the act rather than to mandatory debarment. Mr. Brancato fails to support this statement with an explanation or further argument. Section 306(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandates that FDA debar an individual if the Secretary finds that the individual has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct: (1) Relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of any drug product; and (2) otherwise relating to the regulation of any drug product under the act. As discussed above, Mr. Brancato's conviction for receiving unlawful gratuities triggers the section 306 (a)(2) (A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandatory debarment provisions. An individual convicted of this crime will not be considered a candidate for permissive debarment unless FDA finds that the conduct underlying the conviction did not relate to the development or approval, or the regulation of any drug product (see section 306(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the act). Absent such a finding, mandatory debarment based upon such a conviction must follow. Because FDA finds that the conduct which served the basis for Mr. Brancato's conviction did relate to the development and approval and the regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products, the mandatory provisions, rather than the permissive provisions, are applicable in this case. Mr. Brancato acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law. Furthermore, he does not dispute FDA's finding that the conduct underlying his conviction relates to the development and approval and the regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products. Therefore, Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. D. The Statutory Criteria Pertaining to Permissive Debarment Are Not Relevant to Mr. Brancato's Mandatory Debarment Action Mr. Brancato states the following: (1) There is no evidence that the Secretary considered the statutory criteria for determining appropriateness and period of debarment for nonmandatory (permissive) debarment, (2) Mr. Brancato took voluntary steps to mitigate the impact of his offense on the public, and (3) Mr. Brancato has no prior convictions. Mr. Brancato fails to support these three statements with further argument. As discussed, the mandatory debarment provisions, not the permissive debarment provisions, apply in this case. The criteria pertaining to permissive debarment, which include evidence of mitigation and prior convictions, may not be considered in making the decision to initiate mandatory debarment proceedings. Because Mr. Brancato argues for the consideration of irrelevant permissive debarment criteria, not applicable to Mr. Brancato's mandatory debarment action, his claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. E. Mr. Brancato's Plea Agreement With the Government Does Not Preclude His Debarment In his next argument, Mr. Brancato states that his guilty plea and cooperation with the government were predicated on the assumption that no civil penalties would flow from his cooperation and that debarment would render his guilty plea subject to collateral attack and jeopardizes the integrity of the judicial process. He does not support this claim with evidence or citations.
