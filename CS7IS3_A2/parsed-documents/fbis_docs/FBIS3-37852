Parades have been postponed until better times. Out of 1,200 soldiers and officers, 400 have been dispatched to Sarajevo from here. [Podkolzin] Today they have already been fully deployed there, they have been deployed normally. There is electricity. So far there is no heating, but it was promised that in the course of the next two days they would be supplied with heating. The battalion has already received a combat task. Today the battalion is serving in the main areas: it is guarding one area for the collection of the Serb weapons under an accord which was reached between the Muslims and the Serbs -- and one group is today serving at Sarajevo airport. Well, and the others have received the task of patrolling the separation line between the Serbs and the Muslims. I got in touch with General Rose, and he said that on the whole they would be serving in very difficult sectors, difficult areas. We were on the brink of this disaster but both the Serbs and Muslims have carried out their obligations as a result of which the strike was called off, and let's pray that there won't be another one. [Solovyev] Do you think that your battalion will be there for a long time? [Podkolzin] Until they set about the next stage of the cease- fire -- this is the opening of the roads for the delivery of humanitarian aid and other issues -- no less than two months will elapse -- but as a whole, it would appear that the contingent will have to be kept there probably no less than two years; this is my personal opinion.
