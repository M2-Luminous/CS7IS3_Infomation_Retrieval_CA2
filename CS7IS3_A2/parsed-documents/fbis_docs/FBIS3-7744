(Eva Slavkovska) has been elected first deputy chairwoman, (Juraj Molnar) has been elected second chairman of the SNS, and (Zuzana Tvrda) was made central secretary. Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the party, said that, after the extraordinary congress [19-20 February] in Zilina, approximately 10 percent of the over-6,000-strong party left the SNS with Ludovit Cernak [former SNS chairman]. The immediate objective of the party is to revive the party's activity, to start off the work of the new executive, which has shrunk from 19 to nine members, and to get ready for the setting up of a preelection coalition. In this respect, Jozef Prokes said that the SNS would not enter into coalition with the Party of the Democratic Left, the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, and Coexistence. He was not able to say yet who would be the election partner of the SNS. Jozef Prokes went on to say that parliamentary elections were the fastest and most stable solution to the current situation. As to the future orientation of the SNS on the political scene, Jozef Prokes said that the party wanted to clearly declare its views. He said the party would be more straightforward than up until now because the past policy of Ludovit Cernak was not clear, and it could not answer the question of whether the SNS was in coalition or in opposition.
