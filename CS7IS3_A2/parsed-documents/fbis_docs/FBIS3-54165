This is not the first time that Western circles and mass media have tried to create problems and commotions in pursuance of their anti-Iranian and anti-Islamic objectives. After some time during which Iran was portrayed as the culprit in the assassination of one of the defunct Democratic Party leaders, the German mass media and officials were forced--after extensive investigations--to officially admit the absence of proof on Iran's role in this assassination. The French Government's recent release of two people who were accused of assassinating Kazem Rajavi, who was assassinated by unidentified persons, shows that such accusations cannot harm Iran's reputation. It seems that there are circles in the Western countries that are trying to create a commotion with baseless allegations and thus to provoke public opinion in Europe, especially in Germany, against Iranians and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The remarks by (Barchal), governor of one of the German states shows that this propaganda policy against the Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing; according to a report published in BILD, (Barchal's) brother, who was an arms dealer, died in a suspicious manner years ago. The group in charge of investigating the case has claimed that an Iranian group was involved in the assassination of this person in Switzerland. But the BILD report gives no facts to prove that Iranian officials were involved in this act. It seems that in the current conditions such propaganda aimed at harming Iran's relations with European countries and especially with Germany is one of the major topics on the agenda of American, Israeli, and British espionage agencies. Calculated steps are needed to neutralize such extensive and calculated propaganda, which has been going on with specific objectives in mind. For a governor of one of Germany's states to threaten to assassinate Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni is nothing but a terrorist act, and the German Government should clarify its stance on such threats.
