FR941107-2-00102 FR941107-2-00053 National Toxicology Program National Toxicology Program (NTP) Board of Scientific Counselors' Meetings; Announcement of NTP Draft Technical Reports Projected for Public Review From November 1994 Through Summer 1996. To earlier inform the public and allow interested parties to comment or obtain information on long-term toxicology and carcinogenesis studies prior to public peer review, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) again publishes in the Federal Register a current listing of draft Technical Reports projected for evaluation by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselor's Technical Reports Review Subcommittee during their next four meetings from November 1994 through the summer of 1996. We plan to continue updating the listing with announcements in the Federal Register once or twice a year. The next meeting date is November 29, 1994. Specific dates for 1995 and 1996 meetings will be established at a later time. The attached Table 1 lists draft Technical Reports for long-term studies on chemicals within known or approximate dates of reviews and includes Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry numbers, primary use, route of administration, species, exposure levels, and NTP report numbers (if assigned). Technical Reports of short-term toxicity studies are currently reviewed by mail; however, when necessary may be reviewed in opening meetings. The attached Table 2 lists the draft Technical Reports of short-term toxicity studies tentatively projected for review by mail during 1994 and also includes Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry numbers, primary use, route of administration, species, exposure levels, and NTP report numbers (if assigned). Those interested in having more information about any of the studies listed in this announcement, should contact Central Data Management as early as possible by telephone or by mail to: MD&hyph;A0&hyph;01, NIEHS, P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina 27709 (919&hyph;541&hyph;3419). The program would welcome receiving toxicology and carcinogenesis data from completed, ongoing or planned studies by others as well as current production data, human exposure information, and use and use patterns. The Executive Secretary, Dr. Larry G. Hart, P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, telephone 919/541&hyph;3971, will furnish final agendas and other program information prior to a meeting, and summary minutes subsequent to a meeting. Attachments. Dated: October 31, 1994. Richard Griesemer, Deputy Director, National Toxcicology Program.
