[passage omitted] Our correspondent Jan Smihula interviewed Ladislav Pittner shortly before the minister's departure from the Russian capital. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Smihula] Mr. Minister, your talks with your Russian counterpart lasted 30 minutes longer than originally planned. Does this mean that some disagreements, problems have emerged? How do you assess today's talks? [Pittner] Our talks lasted longer not because of disagreements, but because of discussing further spheres of cooperation on which agreements are being drafted by our experts for signing. Above all, this concerns the issue of police attaches who are to work in our two countries. A Russian police attache based in Bratislava will probably be accredited to also work in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Regarding our police attache, I was promised that he will be given opportunities to widen his activities to reach other former Soviet republics. The other issue concerned archives and we received full support from the minister for gaining access to the archives to see, for instance, files on people taken against their will to Russia. [passage omitted] We were also promised help in searching for one part of the President Jozef Tiso [World War II pro-Nazi leader] archive. [passage omitted]
