The official said that in the first quarter of 1994, Shanghai approved the establishment of 15 businesses involving investment by multi-national companies, including the McDonald's Company of the United States and the Sony Corporation of Japan. By the end of March, Shanghai had approved the undertaking of 472 major projects, involving 10.24 billion U.S. dollars in total overseas investment, he said. Multi-national companies began to invest in Shanghai in 1980, he said. The Swiss elevator manufacturer, Schindler Holding Company, took the lead, and was followed by the Foxboro Company, of the United States, the Volkswagen Company, of Germany, and the Bell Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium. He said that 60 percent of the 129 multi-national companies began investing in Shanghai in 1993. He praised these companies for helping speed up the construction of the Pudong new area and build Shanghai into a major economic, financial and trade center in Asia. The Du Pont Company, of the United States, began to cooperate with Shanghai in the 1970s, in the form of merchandise trade, he said. In the 1980s, the company began transferring technology to its business partners in Shanghai. In the 1990s it began combining direct investment with technology transfer, the official said. To date, the company has set up a joint venture involving at least 10 million U.S. dollars in investment in the Pudong new area, where flexible policies are being pursued to encourage Chinese and overseas investors. It is now negotiating with research institutes in Shanghai on co- production of substitutes for freon (used in refrigerators and aerosols), he said. In 1992 the Sharp Corporation of Japan launched a joint venture -- capable of building 200,000 air conditioners a year -- in the Pudong new area, he said. The company has decided to increase its investment in Shanghai and transfer production of other electrical appliances to the city, he said. The Bell Telephone Equipment Company, of Belgium, plans to site all its new investment projects in China in the Jinqiao Export processing zone in Pudong. The American Telegram and Telephone Company has set up three joint ventures in Shanghai, the official said. These ventures have achieved high economic returns by combining American managerial expertise with specific conditions in Shanghai, he said. In 1993, the American company's business volume, including economic returns from their joint ventures, in China amounted to 200 million U.S. dollars, half of which came from its Shanghai-based ventures, he said.
