At each candidate standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the average consumer of $70.39 for the representative class of electric water heaters with no impact on gas water heaters, which remain at the base case at this level; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $81.04 and $19.13 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively; standard level 3, by $974.88 and $29.81; standard level 4, by $1024.20 and $29.81; standard level 5, by $1024.20 and minus $3.77; standard level 6, by $907.99 and minus $3.77; standard level 7, by $907.99 and minus $13.12; and standard level 8, by $907.99 and minus $437.41. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that no standard level, other than levels 5 through 8 for gas water heaters, would cause any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.5 and 4.6. The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of water heaters. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for all classes of water heaters, standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.19 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;8 are $0.99 billion, $40.17 billion, $42.92 billion, $42.68 billion, $38.15 billion, $39.91 billion and $32.50 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.
