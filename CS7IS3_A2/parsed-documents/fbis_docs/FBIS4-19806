On Thursday [21 April], Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel stated in Bonn that the continuing aggression by Serbian combat troops and their political leaders' constantly broken promises grossly violate the basic rules of humanity and international law. The military and economic countermeasures mentioned by Clinton are part of the options of the allies to bring the Bosnian-Serb leadership to its senses. The Federal Government calls for close political coordination between the European Union, NATO, the United Nations, the United States, and Russia. The Federal Government particularly welcomes the intention expressed by Clinton for political coordination, above all with Russia, to prepare further steps. This is the basic condition for clear and consistent action against the forces of aggression, Vogel stated.
