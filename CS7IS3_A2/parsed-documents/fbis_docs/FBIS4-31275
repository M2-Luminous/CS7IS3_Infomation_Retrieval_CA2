Research conducted so far indicates that the level of interest shown in the elections is not too high, especially in rural areas and small towns. It is precisely in those areas that the deadline for registering electoral lists has been postponed because there were no volunteers to be candidates to the gmina [small administrative unit] councils. It seems that coalition politicians are showing moderate interest in the election campaign and that they leave its implementation up to local activists. Most probably they thought that they had carried out all possible propaganda measures for the sake of their parties earlier in the Sejm. On the other hand, the efforts of extraparliamentary right-wing parties are concentrated precisely on the elections and on warning the voters against an impending disaster which, according to those right-wing parties, a potential postcommunist victory would be. Kazimierz M. Ujazdowski, leader of the Conservative Coalition, says that the left-wing program is directed against self-government, while a left-wing victory in the elections may mean a return to power of people with shameful pasts. He added that the main goal of the right-wing camp in the communal elections is to prevent postcommunist forces from taking over local authority in Poland and an effective fight with the policies of gmina socialism. These declarations are characteristic of the election campaign being conducted by the right wing. Donald Tusk, deputy chairman of the opposition Freedom Union [UW], is less emphatic in his warnings against the dangers of policies of the governing coalition, and he assures that UW will become a party that will be able to stop state-controlled socialism, which is resurgent in Poland today, while, in the self-government elections, UW will demonstrate it can achieve victory instead of just declaring ideas that are correct and wise. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, leader of the Union of Real Politics, has decided to present a specific program in the campaign, which his local council members promise to implement in the gminas in which they expect to score a victory. He is calling for a repeal of the inheritance tax [podatek spadkowy] and an enfranchisement of residents of communal apartments. All religions of the world unanimously prohibit robbing widows and orphans. The inheritance tax is nothing but an outright immorality, says Korwin-Mikke. The Democratic Left Alliance, as Aleksander Kwasniewski said recently, wants to score electoral success through persistent implementation of the electoral program, which is about striving for political stabilization, a reform of social policies that entails an active battle against unemployment, and using the international situation for Poland's joining European organizations. A majority of electoral programs by parties and coalitions has been voicing slogans that are equally abstract and hardly intelligible to the voters.
