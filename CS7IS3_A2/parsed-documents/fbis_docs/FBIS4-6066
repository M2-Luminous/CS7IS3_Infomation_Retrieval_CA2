REPUBLIKA says the incident in Medan has destroyed the image of the labor movement and expressed hope that the incident will serve as an important lesson for both the government and businessmen. Meanwhile, KOMPAS describes as correct and praiseworthy the remarks made by the chairman of the North Sumatra regional chapter of the Coordinating Agency for the Strengthening of National Stability to the effect that the agency will help solve the issues of the minimum wage and workers' rights because this will lead to a fair and harmonious relationship between workers and employers.
