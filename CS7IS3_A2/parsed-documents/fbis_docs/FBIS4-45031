The newspaper SALAM, which reported this in its 7 Khordad (23 May) issue, noted that the Iran Accounting Court confirmed these figures. The expert from the Majles Accounting Court, Budget and Financial Affairs Commission said that the steel factories are not profitable and do not give an appropriate return. In addition to the fact that the domestic steel market has been saturated, international competition is very difficult for Iran's steel and thus the Islamic Republic of Iran has not been successful exporting its products. He cited the high finished price of Iran's steel as one of the reasons for its lack of export success. Recently the executive director of the Mobarakeh Steel Complex, in an interview with the newspaper RESALAT, called himself "God's replacement on earth" and said that with regard to his specialty, in one sense his position is higher than that of the vice regent and even the Prophet!
