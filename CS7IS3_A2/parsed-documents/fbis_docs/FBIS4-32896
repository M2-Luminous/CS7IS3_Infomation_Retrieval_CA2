[applause] We will complete this work in the next three weeks. The same policy was applied today. The people won. In the next three weeks, Colombia will return to the hands of all Colombians. [applause] The Colombian people have spoken with a strong, convincing voice. Today, you voted for a change. No more of the old promises and the old politics. You have voted for a new leadership above the old political machinery. Millions of Colombians have voted for the future, not for the past. Throughout the country, this wonderful nation, there is a strong desire for change. We have seen our fellow countrymen on the streets. We have heard this in your voices, which have demanded a change, on the street and in your homes. We have felt it in the thousands of hands we have shaken, the many Colombians who have supported us with their hearts. Colombia's time is up. The time has arrived to give the people a better life. The time for a change is at hand. Today, our people sent a message to the guardians of the old politics. [Words indistinct] not along the old, eroded road. We will outline a new course. The vote of the humblest of our fellow countrymen has the same value as that of the most powerful and privileged. The message [applause] is that we are the masters of our own destiny. The message is clear. Do not let yourselves be guided by the great but empty rhetoric. [Words indistinct] because it is backed by a specific, serious, and consistent program to create new and better jobs, stimulate investment and industry, rescue the rural areas and peasants from neglect, lend to those who wish to start their own business, give the benefit of potable water to more than 10 million Colombians, [applause] build 360,000 new social interest homes, carry out the great educational reforms that will give all Colombians an opportunity to prepare themselves and succeed in the difficult and competitive world that awaits them at the turn of the 21st century. [Words indistinct] material welfare but with the soul and our nation. We oppose the legalization of drugs in any form. [applause] This has been, is, and will continue to be my position; the same position I have maintained for 15 years, the one I will continue to maintain as president of all Colombians. [applause] We must set one goal: not to tolerate drugs, drug trafficking, the consumption of drugs, or narcoterrorism. This will not happen overnight or in a couple of months. But this is the path we must take and the one we must seek.
