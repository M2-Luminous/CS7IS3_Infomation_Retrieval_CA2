They freely expressed their views at a forum held by the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office [SCHKMAO] and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY's Hong Kong Branch [XNAHKB] in the past couple of days, thereby demonstrating a great sense of responsibility befitting those who are the masters of their own affairs. The forum for Hong Kong affairs advisers was held in Shenzhen from 2 to 3 March. SCHKMAO Director Lu Ping and XNAHKB Director Zhou Nan presided over the forum and listened to advisers' views. During the forum, the advisers pointed out: Britain's "White Paper" announced recently and its various unilateral sabotages of the talks revealed the deceptive nature of "cooperation with China" -- a phrase that it has kept on repeating. The negative example set by Britain which may serve as a lesson has made more and more Hong Kong people realize the truth and become disillusioned. We must specially watch out for various "actions" on the part of the Hong Kong British authorities, such as making trouble in the economic and banking sectors, before they pull out. Analyzing the series of moves taken by the Hong Kong British authorities in recent years, some advisers believed that Britain's sabotage of Sino-British talks and Hong Kong's smooth transition was planned beforehand for the purpose of leaving a "hot potato" for the special administrative regional government in the future. In this connection, China should make proper preparations to meet various emergencies. The issues of government functionaries' and people's livelihood in Hong Kong also caught the attention of advisers. During the forum, they discussed how to solve the housing, transportation, and public security problems facing ordinary citizens and how to guarantee the support for the aged after they have retired; they made many constructive suggestions. The advisers said: There are only a little more than three years left before China regains its sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. As China and Britain fail to reach an agreement, preparatory work for the special administrative regional government should be accelerated. In this regard, the tasks of the Preliminary Working Committee are particularly important. The arduous tasks should be jointly undertaken by all patriotic Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong with the attitude of those who are the masters of their own affairs. The Hong Kong affairs advisers will also make efforts, communicate with the broad masses of citizens, and make contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition and to its long-term prosperity and stability. In their speeches, relevant persons in charge of the SCHKMAO and XNAHKB who attended the meeting said: The rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people after "97" is possible only with the participation of the Hong Kong people before "97." The advisers' views and suggestions are a concrete embodiment of the active participation by the Hong Kong people; they play a role in promoting the post-transition work and, meanwhile, reflect the prospect of "the rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" as well as the confidence that Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have in marching toward 1997. SCHKMAO Deputy Director Chen Ziying and XNAHKB Deputy Director Qin Wenjun attended the forum.
