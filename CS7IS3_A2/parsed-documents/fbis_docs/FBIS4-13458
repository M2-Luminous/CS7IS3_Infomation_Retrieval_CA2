This is because this phenomenon produces new and categorical evidence that the front of the hostile forces that have imposed the criminal comprehensive blockade is disintegrating. After the split which took place at the UN Security Council and led to the emergence of a majority supporting Iraq's rightful demand that the blockade be lifted, there has been a noticeable increase in the flow of Arab and world figures and delegations arriving into Iraq, both publicly and officially, making the point that they want to assert their support for Iraq and condemnation of the blockade. A quick glance at yesterday's press reports on the visiting delegations and figures is enough to make us realize the great and positive changes which have turned into a phenomenon pleasing Iraq and lovers of freedom and disheartening the slaves of evil and the Satan occupying the White House. The press reports noted the arrival of two Italian economic and parliamentary delegations, a German economic delegation, a French media-commercial delegation, two Belgian delegations, a Jordanian delegation led by a deputy prime minister, a Romanian minister, and Bishop Capucci, who arrived to voice his solidarity. [passage omitted] The public flow of delegations and officials and their unanimous support for Iraq and the expression of their desire to have trade with Iraq has a profound, clear, and significant message. It tells us that the world--both states and institutions--has become weary of and unprepared to tolerate the U.S. excesses anymore. It also shows that the world has freed itself of many of the factors of fear and hesitation, taking moves to condemn the U.S. colonialism and support Iraq. In this vein, the visits to Iraq break the cordon of isolation that the United States has imposed with force and terror. This positive phenomenon complements and supports another phenomenon, which is the rift in the stands of the UN Security Council member states on Iraq. This is because by expressing its support for Iraq, the world public opinion offers support for the states that have changed their stands and begun to demand that the blockade be lifted. Besides, the presence of official trade delegations is yet further evidence that circumstances are getting ripe for the end of the blockade. In the past, foreign companies used to visit Iraq for secret talks on future contracts. But now, they are publicly declaring their decisions regarding Iraq. What does all that mean? It means, among many other things, that the Iraqi people's steadfastness and sacrifices have provided a solid basis for the world to review and reconsider its stands. This is just the beginning. Bill Clinton, who furiously and stupidly watches these developments, should prepare his cheek, which is swollen from domestic slaps, for a new slap from Iraq, which might make him weep, after he has begun to see how the world is gradually siding with Iraq and opposing his criminal plans to annihilate the Iraqis. Clinton: Drowned as you are in an ocean of crises and scandals, pause for a while and consider your future. The Iraq storm is coming, there is no question about it. You are vulnerable, and can take no more slaps.
