(Misac)'s activity can be compared to a merchant getting ready to buy a tiger's hide. This is France's policy and preparation for Cambodia in line with its obsolete colonialist system. During this trip to sound out the opinion on this important issue, (Misac) received answers from various sources as follows: First opinion: The persons qualified to succeed his majesty are members of the Duang Dynasty's Norodom and Sisowat lines, such as His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Norodom Chakkrapong, HRH Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat, and Prince Norodom Sihamoni. Second opinion: The Vietnamese communists and their puppets want Norodom Chakkrapong to succeed His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. They have also put Chea Sim's name on the list to succeed his majesty, saying that Chea Sim has been given a royal title. He has ordered the masses and government officials to use royal language when addressing him and to call his wife the royal consort. The people in Phnom Penh ridiculed traitor Chea Sim, likening him to the lizard with a golden ring. They asked, who asked (Misac) to come to Phnom Penh to arrange an heir to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's throne -- the outstanding leader and father of the nation, of national reconciliation, and of peace -- who is respected and loved by the entire nation? The Cambodian nation and people asked, who wanted this man to raise the question of reigning on the throne in the current Cambodian situation when the nation and people are suffering from great and most serious misery due to both national and social problems and despite the fact that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk still continues as the esteemed and beloved outstanding leader of the nation and people? The nation and people also expressed anger with the Vietnamese communists and their puppets for trying to elevate the traitorous clique, their out-and-out flunky to the throne in Cambodia. His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk has stated clearly that the reigning king must have good quality and virtue and always be concerned about the national and people's interests and the national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Cambodia. The entire Cambodian nation and people are in unity with His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, France, the Vietnamese communists, or any other foreigners have no right to arrange any successor to the throne for serving them and destroying the Cambodian nation and people.
