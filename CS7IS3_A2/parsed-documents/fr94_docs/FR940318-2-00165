FR940318-2-00165 FR940318-2-00093 Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,120] John Roberts/Act II, Incorporated; Biddeford, ME; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On February 7, 1994, the New England Regional Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on January 27, 1994, and was published in the Federal Register on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6963). The union submitted the name of the subject firm's major manufacturer in 1992 and stated that the manufacturer has replaced the subject firm's production with imports. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 9th day of March 1994. Stephen A. Wandner, Deputy Director, Office of Legislation & Actuarial Services, Unemployment Insurance Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6445 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
