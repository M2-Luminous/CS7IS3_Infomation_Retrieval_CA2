The new minister, Nikolay Yegorov, is an ethnic Cossack, who had made a lightning career, moving from a collective farm chairman to the leader of Russia's largest territory to the ministerial office. Economist Nikolay Yegorov is 42-years-old and his last post was the leader of Kuban, Russia's southern frontier region. He is reputed to be a rational politician, capable of keeping stable the situation in a multinational border territory. He enjoys considerable authority not only in that territory but also among the leaders of Russia's north Caucasian republics. Yegorov favours a tougher executive discipline as people are tired from disorder and irresponsibility and want authorities to be authoritative and not sideline dispassionate observers. President Boris Yeltsin began his brief vacation in the south last March with a five-hour conversation with Yegorov, who was the head of administration of the Krasnodar territory. Their discussion of Kuban's problems as Russia's southern frontier territory, including migration of people from the flashpoints of ethnic tension in the Commonwealth must have impressed the president. Their discussion of migration and inter-ethnic relations continued later and may have prompted the present appointment.
