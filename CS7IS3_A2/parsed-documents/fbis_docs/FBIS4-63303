Svanidze's well-known report on the "Podrobnosti" ["Details"] program. A similar threat had been delivered at the previous session. But on that occasion the LDPR faction in the event decided to participate in the Duma's work in exchange for the chamber leadership's agreeing to send a letter to the RTR [Russian Television and Radio] leadership, suggesting that N. Svanidze be dismissed. However, V. Zhirinovskiy, who returned on the eve of the session from a tour of the country, evidently proved to be not satisfied with this decision, and withdrew his faction from the hall anyway. Neither the persuasion of the Communists and the Agrarians, nor even a decision to submit as the first item on the agenda a draft Duma resolution on the creation of the house's own television and radio broadcasting service, was of any avail. At the same time V. Zhirinovskiy announced that his faction is suing V. Svanidze for 560 million rubles. It was also announced that writs are being issued against Ye. Gaydar and IZVESTIYA for the publication of the "Russia's Choice" leader's article on V. Zhirinovskiy. The session also repeatedly heard calls for all Russian television journalists to be deprived of their accreditation. However, these calls did not meet with support. However, by walking out of the Duma's hall of sessions the LDPR faction did not manage to achieve its main goal -- to wreck the quorum. On the contrary, supporters of the formation of yet another parliamentary television company found themselves facing the risk of remaining in the minority, since the "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] factions categorically opposed this idea. The main part of the debates was devoted to allegations from supporters of parliamentary television of the nonobjectivity of media coverage of legislators' activity. In the opinion of representatives of factions -- notably the Communist Party -- the creation of a Duma television and radio broadcasting company would rectify the situation, since it would give all deputies the opportunity to address voters directly on two state television channels. If the decree is adopted, television viewers could have the opportunity to hear roughly 30 minutes' of speeches from the State Duma deputies every day.
