FR941205-2-00139 FR941205-2-00073 Surveys of Housing Conditions . Surveys of housing conditions serve several purposes in evaluating applications for housing rehabilitation activities. These include establishing the seriousness of need for such assistance in the project area, providing a basis for estimating overall budgetary needs, and providing an indication of the marketability of the project. Project Design and Feasibility . The application should describe the project in sufficient detail to allow the reviewer to assess its feasibility and its probable impact on the conditions described. It also should describe project requirements in such a way that regulatory and policy concerns will be addressed. In reviewing applications from grantees with prior housing rehabilitation projects, reasonableness of cost-per-unit, stated in the application, will be compared against the grantee's actual past performance. All applications should provide documentation to justify the cost-per-unit estimates, particularly grantees where past performance does not support the estimates in the applications. It should be noted that HUD encourages communities to design projects supplementing CDBG rehabilitation funds with private funds wherever feasible and appropriate, especially in the case of rental units and housing not occupied by lower income persons. In such cases, the CDBG subsidy should be as low as possible, while retaining sufficient incentive to attract local participants. On the other hand, projects designed for low income homeowners should not require private contributions at a level that puts the project out of reach of potential participants. Where the creation of new units is proposed through conversion, the application should document the need for additional units based on vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from the rehabilitation of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structure for residential use, or new construction projects for which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance. Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing feasibility from the standpoint of market financing. The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. For projects consisting of more than one activity, the activity that directly addresses the need must represent at least the majority of funds requested. Other activities must be incidental to and in support of the principal activity. For example, public improvements included in a rehabilitation project that addresses housing need must: be a relatively small amount in terms of funds requested; clearly be in support of the housing objective; and demonstrate a positive and direct link to the national objective. For incidental activities claiming benefit to low- and moderate-income persons on an area basis, the application must document that at least 51 percent of the residents of the service area meet the low- and moderate-income requirement. Funds should not be requested for activities that are not incidental to, and in support of the principal activity. Scoring . Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial'' impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner. The objective for non-target area projects, in as much as they are sparsely populated, only should be to assist low- and moderate-income persons. Accordingly, the following standard will be used for rating housing rehabilitation projects: Maximum (400 Points) 1. Severe need is shown in the project area, in terms of the proportion of units that are substandard and the extent of disrepair in the units. 2. The project would bring all, or almost all, of the units in the project area up to standard. 3. There are no feasibility questions, such as availability of other resources, marketability, or appropriateness of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed. 4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other housing projects. 5. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. Substantial (300 Points) 1. Serious need is shown. 2. Project would bring most of the units in the area up to standard. 3. There are no major feasibility questions. 4. Benefits a substantial number of persons. 5. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. Moderate (200 Points) 1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications. 2. Project would bring units up to standard, but not to the same extent as other applications. 3. There may be some minor feasibility questions. 4. Benefits a significant number of persons. 5. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.
