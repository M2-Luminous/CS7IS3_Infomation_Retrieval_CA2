This historical reference implies that the PLO leader reserves the right to renege on his agreements with the State of Israel. His attempt to justify his call for jihad for Jerusalem by explaining that the term -- which has an undoubtedly military connotation -- does not refer to bellicose activity but rather to nonviolent struggle, was defined by the prime minister as "far-fetched"; it would be equally accurate to describe Yitzhaq Rabin's reaction this way. The PLO leader's reference to the Muhammad example creates a crisis of confidence with 'Arafat. What will Israel be able to rely on if the PLO leader, addressing a Muslim audience, apologizes for agreements with Israel while citing a precedent from the early days of Islam -- a precedent legitimizing the violation of agreements? Israel can understand that 'Arafat must contend with the problem of the Islamic fundamentalists' objection to recognizing the Jewish state and the agreements, but it does not have to tolerate his double-talk. If the PLO leader wants to promote the peace process with Israel, he must retract the transparent insinuation that he is not bound by the Oslo and Cairo agreements and that he even sees himself free to violate them. The Israeli Government cannot again settle for the kind of mollifying explanations 'Arafat offered following his call for a jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem. It is imperative that 'Arafat declare unequivocally that he acknowledges the validity of all the agreements and that he will adhere to them, as he has pledged to do. Not only the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Cairo agreement are at stake. 'Arafat should at last do what he promised in a letter to the prime minister on 9 September 1993: "The PLO considers that the signing of the DOP constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and stability.... The PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council [PNC] for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant." 'Arafat has owed this approval to Israel for over eight months. Another postponement must not be tolerated. If he wants to establish self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, he must make a concentrated effort to secure the PNC's consent to the approval to which Israel is entitled. The PLO chief will do well not to delude himself about the gravity of the impact of his Johannesburg remarks. If his yearning for a conciliation with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] renders his consideration for the State of Israel a marginal issue, he should know that the Gaza and Jericho peace process will be frozen in its present condition, and there will be no continuation of the interim and toward the permanent settlements. Unless he sees to it that the clauses in the covenant are revoked, he will be unable to regain Israel's trust in the PLO's sincerity, and instead of settling in Jericho, 'Arafat will stay in Tunis.
