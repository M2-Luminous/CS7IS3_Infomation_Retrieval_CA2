Our correspondent Arye Schorr reports: [Begin recording] [Schorr] The prime minister was asked today for his opinion regarding reservations expressed by Labor figures regarding a referendum and their preference for elections after an agreement with Syria is finalized. Mr. Rabin explained at length his decision -- taken following consultations with several of the ministers -- namely that if a peace agreement with Syria calls for a significant withdrawal, he will opt for a referendum. Mr. Rabin said that a significant withdrawal could involve the removal of settlements, and on this issue he would like to hear what the public has to say: [Rabin] I am convinced that if and when we reach a draft peace agreement between Syria and Israel -- and this will demand a painful price from us, perhaps even more painful than the Israeli public expects -- if and when this happens, and if we want to be completely honest.... [Schorr, interrupting] Rabin went on to say that we must ask the public whether it is willing to pay the price. The prime minister, answering a question, said that at this point -- and the emphasis was on this point -- there is no need for a proper government decision on the issue of referendum. He emphasized that there is no need to adopt new decisions. It is too early to draft a law in this issue in the Knesset: [Rabin] I believe that there will be a government majority for this. In any case we will need to draft a law in the Knesset, but there is no point in doing so now, because at this stage we have nothing concrete to submit to the public. We will do so when and if there is something to present to the public. On the Palestinian track we are not dealing with a territorial concession; there is no danger for uprooting settlements there. The government has received a clear and unequivocal mandate in this sphere. We expressed a willingness for territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, but nothing beyond this. [Schorr] Today Rabin gave his first public reaction to the position adopted by al-Asad in the Geneva summit. He said this is not the time to hand out compliments: [Rabin] I am not going to hand out grades to anybody. Although I expected more, for the purposes of continuing the negotiations I am willing to settle for what was publicly said and with what we were briefed on, although not publicly said. [Schorr] Mr. Rabin hinted that there are elements in al-Asad's position which were not expressed in his speech, but about which the Americans briefed Israel. This is the next issue on the public and media agenda: What was really said in the private meeting between Clinton and al-Asad. [end recording] To sum up: At this stage there is nothing to submit to the public for a referendum, because we have still not reached the stage of territorial concessions and uprooting settlements. This was what the prime minister said today at Jerusalem's King David Hotel.
