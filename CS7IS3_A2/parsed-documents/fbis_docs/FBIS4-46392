In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our method since we came out of prison has been not to participate in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [murdered by the Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical School incidents, the assassination of [former president] al-Sadat, to the Asyut incidents. We in fact have issued several statements criticizing violence. ROSE AL-YUSUF: The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group leader has accused you of supporting terrorism with money. Mashhur: I have no knowledge of that. Let them investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by 'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with this. ROSE AL-YUSUF: Don't you have any connection with Ahmad 'Ubayd? Mashhur: I mean that we have nothing to do with the money, and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave money. ROSE AL-YUSUF: Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend to escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the professional unions? Mashhur: Our method is moderation, and not violence, capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a message. This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to say that Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is the solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the government] who do not want to recognize us.
