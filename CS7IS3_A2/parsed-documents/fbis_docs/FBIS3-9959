FBIS3-9959 "drlat039_r_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Peru Cali Cartel Seeks To Recover Advance Paid to `Vaticano' PY2502135094 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p A15 PY2502135094 Lima EL COMERCIO Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] PNP [Peruvian National Police] intelligence sources disclosed that Wilber Alvarado Linares, aka Champa, one of the main drug dealers in the Upper Huallaga, allegedly has taken the place of Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, as the main drug supplier for the Cali cartel. Moreover, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, barons of the cartel, allegedly have chosen to contact Champa to try to recover the advance they paid Vaticano to buy white cocaine paste. According to our sources, the arrest of Vaticano in Cali, Colombia, will represent a hard blow to the Rodriguez Orejuelas' "economy" if they fail to identify the "buyers" who received an advance for the purchase of a "large quantity" of drugs. Other traffickers such as "Camboya," "Escorpio," "Santena," "Joselito," "Chuquin," "Mecano," "Tico," "Nano," etc., who also have "interests" in the Upper Huallaga might also be affected for having given Vaticano an advance of several thousands of dollars. In this regard, it was learned that Elias Chavez Penaherrera, aka Lan, who is Vaticano's brother and the pilot of his private aircraft, may take Vaticano's place because he knows his "contacts" and probably the drug buyers who received the advance payment from the Cali cartel. Moreover, the National Intelligence Service has discovered that Vaticano and the aforementioned drug traffickers had their operations center in the Upper Huallaga, Palma Pampa, Ramal de Aspuzana, Huicungo, "Boca de Diablo," Bellavista, and Bolognesi Province. As for Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, it was learned that the Intelligence Services as well as Dinandro [Anti-Drug Division] are after several of his front men whose names are being kept secret and other people also involved in drug trafficking.
