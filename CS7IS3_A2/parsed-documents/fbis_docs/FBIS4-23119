Japan-U.S.: MITI Divided on Fate of Semiconductor Pact Japan-U.S.: MITI Divided on Fate of Semiconductor Pact Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) appears to be divided over whether to press the United States for the repeal of the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement when the pact comes up for review in July 1994. On 13 June two senior MITI officials gave conflicting signals on the issue to the Japanese press. According to the 14 June edition of the business-oriented Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a senior MITI official told the newspaper the previous day that Japan was considering presenting a proposal to terminate the accord at the round of U.S.-Japan semiconductor talks which began on June 15. The official argued that the accord "sets a bad example" because it contains a numerical target for the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market, and because it "gives the United States an excuse to impose sanctions against Japan" if Tokyo fails to meet this target. By contrast, the 14 June Mainichi Shimbun reported that another unnamed senior MITI official told the paper on the 13th that the Japanese Government "will not seek to repeal the agreement" before it expires in July 1996. The official told the paper that a number of MITI officials feel strongly that Japan should not risk further straining relations with the United States by pressing to repeal the Semiconductor Agreement just as the contentious bilateral framework talks are resuming. The ministry may be under pressure from the Japanese semiconductor industry to push for the repeal of the Semiconductor Agreement--a factor that may be influencing the views of those in the ministry who want to terminate the accord. According to the 10 June Asahi Shimbun, at a news conference following a meeting of officials from U.S. and Japanese semiconductor firms on 9 June, Hidehiko Yoshida, vice president of the Toshiba Corporation and chairman of the Committee of Users of Foreign Semiconductors, called for the termination of the Semiconductor Agreement. Yoshida criticized the provision in the agreement stipulating that foreign semiconductors should reach a 20 percent share of Japan's semiconductor market, asserting that "in the past, this figure has tended to take on a life of its own beyond the purpose for which it was originally intended." He argued that the figure was "no longer necessary" and that "the private sector should be left alone to look after its own affairs" now that increasing contacts between the U.S. and Japanese semiconductor industries had laid the foundation for future cooperation between the two.
