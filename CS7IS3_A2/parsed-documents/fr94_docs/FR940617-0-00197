(a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled nonroad compression-ignition engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept (described in §86.1310&hyph;90 of this chapter) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CO, and CO 2 . A continuously integrated system is required for HC and NO X measurement and is allowed for all CO and CO 2 measurements. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO 2 . General requirements are as follows: (1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP&hyph;CVS and a heat exchanger or a CFV&hyph;CVS with either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP&hyph;CVS system. Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV&hyph;CVS system. (2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled compression-ignition engines requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) and heated sample system (191 # 11 ○C). (i) The HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously over the test cycle. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, the HFID must be used with a constant flow system to ensure a representative sample. (ii) The heated probe shall be located in the primary dilution tunnel and far enough downstream of the mixing chamber to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the point of sampling. (3) The CO and CO 2 analytical system requires: (i) Bag sampling (see §86.1309&hyph;90 of this chapter) and analytical capabilities (see §86.1311&hyph;90 of this chapter), as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart; or (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO 2 meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative sample.
