The latest is in Bong County between Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and yet another anti-Taylor armed group. Once again it seems the civilian population are getting the worst of it. From Monrovia, Niinartey Allison telexed this report: Hundreds of panic-stricken people are fleeing from the renewed fighting in Lower Bong County. They are moving south toward Kakata and Harbel. A broadcast on NPFL-controlled radio on Sunday [23 January] confirmed the fighting. Another broadcast this morning by Charles Taylor called on ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] to immediately deploy troops in the area. Relief officials here said today that about 9,000 people have fled the fighting around (Killer Bay) and Sonoya. Some residents of Sonoya, who arrived in Harbel at the weekend, said the fighting is still continuing. They said the fighting was between the NPFL and the new armed group called the Bong Resistance Movement. They explained that a good number of people are fleeing areas around the Salala Rubber Plantations, Jibi, German Camp, and Bolola. One eyewitness, Martha Togber, explained how she was forced to leave behind her 80-year-old mother as the sound of gunfire came closer to her house. Meanwhile, Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberian] movement has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, as a result of the refugee influx there.
