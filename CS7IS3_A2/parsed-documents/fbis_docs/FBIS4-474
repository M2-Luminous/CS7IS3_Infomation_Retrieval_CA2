After all those who demanded the ending of apartheid and the ANC's elevation to power were mostly silent on violation of rights, including mass murder, elsewhere in the world. That is why support for emergency rule from outside South Africa carries little moral weight. A discordant and perceptive note was however sounded in an editorial in the London SUNDAY TIMES. The editorial states that an election under present circumstances will do nothing to reconcile South Africans, and that as such we are on the brink of civil war. This is "not simply a legacy of apartheid, but of the bungled way the transition has been handled." ANC and NP [National Party] "propaganda machines insist the election will be substantially free and fair, and that once a popularly elected government is in place peace will blossom." But, it is predicted that neither will happen. "Rather than addressing the underlying reasons for the violence, the ANC and the government blindly push ahead, believing states of emergency and military force will provide solutions. They persist is claiming that the new constitution they have drafted is a federal one, even when scores of foreign experts have pointed out it is not." The ANC, it is correctly pointed out, has won everything it wants, and all who remain in the way are Zulu leaders. But, though Dr Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelithini are dismissed as spoilers: "All they are asking for are federal powers along the lines enjoyed by German, Canadian or American states or provinces. Is South Africa to be plunged into a bitter civil war for this?" The article predicts that South Africa, under present arrangements, is heading towards an authoritarian, effectively one- party state. "Declaring states of emergency and sending in the army is no solution. They will be able to take Ulundi, the kwaZulu capital, but will face an unwinnable guerilla campaign in the hills of northern Natal. At some point, a political solution will have to be found." "Mr Mandela and Mr De Klerk must take the plunge ... at this week's summit with Chief Buthelezi and King Zwelithini they should postpone the election, not just in Natal, as they are now belatedly considering, but nationwide." It is also recommended that, using international mediation, they should give serious thought to granting real autonomy for regions. Though this all may not be politically correct, the editorial is entirely sensible. If this route is not followed this kind of view will be repeated many times as the folly of ANC/NP [National Party] handiwork becomes more evident. This view will also be expressed by those who really count -- foreign investors. They will express their view by withholding their capital from South Africa, to the impoverishment of all. This consideration is far more important that the sycophantic support of State Department or Foreign Office officials, whose job after all is the cultivation and flattery of foreign governments and by implication ruling parties. And it is also far more important than mere expressions of "moral" support from foreign governments, or from mutual admiration societies like the UN or OAU.
