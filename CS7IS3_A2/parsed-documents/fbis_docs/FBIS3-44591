Patten said: Under circumstances where China and Britain cannot reach full agreement on the issue of the political system, the British side can still strive to reach a partial agreement with the Chinese side on the issue of the political system or reach an agreement on issues other than the political system, which states that each side goes its own way (agree to disagree). A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last Friday that the talks could only be reopened if the Hong Kong Government revoked that part of the political reform bill submitted to the Legislative Council [Legco]. Responding to this statement, Patten pointed out: Legco has already started discussing part of the political reform bill, it is impossible for the Hong Kong Government to suddenly stop its legislative work, and the legislative process concerned process will continue until the end of February when Legco passes the bill. He said: The Chinese side knew months ago that the Hong Kong Government is facing a very big time constraint. Partial Agreement on Political System Welcomed Faced with a deadlock in which China and Britain still cannot reopen the talks, Patten said that when he returns to Britain at the end of this month to report on his work, he and Prime Minister Major, Foreign Secretary Hurd, and other cabinet members will review Sino-British relations following the suspension of the talks and plan for the next step of the legislative work on the electoral arrangements. He will also hold in-depth discussions with the top British leadership on four tactical options for handling Sino- British relations. Patten said that he will attend a hearing held by the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee and will discuss current Sino-British relations with Foreign Office officials. While in London, Patten will meet Robin McLaren, British ambassador to China and negotiator at the Sino-British talks, who has recovered from an illness, and will discuss the outlook for talks with him. Patten said: Now, the top priority of the British side is still to strive to hold an 18th round of talks with the Chinese side and to strive to reach an agreement on the issues of the through train, the functional constituencies, and the electoral committee before the Hong Kong Government submits the remaining parts of its political reform bill to Legco. He pointed out that if both sides cannot reach a full agreement, he welcomes both sides trying to reach a partial agreement, for example, both sides could reach an agreement on one to two of the three large issues, namely, the through train, the functional constituencies, and the electoral committee to narrow the gap between both sides on the arrangements for the political system. For the British side, this is the second option. However, Patten stressed: Even if the partial through train arrangement theoretically emerges, there has been hardly any sign so far that the Chinese side intends to reach a partial agreement. Besides, he said, a partial agreement must contain factors which are reasonable and deserve to be upheld. Vigorously Ensuring Other Kinds of Cooperation While Each Side Goes Its Own Way Patten acknowledged that if both sides could not hold another round of talks, the British side must decide on the electoral arrangements on its own. The British side's third option is that both sides admit that there are differences over the political system, but that they can continue to cooperate with each other on issues other than the political system and can reach an agreement which states that each side is going its own way. He said: Even if China and Britain cannot reach agreement on political issues, it does not mean that both sides cannot reach any agreement on other issues, and an agreement which states that each side goes its own way, is, after all, better than no agreement. He added: It is always better to confine both sides' differences to a few political issues rather than spreading the political impact to other fields. When talking about the British side's final option, that is, under a situation where there is no agreement, the Hong Kong Government unilaterally submits the remainder of the political reform bill to Legco for discussion, Patten said that it was his duty to exercise effective rule over Hong Kong and that he firmly believed that Legco members would not choose to do something which they deem incorrect merely because the Chinese side had threatened to cancel arrangements for the political system. Patten added: The Chinese side has warned that in 1997, they will cancel any arrangements on the political system with which Beijing does not agree, but different Chinese officials give different meanings to "cancellation." Patten said: The Hong Kong Government should not, at present, do anything to the detriment of the interests of Hong Kong merely because the Chinese side may do something to the detriment of the interests of Hong Kong in an uncertain future. In the interview, Patten also commented on the preliminary work committee of the preparatory committee of the special administrative region and analyzed the prospects of Sino-Hong Kong cooperation and implementing a high degree of autonomy after 1997. In addition, he also talked about China's most-favored-nation status, Hong Kong's economic prospects, the financial reserves, the overheated real estate market, and other issues.
