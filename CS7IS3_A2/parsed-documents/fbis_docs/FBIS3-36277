The point is that figures from secret Defense Ministry documents, published by the press in Moscow recently, have made us focus on all these issues again. Let me recall some of these data: only 51 percent of the Armed Forces personnel and only one division in each military district are capable of waging combat operations. Only 20 percent of tanks currently at the army's disposal can be regarded as combat-ready and there are only a few Navy warships that are capable of complying with the Navy regulations governing the procedure of putting a warship in a state of full combat readiness. Replying to Mayak correspondent Yuriy Selivanov's questions, Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army, deployed in the Dniester region, confirmed these depressing data in a short interview. [Begin recording] [Selivanov] The first question for Aleksandr Ivanovich is connected with his appraisal of the current state of the Russian Armed Forces and the military reform under way in these forces. [Lebed] The Army has been pushed up a blind alley, carved up, and had mud flung at it, and this was a lengthy and systematic process. At long last it is as though they saw the light, not completely, but, nevertheless, they did see the light and it is as though they started to be more receptive to the Army and its problems; pay was raised and some half-hearted attempts to build housing got off the ground. As for the breakup, they did it fast, but to restore all this and put things to rights, well, time is needed here. [Selivanov] The second question: Independent states have existed on the former USSR's territory for two years and they have been setting up their own armies for two years. If at all possible, could you sum up the results of these military developments in the independent CIS states? [Lebed] I would not like them to take offense at what I say, but this signifies the Army's collapse: They destroyed what did exist and proved incapable themselves of preserving what existed before, with all the shortcomings -- and shortcomings did exist, I am not saying they did not. They did not do anything positive, just put the finishing touches to the process of destruction and went about it with joy, as it were, getting rid of Russians, getting rid of all those who dared to think differently. This is a state of collapse -- there is no army. What does exist are these decrepit forces of these apanage principalities, equipped with rusty tanks and combat vehicles, weapons that are not ready to do battle and so on. Well, this is my view now. [end recording] Despite this whole unpropitious climate that now prevails, Russia has gained almost as many generals as was the case in the entire and huge Soviet Union, in all its 15 republics. However, if today's article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA is anything to go by, it is the Russian Ministry of Defense -- Minister Pavel Grachev and his retinue -- that need to be blamed here. Quite a few pages would be needed to list this retinue. Reading the service records of the closest bigwigs, some people get indignant and angry, while others simply laugh loudly. However, an ever more serious irritation at the minister's personnel policy is coming to a head, if one takes the officer corps of the Ministry of Defense as a whole. Photocopies of biographies of generals from Pavel Grachev's entourage, generals who, as far as the army is concerned, climbed the service ladder unusually fast, have recently been circulated and are being circulated in the Russian Defense Ministry's and the General Staff's directorates and departments. However, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA says that what is really alarming is the fact that, having encountered instances such as these, more and more military professionals are beginning not to give a damn about anything and are leaving the Army altogether. Thus, the Army is being deprived of the main thing -- the military intellect which, despite the not entirely unjustified jokes among the public, did, nevertheless, exist in it.
