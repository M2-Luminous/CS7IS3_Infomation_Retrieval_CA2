FR940627-2-00123 FR940627-2-00050 Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a proposed revision to a guide in its Regulatory Guide Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses. The draft guide, temporarily identified by its task number, DG&hyph;1031 (which should be mentioned in all correspondence concerning this draft guide), is a proposed revision to Regulatory Guide 1.160, ``Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants.'' This guide is being revised to provide guidance on meeting the Commission's current rules on maintenance and on monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance in nuclear poser plants. This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position in this area. It has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position. Public comments are being solicited on the draft guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments will be most helpful if received by August 25, 1994. Although a time limit is given for comments on these drafts, comments and suggestions in connection with (1) items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or (2) improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time. Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Requests for single copies of draft guides (which may be reproduced) or for placement on an automatic distribution list for single copies of future draft guides in specific divisions should be made in writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director, Distribution and Mail Services Section.
