Late yesterday, Carabinieri police acted on 12 preventive custody warrants issued by magistrates in Reggio Calabria in charge of the investigation into the Messina judges and unidentified businessmen and Mafia gangsters opened last year. The investigation, still under way, is based on testimony provided by organized crime figures in custody who have turned state's evidence. The charges against La Torre, in retirement since December last year, refer to his work when he was an assistant judge on the Messina criminal appeals court. Judiciary sources said today La Torre was allegedly corrupted by Messina Mafia clans in exchange for issuing light sentences from the criminal court bench and that Mancuso is thought to have worked to the benefit of gangsters while they were detained. In addition to the word of informants, said these sources, the Reggio Calabria magistrates also possess documents pertaining to the charges. Aside from the Messina judges, arrested in their homes, two of the 12 warrants could not be served because they were issued for known Mafia figures still at large. Six others were delivered in jail to suspected members of Messina Mafia families.
