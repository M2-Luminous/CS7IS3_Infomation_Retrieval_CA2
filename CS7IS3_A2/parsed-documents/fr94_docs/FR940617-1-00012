Ancillary Information A consumer reporting agency is not required to disclose information consisting of an audit trail of changes it makes in the consumer's file, billing records, or the contents of a consumer relations folder, if the information is not from consumer reports and will not be used in preparing future consumer reports. Such data is not included in the term ``information in the files'' which must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant to this section. A consumer reporting agency must disclose claims report information only if it has appeared in consumer reports. * * * * * 12. Risk Scores A consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer in response to a consumer's disclosure request: (a) Risk scores (or other numerical evaluations, however named), calculated at the time of the consumer's request; and (b) a brief statement that explains what the risk score predicts, how the score may be applied by its user, and how the consumer ranks against other consumers under the scoring model. The agency must disclose this information for each type of score, regardless of who developed the score, that the agency has reported to its clients within the six months preceding the date of the consumer's disclosure request (or within two years, if for employment purposes). * * * * * By direction of the Commission.
