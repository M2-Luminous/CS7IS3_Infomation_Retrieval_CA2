Swiss Transport Minister Adolf Ogi said France was being tough on Switzerland by opposing Swiss attempts to resume transport negotiations with the European Union. Mr Ogi, speaking after talks in Crete with his French counterpart Bernard Bosson, said Switzerland would nevertheless continue to press its case. Mr Bosson told reporters that Swiss policy was contradictory. He said Switzerland had voted to ban foreign heavy goods traffic from its north-south transit roads, while at the same time demanding free access for its own heavy goods vehicles on French territory. Mr Ogi and Mr Bosson are in Crete for a European transport conference.
