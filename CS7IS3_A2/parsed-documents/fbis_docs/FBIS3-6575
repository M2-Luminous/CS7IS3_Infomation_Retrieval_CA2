The 55-minute meeting at the truce border village of Panmunjom ended without setting a date for the next round of talks. The talks collapsed with North Korean negotiators walking away from the dialogue table, the officials said. The South Korean side urged North Korea to drop "unreasonable" demands and show sincerity in its attitude to make improvements in working through differences over procedural matters, they said. Song Chung-tae, the chief South Korean delegate to the inter-Korean dialogue, sounded out a tough warning that the nuclear issue is entering a critical phase, with the international community considering punitive actions at some point. "Time is quickly running out and it is hard to tell what ominous consequences North Korea's recalcitrance on the nuclear issue will bring about," Song said. In response to Song's remarks, his northern counterpart Pak Yong-su raised his country's earlier demands and accused South Korea of using the inter-Korean contact as a way to scuttle high-level talks between the United States and North Korea. Pak blamed South Korean's uncooperative acts for failing to make significant progress in the inter-Korean dialogue for an exchange of special envoys.
