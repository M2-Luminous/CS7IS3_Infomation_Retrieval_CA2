Ever since the beginning of December, the big dailies and news agencies in the intensively developed countries placed particular emphasis on the antigovernment and antipresidential demonstrations organized in Bucharest and throughout the country by the trade unions and students organizations. All press items and television broadcasts mentioned the fact that these were the most widespread people's demonstrations in the wake of December 1989. Western investors, who form their opinion about a country from newspapers and television programs, probably had the impression of a social-politically instable Romania that is shaken by social unrest. Thus it is clear that no investor will be tempted to invest his money in a country that is more unstable than quicksand. The anniversary of the Romanian revolution was an opportunity for the international press and television to review the road covered by Romania so far. Catastrophic, to say the least, was the conclusion drawn by all press reportages and television programs devoted to this inventory. From the United States to Japan, readers were reminded that Romania is the only country in the East where the communists are still in power and that Romania is a country led by extreme nationalists, even fascists. Now, at the end of the year, Western reporters deemed it fit to deal again with Romania. The image one gets from Western television reportage is that of a backward country that has been unable to break away not only from communism, but not even from Ceausism [Ceausescu-type of system]. The European television channel Euro-News last week broadcast two singularly violent reportages devoted to Romania. First, they dwelled on the absolute poverty prevailing in the country. Second, on the nostalgia regarding Nicolae Ceausescu. Other reputed television channels also carried programs devoted to Romania. CNN, for instance, carried a brief reportage on HIV-positive children in Romania, who are spending their last days in the misery of local hospitals. The French TV5 Channel dealt with the street children. The images broadcast by CNN, Euro-News, and TV5 to the world are strikingly reminiscent of the images broadcast by international television channels immediately after the December 1989 revolution. It goes without saying that now, at the end of 1993, Romania's image in the world, an image created by the international press and television, is as poor as that of 1990. The violent campaign against Romania may be surprising up to a point. Within the inventory made regarding 1993, the presidency and government boasted about great international achievements: the granting of most-favored-nation status, the accord with the IMF, and the admission to the Council of Europe. More surprising than ever before, President Ion Iliescu assured us that Romania's isolation has come to an end. The position of the international press and television is also shocking because of the way they report on actual reality. No matter how critically we viewed Iliescu's regime, a regime that has been in power in Romania since December 1989, we cannot say that nothing has changed on the sociopolitical or economic levels. At least from a legal point of view, the foundation was laid for a pluralist system, there is freedom of expression, and the market economy has begun to take shape. It is clear that the television programs and press articles devoted to Romania do not bear this in mind. Portraying Romania in black colors is also slightly strange from another point of view. For more than a year now, the government and presidency have been talking about the tremendous political and financial efforts to improve our country's image in the world. Tremendous sums of U.S. dollars have been spent on publicity in reputable dailies and weeklies. Each Romanian in the Diaspora is being courted infinitely. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that all our embassies have made it their aim to present the true situation in our country. The surprising nature of Romania's disastrous image in the world is only apparent. In actual fact, the poor portrayal of our country in the Western press and television is perfectly explicable. It represent the effect of a situation that was specific to Romania after the December 1989 revolution. The period that followed the Romanian revolution was a period of disappointment throughout the world. I am not talking of the fact that the former party activist, Ion Iliescu, is at the helm of the country. In other countries, which belonged to the communist camp, power was also taken over by former communists. They, however, manifested themselves from the very beginning as firm advocates of political pluralism, democracy, and market economy. Admitting publicly that they had been communists, they proved that the long experience of dictatorship convinced them of the failure of implementing the Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Ion Iliescu and his cronies did not do the same. For a long time, the current president acted as a tardy perestroykist. In his statements in 1990 he pleaded for communism with a human face. This public support for communism was coupled by a number of political actions, which were clearly at variance with democratic principles. I am talking of the famous miners' incursions, which attempted to eliminate the opposition and the independent press by means of armed civilians. By and by, the international press formed the image of a Ion Iliescu full of communist nostalgia. Public opinion throughout the world was convinced of this on the basis of the articles and televised reportage devoted to the violation of the principles of democracy in Romania after December 1989. Unfortunately for Ion Iliescu, the history of Russia and of the Eastern countries took a different course than the one desired by him. In Russia, the former activist Boris Yeltsin proceeded to radical democratic reforms and the market economy. All the countries, which used to belong to communism, firmly embarked on the road to a market economy. Had Gorbachev not fallen, had Russia not embarked on the road to democracy, and had the communist regimes in China and Cuba not declared the bankruptcy of the centralized economy, Ion Iliescu would probably have advocated the cause of communism with a human face. Left all by himself in Eastern Europe, slowly, slowly the president worked toward a substantial change in his political platform. Under domestic and international pressure, he declared to be the advocate of democratic reform. Firmly influenced also by the former FSN [National Salvation Front] reformist grouping, he had to accept, albeit reluctantly, the radical measures in the direction of proceeding to a market economy. Consequently, pluralism and a free market began to take shape in Romania. The press, however, works with general images, in general terms. It has to constantly bear in mind the already existing opinion of its readers. Thus, when it came to Ion Iliescu and realities in Romania, the international press and television were subject to this very law. The president's and our country's image is that formed in the wake of the 1989 revolution. That is the image of a neocommunist president who is leading a country immobilized by its obsolete structures. To alter this image is a very difficult thing. For this to happen, the international press would have to assume numerous risks, including that of contradicting its readers. Consequently, foreign reporters come to Romania with an image they formed in 1990. Here, however, they find a much more pronounced reality. It is difficult and practically impossible for them to reflect these nuances in their reporting. This is why they seek elements in Romania's reality today that will confirm their preconceived image. Hence the contradiction between the reportages devoted to Romania of late and the reality of our sociopolitical situation, including the president's conduct. It is useless to talk about how harmful this perception of our country in the world is. As I have said before, the former communist countries are involved in a fierce competition in order to attract foreign capital and to occupy a place in the forefront in the world today. This period following the collapse of communism is decisive for the place of a former communist country in the world hierarchy. The big European and worldwide games are taking place now. This is tellingly proven by the question regarding the East European countries' entry into NATO. All East and Central European countries want guarantees on the part of the most powerful military treaty in the present-day world regarding possible expansionist attempts by Moscow. Obtaining such guarantees is, for each country that used to belong to the communist camp, a matter of national interest. The position of the West toward this desire of the East European countries is being established, however, on the basis of the image each of these states, which were formerly under Soviet occupation, enjoy in the world. Thus it is clear that Romania's image in the international press plays a decisive role in the place and role attributed to our country by the great powers in the Balkan area and in Europe. Naturally, there are numerous situations in which the great powers specifically bear in mind their geopolitical interests. No government of any Western country can take the liberty, however, of ignoring public opinion. No matter how important Romania would be from a geopolitical point of view, the leaders of the major powers also have to bear in mind what the public thinks about Romania. And the beliefs of the public are forged by the press and television. From this point of view, we may say that Romania's image in the international press and television profoundly harms our national interests. The West's reticence toward our entry into NATO is a sign of this harmful reality. However, how can Romania's image in the world be changed? That is very easy. Through a radical change in the political regime, a change that through its spectacular nature would decisively influence Western public opinion. This change could be achieved, among other things, in two directions. One would be President Ion Iliescu's firm public commitment to reform and democracy. As long as the president continues, however, to flounder, to promote an ambiguous policy that is neither rightist, nor leftist, this direction will be practically impossible. Another solution would be to form a coalition government with the participation of the opposition. Given its exceptional nature, this event would capture the attention of the media throughout the world. For the international press and television this would be a real opportunity to persuade the public that something has happened in Romania. Is Cotroceni [presidency seat] aware of this requirement? Judging by the bluff represented by the initiative of consulting the parliamentary parties, it seems that the answer is no.
