FR941125-2-00061 FR941125-2-00048 Final Filing Deadline in Special Refund Proceeding No. LEF&hyph;0003 Involving AOC Acquisition Corp. AGENCY: Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy ACTION: Notice of Final Deadline for Filing Applications for Refund in Special Refund Proceeding No. LEF&hyph;0003, Apex Oil Co., Apex Holding Co., Clark Oil & Refining Corp., Goldstein Oil Co., Novelly Oil Co. (AOC Acquisition Corp.) SUMMARY: The Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy has set the final deadline for filing Applications for Refund from the escrow account established pursuant to a consent order entered into between the DOE and AOC Acquisition Corp., Special Refund Proceeding No. LEF&hyph;0003. The previous deadline was July 31, 1992. The new deadline is January 31, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas O. Mann, Deputy Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;2094. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy is hereby setting a final deadline for the filing of Applications for Refund in the AOC Acquisition Corp. (AOC) refund proceeding. On August 20, 1991, we issued a Decision and Order setting forth final refund procedures to distribute the monies in the oil overcharge escrow account established in accordance with the terms of a consent order entered into by the DOE and AOC's predecessor companies. See Apex Oil Co., Apex Holding Co., Clark Oil & Refining Corp., Goldstein Oil Co., Novelly Oil Co. , 21 DOE Â¶ 85,341 (1991), 56 Fed. Reg. 50719 (October 8, 1991). That Decision established July 31, 1992 as the filing deadline for purchasers of Clark refined products to submit refund applications. Since July 31, 1992, we have routinely granted extensions of time to Clark customers who were unaware of the proceeding or were in the process of gathering information to support their refund claims. We have now received 327 refund applications. Given that the proceeding has been open for three years, we have concluded that eligible applicants have been provided with more than ample time to file. We will therefore not accept applications that are postmarked after January 31, 1995. All Applications for Refund from the AOC Consent Order Fund postmarked after the final filing date of January 31, 1995, will be summarily dismissed. Any unclaimed funds remaining after all pending claims are resolved will be made available for indirect restitution pursuant to the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501. Dated: November 16, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29083 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
