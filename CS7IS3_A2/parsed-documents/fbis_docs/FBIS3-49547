However, Slovakia is still some 4.5 billion korunas in debt in the mutual clearing account and, at the moment, is again exceeding the agreed margin. "This tendency is continuing in January; Slovakia is again drawing above the credit margin," said Ota Kaftan, of the Czech National Bank [CNB]. Despite these problems, the clearing method of settling accounts in mutual trade is maintainable for the foreseeable future, and the CNB is taking this into consideration.
