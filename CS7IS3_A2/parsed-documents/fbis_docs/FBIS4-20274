Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, said after his meeting today with Rauf Denktas: I have no agreement to announce. Mr. Clark added that after this meeting he does not think there is any reason for further consultations. Mr. Clark further noted that he wants to think about what he has discussed here as well as about his meetings with the representatives of Greece and Turkey before he proceeds with any recommendations. In a statement after his meeting with Joe Clark, Rauf Denktas said that he expects responsibility for the deadlock in the talks will be attributed to the Turkish Cypriot side. According to REUTER, Rauf Denktas said that he foresees that the Turkish Cypriot side will be accused of refusing to accept the demands of the Greek Cypriot side which, as he put it, have been added to the initial package of measures proposed by the United Nations. Denktas noted: We will be accused again because we do not give in to anything that the Greek Cypriots demand. At this point, REUTER points out that Joe Clark denied repeatedly that the confidence-building measures package had been changed considerably in favor of the Greek Cypriot side. At the same time, revealing once again the Turkish Cypriot side's true intentions, the Turkish Cypriot leader said that the Cyprus issue cannot be solved so long as the international community recognizes the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legal government in Cyprus. Denktas added: The price that we will pay for not accepting this situation is much smaller than the one we would pay if we accept it. Earlier today, Mr. Clark had a meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis, who reiterated to Joe Clark that, if Rauf Denktas does not accept the document within the framework of the time limit set by the Security Council, he sees no reason to continue discussion on the confidence-building measures nor does he intend to continue. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis briefed the journalists in this connection and said that our side is now awaiting the UN secretary general's report to be submitted; it will record the facts and should attribute responsibility where they should be. Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel are now briefing the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the Security Council. A senior government source has told the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation that now the UN secretary general's representatives also attribute responsibility to the Turkish side for the failure of the proximity talks. According to the same source, at least two countries of the European Union [EU]--Britain and Germany--now agree with the Cyprus Government's position that the process for Cypriot accession to the EU should be expedited, and this is something that would work to put pressure on the Turkish side. The government source made this statement after the meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis had this morning with the UN officials and after a meeting the president also had with the German ambassador to Cyprus.
