(b) It is the policy of the Department of State that individual acquisitions or classes of acquisitions involving national security information be handled in accordance with the laws and regulations regarding classification and control of classified information. Executive Order 12356, National Security Information (April 2, 1982), prescribes a uniform system for classifying declassifying, and safeguarding national security information. (c)(1) The Department's requirements personnel, reviewing officials, the contracting officer, and the approving official shall jointly confer on using this authority and the extent to which national security pertains to the acquisition(s). The Department shall examine the acquisition in its totality, including any antecedent and/or consequent acquisitions and related actions, to make these determinations. The Director, Diplomatic Security Services, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is the authority for the determination that specific information should not be released on all proposed acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involves national security information. The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence Liaison Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is the approval authority for such acquisitions derived from or funded by other agencies. The requirements office is responsible for obtaining the approval of the appropriate official and ensuring that all documentation necessary for the decision is accurate and complete with respect to information that should not be released. (2) In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(1), acquisitions involving national security information shall be publicized if identification of the individual acquisition or class or acquisitions would not compromise national security. (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing competition. 606.303&hyph;1 [Amended] 43.

Such procurements shall be supported by an approved Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements of FAR 6.303&hyph;2 and DOSAR 606.303&hyph;2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, and administrative and management support.

Justifications shall specify an effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life of the technical equipment.
