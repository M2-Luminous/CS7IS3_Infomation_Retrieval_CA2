The Cuban Foreign Ministry reportedly is awaiting an Argentine confirmation of the official visit, the first by a high-ranking Cuban official since Carlos Menem took office in 1989. "The response is expected to arrive either tomorrow or in the next few days," said Cuban sources. The same sources added that Robaina is travelling to Buenos Aires after a three-day visit to Montevideo, Uruguay, from 4-6 April within the framework of a tour through several Latin American countries. However, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister told LA PRENSA: "So far we have had no news on the subject. If we do, we would consider it because there is nothing strange in this visit." He said that, for example, "former Cuban Foreign Minister Malmierca has visited Argentina," among other "Cuban strong men" who have recently visited Argentina.
