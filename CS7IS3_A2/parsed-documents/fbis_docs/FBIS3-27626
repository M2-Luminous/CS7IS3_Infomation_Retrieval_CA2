This is because historical experience shows that it: will be by no means easy to attain this objective. Prices Rose by 18 Percent Last Year A few days ago, the Guangdong Commodity Prices Bureau provided deputies attending the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress meeting with a document on the market price situation. According to the document, Guangdong's general index of retail prices last year rose by 18.2 percent over the previous year. Market prices rose considerably across the province, with hefty increases registered at the beginning and end of the year and prices stabilizing in the middle of the year. According to analyses, the steep price increases in Guangdong last year were caused by economic growth, the introduction of various reforms, and other normal factors, and by natural disasters, artificial, and other abnormal factors. Through hard work, the momentum of excessive price hikes has been curbed to a certain extent, but the planned control target was still exceeded by 8.2 percentage points. The principal cause of Guangdong's consistently high prices was rapid economic and investment growth. The originally planned price control target was determined according to planned growth of 12 percent in Guangdong's GNP. In fact, Guangdong's GNP grew by 21 percent last year, which was certainly reflected in the general index of retail prices. Rapid economic growth gave rise to rapid investment and credit growth. On the one hand, this led directly to hefty increases in the price of capital goods, especially steel products and cement; on the other hand, as some 40 percent of the investment was turned into consumption funds, pressures to raise prices increased, bringing about a hefty increase in the price of relevant products. In terms of the macro environment, this determined that Guangdong's general index of retail prices outstripped the originally planned control target by a big margin last year. Great Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Swap Prices Last year, the state increased the weight of reform, readjusted tax rates, allowed exchange price fluctuations, and carried out price reform. All these have also directly contributed to price hikes in Guangdong. For example, the state raised the retail sales tax rate from 3 to 5 percent. As retail prices for over 90 percent of commodities in Guangdong were subjected to market regulation, the increase in tax rates was also reflected in prices. Moreover, as a lot of operators also jumped on the bandwagon, the actual impact was greater than had been theoretically estimated. Besides, foreign exchange swap prices fluctuated wildly last year. As Guangdong imported large amounts of energy, raw and semifinished materials, and household electrical products, a drop in the exchange rate directly drove up prices of these commodities by a big margin, and, at the same time, caused some people to expect that the renminbi would be devalued. With the acceleration of price reform across the nation, prices of most commodities, such as grain, steel products, and coal, were liberalized, and prices of railway cargo transport were also adjusted upward substantially. The impact was especially serious in Guangdong, which principally relies on imports of energy materials and raw and semifinished materials from other provinces and which sells most of its products to other provinces. Guangdong was repeatedly hit by natural calamities last year. What with the low-temperature cold front at the beginning of the year and typhoons and rainstorms in the middle of the year, there was a sharp drop in the output of fruit, vegetables, and grain. This exacerbated the contractions caused by supply falling short of demand. The impact of natural calamities on vegetables, in particular, was most severe, and vegetable prices soared three times. Furthermore, some localities relaxed or neglected the "shopping basket" project by turning vast tracts of vegetable fields into real estate. As newly cultivated vegetable fields are remote and their output is low, vegetable prices tended to rise when natural calamities occurred. Artificial or Indiscriminate Collection of Fees Adds Fuel to the Flames Artificial or indiscriminate price increases and collection of fees also contributed to rising prices. For a time last year, the phenomena of jumping on the bandwagon and artificially forcing up prices were rampant in Guangdong, but they were curbed by the provincial government through vigorous rectifications. By late November last year, however, because some newspapers erroneously reported that grain was in short supply and grain prices were likely to rise, and because some rice traders and self-employed grain shops took advantage of the opportunity to jack up prices, the price of rice soared in the short space of half a month and in Guangzhou rose by about 60 percent. Maintaining the basic stability of market prices bears heavily on social and economic stability. Last year, Guangdong Province took measures to curb wanton price increases, such as organizing a general inspection of fees collection and commodity prices across the province, seizing the right time to introduce price reform in light of the market price situation to reduce the impact on prices, and doing a good job in the production of staple food to stabilize prices of those commodities that bear heavily on the people's well-being. Guangdong also stepped up controls over the collection of administrative and operational fees in accordance with the law. According to statistics, in the first 11 months of last year, a total of 2,189 fee collection items were abolished and another 608 rectified in the province as a whole, thus reducing social burdens by about 300 million yuan. Moreover, individual dynamic, direct management at different levels was also administered toward prices of commodities and services that are monopolies, mandatory, and protective and have public welfare characteristics. Establish Price Regulation and Control System Looking ahead into the new year, the price situation in Guangdong will still be very grim because many reform projects will be introduced and the economy is still growing at a fairly high speed. The various price hike factors have not been eliminated. For example, in reforming the taxation system and readjusting the tax burden structure, tax reduction does not necessarily lead to price reductions and a rise in taxes will be shifted onto prices. The current overheated social demand will also drive up the price level. Wen Wuhan, secretary general of the Guangdong Commodity Prices Association, gave an incisive analysis of the strong motives behind the government's attempt to "control commodity prices." In his view, of the price reform aimed at establishing a socialist market economic structure, liberalizing competitive prices constitutes only part of the price reform. What is more important and arduous is to establish a price regulation and control system suited to a market economy. Viewed from this angle, price reform still has a long way to go. He stressed: First, it is necessary to make clear that the objective of reform is to establish, under state macroeconomic regulation and control, a price structure based on fixed market prices so that the government can regulate and control the market, the market can fix prices, and prices can guide enterprises. Second, it is necessary to have corresponding economic, legal, and administrative means to exercise regulation and control over prices, and to place these reform tasks on the government's agenda. If we pay attention only to price controls, we are likely to return to the old path of direct regulation and control.
