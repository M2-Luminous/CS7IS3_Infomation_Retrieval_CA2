Polish President Lech Walesa, in a letter sent to forum participants, pointed out that "Poland has a central position between the East and the West, the North and the South, and, consequently, it must be part of the integrated continent because this is in the interest of the whole of Europe. Poland is a country of enormous possibilities and a place where good business can be done. To place your stakes in Poland means to choose success," the president added.
