These accusations come amidst tension between President Trovoada and the government, following attacks published by the government newspaper, NOTICIAS, against the president. The newspaper is run by a PCD parliamentarian, Martihno Tavares. According to a source at the presidency, President Trovoada asked the premier to intervene to put an end to the attacks. The newspaper further accused President Trovoada of "not respecting the agreement reached between himself and the PCD during the 1991 democratic transitional period." The newspaper did not state what that agreement was. President Trovoada was elected at the beginning of 1992 during the country's first multiparty presidential elections, in which he stood as an independent candidate. The government was formed following the country's first multiparty parliamentary elections, which the PCD won. President Trovoada dismissed Premier Daniel Daio in April 1992 following a sociopolitical crisis linked with the adoption of austerity measures, an increase in the price of petroleum products, and the 40-percent devaluation of their currency, the dobra. Finance Minister Costa Alegre then took over as prime minister.
