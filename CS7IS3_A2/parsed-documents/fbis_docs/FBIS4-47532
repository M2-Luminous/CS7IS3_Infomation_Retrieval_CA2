To this end, a vector obtained by splitting the pFPCP10 plasmid by the BamHI and EcoRI restrictase was used for cloning the B/E gene and a vector obtained by splitting the pTE2IL3 plasmid by the HindIII and EcoRI restrictase was used for cloning the H/E gene. Deletions caused by ruptures in one of the plasmid DNA chains were noted in the experiment to clone a synthetic oxytocin trimer gene; it is stressed that these deletions are much less frequent when cloning a covalent-closed cyclical two-stranded DNA. These recurrent gene sequence cloning feature may also be observed in other cases. It is speculated that the difficulties related to these deletions or recombinations could be overcome by using the techniques which were verified in this study.
