FBIS4-28071 "dreas110__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-010-A Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo in `Difficult' Position Regarding DPRK Tokyo in `Difficult' Position Regarding DPRK OW0706190894 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0706190894 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Unattributed article: "Sandwiched Between United States and China, Japan Is Agonizing"] [Text] Japan, sandwiched between the United States, which is poised to begin a full-fledged study of ways to impose sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of nuclear weapons, and China, which is cautious about any sanctions against North Korea, is agonizing over how it should conduct its diplomacy. The Foreign Ministry's view is that if the UN Security Council [UNSC] continues to hold discussions on imposing sanctions against North Korea, leaving the current deadlock over the issue unbroken, the UNSC would inevitably vote to adopt a resolution warning North Korea, the substance of which is harsher than that of two presidential statements, or to impose the first mild economic sanctions against North Korea. According to a high-ranking government official, the government plans to place priority on what the United States advocates if the United States and China split in their opinions on sanctions against North Korea, but the government intends to vigorously persuade China, which is negative about imposing sanctions against North Korea. The government believes that if China is isolated from the rest of the world because of the North Korean nuclear issue, it would lead to instability in the Asia-Pacific region. The government is concerned that Japan would have limited policy options if a situation were created wherein China vetoes a resolution slapping sanctions on North Korea and the United States responds to China's action by taking the lead in imposing multinational-type sanctions against North Korea outside the United Nations. The Hata government wants to promote a strategy under which Japan makes aggressive international contributions mainly through the United Nations. It seeks permanent membership in the UNSC, and it vigorously participates in the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). For the Hata government, it is most desirable for all permanent members of the UNSC, including China, to take concerted actions to settle the North Korean nuclear issue. Unlike the Gulf war in which the United States took initiatives in the UNSC and led multinational forces in fighting against Iraq, the Clinton administration has continued to cautiously deal with the North Korean nuclear issue while watching the progress of negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea. The United Kingdom and France have taken a tough stand on the North Korean nuclear issue. It appears that their tough stand has not become a consensus in the UNSC because of the cautious U.S. stand. A growing number of officials in the government think of the need to reaffirm Japan's cooperation with the United States, saying: "We must think of forging a Japan-U.S. alliance in light of the North Korean nuclear issue" (according to a top government official). Japan, however, cannot make light of relations with China which have a great impact on Japan's security. Prime Minister Hata is likely to be pressed to make a difficult diplomatic response to the North Korean nuclear issue.
