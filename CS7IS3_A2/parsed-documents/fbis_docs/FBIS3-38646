What do you think this means in practical terms? [Kinkel] This means that we will probably have a NATO session tomorrow or Wednesday [9 February] at which we will discuss what can and should be done. If you don't mind, I would like to say first of all that what has happened in Sarajevo is really terrible and cannot be justified in any way. We do not know who fired this dreadful shell. It was very probably Serb aggressors, but no one knows for sure. Now we do indeed have a situation where the whole world is demanding that action of a military nature be taken. However, this must be considered very carefully, and I assume that we will be doing this in Brussels today. [Beindorff] In your view, Mr. Kinkel, do the UN resolutions passed to date cover military intervention? [Kinkel] It is true that in asking NATO to make preparations for air strikes on artillery positions around Sarajevo, Butrus-Ghali is basing his action on Resolution 836, according to which force may be used to safeguard protected zones. Sarajevo is such a protected zone. [Beindorff] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, you are reported to have telephoned your counterparts about policy toward Bosnia. I asked at the start what was the prevailing mood? [Kinkel] That's right, I was on the telephone until the early hours speaking to virtually all my European colleagues and, in particular, to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I cannot go into detail here about everything that was discussed. However, there were still differing views. Those with troops on the ground, the French and the British, are naturally concerned that air strikes could be a danger to their own troops and we all anxiously ask the question: What happens afterwards, after the air strikes? Might the whole situation deteriorate even further? The military leaders are in fact more inclined to warn against air strikes. We will be discussing all this in Brussels and, of course, in all this we Germans are, as in the past, not the best ones to give advice with regard to the former Yugoslavia and not the ones who should be particularly pushing for action, because if things get serious, the way things look we probably won't be involved. [Beindorff] Does this mean, Mr. Kinkel, that it is to be expected that for instance London, a NATO member, will prevent military intervention by NATO by using its veto? [Kinkel] No we cannot say this at the moment. I have spoken to Douglas Hurd and I know his view very well. They are above all concerned, and I say this again, about their own soldiers. Let us wait. I know all this looks unsatisfactory, and people think that one could resolve the situation overnight with air strikes. If it was easy, it probably would have already happened. [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, will you support military intervention aimed at selected targets in Brussels today? [Kinkel] I will be as cautious as I have been so far, simply because naturally the partners will be asking: Will you Germans be involved? They know our constitutional situation, they know the political situation, which will probably not produce a majority in the German Bundestag in favor of intervening in the former Yugoslavia, even if we are able to do so constitutionally. I mean we will not obstruct things. We will help wherever we can within our possibilities. I am happy that we are contributing in the humanitarian field, that injured people have been brought to us. I assume, I'll say it again, that there will be a NATO meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. The final command for an intervention has to come from Butrus-Ghali. Everyone agrees on this. It is interesting for me what the U.S. President said and also what the U.S. secretary of defense said in Munich yesterday and the day before. President Clinton has pointed out again that everything should be tried to make progress by peaceful means. He once again committed himself to an arms embargo. He did, however, also hint at air strikes or military intervention and committed himself to American support in such possible military action. [Beindorff] Does this mean in your view that lifting the arms embargo as requested again by President Izetbegovic is impossible? [Kinkel] I think this will be impossible for as long as there are ground troops out there, simply because the Europeans, some of whom -- like the French -- are there with several thousand men, are concerned that the hostilities will spread if the arms embargo is lifted. We, the Germans, have always been very close to the American position, because we were particularly concerned with protecting the weakest, the Muslims, and possibly giving them the chance to defend themselves. However, I understand very well the concern of my European partners who have ground troops there, and who say they will be in danger. Generally, in the case of air strikes, the use of UN ground troops would become very doubtful. This is what the French and the British in particular are concerned about. The French have around 6,000 men out there. We should exercise restraint with our advice, we have no one out there. [Beindorff] How great is, to your knowledge, the actual danger to the ground troops, the blue helmets in Bosnia? [Kinkel] This is an issue that has to be judged from a military point of view. I cannot judge this very well myself. I take advice on this, and the military people warn us. They say that the Serbs will probably react even more brutally if air strikes were carried out, no one knows. So it is a double-edged sword. If you read the German press today then, as far as I know, you see divided opinion. One side says something must happen, the other side says for God's sake be careful. Respice finem -- look before you leap -- what will happen afterward? It is very easy to say military intervention is needed, but the matter is very difficult and the consequences need to be considered very carefully. I can only say again and again: If it was as easy as all that the international community, the UN, NATO would have reacted in the past and met what has now become an an emotionally understandable demand by many people. Indeed people are angry and sad at the same time that it has not been possible to bring this problem under control. [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel you say this needs to be carefully considered, but there has been sufficient time to consider whether military measures are an option or not. Why is this decision being put off again and again, always with the same justification? [Kinkel] It is very simple. Those who do not have ground troops there are in favor of air strikes, and those who do have ground troops call for caution. Those who have ground troops there are the ones whose interests have to be taken into account. After all they have so far been the bravest of all, they have demonstrated commitment. We cannot let them down now, their military interests and their concerns need to be considered above all. And those who do not have ground troops there, like ourselves, should be cautious. The Americans know why they are being cautious, because they are not prepared to send ground troops there, which I understand. They want to use air strikes alone. It is all not that simple. [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, Bosnia mediators Owen and Stoltenberg are now calling for a separate peace plan for Sarajevo. Do you support this idea? [Kinkel] Of course, I support anything that can lead to peace including such a separate peace plan. I wanted to point out earlier, Ms Beindorff, that at the same time -- and I refer back to what the U.S. President has said -- we must try to do everything possible to reach a peaceful settlement based on the European plan of action which was, in turn, based on the proposal put forward by [French foreign minister] Juppe and myself. I do not know whether this will succeed. We must not give up hope here either, and I am pleased that despite this awful attack in Sarajevo Izetbegovic intends to come to the talks to show that they obviously haven't given up either. However, I am disappointed, and I'm making no secret of this, that there has been no solution to date, although positions are relatively close on most issues. This is obviously because the warring parties presently are not willing ultimately to make peace. However, nothing will happen if there is no willingness on the part of the warring factions. [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, you know that there is growing international criticism of the role of Lord Owen in particular in the peace negotiations. Do you share this criticism? Is Lord Owen still representing the interests of the European Union? [Kinkel] Yes, I do not consider it just and right to condemn Lord Owen one-sidedly for his extremely difficult work and his mediation attempts. He is doing an extremely good job -- together with Thorvald Stoltenberg who is representing the United Nations in this regard -- and he is trying his very best. All I can say here is who can do it better? It is terribly easy to have a go at the mediators, the plans and everything else, but levelling criticism from outside and having to find a solution in practice are two very different matters and the latter is by far the more difficult. [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, the last question. What do you think will happen when there are again no deeds but only statements? [Kinkel] I hope that there will be more than mere statements. By the way, in this difficult area where, as I have seen myself for months now, things inevitably go back and forth, I would not like to answer hypothetical questions, but I would be pleased if we can make decisions in Brussels today which would be useful for the meeting of the NATO Council.
