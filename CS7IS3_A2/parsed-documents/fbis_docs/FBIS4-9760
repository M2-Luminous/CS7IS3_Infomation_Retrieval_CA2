FBIS4-9760 "drlat063_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Havana Cites AIDS Figures, Ambulatory Program Havana Cites AIDS Figures, Ambulatory Program FL3103222894 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 31 Mar 94 FL3103222894 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] Dr. Rigoberto Torres, an expert on AIDS, has told this newscast that despite significant economic limitations, over 60 participants in a new ambulatory program have their food supplies guaranteed and the same access to treatment and medicines as hospitalized patients. Torres added that the diet program includes eggs, meat, fish, milk, tubers, and vegetables to bolster the regular diet received by every Cuban citizen. Torres acknowledged, however, that this special diet is below the 4,000-calorie diet the patients received while at the sanatoriums and which is still being provided to those living there. The Cuban hospitalization program began in 1986. Since then, 1,011 HIV carriers have been detected. Epidemiologists believe, however, that there could be another 200 undetected cases. So far, 164 people have died of AIDS, 12 of them due to unrelated causes. Full-blown AIDS currently effects 256 individuals. The life expectancy of an HIV carrier in Cuba averages 12 years, while the average for AIDS cases is 1.5 years. These indexes are relatively high in comparison with world statistics.
