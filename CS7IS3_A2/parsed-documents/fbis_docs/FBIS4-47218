Vital Activities in the Entire Southern Section of the Republic Have Been Endangered by a Single Stroke of a Pen"] [Text] For the last 30 years, all three southern oblasts of our republic were supplied with electricity through the Yuzhkazenergo system. Following the disintegration of the USSR, the bulk of the power capacity in this region ended up abroad, in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The Zhambyl GRES [State Regional Electric Power Station] is the only station that is in a position to meet 80-90 percent of local needs. However, in view of a fuel shortage, the Yuzhkazenergo distributes the miserly amount of power which the station currently generates evenly among South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, and Kzyl-Orda Oblasts. This robs of its sleep the leadership of Zhambyl Oblast, which considers itself the owner of electricity generated at the Zhambyl GRES. The two adjacent oblasts are not taken into account. The desire to dissociate at any price borders on the absurd. For example, it is proposed to tear down the power lines built by the Yuzhkazenergo Production Association and to create Zhambylenergo, which will report solely to the local authorities. The government has given the go-ahead for the partition of the power industry in South Kazakhstan, apparently being reluctant to pick a quarrel with the administrator of Zhambyl. Gennadiy Knyshev, deputy chief engineer of Yuzhkazenergo, believes that "10 years ago, when the economy operated in a far steadier manner, such a reorganization could have been feasible. At present, this is a step toward the abyss." The consequences of the undertaken transformations are easy to figure out. For example, where are skilled cadres to be had? Hardly anyone will go to Zhambyl from the abolished Yuzhkazenergo or Russia. On the contrary, specialists that are left without a job will head for the historical motherland. Inexperienced people will be recruited by the Zhambyl administration, and, therefore, the likelihood of an emergency situation will increase. This is as clear as can be to the power industry personnel of all three oblasts. Being concerned about this turn of events, they appealed to Kazakhstanenergo, the former Ministry of Power and Fuel Resources, and the republic government with a letter which, in particular, says: "Electricity consumption in the region remains the lowest in the republic. At a stressful time of preparations for the coming winter, with a minimal reserve of fuel, spare parts, and materials available to us, we learned with alarm about the expected division of our energy system and the creation of a separate staff for the Zhambylenergo administration. We insistently ask you that the issue of reorganizing the structure of the power industry in south Kazakhstan be canceled until the economic and financial situation stabilizes and the power supply to the region is made steadier. The construction of a high-voltage power line to carry cheap electricity from the north to the south of Kazakhstan is a priority issue in accomplishing the stabilization of the financial and economic situation of the power industry and a steady supply to the three oblasts of south Kazakhstan in which more than one-third of the economic potential of the republic is concentrated." Would it not be better to invest all the funds to be spent for the reform into building this line? For the sake of fairness, stresses G. Knyshev, we must note that among the reasons for the "divorce" there is an objective one. The current tax policy is such that the tax is collected for the budget from the entire Yuzhkazenergo. Zhambyl Oblast looses a certain proportion of these taxes. All of them go to Almaty and are then distributed in a centralized fashion. Would it not be better to try and solve this problem at the level of taxation rather than slicing through the flesh of a single organism? Following the creation of Zhambylenergo, the establishment of similar autonomous structures in Kzyl-Orda may become the next step. After all, the power industry of Shymkent will not be able to maintain them itself because the Kzyl-Orda power group, especially TETS-6 [Heat and Electric Power Station-6] meets its outlays out of the funds generated by Yuzhkazenergo. In a word, the power industry in the south of the republic is on the verge of regional or, more precisely, localistic "sovereignization." Meanwhile, poor examples are easy to follow.... EDITORIAL NOTE. As a message from the republic president to the Kazakh Supreme Council said, the current government and heads of oblast administrations do not amount to a unified team that is necessary to stabilize the economy and enhance reform. A quite convincing confirmation of this is found in the situation described by our correspondent, which concerns a key, basic sector in the absence of which no other sector can exist in a regular manner. It cannot fail to surprise us that the partitioning of the power industry, whose strength is precisely in the unity of the technological process and the opportunity for various enterprises to instantly come to a neighbor's rescue, is being devised in one of Kazakhstan's large regions with a blessing from Almaty at a time when the integrationist initiatives of the republic's president, including the creation of the Eurasian Union gain ever more supporters beyond the Kazakh borders. However, the exact opposite thing will begin to happen here any moment. This shows once again how topical the proposals of the president are to bring to an end "confusion and hesitation" involving the government, the local authorities, and various sectors--in the interest of the economy, the society, and the people.
