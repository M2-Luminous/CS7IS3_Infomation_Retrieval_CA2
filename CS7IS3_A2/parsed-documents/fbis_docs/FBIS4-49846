Vice-President of China's Supreme Court Liu Jiachen said at a press conference here this afternoon that the crimes of stealing and damaging facilities for railways, oilfields, power and communications have become very rampant recently, which has done great harm to public security, social stability and the national economy. Liu Xiaoguang, a 27-year-old jobless man, and his accomplice Zhang Guobin, 26, had plundered types of valves, seamless steel, tires and other materials valued at 520,000 yuan from the Daqing oilfield on 20 occasions from January to September 1992. The two were sentenced to death by the Daqing Intermediate Court of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China. Chen Guiluo, a 35-year-old railway worker, together with six other accomplices, had committed six burglaries at five railway stations and along the railway lines from April to June 1993. He had plundered more than 140 tons of rails and 111 wooden ties valued at 400,000 yuan. While being held at the police bureau, Chen tried to flee with other detainees. He was sentenced to death by the Special Intermediate Court for Railway Transportation of Liuzhou city in southwest China. Two peasants, Zang Wenli and Zang Genzhu, stole 60,000 meters of telephone line worth 90,000 yuan in one year's time. Direct loss from the crime was 100,000 yuan and indirect loss was more than 2.45 million yuan. They were sentenced to death by the Intermediate Court of Zhumadian city of Henan Province in central China. Hu Xinqi, a 22-year-old peasant, together with four other accomplices, had plundered or damaged 11 working electrical transformers from February to June 1993, and had brought about 45,000 yuan in direct economic losses as well as bringing about great disruptions in people's lives and local rural production. He was sentenced to death by the Huanggang Intermediate Court of Hubei Province. The six convicts appealed to higher courts after the sentences. All appeals were rejected, with original sentences maintained. The Vice-President Li Jiachen said that what the convicts had stolen were large and heavy facilities of high value. The crimes were also perpetrated on a fairly large scale with multiple accomplices. "Such criminals, who pay no attention to the public security and law of the state, must be punished severely according to law," he stressed.
