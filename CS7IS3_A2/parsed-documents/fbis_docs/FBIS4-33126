[Correa] I still believe it is a complex situation, not only because of all the implications regarding Gen. Stange, but also because this is a highly sensitive issue in view of the duties with which the Carabineros are entrusted in their capacity as uniformed police, that is, safeguarding peace and order. This is why this is an extremely delicate issue, as anything that undermines public order has very serious implications for society as a whole, and not only for the government or for the Carabineros. The situation, therefore, had to be handled with great care. [Oyarzun] Do you believe the situation was handled with "great care," or with the gracefulness of a bull in a china shop? [Correa] In practice, in compliance with express government orders, the executive branch has handled Gen. Stange's problem through the Defense Ministry. The Interior Ministry, which is under my responsibility and which according to the Constitution is responsible for safeguarding public order and the safety of citizens, was not directly involved in the negotiations. As a member of the political team, however, we were permanently informed about the entire situation, discussing the issue and as a group adopting decisions with the president. I have nevertheless had a normal working relation with the Carabineros, striving so that the problem with its director general would not have an impact on public order, which has been maintained at normal levels. [Oyarzun] Is it true that last week the Interior Ministry and the Carabineros held unofficial contacts to solve the crisis? [Correa] Within these past 40 days the government has been willing to explore all possibilities. [Oyarzun] The government or the Interior Ministry? [Correa] The government as such; the Interior Ministry is part of the government. We studied all the possibilities that could have led to a proper solution. Unfortunately, the different alternatives have not allowed us to achieve a definitive solution, but I hope we will be able to do so in the next 30 days. [Oyarzun] What is this definitive solution? [Correa] I sincerely believe that a continued lack of definition regarding the Carabineros command is not desirable. [Oyarzun] Who is to blame for this lack of definition, the Carabineros or the government? [Correa] I would say that this is a result of the situation itself. There was a court ruling on one of the most abominable crimes in Chilean history, which had already caused a crisis in the Carabineros high command. This resulted in the ousting of the then Carabineros commander, General Cesar Mendoza. Throughout the nine years of this court case, there have been events that have raised some doubts about the role played at the time by the Carabineros high command, and Gen. Stange is the only member of that high command who is still on active duty. The government is not to blame for creating this situation. This is the result of a very traumatic event. The government believes that the mere fact that charges were raised against the Carabineros director general--charges that must be proven in court--constitutes in itself a very complicated situation. [Oyarzun] The special judge assigned to investigate the alleged crime of "nonfulfillment of military duties," of which Gen. Stange is accused, has rejected the request made by the lawyers of the accusing party to hold a confrontation [careo] between Gen. Stange and other officers and to indict him. Is this not an important sign that Gen. Stange is not guilty? [Correa] It is up to the courts to decide that. The government has always maintained that the unsuitability of Gen. Stange's remaining in his post is not directly associated with the result of the court case. In this country there are laws through which it is sufficient that an individual be indicted on charges of a crime deserving punishment, after which it is presumed that he immediately loses certain rights, such as the right to vote and to be elected. [Oyarzun] There are those in the government who said that Stange's ousting was not a legal issue but a matter of principle, and that even if the president lost in this regard, the government would win a moral victory. Do you agree with this? [Correa] All this is part of a past we have not yet been able to overcome. There are many Chileans who suffered in their own flesh and blood the rigors of the military regime, through human rights violations. There are many pending trials, and many things that will have an impact in our lives for years to come. I believe that Chile has a very important moral debt with these hundreds of thousands of Chileans, many of whose lives were destroyed or who endured tortures or were imprisoned. We have to make an effort to overcome this past. I believe it is very important to pay your dues. I am not speaking negatively, but in order to be at peace with ourselves. [Oyarzun] Wouldn't it be better if we overcame some chapters in this regard? Do you believe the country can always look backward? [Correa] To continue looking to the past is directly related to how well or how badly we are able to overcome these situations. There are different ways of going about it. One would be to throw a blanket over the past, as if nothing had happened, like a collective complicity in claiming there were no human rights violations in Chile. Such an attitude would solve current problems, but not future ones, as the ethical bases of democracy and peaceful coexistence would be seriously weakened. I believe that impunity and the fact that people do not answer for their deeds undermines the ethical and political principles of a democracy. People must have the courage to face these issues with high-mindedness. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Isn't the agreement reached by the defense minister and Gen. Stange like a predated check, a kind of "passing the ball" for four weeks? [Correa] Undoubtedly we achieved a partial agreement, which should give us time to arrive at a definitive solution. [Oyarzun] What does this "definitive" solution for the Stange issue consist of? Does he have to go? [Correa] This will be decided in the next couple of days. I believe we should continue to hold meetings that will allow us to find formulas for finding a proper solution to problems. One can understand Gen. Stange's interest in seeing that the court case against him is definitively resolved, but as I have already explained, the general must also understand that it is very difficult to exercise a command when one lacks the president's trust and backing. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] What has the administration done in its first 70 days in government? [Correa] There were several important initiatives. Today we are submitting to Congress a bill on the Copper Corporation (Codelco), which is of vital importance to the country. This is an indication that there have been substantial initiatives in the drafting of laws. The opposition criticism that "there is a legislative drought" and that there has not been a legislative initiative is, therefore, unjust. [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] If you had to render an account of your first 70 days in government, what would you point out? [Correa] I believe I have fulfilled the tasks that are pertinent to my post under not so normal situations. [Oyarzun] Why? [Correa] Because what we have experienced regarding Gen. Stange's situation has not been a minor issue. Let me remind you that three days after assuming power we were faced with General Nunez's retirement, and Gen. Stange's problem cropped up 11 days after the inauguration and still must be resolved. These 70 days, therefore, were not normal. I hope the following days will not be as complex. [Oyarzun] Didn't the administration bring these problems upon itself? [Correa] No. All of those who have been most involved with the issue have agreed that there were no solutions other than those adopted by the government. [Oyarzun] What about the opposition? [Correa] The opposition has done its job in trying to create the greatest number of problems possible; the opposition has hardened. Please take into account that this administration has not enjoyed the 24 hours of the so-called grace period. I believe that even before assuming power we were under quite a lot of pressure. In view of this, and because we were facing a complex situation, the president invited the member parties of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy to discuss the situation. We were faced with the difficult issue of Carabineros. This is all part of the costs and benefits brought on by continuity. We inherited some problems from the previous administration, but there are other long-standing problems as well. [Oyarzun] Is it true that you have had disagreements with the defense minister and the minister of the presidency? [Correa] There have been no disagreements with the defense minister. We have a very direct relation, which contributes to the openness of our work. As in all human affairs, we share different points of view, but through dialogue and discussion we will achieve agreement. [passage omitted]
