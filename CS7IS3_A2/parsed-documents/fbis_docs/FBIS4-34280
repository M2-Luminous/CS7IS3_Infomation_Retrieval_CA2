The Central Bank of Ecuador, BCE, has issued its monthly report for March 1994. It states the Ecuadoran trade balance recorded a surplus of $104 million, a 41.3-percent increase over the same month last year. Exports totaled $250 million, and imports reached $146 million. Exports for the quarter were 4.6 percent less, however, than in 1993, $688.8 million versus $722.4 million. Oil was, as usual, the major export item, with sales totaling more than $264 million for 20.3 million barrels. Exports of items other than petroleum produced $294.5 million during the quarter, approximately $100 million less than the first quarter of 1993. Nevertheless, Jose Riofrio, marketing manager for the National Banana Plan (Programa Nacional del Banano), said "the effects of the European Union import restrictions have not yet been felt in Ecuador." Shrimp sales dropped 10.6 percent, while coffee rose from $13 million to $21 million. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0023 GMT 12 June 94) On 7 June, Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced the response to the bid for oil exploitation rights "is the best proof the country has regained its prestige and confidence abroad." He announced 28 firms, grouped into 13 consortiums, participated in the bid. There are 17 well sites in six sectors of the Amazon region that are expected to require an overall investment of $141.7 million. The winners are Amoco-Mobil, Triton, Orix, City-Ramrod, and the Ecuadoran consortium Tripetrol. Francisco Acosta, energy and mines minister, has said the best guarantee for the investors "is the absolute honesty of the bid process." Contracts will be signed in November, and work is expected to begin in 1995.

A BCE spokesperson has said this figure is $43 million higher than in April. The increase "comes from higher prices for Ecuadoran petroleum on the international market." The official added that "despite the improved conditions abroad, gasoline prices continue to rise in Ecuador." (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 June 94) Financial expert Luis Onofa, in an article for Quito's daily newspaper HOY, has said Ecuador's foreign debt has doubled in 12 years. This, he said, "demonstrates that despite renegotiation efforts, liabilities continue to pierce the heart of the economy, halting all growth." Ecuador's debt was $6.63 billion in 1982, and it is $12.96 billion now. Previous administrations were unable to reach any favorable agreements with the international financial institutions, private banks, or the Paris Club. Sixto Duran-Ballen's administration has "managed to restructure the debt," however. Capital will be paid in 30 years with a 45-percent discount, while overdue interest will be paid in 20 years on good terms and a 10-year grace period. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1607 GMT 7 June 94)
