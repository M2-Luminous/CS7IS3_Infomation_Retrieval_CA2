Representatives of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] and the Belarusian Strike Committee Council spoke to the participants. BNF Chairman Zyanon Paznyak appealed to the workers to continue the strike, which in his opinion is the only way to achieve early legislative elections and bring about the government's resignation. Syarhey Antonchyk, Strike Committee Council deputy chairman, pointed out that pressure was exerted on the organizers of the strike. Many enterprises, including the Minsk motor vehicle plant, announced 15 February a day off. The participants in the meeting demanded that the government led by Vyacheslav Kebich be dissolved by 22 February, and new elections to the Supreme Council be called. After the meeting, the strikers marched along Skaryna prospect to the Supreme Soviet building. The building was surrounded by metal barriers and a line of militiamen, so the meeting was held in front of the right entrance facing Engels street. While amplifiers and loudspeakers were being installed, the strikers were shouting: "Resignation! Resignation!" The meeting near the Supreme Soviet was opened by Syarhey Antonchyk, after which the floor was given to Minsk City Soviet Deputy Anatol Hurynovych, Supreme Soviet Deputies Yawhen Tsumaraw, Zyanon Paznyak, and Syarhey Navumchyk, as well as to intellectuals, students, and workers. The speakers bitterly criticized the activities of the legislature and the government which "having led the nation to complete poverty are continuing to sell Belarus." Syarhey Antonchyk called on the people to help appoint former Interior Minister Uladzimir Yahoraw to the same post in the new Council of Ministers. The participants reiterated their demands: The resignation of the Kebich government, the formation of a provisional government of people's trust, early elections in March 1994, and granting strike committees 15 minutes of broadcast time every night after the Panorama newscast [1900 GMT]. The Supreme Soviet has been given until 1200 on 22 February to discuss these demands. After reading their demands, the demonstrators started to exclaim: "We want Hryb," because they expected that the Supreme Soviet chairman would come out of the building to receive the petition. After Mechyslaw Hryb failed to show up, a delegation was formed to hand the petition to him. The delegation represented by People's Deputies Syarhey Navumchyk and Aleh Papkow and Belarusian Strike Committee members Mikalay Zimin and Alyaksandr Lysenka entered the building and handed the petition over to Mechyslaw Hryb. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, "we received no concrete answer, but Hryb pointed out that the main thing to be done for Belarus now is the adoption of the state [word indistinct]. Asked about his attitude toward the government's resignation Hryb said that he could do nothing about it. I understood that the Supreme Soviet chairman was dumbfounded." At 1340 the meeting at the Supreme Council finished. There were no incidents involving either the militia or the strikers.
