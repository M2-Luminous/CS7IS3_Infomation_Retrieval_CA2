Movement may accelerate the progress of reforms or may blow them up. This is yet another poser for the government which is pressed for time in this respect..." [sentence as received] ROSSIYSKYE VESTI today begins the publication of a series of articles revealing the logic and nature of the formation of vertical ties between local executive power bodies. The first article is by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential administration's directorate for territorial affairs. Having recalled that the power bodies of the subjects of the federation (regions, territories, and republics) were formed on the strength of "momo-party" lists and that the elected officials constitute the old system of local governing councils, Medvedev writes that, as a result, the two systems of state power in Russia were doomed to confrontation. "The main task now is to reform the second stage of state power or the second element as represented by the state power of the subjects of the federation. As a result, better prepared people are to take office," Medvedev points out. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the need to combat mounting inflation. An article to this effect strongly cricicises Russian businessmen -- a "class of proprietors - the main social base of reforms" -- for not being in a hurry to boost and modernise production and for prefering "to keep their money in foreign banks". Referring to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, the newspaper points out that the amount of outflowing capital is already 30,000 million U.S. dollars, with 2,000 million dollars being added to them every month. "So, who helps whom, we to the West or the West to us is the question. An answer is not without interest, the newspaper points out. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, dealing with the recent mortar attack on a market in Sarajevo, when 68 people were killed and about 200 wounded. Churkin's opinion is that the main problem in the Yugoslav conflict is posed by extremist approaches by all the three conflicting sides, including the Serbs. "Those who state that we as Slavs should side with the Serbs bestow a doubtful benefit on the Serbs because they support those of them who push their oun people to suicide," Churkin pointed out. "In any case, there should be a question of a political solution to the problem of Sarajevo and Bosnia as a whole", he said. TRUD on the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent official visit to Georgia: "One must give due credit to the courage of Boris Yeltsin who decided to visit Tbilisi -- the city where no one can be sure that his next step would be as safe as the previous one". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA opens up with a report on preparations for elections local government bodies in St. Petersburg. [sentence as received] The electoral bloc "the Democratic Unity of Petersburg", which unites about 30 organisations of reformist orientation, now stands chances to get the largest number of seats in the city assembly. Members of Russia's Choice constitute the core of this bloc. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russia's military doctrine: "The basic distinguishing feature of Russia's new military doctrine is that it gives the president and the government the right to use the armed forces to fight not only an external enemy but also an internal one as well". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article about former Chief Justice of Russia's Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin. The newspaper writes about him with respect and compassion.
