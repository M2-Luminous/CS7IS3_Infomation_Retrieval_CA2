Prime Minister of the Srpska republic Vladimir Lukic and RSK Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic confirmed at a news conference that the new dinar should be officially introduced into payment operations, which will be unified among the Serbian lands in the shortest possible time. According to the latest information, the text of a protocol has just been completed in Belgrade, to which, among others, the National Bank of Yugoslavia has also given its consent. It is thus expected that as of Monday the new dinar will also be the official means of payment between Krajinas and the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. There will be no more postponements, as this would incur great losses to both Krajinas.
