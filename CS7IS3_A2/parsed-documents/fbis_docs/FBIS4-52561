FBIS4-52561 "dreas091__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-091-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo, Washington Plan Joint High-Tech Research Tokyo, Washington Plan Joint High-Tech Research OW1005152194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 May Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1005152194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] With regard to the civilian industrial technology cooperation that was discussed as a backbone for "global bilateral cooperation" between Japan and the United States during the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the Japanese Government disclosed on 9 May that both Japan and the United States have agreed to launch joint research in four areas including the joint development of ceramics, which is used to manufacture the semiconductor substrate of the next-generation high-density integrated circuit. Mary Good [name as published], U.S. secretary of commerce for technology, will visit Japan in early June together with American researchers in charge of the four areas to consult with Hiroshi Kashiwahi, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology director general, and other Japanese researchers about specific ways to cooperate. Japan and the United States originally agreed to promote civilian industrial technology cooperation in 10 areas during vice ministerial talks held last December, but the two countries later agreed to initiate cooperation within four areas. The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain stalled, but there has been no disagreement between the two countries on promoting cooperation and pressing ahead in the four areas. The United States, which plans to convert the military and aerospace technologies into civilian production, wants to use Japan's advanced industrial technology. While the United States is increasingly moving to protect its high-tech industry, Japan aims to head off future trade friction with the United States by promoting cooperation in which Japanese private enterprises will participate. The four areas include the joint research and development of ceramics, composite carbon fiber materials used to manufacture machinery, data collection using a crystal protein system, and technology to build more environmentally friendly factories. The semiconductor substrate, which is obtained from the burned powder of nitriding aluminum, has been used mainly for military purposes in the United States. Under the joint research and development arrangement, an attempt will be made to combine the U.S. manufacturing technology with Japan's processing technology to raise the thermal conductivity of semiconductor substrate by about two times for the ultimate purpose of keeping heat from staying in semiconductors. This attempt, if successful, would serve to miniaturize the cooling device of large computers, liquid-crystal television sets, and personal computers, while prolonging their durability. Under the joint development arrangement, an attempt will also be made to combine U.S. stereo fabric technology, which has been used by NASA to build space shuttles, with Japan's surface processing technology, which uses high-powered lasers to develop composite carbon fiber materials. Japanese and American researchers will work to develop a technology that costs less in manufacturing composite carbon fiber materials. Composite carbon fiber materials will be widely used to manufacture high-powered engines and high-precision machine tools.
