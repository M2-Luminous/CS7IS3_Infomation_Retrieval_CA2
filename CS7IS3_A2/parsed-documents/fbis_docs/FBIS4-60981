This was the conclusion reached by Nursultan Nazarbayev, Askar Akayev, and Islam Karimov, the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, at their meeting on 29-30 April on the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul that was proposed by the Kyrgyz leader, the KazTAG news agency reported today. Trilateral summit meetings of this kind have become a regular event. They had been held in Kazakhstan previously--in the locality of Ordabasy in south Kazakhstan Oblast and also in Kokshetau. The main outcome of the present meeting was Kyrgyzstan's joining the treaty on the creation of a single economic space between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The treaty has now become trilateral. The presidents discussed a wide range of issues of mutual interest and exchanged views on the current situation in Central Asia and the CIS, as well as on a range of international problems. The presidents pointed out the positive trend toward deepening economic links in the region and in the CIS as a whole. They especially noted the importance of working out a mechanism for implementing the treaty between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan on the creation of a single economic space, which represents a new level of integration for the economies of Central Asian states at a time when obstacles to economic interaction such as customs barriers and double taxation continue to be removed, while at the same time currency exchange points are opening. The sides noted that the document is fully in accordance with the provisions of the treaty on the creation of an economic union between Commonwealth countries and is open for joining by all the states of the Commonwealth. The need to heighten the role of institutions integrating the economic, cultural, and information space both within the CIS and within Central Asia demands that dialogue at the summit level be stepped up, the presidents said. Similar problems in the economic and political spheres and traditional production and social links create real preconditions for developing closer cooperation, for significantly reducing the expenses of the transitional period, and for relieving the difficulties brought about by the process of forming a market economy. They believe a number of political problems are also common to the whole region. The potential for the peaceful and effective cohabitation of different ethnic groups in Central Asia should help to stabilize the ethno-regional situation. Within the framework of the decision by Commonwealth heads of state to render urgent aid to Kyrgyzstan, the leaders of the three countries discussed specific measures for eliminating the damage that the elements have inflicted on the Republic's economy. Expressing satisfaction with the results of the meeting, the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan stressed that the constructive and fruitful talks that had taken place would serve "to further develop and strengthen the historic friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between the peoples of our fraternal countries."
