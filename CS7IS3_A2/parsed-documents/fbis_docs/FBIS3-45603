The officers and men of Inner Mongolia's armed border police fight and live on the Gobi grassland and in desert forests, where the environment is harsh and the climate is miserable year in and year out. They shoulder very difficult border defense tasks. According to the requirements of public security and frontier defense work on the building of Army units under the new circumstances, the frontier corps party committee made strenuous efforts in grassroots building, improved the working and living conditions of officers and men, and helped bring the building of the force and its professionalism to a new height. This frontier corps has also been working hard to serve the autonomous region's economic construction. Over the past three years, they have reformed some means and methods of management that are out of pace with the situation and impede the economic development of the border region and have simplified the procedures for the granting of entry/exit permits and border inspection. They have brought into full play the advantages of border defense and have taken advantage of their contacts with the border defense departments of Russia and Mongolia to build connections for the development of border trade, tourism, investment, and exploitation between localities. Statistics have shown that, during those three years, the border inspection stations had over 900 meetings and talks with parties in Russia and Mongolia and quite successfully accomplished the tasks assigned by the governments at various levels and the relevant departments, for which they were praised by local party committees and governments.
