THAN SETTHAKIT correspondents have reported on the progress of this situation, and a source in the Office of the National Commission for Energy Policy (SPhCh) revealed that a check on large factories in Samut Prakan indicated that many used furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur. This was thought to be the cause for the ``acid rain'' problem. In addition to the Phra Nakhon Tai [South Bangkok] electrical plant, it was found that there were 37 factories out of the approximately 3,000 in Samut Prakan which released from 21.6 tons per year to 1,720 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. The trend was for these factories to release more sulfur dioxide every year. ``Those in industry still do not feel that it is important to deal with acid rain and are not prepared to switch from high- to low sulfur furnace oil. They generally claim that it would increase costs. Therefore we will probably need some procedure to induce these factories to change so that the problem can be solved,'' the source felt. The same source said that at present the government did not have any procedures to compel them to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. And the standard for sulfur dioxide of 300 micrograms per cubic meter was a standard for testing the atmosphere. No procedure had been specified for measuring the release of sulfur dioxide by individual facilities. Also, there was no procedure for punishing violators. These were the problems which made it difficult to avoid pollution. As for the 37 large factories mentioned, these were generally in heavy industry and included the Thai-Asahi Glass Factory, the Ajinomoto MSG Factory, the Krungthep Steel Factory, Thai Phatana Steel, as well as paper mills and textile factories. Mr. Prasoet Bunsamphan, the Deputy Director of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand(PTT), made an interesting point. At the beginning of last October the PTT had signed a contract to sell 3,600 million liters of furnace oil with a sulfur content of 3.5 percent to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) over 3 years for about 10,400 million baht to supply the Phranakhon Tai electrical plant and the Bang Pakong electrical plant. This was in addition to the 28,955 million liters normally supplied to the KFPh. According to the signed contract, the PTT is to bring in furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur content but may substitute furnace oil with less sulfur for an additional 30 to 35 satang per liter if EGAT is willing to use it. This could increae the price of electricity by 1 to 1.5 satang per unit. When one calculates the increase in expense and considers that the government does not have any policy of supporting this through reduced import duties for low-sulfur furnace oil, then one can see that this might be very difficult for EGAT. At present the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant and the Phra Nakhon Neua [North Bangkok] electrical plant use 2,600 million liters per year of 3.5 percent sulfur furnace oil. The factories in Bangkok and Samut Prakan use 1,300 million liters per year. In the past the PTT imported 50 million liters of 2 percent sulfur furnace oil for the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant. This apparently created a burden inasmuch as the price was higher than the contracted price. If the government adopted measures to compel factories in both Bangkok and Samut Prakan to use low-sulfur oil, this burden would disappear because they would be able to shift the burden of the price of the furnace oil which met standards onto the factories instead. ``If EGAT should import low-sulfur furnace oil, although it might appear that all the burden was shifted to it or the factories, in fact in the past the price of 3 percent sulfur furnace oil has been higher: U.S.$15 to U.S.$17 per barrel -- whereas now the price has dropped to only U.S.$11 to U.S.$12 per barrel. If 2 percent sulfur furnace oil were imported, the investment would be 30 to 35 satang per liter higher, but this would still be lower than when the price of furnace oil was high as in the past,'' Mr. Prasoet said. The EGAT deputy director also said that the Commission for Considering a National Energy Policy, chaired by Dr. Sawit Phothiwihok, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office, was considering making an announcement compelling factories both in Bangkok and Samut Prakan to use low-sulfur oil with 2 percent sulfur. But there was still the problem that many factories were not willing to use it. Nevertheless the announcement is expected this November. Mr. Yothin Tanthansakun, the Director of the Division for Safety and the Environment of the Toyota Motor Company (Thailand) Ltd., offered information worth following up on: if Samut Prakan pollution damages the finish of the company's already assembled cars this season, the company would correct this by applying wax to prevent corrosion. To be sure about this, he said that ``Toyota officials are checking to see if acid rain is causing this damage.''
