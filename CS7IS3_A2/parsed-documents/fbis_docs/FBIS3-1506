He told a news conference a working committee had been established on Monday night to explore the possiblility of holding the election in kwaZulu, where more than 100 people have been killed in the past week. "The Angolan experience indicates that in a society infinitely more riven than ours they actually did conduct free and fair elections. If they can do it in Angola we can do it anywhere in this country, including kwaZulu and Natal," he said. In Angola, rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the result of the internationally monitored election, which his UNITA movement lost, and returned to civil war. The IEC also announced at the news conference that there had been 305 complaints of infringement of the Electoral Act and 15 summonses had been issued. Mr Justice Kriegler said two elections officials travelled to Durban on Monday night and had talks with representatives of the kwaZulu government and the Transitional Executive Council on implementation of the IEC's mandate in kwaZulu. The meeting agreed to create a working committee that would include police to look into the feasibility, "under the current political climate, to mount an election in kwaZulu" as a matter of urgency, Mr Kriegler said. The committee began its work on Tuesday morning and is expected to report on its findings by April 5, Mr Justice Kriegler said. If the committee concluded that an election was not possible in kwaZulu, it would be up to political leaders to find a solution. "As far as the IEC is concerned, that will be a political impediment. It will be for the political role players to resolve the issue and to remove any poltical impediments," he said. The IEC visit to Durban followed talks between President F. W. de Klerk and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who had pledged to allow the IEC to work in his region. Mr Buthelezi's supporters have occupied at least two venues for African National Congress rallies in the region, sparking fears of a bloody run-up to the election. Political violence has soared in kwaZulu and Natal, leaving more than 100 people dead and scores injured in the past week. A Zulu march in central Johannesburg on Monday to demand a Zulu kingdom erupted in vicious gunbattles that left at least 31 people dead and hundreds injured. Mr Justice Kriegler said planning for the election in kwaZulu/Natal was going ahead. He said the IEC on Tuesday morning began identifying and securing voting stations countrywide. Asked whether the violence in central Johannesburg on Monday could have an effect on the election, he said: "It does not seem to impact directly on free and election. It may have serious political implications later." He added the IEC was in regular contact with security forces on plans to ensure adequate safety for voters.
