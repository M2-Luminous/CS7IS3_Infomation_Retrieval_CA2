Palestinian Police officers detained Hani' al-'Abd, who is suspected of having committed criminal offenses. Al-'Abd, a Jabalyah resident and an Islamic Jihad activist, was detained at his workplace -- the Khan Yunus Technological College. He was placed in the same cell in which he had been held by Israeli security services. In reaction, the Islamic Jihad distributed a leaflet in Gaza claiming that Hani' al-Abd's arrest was the beginning of a civil war. The leaflet argued that al-'Abd was detained because of his affiliation with an organization that opposes the agreement with Israel, and not because of criminal charges.
