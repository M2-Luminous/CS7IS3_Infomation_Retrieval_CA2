None of those polled had actually read the document. We asked Saturday shoppers these three questions following the release on Thursday of the White Paper, giving details of talks over the territory's future in preparation for reunification with the mainland in 1997: -- Have you read the White Paper? -- Do you feel that China stalled the talks? -- What do you feel the next move should be in the current standoff between the Chinese and the British sides? Marie Ng: "I didn't read the White Paper. I think both sides are responsible for the talks. The Chinese government is a dictatorship. Although the British have given a good impression, we know nothing about the negotiations. I hope they will go back to the table soon." Rainbow Chow: "I didn't read the White Paper. I don't know which side should bear the responsibility, but I don't like the Chinese officials because they are always critical and ungracious. I hope both sides will open talks soon." Danny Law: "I didn't read the White Paper. I felt that both sides stalled the talks. There seems to be no way to come an agreement if other countries can intervene." Collins Barron: "I haven't read the White Paper yet. Both sides should bear responsibility. I hope the negotiations will be opened as early as possible." Eric Winkler: "I didn't read the White Paper. This is a cultural misunderstanding, so the two sides need to understand each other. There is not much chance for China to improve its democracy policy because Deng Xiaoping is the boss now. I really hope the two sides will be back to the talks in future." James Lam: "I didn't read the White Paper. I think that they had better stop arguing and both sides should compromise and make mutual concessions in order to ensure stability and prosperity in the territory after 1997." Ken O'Byrne: "I didn't read the White Paper. Both sides should take responsibility because different people have different ideas and opinions. I wish the talks would go ahead soon." Merlida Dallo: "I didn't read the paper. I think China stalled the talks and should bear all the responsibility. I don't trust the Chinese government."
