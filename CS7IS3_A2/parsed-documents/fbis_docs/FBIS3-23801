A contract was concluded between the "MOST" association for business cooperation with foreign countries and the Polivinilatsetat Plant on 28 May 1993. It was based on the "General Agreement on Joint Production-Commercial and Investment Activity," concluded between the Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Russian Federation Committee on the Chemical and Petrochemical Industry, and the Government of the Republic of Armenia. The need to create a petroleum processing production unit in Armenia is conditioned by its acute demand for heating and motor fuel, as well as by the possibility of partially supplying the republic's chemical complex with needed chemicals. Liquefied gas, gasoline fraction, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, and fuel oil (mazut) will be obtained, as well as pentane-hexane (the basic raw material for the production of acetic acid), which will make it possible for Nairit to produce acetic acid, which is used at the Polivinilatsetat Plant in the production of vinyl acetate. The utilization of crude oil with a low sulphur content from Western Siberia is envisaged in the initial stage, the movement of which over the Novosibirsk-Batumi-Yerevan route is simpler and more economical than the products of its processing, since crude oil, unlike mazut, does not freeze under low temperature conditions and is far smaller in volume than the volume of the components obtained after processing. A group of specialists invited by the "MOST" association for familiarization with the state of affairs on the spot was dispatched to the Polivinilatsetat Plant for the purpose of creating the petroleum processing complex. The conducting of research work and the execution of orders for the manufacture of the equipment required is also called for. At the request of the association the basic equipment manufacturing plants have already started to work on the requisite equipment. The association has given advanced payments for the preliminary stages of operations to certain plants for the manufacture of the necessary equipment and has also come to an agreement with a number of CIS petroleum processing plants about giving the Polivinilatsetat Plant new equipment. Part of it was ready for shipment to Armenia already in the beginning of November. A good deal has been done in the last six months, it seems, in the direction of resolving this question which is vitally important for Armenia. However, we are forced to note that up to this day, despite the numerous appeals and telegrams on the part of the "MOST" association, the Armenian side has not paid for the work performed. We have tried to get an explanation concerning this from the director of the Polivinilatsetat Plant and to familiarize ourselves with the situation on the spot. Director M. Davtyan has kindly given us detailed information on the course of the conduct of operations. Thus, the organization of petroleum processing at the Polivinilatsetat Plant is very beneficial as regards the saving of funds, since there are unutilized fixed capital and engineering service lines on the plant's territory, the plant has skilled engineering-technical personnel and workers and, what is the main thing, the heating fuel will be used by the nearby Yerevan Heat and Electric Power Station and the acetic acid raw material by Nairit which is located in the vicinity. Taking all this into consideration, the specialists have concluded that all costs related to the organization of this production unit would be recovered in four months and construction work would be confined to 12 months all told. As far as the course of the operations is concerned, the director noted with regret that already over several months directives concerning the apportionment of 800 million to the "MOST" organization's account from the 1.2 billion rubles in credits granted to the Polivinilatsetat Plant have passed from the prime minister to various state ministers, the ministries of economics, industry, and finance and to the State Bank, to no effect however. Familiarity with the documents and directives leaves no room for doubt that all these officials well realize the urgency of the question and, it seems, are interested in its prompt solution. However, the fact is that the question has not been resolved in months. This loss of time will cost dearly and, undoubtedly, will affect the future of our republic, which is in a desperate energy situation. The Russian Federation has warned that installation of equipment in the already prepared sections of the plant before the coming of cold weather will be imperiled because of non-payment for the operations of the preceding stage by the Armenian side. The dragging-out of technological operations in 1993 not only will lead to an appreciable increase in the cost of the project but the time periods for the testing and operation of the plant also will have to be postponed to the beginning of the winter of 1994-95.
