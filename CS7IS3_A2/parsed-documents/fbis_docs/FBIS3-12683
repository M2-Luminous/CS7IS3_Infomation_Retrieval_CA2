The security forces intercepted the demonstration in front of the ROSE AL-YUSUF building and succeeded in dispersing it. These forces imposed strict security measures around the People's Assembly and the adjacent ministries for fear of a resumption of the demonstrations. The Central Security Forces surrounded Cairo University and engaged in violent clashes with the students inside the campus and fired tear gas grenades and rubber bullets, injuring a large number of students. Among those injured were Hasan 'Abd-al-Samad 'Asakir, a student at the law college; Sami Muhammad Zaydan, a student at the arts college; Mu'tazz Mahmud, a student at the law college, who was hit by three bullets in his left foot; and Sami Ahmad Fadil, whose left leg was hit by rubber bullets. A number of injured students were taken to the al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital. In the meantime, thousands of students continue to stage demonstrations in the universities of 'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Alexandria. Nasirist and Islamic students joined in leading the demonstrations. The students carried placards condemning the Arab rulers' defeatist stances and calling for an immediate halt to the peace negotiations and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in Cairo.
