FR940826-1-00072 FR940826-1-00009 51. For example, a women or minority-owned firm electing to use the 25 percent option may have a non-eligible investor with more than 25 percent passive stake and still qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for benefits that apply to small businesses, as long as the attributable revenues of the investor do not cause the applicant to exceed the gross revenues/total asset caps. In these contexts, no additional restrictions would be necessary, because women and minority-owned applicants, like other applicants, would be eligible to bid in these blocks and to qualify as small businesses so long as they comply with the same restrictions on financial eligibility that apply to other applicants. Since the attribution rule itself operates to ensure compliance with size limitations, it would not be necessary to impose additional restrictions on the size of interests held by investors with attributable interests. This firm would not qualify, however, for special measures applicable only to women and minority-owned businesses, such as ``enhanced'' installment payments or the 15 or 25 percent bidding credits, because it has a single non-eligible investor with more than 25 percent passive interest. In circumstances in which women and minorities are required to retain only 25 percent of the firm's equity, this additional structural restriction would be appropriate because the objective in this context is to ensure not merely financial eligibility, but that women and minorities retain control of the license. 52. We set forth previously rules defining more explicitly the term ``control'' for purposes of determining whether a ``control group'' maintains de facto as well as de jure control of an applicant. 44 We propose to apply those rules equally to the minority and women principals of minority and women-owned applicants. Consistent with our general policies with regard to women-owned applicants for purposes of our multiple ownership and cross-ownership rules in this broadcast context, we do not propose to adopt, at this time, any special rules or presumptions to determine whether women-owned applicants exercise independent control of their firms. See In the Matter of Clarification of Commission Policies Regarding Spousal Attribution, 7 FCC Rcd. 1920, 57 FR 08845 (Mar 13, 1992). 44 See supra Â¶49. 53. We also note here that we are proposing to depart from the provision in the Third Report and Order that bars publicly traded companies from qualifying as minority and women-owned businesses for purposes of participating in auctions. Most of the steps proposed to assist these designated entities in this Further Notice ( e.g. , bidding credits and installment payments) are confined to winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks, where there would be a financial limit on the size of participants. Because of the large capital entry costs of narrowband PCS, we now believe that even publicly traded companies owned by women and minorities that qualify to bid in entrepreneurs' blocks require additional measures, such as bidding credits and installment payments, to be able to participate successfully. 54. As noted above, we propose that applicants owned by women and minorities must meet the limitations on gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth to qualify for entry into the entrepreneurs' blocks. The size limitations would not apply, however, to all measures designed to assist applicants owned by minorities and/or women. The tax certificate policy applies to all narrowhead PCS licenses and would not be limited to licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Therefore, businesses owned by minorities and women need not meet the gross revenue and other financial restrictions to qualify for tax certificates. But minority and women-owned firms would have to satisfy the Commission's structural ownership requirements to receive the benefits of tax certificates; that is, they would be subject to the limitation that interests held by investors who are not women and minorities must be passive.
