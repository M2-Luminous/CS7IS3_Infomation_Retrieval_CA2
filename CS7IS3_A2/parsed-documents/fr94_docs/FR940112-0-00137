FR940112-0-00137 FR940112-0-00024 §500.26 Representations of servings, uses, applications. (a) The label of any packaged consumer commodity which bears a representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications of such commodity contained in such package shall bear in immediate conjunction therewith, and in letters the same size as those used for such representations, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight or mass, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving, use, or application: Provided, that such statement may be expressed in terms that differ from terms used in the required statement of net contents (e.g., cupsful, tablespoonful, etc.), when such differing terms describe a constant quantity. Such statement may not be misleading in any particular. (b) Representations as to the total amount of object or objects to which the commodity may be applied or upon which or in which the commodity may be used, will not be considered to be representations as to servings, uses, or applications, if such amount is expressed in terms of standard units of weight or mass, measure, size, or count. (c) If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR Part 10, by the Department of Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the terms ``serving,'' ``use,'' or ``application'' with respect to a particular consumer commodity, then any label representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications in such packaged consumer commodity shall correspond with such quantitative definition. (Copies of published standards will be available upon request from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20899.) §500.27 Multiunit packages. (a) A multiunit package is a package intended for retail sale, containing two or more individual packaged or labeled units of an identical commodity in the same quantity. The declaration of net quantity of contents of a multiunit package shall be expressed as follows: (1) The number of individual packaged or labeled units; (2) The quantity of each individual packaged or labeled unit; and (3) The total quantity of the multiunit package. Examples: Soap bars: ``6 Bars, Net Wt. 3.4 ozs. (96.3 g) each, Total Net Wt. 1 lb. 4.4 oz. (578 g)'' Facial Tissues: ``10 Packs, each 25 two-ply tissues, 9.7 in. x 8.2 in. (24.6 x 20.8 cm), Total 250 Tissues.'' (b) The individual packages or labeled units of a multiunit package, when intended for individual sale separate from the multiunit package, shall be labeled in compliance with the regulations under this part 500 applicable to that package. (c) A multiunit package containing unlabeled individual packages which are not intended for retail sale separate from the multiunit package may contain, in lieu of the requirements of Paragraph (a) of this section, a declaration of quantity of contents expressing the total quantity of the multiunit package without regard for inner packaging. For such multiunit packages it shall be optional to include a statement of the number of individual packages when such a statement is not otherwise required by the regulations. Examples: Deodorant Cakes: ``5 Cakes, Net Wt. 4 ozs. (113 g) each, Total Net Wt. 1.25 lb. (566 g)'' or ``5 Cakes, Total Net Wt. 1 lb. 4 ozs. (566 g)''; Soap Packets: ``10 Packets, Net Wt. 2 ozs. (56.6 g) each, total Net Wt 1.25 lb. (566 g)'' or ``Net Wt 1 lb. 4 ozs. (566 g)'' or ``10 Packets, Total Net Wt. 1 lb. 4 ozs. (566 g).'' §500.28 Variety packages. (a) A variety package is a package intended for retail sale, containing two or more individual packages or units of similar but not identical commodities. Commodities which are generically the same but which differ in weight or mass, measure, volume, appearance or quality are considered similar but not identical. The declaration of net quantity for a variety package will be expressed as follows: (1) The number of units for each identical commodity followed by the weight or mass, volume, or measure of that commodity: and (2) The total quantity by weight or mass, volume, measure, and count, as appropriate, of the variety package. The statement of total quantity shall appear as the last item in the declaration of net quantity and shall not be of greater prominence than other terms used. Examples: (i) ``2 sponges 41/2 ins. × 4 ins. ×3/4 in. (11.4 cm × 10.1 cm × 1.9 cm); 1 sponge 41/2 ins. × 8 ins. ×3/4 in. (11.4 cm × 20.3 cm × 1.9 cm); 4 sponges 21/2 ins. × 4 ins. ×1/2 in. (6.3 cm × 10.1 cm × 1.2 cm) Total: 7 sponges''. (ii) ``2 soap bars Net Wt. 3.2 ozs. (90 g) each; 1 soap bar Net Wt. 5.0 ozs. (141 g). Total: 3 bars Net Wt. 11.4 ozs. (323 g).''
