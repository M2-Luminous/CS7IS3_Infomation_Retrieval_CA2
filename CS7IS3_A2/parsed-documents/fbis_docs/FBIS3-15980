Before that the Saeima voted against these conditions, as a first reading of the bill, and also rejected the proposal from the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs, returning them to the government for reworking. The regulations were adopted by the Cabinet in the last days of 1993, and were intended for police officers working together with the Home Guards, with the right to search detained cars and their passengers. In the debate prior to the vote, Deputy Aristids Lambergs of the Latvian National Independence Movement stressed that the regulations adopted openly violate the rights of citizens of the Republic of Latvia and the principles of personal freedom. In turn, at a news conference after the vote, Latvian Way faction head Andrejs Pantelejevs welcomed all the racketeers and other (?kinds of) bandits whom the police officers and Home Guard will not be able to search when stopping their cars [sentence as heard]. The Saeima also adopted on its first reading a bill prepared by the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs on the National Security institution and the Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution. The Saeima rejected an alternative possibility, a bill prepared by the Cabinet on counter-espionage.
