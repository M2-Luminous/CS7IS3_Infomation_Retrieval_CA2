The instrument's construction and characteristics are described, and test results including typical spectra are given. The system is based on a Brueker 113V FTIR spectrometer, with an operating spectral range of 10-10,000 cm[.sup]-1[/] and a maximum resolution of 0.03 cm[.sup]-1[/]. The liquid-helium Dewar/superconducting magnet system is an Oxford S11/12L-40-13, with a magnetic-cavity effective diameter of 40mm and a maximum field strength of 12 T. The five-reflector imaging system is independently developed. Overall system transmission efficiency is 0.37 (37 percent). Figure 1, reproduced below, is a schematic diagram of the entire system, while Figures 2 and 3, not reproduced, show measured spectra for a test of the optical transmission system and photothermal ionization spectra (resolution = 0.15 cm[.sup]-1[/]) of ultra-pure silicon under various magnetic fields. There are no tables. Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of the FTIR Magneto-Optical Spectrometer References 1. McCombe, B. D., and Wagner, R. J., ADVANCES IN ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRON PHYSICS, 1974, 36:1. 2.
