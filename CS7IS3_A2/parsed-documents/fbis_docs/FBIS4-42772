Setting the date for the presidential ballot, Pasqua told the French Senate, or upper house, that the Socialist head of state's second seven-year term ends at midnight on May 20, 1995. Mitterrand, aged 77, has shrugged aside any idea of standing for a third term. First elected head of state in 1981, he has been sharing power with a conservative coalition government since the ouster of the former Socialist administration in elections in March last year. He also shared power with a conservative government from 1986 to 1988.
