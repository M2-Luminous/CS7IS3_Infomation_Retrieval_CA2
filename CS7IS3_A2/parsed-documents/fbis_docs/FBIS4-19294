The fund will provide support for the actual withdrawal and for pensioned officers from the Russian army. The money will also be used to clean up the military areas the Russians leave behind. This was one of the promises from Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal) to a very worried President Guntis Ulmanis who visited Copenhagen yesterday. But Niels Helveg Petersen declined to say how much Denmark will give to the "cleanup" fund. What is most important is to get it set up, the minister said. The visit of the Latvian president comes as a reaction to increasingly tense relations between Latvia and Russia. On 5 April President Boris Yeltsin gave his approval to a plan according to which Russia will establish permanent bases, including one in Latvia. This has since been described as a "technical error" by a Yeltsin spokesman and Russia's ambassador in Latvia has apologized. But President Guntis Ulmanis wants an explanation and a retraction from Yeltsin and believes that in the meantime the message from Yeltsin is: "A warning -- and not only to Latvia." And President Guntis Ulmanis will seek backing for his view in Paris and London as well as Copenhagen. For his part Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen described the declaration from Yeltsin as: "Mystifying and totally unacceptable to Denmark and the international community." An agreement on the withdrawal of the approximately 10,000 Russian troops from Latvia by the end of August this year was to have been signed on 20 April. But after Yeltsin's "base declaration" of 5 April Guntis Ulmanis cancelled his visit to Moscow. Another unresolved issue between Russia and Latvia is the closure of a large radar station at Skrunda. By way of compromise the Latvians are willing to allow the Russians to keep it for four years.
