FR940603-2-00159 FR940603-2-00091 Applicants in the FIR and SCI grants programs should limit indirect charges to the organization's approved rate. If the organization does not have an approved rate, the application should include an estimated actual rate. Applicants for projects in the Research Training and Career Development program are limited to an indirect rate of 8 percent. There are no indirect charges permitted in the Fellowship program. 6. Can profitmaking businesses apply for grants? Yes. However, for-profit organizations will not be able to collect a fee or profit on the grant, and in some programs will be required to share in the costs of the project. 7. Can individuals apply for grants? No. Only organizations are eligible to apply for grants under NIDRR programs. However, individuals are the only entities eligible to apply for fellowships. 8. Can NIDRR staff advise me whether my project is of interest to NIDRR or likely to be funded? No. NIDRR staff can advise you of the requirements of the program in which you propose to submit your application. However, staff cannot advise you of whether your subject area or proposed approach is likely to receive approval. 9. How do I assure that my application will be referred to the most appropriate panel for review? Applicants should be sure that their applications are referred to the correct competition by clearly including the competition title and CFDA number, including alphabetical code, on the Standard Form 424, and including a project title that describes the project. 10. How soon after submitting my application can I find out if it will be funded? The time from closing date to grant award date varies from program to program. Generally speaking, NIDRR endeavors to have awards made within five to six months of the closing date. Unsuccessful applicants generally will be notified within that time frame as well. For the purpose of estimating a project start date, the applicant should estimate approximately six months from the closing date, but no later than the following September 30. 11. Can I call NIDRR to find out if my application is being funded? No! When NIDRR is able to release information on the status of grant applications, it will notify applicants by letter. The results of the peer review cannot be released except through this formal notification. 12. Will all approved applications be funded? No. It often happens that the peer review panels approve for funding more applications than NIDRR can fund within available resources. Applicants who are approved but not funded are encouraged to consider submitting similar applications in future competitions.
