"I am not sure of the exact number, but there are no more than eight or 10 still in jail," Raidi told journalists after a press conference called by the Tibetan delegation to the annual session of parliament in Beijing. During his recent visit to China, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked the Chinese Government to provide information on 106 people believed to be jailed in Tibet because of their religious or political convictions. During the press conference Raidi, who is also deputy secretary of the Tibetan Communist Party, said Tibetan authorities had "already received several similar lists", adding that "certain people" on them "did not even exist". "I do not know how they (Western and international organisatons) compiled these lists," he said. The Tibetan delegation told reporters here that human rights were respected on the "Roof of the World" and that attempts at separatism were doomed to failure.
