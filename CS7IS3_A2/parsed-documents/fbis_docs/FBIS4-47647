FBIS TRENDS-27MAY94-Russia Military Bows to Pressure On Joint U.S.-Russian Exercises Military Bows to Pressure On Joint U.S.-Russian Exercises SUMMARY After Russian President Boris Yeltsin's retreat under pressure from the legislature, the Defense Ministry finally acceded to legislative demands and cancelled joint U.S.-Russian military exercises--at least temporarily. Russian press commentary on the issue divided along political lines, with communist and nationalist papers opposing the exercises and reformist newspapers favoring them. The usually pro-Yeltsin Izvestiya criticized Yeltsin's handling of the issue. END SUMMARY The Russian Defense Ministry, bowing to political pressure, informed the State Duma on 19 May that it had "postponed" joint U.S.-Russian exercises--originally scheduled for July at the Totsk training area in the Urals--in line with President Yeltsin's 26 April recommendation that it reconsider the expediency of holding them. Moscow radio (19 May) reported that the ministry announcement "particularly noted" that Yeltsin "agrees" with the Duma position that the exercises needed to be "cancelled." Segodnya reported the same day, however, that the ministry planned to hold new talks--set for June--with Pentagon officials on possibly rescheduling the exercises for a later date. The postponement followed intense political lobbying from hardliners and nationalists in the legislature, the press, and local organizations near the training range, which began gathering steam in March (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 March; Interfax, 18 April; Selskaya Zhizn, 13 May) as publicity about the exercises began to surface. The Duma, which had not been consulted before the public announcement of the exercises, expressed "doubts" about their desirability (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 15 April; ITAR-TASS, 20 April) and, on 22 April, sent a resolution to Yeltsin asking that he reconsider the decision to hold the exercises "with due account for the Russian social- political situation" and "the framework of civic peace in Russia" (ITAR-TASS, 26 April). Faced with such an implicit threat to social stability on the eve of signing the Civic Accord agreement with the Duma, Yeltsin retreated somewhat and referred the matter back to the Defense Ministry for further study "with due regard" for the "stance" of the parliament and "comments" made "by the general public" (ITAR-TASS, 26 April). A Military Counterattack Senior military officials appeared reluctant to take Yeltsin's hint and staged a last-ditch effort to salvage the exercises. In a campaign spearheaded by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, military leaders defended the military and political value of the exercises, played down their cost and size, and dismissed detractors as military incompetents: -- Grachev, who signed a memorandum arranging for joint exercises during his U.S. trip in September 1993 (Moscow TV, 9 September 1993) may have felt his prestige was on the line. He insisted repeatedly at news conferences that the exercises were "vital" for the sake of peace and friendship and to erase the "enemy image" and "really move" toward U.S.-Russian partnership (Moscow radio, 6 and 11 May). Asking rhetorically what was "wrong" with young Americans and Russians having contact and learning about each other, he complained bitterly about the "rumpus" and "hullabaloo" in the Duma, as well as the "stir" in the government and Security Council, noting that when the agreement was signed a year ago "everyone remained silent." He stressed that the planned maneuvers were "peacekeeping"--not "war" --exercises, and that if Russia really respected those "for whose sake we are engaging in peacekeeping activities," then the exercises should be held. -- Echoing Grachev, Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief, emphasized that the objective of the exercises was to practice peacekeeping skills and that, in any event, the exercises were extremely limited in scope. Extolling U.S. expertise in such operations, he stressed that the Americans would demonstrate such techniques as separating feuding sides and dealing with refugee and other humanitarian problems--a clear allusion to peacekeeping problems faced by the Russian military in former Soviet republics. Semenov also pointed out that the Americans had initially offered to conduct the exercises in the United States, but that the Russians had refused on the grounds of cost (Obshchaya Gazeta, 6-12 May). -- Russian General Staff chief Mikhail Kolesnikov expressed regret at the "heated debate" in the Duma, and complained that public opinion is being "deliberately provoked" by people who "do not know" or "pretend not to know" what "command and staff" exercises are. Emphasizing the small-scale nature of the exercises, he pointed out that "not a single American tank" would be on the Totsk training ground (Interfax, 4 May; Segodnya, 6 May). Splits in the Parliament Yeltsin's waffling stance also sparked further disagreement among parliamentary reformers and hardliners with some in each group drawing parallels between the exercises and the NATO Partnership for Peace plan and, depending upon their political orientation, either viewed them as another example of the West trying to take advantage of Russia, or as essential for cementing U.S.-Russian relations: -- Insisting that the exercises should be continued, Chairman of the Duma's defense committee and Russia's Choice member Sergey Yushenkov berated Yeltsin for heeding the Duma's objections to the exercises. He called Yeltsin's decision a "return to the Cold War" and linked it to Russia's delay in joining the Partnership for Peace plan. He contended that a decision on the exercises was "the exclusive prerogative of the executive" and that the President's stand "testifies to the weakness of the executive power and its poorly-considered actions" (ITAR-TASS, 27 April). -- In a more measured argument, Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko observed that politicians should "react calmly" to the military's efforts to enhance combat readiness, including joint exercises with other countries. Countering those who were "indignant" about "Yankee feet" on Russian soil, he retorted that in this case, "an ally, not an aggressor, was stepping on our soil" (ITAR-TASS, 28 April). -- One of the deputy chairmen of Yushenkov's committee, Liberal Democrat Yevgeniy Loginov, opposed the exercises, insisting that they had no "practical value." He claimed, moreover, that the majority of the Duma also opposed planned joint U.S.-Russian naval exercises. Alluding to 1992 U.S. media stories about possible Pentagon plans, including one that allegedly posited Russia as a likely adversary, Loginov said that it would be "nonsense" to hold joint exercises with a state that held such views (ITAR-TASS, 27 April). -- Chairman of the Federation Council's defense committee Pyotr Shirshov protested that Russia "cannot be made into a training ground for the American Army." He linked his opposition with that of his stance on Partnership for Peace, which he termed a "danger for Russia," arguing that by participating in that plan the Russian Army "becomes transparent to the North Atlantic bloc" (ITAR-TASS, 13 May). Media Reaction Media commentary on the U.S.-Russian joint exercises has predictably divided along political lines. The anti-West communist and nationalist press strongly condemned the exercises as dangerous to Russia's security, while the reformist press, including the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, supported them: -- In a strident front-page article in the ultranationalist Zavtra (the former Den), Major General Viktor Filatov, formerly editor of the Military-Historical Journal, called the exercises a "fool's dream coming true" in which the "[U.S.] stars-and-stripes will be flying over Eurasia without firing a single shot." He further charged that the exercises were part of a conspiracy aimed at Beijing and run by an American-dominated "world government," using NATO as a battering ram (No.12, March 1994). -- The pro-communist newspaper Pravda ran a series of front-page anti-exercise articles starting in March. Retired General Viktor Chudov charged in a long diatribe that the exercises were designed to dampen "reunification sentiments" in former Soviet republics and to inspire "separatists and nationalists" to "vigorous activity." He berated the Defense Ministry's "top brass" for engaging in such exercises instead of carrying out its own war games designed to repel potential aggression "by a coalition of nuclear powers" (16 March). A week later, an article on peacekeeping costs gave short shrift to a statement by Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev that Russia intended to borrow and learn from U.S. peacekeeping experiences, asking sarcastically if the Russian military intended to emulate U.S. military operations in Panama, Grenada, and the Persian Gulf (23 March). -- The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda published a long, extremely upbeat interview with Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Ground Forces, who described the size and scope of the exercises (5 March). In addition, following the Chudov article in Pravda, Krasnaya Zvezda published a strongly-worded rebuttal on its front page, charging that the Pravda article was filled with a "series of gross distortions" and written by an author who "does not have true information on the exercises." The Krasnaya Zvezda article ended by claiming that the exercises "should make a real contribution to the cause of international cooperation in the settling of conflicts in trouble spots" (18 March). -- The usually pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya, in an article titled "The President Will Be Making A Mistake If He Cancels the Russian-U.S. Exercise," called holding the exercises "a matter of honor" and lambasted the "absurd charges" against them made by "politicians of a very clear-cut orientation"--a clear reference to Yeltsin's opposition. Contending that there were situations "when compromise becomes spinelessness," the article charged that "unpredictable to-ing and fro-ing, whatever the reason,"inflicts "very severe blows on the unconsolidated authority of a Russia which, appropriately or not, likes to call itself great" (28 April). Outlook Yeltsin's pressure on the military to accommodate the Duma's demands to cancel the joint exercises suggests that he feels a need to yield to nationalist forces in Russia on at least some agreements with the West in order to try to salvage others. His apparent weakness in yielding to the Duma's pressure is likely to embolden his opponents to continue to attack him and his supporters over his policy of cooperative relations with the West as well. Moreover, the military's effort to proceed with the exercises despite Yeltsin's backtracking suggests that leading officers are concerned the yielding on this issue may jupordize future military-to-military relations with the West.
