Goncz and Demirel agreed that closer political, economic, and cultural links between Turkey and Hungary could also promote Hungary's Western integration in certain areas. Turkey supports Hungary's OECD membership and also sees cooperation possibilities under the peace-partnership scheme. Goncz confirmed the invitation for Demirel to visit Hungary, and they also discussed the situation in the former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia-Herzegovina. Goncz said that settlement of the conflict is necessary before refugees sheltered by Hungary can be returned to their homeland. Demirel expressed Turkey's readiness to join all efforts at ironing-out differences and preventing the war from eventually spreading to Kosovo, Sanjak, Macedonia, or Vojvodina. The Middle East peace process was the subject of talks between 'Arafat and Goncz. Arafat said he hopes for an early agreement on the basis of his Davos discussions, because it is important for the peace process not to lose its credibility by further delay. They also discussed Hungarian-Palestinian relations and the reconstruction program. Goncz confirmed an invitation for 'Arafat to visit Hungary. Birkavs told Goncz of Latvia's intention to increase ties with the Visegrad Group (comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). He called for new accords with Hungary, mainly in business and law. Birkavs cited security as a top priority for his country. Goncz welcomed endeavors to boost bilateral links, and expressed Hungary's readiness to help Latvia join European integration organizations. Goncz asked Paye to back Hungary's efforts to attain full OECD membership. Paye expressed his appreciation of previous cooperation between various committees of the OECD and Hungary. Accompanied by Hungarian Foreign Economic Minister Bela Kadar, Goncz and Larosiere discussed EBRD assistance for economic restructuring, privatization, and infrastructure projects in Hungary, amounting to ECU200 million so far, plus aid commitment of ECU700 million. They also reviewed areas for possible additional EBRD support, primarily banks and large privatized companies.
