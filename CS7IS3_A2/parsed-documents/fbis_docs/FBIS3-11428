He noted the GDP rose from $28.1 billion in 1989 to $43.8 billion in 1993. Investment rose from $6.5 billion to $11.3 billion. He said government investments also increased from $760 million to $1.425 billion. He explained that the government's savings rose from $850 million in 1989 to $2.2 billion in 1993.
