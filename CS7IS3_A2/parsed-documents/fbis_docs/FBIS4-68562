As a result there is a movement of the workforce from the state sector of the economy to the private one. However, the weak private sector cannot absorb the supply of available idle labor. A class of private entrepreneurs and employers who can employ large numbers of workers from the labor market while building or developing production units has not yet formed. The essential and proper conditions to organize production are not yet present in the republic. Only small enterprises are created in which the recruitment of workers is based on ties of friendship or blood. The number of persons employed by the state sector of the economy in 1993 was 3.2 percent less than what it was in 1992 (1993 figures are estimated). The number of persons employed by the entire economy dropped by a similar amount over the said interval. There have also been significant changes in the structure of labor resources. The relative weight of persons employed in public production declined by 2.8 percentage points while those who are unemployed increased by 3.1 percentage points. c) The branch structure of the republic's economy has not yet been determined. As a result, the formation of demand for labor is blocked. The resolution of the branch structure policy became essential beginning in 1990 when it was decided to make a transition to a new economic system. However, that was not done. Today work in that direction is slow. The policy on economic branch structure must be in harmony with the republic's resource (both material and labor) potential as well as its internal and external economic, social and military interests. It must reduce the production volume of energy- and material-intensive branches and expand the volumes of labor- and knowledge-intensive branches. Special attention must be paid to the service sector. It must be pointed out that in all developed countries more than half the workforce is employed in the service sector. In those countries, the number of persons employed in the primitive sectors of the economy (agriculture, forestry and fishing) is small (2 to 10 percent of the total workforce). In our republic, 20 percent of the workforce employed in public production is employed in primitive sectors, and 40 percent is employed in the service sector. This distribution must be gradually changed, and the relative weight of the service sector must be increased. d) The imbalance between the supply of and the demand for labor is associated with the reduction in the overall number of work places. A rigorous inventory of work places in the republic has not been taken. As a result the dynamics of their development can be estimated only on the basis of indirect data. Analyzing the last few years' data for capital investments, the utilization of primary resources and the number of persons employed in the economy as well as the results of individual studies, one can conclude that the number of work places has followed a declining trend since 1991. The number of work places in 1992 was roughly 4 to 6 percent less than in 1990. The qualitative aspect of the correlation between work places and the workforce is characterized by a severe imbalance. Most of the existing work places are incompatible with current scientific and technological standards and Armenia's new situation. The republic must have work places equipped with modern technology and equipment in order to open up to the world market. Unfortunately, most of the basic resources of existing enterprises are fatigued metaphorically and physically. In many work places the basic conditions necessary for work are nonexistent. e) The low level of wages is aggravating the problems of the labor market. The wage level has also become the important factor which is forcing a large number of employed persons to seek better-paying employment and to change the nature of their work. f) A portion of the workforce is leaving the republic in a disorganized manner. That has reduced the scale of the problems of the labor market. It must be pointed out that most of those who leave are highly-trained specialists, craftsmen as well as businessmen who could have raised the standard of employment by a certain amount. g) The role of the labor unions in the organization of the workforce is very poor. Although an agreement was signed between the labor unions and the government last year, no practical results have yet been observed. h) The presence of a large number of refugees [from Azerbaijan] in the republic has heightened the tensions in the labor market. In order to visualize the scale of the problems of the labor market in Armenia let us review certain data we have computed. In Armenia, an average of 340,000 to 360,000 persons look for work each year. An overwhelming majority of these people are persons who want to change the type of their work. Of these, 43 percent find work. About 68 percent of unemployed citizens and only 2 percent of those who want to change the type of their work apply to employment centers. On the average, only 25 percent of all persons looking for work apply to employment centers. As of the beginning of 1993, 67,600 persons were registered at employment centers. Of those, 64,400 were unemployed persons. By the end of 1993, the total number of persons registered at employment centers had risen to 114,000 of which 110,200 were unemployed. At the end of year, the supply of [idle] labor had increased by 68.6 percent compared to the beginning of the year, while the demand for labor had declined by 37.3 percent. Because of the low demand for labor, only 5,400 citizens were placed in work by employment centers in 1993. As of 1 January 1994, more than 102,600 citizens had the status of unemployed. More than 60 percent of the persons with the status of unemployed are women. The number of young unemployed persons is also quite high. The education level of more than half of the unemployed citizens is middle-school education or lower. Those with higher [above high school] education constitute 17 percent of the total. The labor market in Yerevan is significant because of its large size. Approximately one-third of the republic's population lives in that city. The capital is home to a substantial portion of scientific, cultural, industrial enterprises and agencies of the state apparatus. Also the population of the capital is highly mobile which expands the outer limits of the labor market. The labor market of Yerevan is characterized by severe imbalances. Nearly 90 percent of the jobs offered through the employment centers are worker positions and 10 percent are service positions. The supply of [idle] labor, however, has exactly the opposite distribution. As a result, the number of citizens with the status of unemployed had increased by 11,100 (2.2-fold) at the end of 1993 compared to the beginning of the year. The [earthquake] disaster zone encompasses 15 districts [rayons] and four cities subject to republican administration. As of 1 January 1993, 25.2 percent of the republic's population lived in this region. Although 5 years have passed since the earthquake of December 1988, the status of reconstruction work is far from being satisfactory. In the conditions that have been created, that work has either come to a stop or continues at a very slow pace. Because few enterprises have been rebuilt and construction work is continually postponed, the level of unemployment is quite high. The disaster zone accounts for 34 percent of the unemployed persons in the republic. These figures refer to unemployed persons who are officially registered. There is a large number of hidden unemployed persons in the republic. Generally industrial enterprises either do not work at all or work with interruptions. Those who work in those enterprises are, in effect, unemployed. According to statistical data, 12 to 15 percent of persons employed in the state sector (90,000 to 115,000 persons) were subject to forced layoffs each month in 1993. In industry that figure is as high as 24 to 31 percent (71,000 to 82,000 persons). Hidden unemployment is always present in agriculture. The number of people in that category has grown recently because of the war situation in the border regions. Finally, there is a substantial army of jobless persons amongst the unemployed (migrants, "small vendors,' swindlers, etc) and refugees. When these groups, that is the hidden jobless, are taken into account, the number of unemployed persons in Armenia can be estimated to be 250,000 to 350,000. The special peculiarities of the workforce in Armenia are likely to persist in the near future. More importantly, in conditions of high rates of currency devaluations it is impossible to keep work places that are not operational. If the phenomenon of hyperinflation penetrates the industrial sector it would be impossible to avoid massive unemployment.
