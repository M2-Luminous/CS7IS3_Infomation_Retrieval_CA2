A strong dissatisfaction against society has been noted among those on low incomes such as workers at state-run enterprises and peasants. This feeling has been considerably intensified because of the growing disparity in incomes, inflation, and corruption among cadres. It is reported that while the notice frankly admits the situation exists, it also points out that "all cadres should try to understand the issue correctly, and at the same time be confident it will be eventually settled by the party." In this way, the CPC has once again called on its cadres to trust the party. The notice can be said to indicate the current situation in which the sense of crisis within the party has been intensified by factors such as disparity in income, inflation, and corruption, which have caused social instability and now apply strong pressure on the party.
