"I think it would be rather unfortunate for the security sphere to become a political battlefield. The theme is too serious. On the other hand, of course, we welcome suggestions from various political parties, and deal with them with all earnestness," Ruml said. Many measures have been taken to regulate mainly common and economic crime. Certain positive trends can already be registered, Ruml said. The Interior Ministry has been dealing with organized crime within a long-term program. "We have no experience of our own with the broad organized crime, and we are only beginning to register some displays of it. We must be seeking our own solution to this sort of problems...," Ruml said, adding that it was not possible to copy the legislation of other countries automatically. Ruml said experts were considering whether it would be expedient to pass a separate bill on fighting organized crime, or merely to amend some provisions of the Penal Code and the Law on the Czech Police. He gave examples of possible security measures to be taken, such as the checking of suspect shipments, confiscation of property originating from organized crime and its possible use in fighting crime, as well as the detention of a thing for a certain time if there exists suspicion that the thing was stolen. Police experts have been carefully considering the establishment of institutions of "latent investigators" and the possibility of a legal provocation of crime, Ruml said. The protection of personal documents against counterfeiting is to be an important measure to prevent car thefts. The ministry has been preparing a new type of certificate on the technical condition of a vehicle, and evaluating proposals for the production of personal documents that cannot be counterfeited, Ruml said. He pointed out that the main problem in car thefts is that false documents are procured immediately and the cars are smuggled abroad. Ruml dismissed the Czech Army's possible assistance in the struggle against organized crime. The Army is being built for another purpose, he noted.
