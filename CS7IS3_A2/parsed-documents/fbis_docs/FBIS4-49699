Concerning the steps and phases for realizing the improvement of the market system, the meeting pointed out: In carrying out reform in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to vigorously develop regional wholesale markets, further expand the scope of market adjustment, improve large-scale wholesale markets and exchanges which are geared to the needs of the whole country, establish a better commodity market system, vigorously develop production factor markets, promote the circulation of production factors, realize the single price system for production factors, develop long-term government orders and contracts, stabilize relations of demand and supply, cultivate a new market relationship, and establish and improve risk funds at central and provincial levels and a reserve system for grain, cotton, and other important commodities.
