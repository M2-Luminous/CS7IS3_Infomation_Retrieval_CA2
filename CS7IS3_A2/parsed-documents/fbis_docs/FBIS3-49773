Upper Silesia's Future Rests on Winning Special Economic Zone Status"] [Text] For a while now, the Western press has carried predictions of the expected emergence of a new "European Tiger." Previously, that aggressive title was reserved exclusively for the economies of such East Asian countries as Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and others. This time it is Poland's turn, and we find the news somewhat surprising, to say the least. However, the Western observers' conclusion is drawn from the study of the Central Office of Planning [CUP] official economic forecast for the next four years, which includes a detailed prognosis for the next year. Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, who heads CUP, maintains that, over the next four years, we will be able to consolidate the economic growth that has already been noted, and even accelerate it. According to the forecast, the gross national product should grow at the rate of 4.2 percent per year, our exports by 5.5 percent, and public consumption by 14 percent. All of this should be accompanied by a 9-percent annual increase in capital investment. These projected figures are comparable with the indexes achieved by Asia's "economic tigers," and that fact gave rise to the aforementioned analogies, which are further reinforced by the proven accuracy of recent CUP forecasts. Will the latest CUP prognoses be just as accurate? This depends first and foremost on our politicians and the policies they pursue--in other words, on precisely those factors that should not affect the economy. The latest CUP predictions were prepared during Hanna Suchocka's rule, whereas the task of their realization will be entrusted to the new government, commonly dubbed the government of the left. It has to be admitted that Prime Minister Pawlak and his ministers have pledged their intention of maintaining the direction of the reforms, including privatization and controlled inflation. However, voices have been heard heralding interventionist policies, which should encourage exports on the one hand and promote our own agriculture and industry on the other. A small measure of state intervention will not harm our interests, and privatization should be carried out avoiding unjust treatment of work forces in the process and at a slightly slower rate, according to the opinion of the government team and its economic advisers. Only such nuances could now alter the accuracy of the forecasts. However, other economists see our aspirations to the title of "Europe's tigers" in bleaker terms. One of them, Andrzej Krzysztof Wroblewski, wrote in his paper, GAZETA BANKOWA, that the sight of the steadily shortening lines of people bringing their savings to banks and the correspondingly lengthening lines of company directors applying in the same banks to have their debts annulled filled him with pessimism. His pessimism was, according to him, an answer to the optimism of those who hope that the left-wing government will not expect people to work hard but will, instead, allow employers to pay them more. Such optimists see the supposed proof of the correctness of their views in the government's decision to abolish the "popiwek" tax [on above-normative wages] on 1 April 1994. Regular polls carried out by the Public Opinion Survey Center [CBOS] confirm a steady rise of popular optimism after the September election and the appointment of the new government. At the same time, CBOS analyses show that Polish people assess their material situation as rather modest. However, compared with the situation prevailing 18 months ago, they appear to have a stronger sense of material security. This opinion should be modified by adding that the relevant polls were carried out toward the end of November, so their respondents could not have known the scenario of the December "packet" of price rises announced for the coming year. An avalanche of these price increases is due to be triggered on the last night of the year and will hurtle onward right through until December 1994. The draft budget approved on Christmas Eve assumed a 27-percent increase in the prices of consumer goods and services! To make matters worse, forecasts concerning the situation in the labor market are hardly any better. It is expected that unemployment will continue to grow throughout 1994 and that, in four years' time, it could still be only 5 percent lower than in 1994. No one is a prophet in his own country, and that is perhaps why Western observers perceive our chances in a more optimistic light--starting with Professor Jeffrey Sachs and ending with Western businessmen, who recently seem to be somewhat more inclined to invest in Poland than they appeared before. They all agree that the obvious continuing modernization of our infrastructure, from the banking system through the communications system to the construction of freeways, speaks in favor of treating us with such new confidence, as does the continuing growth tendency noted in our economy. Unfortunately, prospects for the Katowice Voivodship appear rather black against that optimistic background picture. Such neighboring voivodships as Bielsko-Biala and Czestochowa have recorded a steady increase in their sold output, so they enjoy rather hopeful expectations and forecasts. However, the region of [Upper] Silesia will not be able to activate its economic potential by itself, considering its lack of gross profit-making capacity, the extent of its debt liabilities, and the absence of credit-generating capacity on the part of the majority of the giant state enterprises representing predominantly such branches of heavy industry as mining and the metallurgical industry. This absence of a growth potential in [Upper] Silesia will persist even in the case of a hypothetical economic boom enjoyed by the rest of the country. This is because--as we will remember--according to an analysis prepared a while ago by the EEC of the development prospects of Poland's individual regions, Upper Silesia is treated as a moribund industrial zone. This is bad news for the region's rating as regards its potential for attracting foreign investors. That is why its future depends, among other things, on whether the Katowice Voivodship manages to win the status of a special economic zone. Unfortunately, Warsaw and its power centers are not at all eager to accord it such a status. As we can see, the answer to the question "What will 1994 be like for us?" will depend on a great many factors. Some of those will be external factors that we cannot influence ourselves. Nevertheless, our country should by no means be regarded as a peripheral area of Europe, and such developments as stemming the recession in the West, securing lasting peace in the world (and especially in Europe), shaping correct relations with our neighbors, and the unveiling of Russia's war doctrine will not be irrelevant to our condition and our assessment of our situation in the coming year. Will a new "tiger" be born in Europe? And will it be a "Polish tiger"? The question remains open, but even the fact that it has been posed bodes well for us. Who would have dared to come up with such a prospect as recently as two years ago?
