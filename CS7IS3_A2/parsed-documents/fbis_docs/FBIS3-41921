The IAEA also informed the North Korean side that in order to inspect seven facilities in accordance with the technological check list, it is necessary that at least six to seven inspectors carry out activities for three weeks. It was learned that the technological check list delivered to North Korea includes items on determining if the number and material of the five megawatt-nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon correspond with what North Korea had previously reported to the IAEA, examining the operation diary, and replacing surveillance equipment. In particular, it was learned that, if a radiochemical laboratory is a reprocessing facility, the amount of nuclear material remaining in tanks and pipes will be measured. In addition, samples from the laboratory will collected and inspectors will check sealed devices and replace surveillance equipment. Public attention is focused on the North Korean response, which is expected in two or three days.
