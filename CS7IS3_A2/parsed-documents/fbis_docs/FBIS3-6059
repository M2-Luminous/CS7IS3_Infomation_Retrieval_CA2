Regarding foreign papers' recent reports that North Korea is developing new types of missiles with a range of either 2,000 km or 3,500 km (tentatively named Taepodong 1 and 2), a government intelligence source said: The contents of the reports are generally true. U.S. intelligence authorities notified ROK authorities early this year about this development. Intelligence authorities of the two countries have thereby been keeping careful watch.
