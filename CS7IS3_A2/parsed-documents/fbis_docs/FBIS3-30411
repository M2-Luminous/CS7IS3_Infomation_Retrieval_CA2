In a joint declaration issued during their brief visit to the besieged Bosnian capital, the two Islamic heads of government said that "rarely has a nation been subjected to such merciless savagery in the full view of the world" as had Bosnia. Stressing the humanitarian nature of their high-profile mission, Bhutto and Ciller called for the immediate lifting of the "unjust" international arms embargo, which "contravenes (Bosnia's) inherent right to self-defence." With all-party peace talks on the future of Bosnia set to resume February 10 in Geneva amid signs of intensified military build-ups by all three sides on the ground, the two leaders denounced all attempts to impose a settlement on the mainly-Moslem Bosnian side. "Bosnia must not be forced to negotiate at gunpoint," the statement said. "We will resist an imposed settlement which rewards the aggressor." [passage omitted] Both women -- the most senior politicians to visit Sarajevo since French President Francois Mitterrand in June 1992 -- also stressed they were opposed to a carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bhutto and Ciller, who were given the red-carpet treatment and a guard of honour on arrival at Sarajevo airport and for whose visit the UN Protection Force imposed tight security measures, called in their statement for an end to the siege of the capital. They also called for the immediate lifting of all obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the re-opening of Tuzla airport, northern Bosnia, which has been shelled by Bosnian Serb troops. [passage omitted] The Bosnian premier was due to take the two leaders on a tour of the city's main Kosevo hospital. [passage omitted] Izetbegovic said Tuesday his government would reject at fresh talks any settlement not offering the "just peace" which had so far not been forthcoming. [passage omitted]
