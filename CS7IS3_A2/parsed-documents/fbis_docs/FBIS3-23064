According to security reports received from a non-Sudanese party, the Sudanese security forces were forced to arrest three persons, one of them a diplomat from the Iranian embassy and two Lebanese. In addition, they seized pistols equipped with silencers and poisoned daggers. The whole case was shrouded in complete secrecy until the conference was over and then the three were deported. The conference cost 320 million Sudanese pounds and was attended by representatives of 27 Islamic organizations in Egypt, China, Kashmir, the former Soviet republics, Morocco, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. The conference was held at two levels: an open one held at the Friendship Hall and a secret one held at the camps center in Sawba. These secret sessions focused on studying the development of terrorist operations. Ayman al-Zawahiri [one of the leaders of the Islamic Group in Egypt] addressed the conference and stressed that his organization recognizes Hala'ib as Sudanese. He attacked the Sudanese opposition and said anyone who opposes the Islamic regime in Sudan is a traitor. He also said that his group is ready to liquidate the Sudanese regime's opponents in Cairo if the Sudanese government asks it. At its secret sessions the conference discussed the status of the Islamic movements in various countries. It agreed that the Islamic movement in Libya should improve its relations with Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's regime in order to gain a measure of stability and legitimacy and become the alternative if any changes occur. The conference also discussed the possibility of Iran giving direct and practical support should an Islamic movement start in the United Arab Emirates. It was also announced at the secret sessions that much backing has been given to the terrorist movement in Algeria through the dispatch of weapons across the Algerian-Libyan borders. The conferees strongly criticized the Islamic movement in Tunis because its tactics are not compatible with the situation and because of its refusal to use overt violence. The conferees were informed that armed action will start soon, after a number of trained Tunisian terrorists have been smuggled into that country. Agreement was also reached on supporting the Islamic movement in Uganda. A committee with al-Fatih 'Urwah as chairman and Colonel 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abdallah 'Ali and Sudanese Ambassador in Ethiopia 'Uthman al-Sayyid as members was formed to manage the terrorist operations against the regimes in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The conferees decided to exert pressure on Pakistan to prevent it from extraditing the "mujahidin" or deporting them. The conference also decided to set up an "International Jihad Fund" headquartered in Sudan under Ibrahim al-Sanusi with the aim of funding and coordinating terrorist actions in various countries. Iran announced it will contribute $10 million as a first installment. From the secret sessions it emerged that Ayman al-Zawahiri and Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz Musa are residing in Sudan, contrary to what some believe, and have full freedom of movement. We have also learned that Tal'at Yasin, whom Egyptian authorities believe to be in Peshawar, succeeded in returning secretly to Cairo some time ago and was one of the ones who planned the attempts to assassinate [Interior Minister] Hasan al-Alfi and [Prime Minister] Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. The actual number of Egyptians who were in Afghanistan was 2,500, of whom 600 had left Pakistan before the Egyptian security delegation arrived there. Most of the others had travelled to Sudan and Yemen. A secret committee chaired by Ibrahim al-Sanusi has been formed to take charge of providing them with a livelihood, continuing their training, and smuggling them into Egypt.
