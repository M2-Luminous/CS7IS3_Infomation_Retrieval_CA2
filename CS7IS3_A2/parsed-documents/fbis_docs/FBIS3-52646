Is that true? Has Israel stated conditions which you have accepted in order to have the negotiations resumed? [Sha'th] We will return to the negotiating table, most probably early next week without any preconditions and without any new additions to what we are committed to. We are committed to the agreement which we signed in Washington. No doubt there has been progress in the negotiations over the past three months. We will all benefit from this progress in returning to the negotiations to reach an agreement. In any case, we have passed the storm which Israel has created over an agreement that was not reached in Cairo. It was a working paper on which President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin added their comments. We are returning to the negotiations without any preconditions. [Al-Shubashi] How was it possible for Israel to go back on that document which it called the Cairo agreement? [Sha'th] In fact, we have not used all our cards. I have not published the hand-written agreement which the Israelis wrote and then thoroughly amended, and again changed later. I have not published the paper which we received from Rabin which includes reservations that are no fewer than 'Arafat's reservations because we do not want to escalate the situation. However, we faced them with what had happened. No doubt, the brother Minister 'Amr Musa helped us and was a witness to everything when he said: There was no agreement, there were working papers and the leaders had to comment on them. That is what Israel returned to at last. [Birru] Has there been any progress concerning points of difference, especially crossings and the Jericho area? [Sha'th] In fact, closer views were realized in Cairo, Oslo, and Paris negotiations. But what spoiled the broth was changing this progress into a claim that a final agreement was reached. If they said progress was achieved then we would have happily agreed with them, but now we have to go back to the negotiations to place all that we have on the table. We do not want to go back on any progress that has been realized. We want to negotiate on what we have not agreed on. [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, both of you have agreed to defer the question of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Jerusalem is being Judaized daily. What can the Palestinians do to stop this ongoing process of Judaization? [Sha'th] As a matter of fact, there is nothing in what we have agreed upon that allows the Israelis to take advantage of time. Therefore, any attempt prior to a final agreement on Jerusalem and the rest of the areas of the West Bank, as well as the other issues which we have not discussed now, will sabotage the goodwill and trust that should prevail between us to arrive at a final solution. We will not sit idle toward any premature attempt. We can protest in various ways. We can also go to the U.S. and Russian sponsors, who signed this agreement with us. Everything should remain the way it is. Anything on which we do not negotiate now should remain frozen until we discuss it two years later. [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat told our radio that withdrawal means withdrawal, and not redeployment. As journalists who follow what happens, we have read that the United States has earmarked funds to finance Israeli redeployment. Do we understand from this that the United States blesses redeployment, and not withdrawal? [Sha'th] I do not think the Americans want to change or amend this agreement. The opposite is true. However, we should distinguish between what we agreed upon in Gaza and Jericho and what we agreed upon in the rest of the West Bank, which is called redeployment. Any funds that Israel will have to pay will be as a result of redeployment and not withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. They will have only small forces in Gaza and Jericho to defend the settlements from within. But the real redeployment will happen in the rest of the West Bank. [Al-Shubashi] Is there a plan to have a future agreement on the future of the settlements inside the Gaza Strip? [Sha'th] The settlements are the same as Jerusalem and the return of the 1948 refugees. The final status of these questions has been deferred to the final negotiations to be held within two years. [Al-Shubashi] The fact that the settlements will remain in Gaza requires Israeli forces to protect them, because Israel insists that the security of the settlements should be in its own hands. How will this problem be resolved? [Sha'th] The problem is already solved because the agreement we signed in Washington states that Israel is responsible for the security of the settlements. However, the disagreement is about the security belt that surrounds the settlements. We have agreed after long negotiations that protecting the security of the settlements will be from inside and not outside the settlements. The negotiations are now about the security framework of these settlements. This is because we think there is enough territory usurped by Israel for the settlement activity to station any small force over there without a need for any further territory. [Birru] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you. [Sha'th] You are welcome.
