He is a member of the European Union troika which has expressed its support for the economic reforms and political dialogue in Algeria while condemning violence in that country. This took place last Monday after a short visit to Algiers by the three ministers. Willy Claes therefore talks about the result of this visit to Algeria. The interview was conducted by Anne-Marie Mouradian in Brussels: [Begin recording] [Claes] First, the government authorities as well as the presidency are firmly determined to continue the monetary and economic reform policy. Second, in order to establish a pluralistic democratic system where human rights are fully respected, they confirmed that they want to continue the dialogue with any political tendency or faction which expresses the willingness publicly to reject the use of violence and terrorism. [Mouradian] Europe has expressed its determination to help Algeria to overcome the economic difficulties on which Islamic fundamentalism thrives. How is Europe helping? [Claes] The European effort should be seen in combination with the activities and actions of other international institutions. As for the European Union [EU], we already decided a few weeks ago to grant the last instalment of a financial aid package to Algeria's balance of payments worth ECU150 million. Now we have realized that this is not enough. We are now waiting for a concrete proposal by the president of the European Commission to strengthen this aid to the balance of payments -- this could amount to ECU200 million -- as well as helping the social policy program which, with the job creation program, is the absolute priority of the Algerian Government. It would not surprise me if, within the next few months, the EU Council of Minister mandates the Commission to start negotiations with the Algerian Government in order to sign a partnership agreement along the lines of what is also being negotiated with the other Maghreb countries, Morocco and Tunisia. [Mouradian] Mr. Claes, a recent NATO report stressed the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa, particularly in Algeria. Is this Islamic fundamentalism a major threat to the West at the moment? [Claes] I believe that the EU is threatened by the rise of nationalism and racism on its eastern borders and by Islamic fundamentalism, which is fanaticism based on religion, on its southern borders. We should not underestimate this danger which is threatening us in Europe. Hence our responsibility to fight against this fanaticism by trying to work out social and economic answers. It is clear in fact that the fundamentalists take advantage of social and economic weaknesses to make progress and do away with democratic regimes. [Mouradian] Isn't there a fundamental difference of approach between the United States and Europe? The Americans seem to have encouraged Algiers to negotiate with the fundamentalists even if this means their participation in government, while the Europeans seem to be more reluctant? [Claes] First, this is not an official opinion of Washington. But I cannot deny that officials of different ranks have recently adopted positions in favor of this approach. I know North Africa quite well. I honestly think that this U.S. approach is naive, because embarking on such a dialogue requires partners. As far as I am concerned, I don't know where these so-called moderates are. I would say that the moderate fundamentalists were at the National Conference and are in the government in Algeria. Up until now, I have not been able to see anyone within the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], that famous movement, coming out as valid partners, rejecting extremist options and, above all, violence. [Mouradian] A last question: Are there not differences among the Twelve? Is there really a common European foreign policy vis-a-vis Algeria? [Claes] I am not sure if we can speak of big differences. It is true that some countries have always been more interested in a community Mediterranean policy than others. This is not surprising in fact. Having said this, let's be honest, there is not, as yet, a common foreign policy on North Africa. The Maastricht Treaty only came into force on 1 November last year: we cannot expect miracles. As you know, we have agreed on some common actions in the Middle East, South Africa, and in the former Yugoslavia. But I think I can say that basically, the EU Council of Minister unanimously agrees that the policy of economic and monetary reform absolutely must be supported in order to help -- in the case of North Africa -- the fight against fundamentalism. There are no contradictions on this matter among the Twelve. [end recording]
