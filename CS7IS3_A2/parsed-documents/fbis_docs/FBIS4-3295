Hata, 58, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has been the main contender since Hosokawa announced his bombshell resignation on April 8 amid a Diet (Parliament) stalemate sparked by his personal financial affairs. The choice of Hata today dashed the hope of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, who simultaneously abandoned his plan to leave the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to run in an upcoming Diet election for the premiership. Watanabe, an LDP veteran, had tried to align with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party), the key political forces within the current seven-party coalition, with the aim of leading, or at least influencing, the next government. By keeping Watanabe and his supporters within the fold, the LDP, still the largest single party, has averted another major split and is still a thorn in the coalition's side. The LDP lost its 38-year-old grip on power last summer after Hata and his political ally, Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the party with their followers to form Shinseito. It was the second attempt by Watanabe, 70, for the prime ministership. He made his first attempt when the LDP was in power. Political commentators said he changed his mind this time after realizing the slim possibility of winning support from Shinseito and other parties. If a policy platform statement is signed by the coalition partners, the leaders of the alliance will nominate Hata for the premiership as early as Wednesday [20 April].
