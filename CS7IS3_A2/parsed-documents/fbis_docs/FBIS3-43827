Addressing a joint news conference with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in Pretoria, he said there were minority groups which were not only concerned about their future and values, but which were determined to arrest all movement to a democratic future. It was the democratic movement's duty to address the fears of all South Africans, including those of minorities. Mr Mandela said an holistic strategy should be applied to solve the violence. The plan discussed with President F W de Klerk could be jeopardised if details were published prematurely, because it involved a number of parties. But Mr Mandela said measures could include a region being declared a disaster area, that the entire community be involved in upgrading programmes, and that hostels be turned into family units. Tremendous progress had been made in building a new South Africa, and there were many people who were determined to contribute to this process. The ANC would continue trying to involve the Freedom Alliance and other parties in the elections, but would proceed without them if necessary. Polls which indicated a landslide election victory for the ANC were encouraging, said Mr Mandela but warned against complacency. The ANC should be on its toes, for while the government might be tagged as illegitimate, paralyzed by corruption, and accused of orchestrating violence, it remained devastatingly effective in elections. The ANC's National Executive Committee would seriously and sympathetically consider an invitation from France for South Africa to join the Franco-African Conference, to be held in Paris this year. Mr Juppe announced France was prepared to assist in training the national peacekeeping force. He added that few countries were interested in improving links with Africa, and were looking instead at the Pacific Rim or Latin America, but France would not forget Africa, and this would ensure a basis for co-operation.
