Does this worry you personally? [Rybkin] For some reason one decree is being taken out of the context of all the State Duma decrees adopted 23 February, namely the one on a political and economic amnesty. Although we have issued a package of five documents, the main one of them being the Memorandum on Accord which says that, together with the government and president and other federal power structures, we must elaborate in the next two to three months joint approaches toward solving a wide range of problems of a political, economic, national, and social nature. All this work should have preceded the implementation of the decree on an amnesty, because the amnesty itself is supposed to last quite a long time. Under the president's legislative initiative it is proposed to release a total of 222,000 people from places of confinement and national economic construction sites, plus those involved in the events of August 1991 and September and October 1993. It turned out that some inconsistency arose in implementing the adopted decisions because of insufficiently efficient coordination between the authorities. Undoubtedly all this creates certain problems in society. Nevertheless, based on the provisions of the Memorandum on Accord, we must see to it that the people who have been released find their place in this life and that they are actively included in constructive work to extricate Russia from the crisis. I think an absolute majority of them will do just that. But if some people lack the intelligence, the heart, or the desire to work for accord.... The state has the strength to put them in their place. Especially as the supplement to the Criminal Code, which has already been given its first reading and which will, I hope, acquire the force of law in the near future, envisages the strengthening of punishments relating precisely to the entire range of articles referred to in the decree on an amnesty.
