The contenders in the final ballot are the candidate from the right (with 32.8 percent of the votes) and the candidate from the center (26.3 percent). These are surprise results in the provincial elections in Catania. Little more than six months after the choice of Enzo Bianco as "progressive" mayor of Palermo, the city has suddenly turned its back against the left, placing on the final ballot the National Alliance candidate Nello Musumeci and the Pact for Italy politician Stello Maugiameli. Rejected with no chance of appeal are Andrea Scudieri (PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], Communist Renewal, AD [Democratic Alliance], Rete, and the Greens) and Maurizio Pellegrino (socialist and PDS circles plus League). National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fino is exultant: "This is the proof that we are not destined to fall into the hands of the left." Satisfied too are [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni, [Italian Republican Party Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa, and the CCD [Democratic Christian Center] neocentrists. Tolling the death knell, for the left, [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto recited a late "mea culpa." "We should not be disheartened, but work hard, because the battle will be a hard one."
