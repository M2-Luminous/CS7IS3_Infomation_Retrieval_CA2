Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic has stated. Jovanovic said in an interview published in the Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Friday [21 January] that the declaration was the cornerstone of the beginning of a process of the normalization of relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia, since he said disagreements which emerge at the peace conference on the former Yugoslavia would be resolved only later on in that process. The Serb Krajina is one of the open issues, and the F.R.Y. can only help resolve the issue by political means and not force, since the future of the Serb Krajina is strictly the affair of the Krajina people, itself. The joint declaration only strengthens the state of peace and it does not affect any of the centuries-old rights of the Serbian people in the Serb Krajina, Jovanovic said. Asked about the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has publicly interpreted as a diplomatic recognition of Croatia by the F.R.Y., Jovanovic said the liaison offices were a transitional solution on the way of establishing full diplomatic relations, on condition the disputed issues of interest to both countries were first resolved. It has been agreed that the liaison offices start working on February 15. Serbs in Croatia will be able to seek aid from the F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and to present possible complaints against the actions of Croatian authorities. Jovanovic underscored the importance of the normalization of relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia for the Geneva peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that Yugoslavia and Croatia had decided to strengthen peace and, thereby, also the positions of the Serb and Croat sides in the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The decision of Yugoslavia and Croatia to resolve problems by peaceful means has unmasked the Muslim side, which has anyway identified itself as a side committed strictly to a war option in the peace talks held so far, the Yugoslav foreign minister said in the interview to the Belgrade daily.
