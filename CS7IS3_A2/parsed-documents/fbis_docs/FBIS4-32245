A growth in meat production is not expected until the beginning of next year. The situation in grain processing is also difficult. During the first three years of economic reform, we harvested 27-28 million metric tons of grain each year. Grain and grain product prices remained relatively stable until early 1992. Despite the fact that growth indicators of these prices were half the rate of inflation, this had no definite negative effect on this sector, primarily due to the size of turnovers (hog production rose, and large quantities of grain were imported). In 1992, grain production dropped to 20 million tons, and, at the same time, during the course of one year, their prices almost tripled. The following year brought an increase in grain production (to 23.5 million tons), while the size of animal production dropped. A state of relative price and production stability developed. Present grain prices are about 15 percent lower than in the spring of last year. Experts in the Agency for Agricultural Marketing (ARR) are forecasting that, after the 1994 harvest, they will drop still more. Domestic consumption demand has little effect on the stability of the grain market. It remains at a steady 115-120 kg per capita per year. The growth rate of grain product prices is not only lower than the rate of inflation, but it is also lower than the price growth of grain itself. An additional factor that helps to maintain this situation is the rather high (82.2 thousand tons in 1993) import of flour. The fact that prices of grain and grain products are not keeping up with inflation is responsible for the steady reduction in the processing margin. The stability of grain prices between harvests means, in turn, that almost no advantage is being taken of the seasonal differences between them. The storage margin category (with fixed costs rising greatly and warehousing costs varying) is almost disappearing. The State Grain Elevators (PZZ) are not able to make a profit at this time and thus accumulate funds for either development or turnovers. Nor did they have these funds previously when, on principle, they were not enterprises created for profit. However, as a result of decisions made on higher levels, they were entangled in investment ventures and thus encumbered with high credit payments. Their debt, by virtue of this, is approximately 90 billion zlotys [Z]. Nor does the PZZ benefit from any credits in grain procurement. The debt attributed to this totals Z250 billion. The process of ownership transformation in the grain-milling industry was preceded by the breakup of the PZZ into smaller units. At this time, there are 105 state enterprises (including 18 limited-liability companies) and two State Treasury stock companies. A few enterprises were privatized, and four are in the process of bankruptcy. As ARR experts have determined, acceleration of the process of restructuring this sector is very difficult (a postinspection report from the Supreme Board of Inspection confirms that the situation in this industry is complicated by overall economic conditions as well as some internal neglect). It will have to wait (there is no great interest in this industry, either by foreign or domestic investors) for a comprehensive program of universal privatization. But general transformations in this industry will not proceed rapidly if comprehensive debt-reduction is not instituted. Regeneration of basic herds in animal husbandry is a long-term measure (since the last harvests a growth in the number of animals has been recorded). An increase in meat production cannot be expected until the beginning of 1995. This year, production will continue to fall. It is anticipated that, compared with 1993, there will be 17 percent less pork, 10 percent less beef (50 percent less compared with 1990), and almost no lamb or mutton for general consumption (the number of lambs is steadily shrinking--at this moment, there are approximately 800,000). In such a situation, obviously we can expect a growth in prices, an increase in import, and a decline in export.
