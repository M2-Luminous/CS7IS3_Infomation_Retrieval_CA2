The move came amid reports that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe has decided to break away from the LDP, launch a new party and vie to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Michihiko Kano, Masahiko Kitagawa, Goji Sakamoto, Takao Sato and Teruhiko Mashiko, members of a faction led by former Trade Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, submitted letters of resignation to the LDP leadership, party officials said. Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Koji Kakizawa, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo Sato also plan to quit the party, the party sources said. Earlier in the day LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news conference the LDP should maintain unity over the choice of its candidate for the premiership. "In any event, the best way for our party to return to power is to pull together and remain united," Mori said. Mori said he will closely monitor a meeting between LDP President Yohei Kono and Watanabe on Friday afternoon. Kono is expected to ask Watanabe not to run for the premiership in order to avoid a major split of the LDP. Kano told reporters his group will form a new party aimed at bringing about a realignment of political parties. Kano's group is expected to team up with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key party in the coalition. Ota and four others are members of a suprafaction policy study group called "liberals," which has urged Watanabe to run for the premiership.
