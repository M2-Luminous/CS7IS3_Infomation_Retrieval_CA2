The definitive formula with a solid sample and methodology will come into force at the end of the year. Here are the results of the four first months test-exercises: White Paper Between the 3rd and 13th January 1994 -- monthly monitor 1 -- 18 percent of Europeans say they have heard or read something on the white paper. In April -- monthly monitor 4 -- 25 percent had become aware of something on the subject. On EC average, the level of expected positive effects of the white paper fell a little between January (47 percent) and April (42 percent). Enlargement In March 1994, the vast majority support membership of Sweden (83 percent), Austria, and Norway (82 percent), Switzerland (81 percent) and Finland (80 percent). In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- "after the next accession to the European Commission (European Union) of countries such as Austria, Finland, Norway or Sweden," 64 percent of Europeans favour membership of Hungary, 61 percent membership of Poland, 59 percent membership of the Czech Republic and 57 percent membership of Slovakia. The Conflict in Ex-Yugoslavia Between the 1st and the 8th of February 1994 -- monthly monitor 2 -- four out of five European citizens (82 percent) opposed "letting things as they go now" in the conflict between the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia. Of the possible measures proposed to the respondents, that of using "fight when necessary to get humanitarian convoys through" received the highest support: 75 percent (90 percent in France). Followed by, though not closely: - Launch air strikes: 37 percent for; 55 percent against (53 percent of French favour this but only 9 percent of Greeks and 6 percent of Portuguese). - Lift the arms embargo against Bosnia: 33 percent for; 54 percent against. - Withdraw all troops: 31 percent for; 62 percent against (71 percent of Greeks are in favour). - Lift the embargo against Serbia: 28 percent for; 58 percent against (67 percent of Greeks are in favour). - Break off negotiations with all sides: 23 percent for; 69 percent against. European Elections In April 1994 -- monthly monitor 4 -- one in two (50 percent) European citizens confessed that in casting their vote to elect members of the European Parliament, their opinion about national issues will be more important. Forty-two percent said that European problems will be more important for them at the time of their vote. Satisfaction With Democracy and Support for the European Union In April 1994, 48 percent of Europeans said they were "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with the way democracy works in their country. Support for the European Union among those who think membership is a good thing has not really changed between January (56 percent) and April (58 percent) 1994. The situation among those who think membership is a bad thing is almost identical: 14 percent in january, 13 percent in April. Following a slight decrease from February to March in those who think that "all things considered, their country has benefitted from membership of the EU" (- 3), the level remained stable between March and April (49 percent).
