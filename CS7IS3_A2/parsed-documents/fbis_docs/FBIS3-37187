Esteemed Professor, you have expressed concern about the relations between the big neighbor and Lithuania at today's news conference. [Landsbergis] It is evident, and what is evident is not open to question--that Russia's official policy toward its neighbors, including the Baltic states, is hostile. This is expressed by threats, pressure, by constant demands and reproaches, and even by accusations. The Baltic states cannot feel secure at a time when such official military and foreign policy doctrines as those recently proclaimed by Russia claim that Russia allegedly has the right to interfere into our affairs using force. In general, the whole policy concerning the encirclement of Russia has been fabricated, which is labelled "the near abroad". This would mean the surrounding world (?according to) the Russian politicians is divided into two categories. Some foreign countries appear to be just normal, regular, foreign sovereign countries, and others are especially subject to influence and even domination by Russia. This fact makes not only the Baltic states, but also the states of Central Europe, to look for support in the structures of European stability and security that have proved their worth. In response to this, Russia once again accuses these countries, including the Baltic states, of anti-Russian or anti-Russia policies. This is a specific aggravation of the political and psychological atmosphere that is coming from Moscow. Therefore, it is rather difficult to give an assessment of this entire unfolding process, including the growing pro-imperialist and aggressive forces in Russia. It is difficult to regard all this as an improvement of the situation in general. Of course, the former and current governments of Lithuania have been trying to maintain good relations with Russia; however, this cannot be said about the Russian side. Perhaps what Russia regards as good relations is not partnership based on equal rights but something else altogether. [Correspondent] As is known, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been stressing of late that a program has been prepared in Russia that will defend the interests of the ethnic Russians living outside the territory of Russia, i.e. in the near abroad. He also stressed the problem of anti-Semitism especially in the Baltic states. [passage omitted] Brazauskas said that the pressing problems raised at the Vienna summit were also topical to Lithuania. These problems were: Aggressive nationalism, a problem of racism, and Zionism. [Landsbergis] This is propaganda and diplomatic murk that is sometimes used in the campaign for international public opinion, and which has been known to us for several years already. We encountered it when attempts were made to harm Lithuania, and this was coming from Moscow. Quite often, Lithuania and other Baltic states were represented as anti-Semitic, nationalistic, anti- Russian, and what not. Of course, one of their objectives was to make influential financial circles in the West become hostile, which would then refuse to help or would refrain from cooperation with the Baltic states--in particular, with Lithuania. [passage omitted] It seems that this card is being used again, since Mr. Kozyrev is accusing anyone and whoever he likes of anti-Semitism. No doubt, at the same time, he fails to mention Russia, where very strong anti-Semitic organizations and groups are active that create an atmosphere of threat or even terror against Jews. [passage omitted] The fact that the mention of Zionism as a topical problem in Lithuania occurred in the annual report of President Brazauskas is completely incomprehensible to me. This is such an old card of the Brezhnev era, which was used to pacify perhaps the Arab partners. However, to claim that this is a topical issue in Lithuania today is simply nonsense.
