Our correspondent Milan Sutalo reports on the talks: [Sutalo] I feel that all the sides who are involved in this tragic conflict are now ready to make gigantic steps toward the cessation of hostilities and that they are ready to pay the price to restore a permanent peace. This conviction was expressed by Yasushi Akashi at the beginning of talks with his hosts, representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Recalling the agreement that was signed in Zagreb by Generals Roso and Delic envisaging a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, interposition of UNPROFOR, and the organization of a mixed commission that will be chaired by UNPROFOR, Akashi said that UNPROFOR was ready to enter this process, but it was necessary for all involved parties to cooperate. We also need additional forces, Akashi said. I think we will get support from the United Nations and its member countries, but only when they are sure that the interested parties are ready to make steps toward peace. Akashi recalled the importance of the talks that are currently being held in Washington and New York, but also said that efforts toward peace were necessary to be made at the local level. After we have alleviated the suffering of Sarajevo, Mostar should be the next town where the suffering of population ought to be alleviated. Therefore, I would like to hear what the Croat side is ready to do in Mostar for the restoration of peace. From what we could hear at the beginning of the talks, which were open to public, we can fathom what the purpose of Akashi's visit to Mostar is. After that, the talks were held behind closed doors. Here is what Yasushi Akashi and Ivan Bender said following the talks: [Begin Akashi recording, in English with superimposed translation] I have had very useful and productive talks here with Croat leaders in Mostar and I have received assurances of their full commitment to peace, I have heard their concerns that this peace might be too fragile. That is all the more reason, in my opinion, that we should join forces to make this peace more durable. We have to start with specific concrete steps toward a comprehensive peace. We will not be contented with peace in Sarajevo, which is important [break in transmission lasting for 1 minute 10 seconds]. [end recording] [Begin Bender recording] We discussed the restoration of peace in Sarajevo. We do not demand the application of that kind of peace to Mostar alone: We demand that the same be done with Mostar, Banja Luka, and Tuzla. We will persevere in that. [end recording] [Sutalo] Asked by a journalist, Yasushi Akashi commented on the NATO downing of the Serb aircraft. [Begin Akashi recording] This was a NATO action in compliance with the Security Council resolution concerning the no-fly zone. I spoke with NATO Southern Command this morning which assured me that they had followed the established procedures. UNPROFOR was not involved in this action. I also called Mr. Karadzic who was in Belgrade. He assured me that it was important for us not to over-dramatize these kind of incidents. And we will continue to make efforts to restore peace, the process of which started in February, and we will try to extend it to other places and areas.
