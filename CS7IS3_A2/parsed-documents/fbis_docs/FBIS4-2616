In addition, a 220-member delegation for talks on Sino-U.S. trade and investments is ready and waiting and will be attending two large-scale activities, a seminar on investment and trade and successive talks in Los Angeles and New York, in mid- April. These will be largest-scale activities in investment and trade China will have sponsored in the United States since China's reform and opening up in the 15 years since Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations were established. This shows China's aspirations and sincerity in expanding opening up, strengthening Sino-U.S. relations in trade and economic cooperation, and welcoming U.S. businessmen to make investments in China. On the eve of her departure for the United States, Jiao Sufeng, foreign investment administration director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, agreed to a special interview with this reporter. Jiao Sufeng disclosed that the current activities in investment and trade include trade talks and inviting investments, with 927 projects in that category. The members of the delegation are from nine of China's central ministries and commissions, 26 provinces and municipalities, and a dozen or so trade companies. Viewing the investment projects and the members of the delegation, we find three major characteristics, namely: --The focus is on infrastructure projects. There are 175 projects involving energy resources, transportation, and telecommunications, with a capacity for absorbing $5 billion to $6 billion of foreign funds. From this we can see that China's absorption of foreign funds will gradually change from leaning toward regions to leaning toward industry. --A high proportion of the projects are of the capital- and technology-intensive type. There are 338 projects concerning raw materials, electronic machinery, the petrochemical industry, the light and textile industries, and the metallurgical industry. Beyond a doubt, they are very attractive to large U.S. transnational companies. --Central and western provinces are taking an active part. Out of the 26 provinces and cities represented on the United States visit, 16 are provinces, cities and autonomous regions in China's hinterland, namely Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Jilin, Shanxi, Xian, and Wuhan. This is related to the structure of the projects, while demonstrating the momentum of China's opening up in all directions. The current visit to the United States will once again show the world that China, this largest developing country, has a huge market filled with temptation. China's bountiful resources, industrial foundation and technological force of an initial range, and cheap labor match very well U.S. abundant funds and advanced technology. The key to developing Sino-U.S. relations should be augmenting trade and economic cooperation characterized by mutual interests and benefits. U.S. investments in China grew steadily between 1979 and 1993. By the end of last year, China had already approved 12,000 projects involving U.S. investments. The negotiated sum was $10.6 billion, with an actual investment of $5.2 billion, next only to Hong Kong. In 1993 in particular, U.S. businessmen invested in some 6,700 projects in China, with a negotiated sum of $6.8 billion, of which some $2 billion was already invested. All the signs are that although some troubles and contradictions often surface in Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, U.S. political and entrepreneurial circles continue to show strong interest and great confidence in China. That is evidenced by the fact that since the beginning of this year, U.S. Government officials, nongovernment delegations, large companies and financial groups have come to China one after another. In view of this, the current large-scope activities in trade and economic relations are aimed chiefly at establishing extensive ties with U.S. figures from economic and entrepreneurial circles, briefing them on China's policy of reform and opening up and conditions in economic development, and providing them with opportunities for investment and trade. Jiao Sufen indicated that strengthening ties and deepening understanding is more important than signing some contracts. A relevant figure stressed that China welcomes U.S. investments, and the United States needs the Chinese market. Harmony between the two sides spells mutual benefits; and confrontation means crippling both. The best policy is to seek common ground while reserving differences, and seek cooperation.
