In a more explicit manner (PSM) and a more discreet one (PRM), the two members of the majority coalition let it be understood that they are ready to question their further backing of the current government in Parliament. Despite the fact that the two statements are issued by different persons, they are quite similar. In fact, the similarity is so striking, that it becomes obvious that we are dealing here with a concerted action of the two parties, or better said of the two outstanding Ceausescu apologists in the respective political groupings: [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu for the PSM and [PRM President] Corneliu Vadim Tudor for the PRM. Both texts are dominated by a lyrical style. In this respect, they are not so much official statements, as elegies. At least PRM's letter, through its size and sighs, is reminiscent of Alecu Russo's "Song to Romania." As far as both PSM and PRM are concerned, the two statements are a good opportunity for a little demagoguery. In the case of PSM, it is slightly more temperate. It is quite likely that the text written by Adrian Paunescu was retouched by the pragmatic politician Tudor Mohora [PSM vice president]. However, PSM's letter reaches some unheard of peaks of electoral demagoguery. The party leadership does not limit itself to stating that it is freezing the negotiations with the PDSR; it also feels the need to present, under signature, a picture of the current Romanian society that smacks of the kind of proletarian cultism that even Ana Pauker and Iosif Chisinevschi [post-World War II Stalinist leaders of Romania] would have been ashamed of. The letter talks about old people scavenging through garbage cans for food, while the rich are dancing and partying at will. It is obvious that the initiator and author of the letter forgets that the paupers he weeps for include the peasants of Butimanu village, whose land was taken away from them by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Likewise, Corneliu Vadim Tudor ignores the fact that he himself is one of the newly rich, who are spending their time moving from one binge to another. If it could talk, the rooms of "Select" restaurant [patronized by PRM officials] would have a lot to say in this respect. The two statements also have the same goal in common. Both the PSM and PRM criticize the PDSR and President Ion Iliescu because the latter do not take steps against certain people who are considered as deadly enemies of the two parties. From the PSM letter we learn that an agreement has been reached with the PSM to replace [Defense Minister] General Niculae Spiroiu. If we take into account a previous article by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, from which we learn that Adrian Paunescu has asked the minister of national defense not to draft his son for military service, we immediately realize why a whole party is trying so hard to overthrow Niculae Spiroiu. The minister of national defense has pissed off Adrian Paunescu because he did not agree to do the PSM vice president this service. Something that Adrian Paunescu was not prepared to tolerate, particularly since the minister of defense during Ceausescu's reign had acceded to his request not to draft him in the army. Mind you, this happened at a time when even Nicu Ceausescu was forced to do his military service. In its turn, PRM is very mad at Ion Iliescu because he did not immediately order the arrest of Niculae Spiroiu, Petre Roman [president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front], Traian Basescu [former minister of transport and deputy of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)], and Traian Chebeleu [Ion Iliescu's spokesman]. Not because the latter were guilty of something, but because they dared to contradict Corneliu Vadim Tudor. We are obviously dealing here with an ordinary attempt to blackmail Ion Iliescu. As I said, Adrian Paunescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor are behind the two statements. Two profiteers of the Ceausescu regime, who in the previous system have become accustomed to having all their absurd whims satisfied, including the wishes to topple various public people only because they had at one point had the temerity to stand up to them. The two statements are a new proof of the huge proportions to which certain Ceausescu apologists were blown up in these trouble times.
