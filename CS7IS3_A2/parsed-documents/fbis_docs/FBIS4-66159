The authors are affiliated with the State Council Development Center's Market Circulation Research Department.] [Text] Since 1993, in the wake of the sharp and rapid increase in investment and consumption demands and the accelerated pace of change in the market pricing mechanism, and accompanying the nation's high rate of economic growth, market prices have also increased fairly rapidly. Since June, in the wake of the implementation of various macro regulation and control policies, the grave inflationary situation has eased somewhat, and regulation and control have slowly produced results. But overall, the market price situation is still very grim; the task of stabilizing prices is very arduous. Therefore, diligently analyzing the 1993 price situation, correctly assessing the 1994 price trend, and formulating appropriate policy proposals are essential to ensure the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national economy in 1994. I. Facts About the Price Increases in 1993 The facts and characteristics of price increases in the market in 1993 are as follows: 1. Nationwide, retail prices skyrocketed month after month. Since March, the magnitude of price increases has been in the double-digits, reaching a peak of 15.1 percent in August compared to a year before. Price increase slowed somewhat in September compared to August. From January to September, prices rose 12.1 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. The rate of increase for each month was 8.4 percent, 8.7 percent, 10.2 percent, 10.9 percent, 12.5 percent, 13.9 percent, 14.9 percent, 15.1 percent, and 14.5 percent respectively. 2. The market prices for food, clothing and necessities, and industrial consumer goods and services were generally higher. Between January and September, prices for each category rose 18.1 percent, 13.6 percent, and 39.3 percent respectively, compared to the same period a year earlier. All three categories are everyday necessities, the demands for which are fairly inelastic. Pushed by these prices, the nation's cost of living index climbed 14.5 percent in the January-September period compared to the same period a year earlier, and in 35 large and medium-sized cities, the index rose 18.9 percent, and in the highest month (September,) it actually topped 23.3 percent, which was the highest rate in recent years. 3. The momentum of market price increase in the rural areas was especially strong. Between January and September, the rural retail price index rose 11.8 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, approaching the urban area's 12.6 percent rate of increase. 4. Pulled by the demand for fixed asset investments, the price of producer goods soared. Prices skyrocketed in the first half of the year, rising by 38.2 percent in the first quarter. Beginning in the third quarter, macro regulation and control began to show results, and the excess demand for producer goods eased and prices did not increase as much compared to the previous two quarters. But prices were still high, and compared to the same period a year earlier, the purchase prices of raw materials, fuel, and energy were 40.6 percent higher. The factory-exit price of steel rose 83.1 percent, cement price increased 52.7 percent, and raw coal price rose 27.4 percent--compared to the second quarter of 1993, the rates of increase have declined 3.3, 2, and 29 percentage points, respectively. Based on the above analysis, it is clear that because of the high rate of increase in investments and the high cumulative rate of increase in credit loans in 1992, total social demand surged and prices soared in the first half of 1993. In the second half of the year, even though macro regulation and control clearly played a role in stabilizing the financial situation, improving financial order, and curbing the increases in the prices of producer goods and exchange prices, overall, the basic factors that caused prices to rise have not dissipated. Statistics showed that inflationary pressure was still strong, or even stronger, in the second half of the year. It is estimated that for the year 1993, the retail price index for society as a whole was around 12.5 percent; the cost of living index might reach 16 or 17 percent, and in the 35 large and medium-sized cities, the cost of living index could be around 20 percent. II. Analysis of the Causes of 1993's Price Increases 1. The surge in fixed asset investments: Investments have sustained a high rate of increase since 1992; society's fixed asset investment has increased 37.6 percent. From January to September of 1993, the state-owned units completed a total of 401.5 billion yuan in investments, 66.4 percent more than in the same period a year earlier. Specifically, investments in capital construction increased 62.4 percent. In the first half of the year, in particular, credit loans went out of control, and the investment scope exploded, increasing by 69.3 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. In the second half of the year, with the implementation of various regulation and control measures, although the increase slowed somewhat, it was still significant. Excess investment demands necessarily push up the prices of producer goods, and higher costs cause consumer product prices to soar. 2. The increased force of price reform gave impetus to a general rise in the price level: Since 1993, the force of price reform has clearly increased. At the heels of decontrols in 1991 and 1992, the state-monopolized prices of grain and oil were decontrolled; the prices of steel materials, coal, crude oil, cement, and other basic raw materials were either decontrolled or significantly readjusted; the prices of housing, gas, water, electricity, and other utilities were raised, and the localities generally revised their service-oriented fees in 1993. These price reform measures no doubt raised the price level in society as a whole. 3. The price increases in 1992 left a "rooster tail" effect: Price reform made fairly big strides in 1992, and for the year, 40 billion yuan's worth of direct price adjustments were made. Because most of the price adjustments in 1992 were introduced after April, they had a significant "rooster tail" effect on prices in the first half of 1993. According to a relevant department, the price adjustments in 1992 were responsible for approximately 4 percentage points of the price increases in the first half of 1993. 4. Prices were affected by the drop in exchange prices: The expanded investment scope increased the demand for imported producer goods and caused an increase in demand for foreign exchange, and adding the speculative activities, RMB's regulation price plummeted, driving the prices of imports up, which in turn drove up the prices of electronics and light industrial products. III. Forecast of 1994's Market Price Trends There is nothing we can do about 1993's high prices, and 1994 market price situation still appears grim, and the main reasons are: 1. The expanded investment impulses linger: Judging by conditions in the second half of 1993, although the macro regulation and control measures have produced initial results and the magnitude of increase in the scope of fixed asset investments has diminished somewhat, it is estimated that society's total scope of fixed asset investment for the year still exceeded the previous year's by more than 46 percent, surpassing the planned scope by 350 billion yuan. Both in terms of investment value and investment scope, last year's increases were the most significant since the 1980's. In terms of the money supply, from 1 January to 17 November 1993, net currency input topped 101.892 billion yuan, 24.374 billion yuan more than in the same period a year earlier. This kind of large-scale investment and increase in the money supply will have significant effects on market supply and demand and product prices in 1994. In addition, the guiding principle for the economy in 1994 is accelerated growth, and the localities and enterprises are full of investment impulses. If the money supply and credit loans are eased once again, market prices may continue to soar. 2. The fairly high rate of increase in income will further drive up prices: From January to September 1993, the citizens' income sustained a high rate of increase. In the cities and towns, the residents' per capita monthly earned income rose 29.4 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, and discounting the price factor, the actual increase was 12.7 percent. The peasants' income also increased. Judging from past experiences, consumer prices are a function of income, and so long as the people's income continue to rise, it will necessarily lead to higher consumer prices. In particular, because of their inelastic demand, the prices of food stuff, everyday industrial goods, and various kinds of services will increase. 3. Prices may be more erratic after decontrol: Currently, the prices of more than 85 percent of the producer goods and more than 90 percent of the consumer goods and materials are completely decontrolled. Decontrolled prices are very much affected by changes in supply and demand in the market and are more difficult to control at the macro level. When there is excess demand, the price level will rise rapidly. 4. Because of strong demand in the domestic markets in 1994, foreign imports will continue to exceed exports, and the price of foreign exchange may rebound, leading to a rise in import prices as well as the overall price level. 5. Price reform measures introduced in 1993 will continue to have a "rooster tail" effect on 1994's product prices, and in addition, some new price regulation items will be introduced in 1994, and they will have even greater effects on 1994's market prices. 6. The steady rise in 1993's price level has produced an effect on the people's consumption psychology (for example, in some localities, there were rushes to buy gold and other goods to hedge against inflation.) If prices remain high in 1994, it will exacerbate the people's expectations about inflation, and if not properly guided, it can lead to panic buying and in turn push prices even higher. Because of the above factors, 1994's market price situation will remain very grim, and if not properly controlled, we may not be able to keep the retail price level at single-digit. This will have an adverse effect on reform and development. IV. Policy Suggestions on Curbing Inflation and Stabilizing Prices 1. We must make keeping prices relatively stable an important macroeconomic policy goal. Years of experience and lessons showed that only if the price level is rising relatively slowly can we attain a rapid rate of economic growth. This is because, first, at a high rate of inflation, because the rate of return on investments in industrial enterprises is relatively low and most funds tend to flow toward stock speculations and real estate investments and other nonproductive sectors where the rates of return are high, we tend to have a "bubble economy." It will cause the investment structure and the industrial structure to deteriorate and damage the basis of rapid economic growth. Second, with a high rate of inflation, the national economy is tightly stretched, making it difficult to implement some of the measures to promote reform and development, and this will make reform more difficult and more risky, which will hamper the establishment of the socialist market economy. Furthermore, when the rate of inflation runs high, lawless speculators will take the opportunity to disrupt market order, which will make the marketization process much more difficult. In addition, a high rate of inflation will have a ruinous psychological effect and stir great dissatisfaction among the masses. Thus, whether from the point of maintaining social stability, further deepening the reform, or making a smooth transition toward the market economic system, we must control the inflation rate. Only in this way can we truly guarantee sustained, speedy, and healthy economic development. 2. We must apply proper force on macro regulation and control. In the wake of the implementation of various macro regulation and control measures in the second half of 1993, the overheated economy which plagued 1992 and the first part of 1993 has cooled; the excess market demand has eased, and the increase in the price of producer goods has slowed, and these are indications that macro regulation and control are producing initial results. But at the same time, market sales have been flat, more industrial enterprises have been losing money, and not all of the state's key construction projects are fully funded. These and other problems make it even more important to gauge the proper force of macro regulation and control. It is our opinion that under the circumstances, we must not "decontrol at once" and blindly ease macro regulation and control. Some regulatory and control measures should continue to be implemented. But at the same time, we must exert proper force to avoid the negative effects of severe economic fluctuations caused by applying too much force. In particular, the price increases in 1993 were the result of many factors that have built up since 1992, over a fairly long period of time, and it will take some time to lower the inflation rate. We must avoid "stepping hard on the brakes." With this understanding, we suggest that the price monitoring goal for 1994 should be to keep the increase in the overall retail price level at around 10 percent. 3. We should implement a fairly tight monetary policy. From January to 17 November 1993, net money input already topped 101.892 billion yuan, and it is estimated that by year-end, it would reach approximately 150 billion yuan, which is a significant scope. Considering that there is usually a 10-month-to-one-year time lag before the effects of excess money input on product prices begin to show up, 1993's money supply will have definite effects on raising product prices in 1994. Therefore we should continue to implement a fairly tight monetary policy in 1994 to keep the money supply within a proper scope. In particular, we should maintain a positive interest rate level. This will have a very critical effect on stabilizing the financial situation, on the people's expectations, on curbing the bloated demands, and on absorbing investment funds. 4. In 1994, when regulating and controlling the extraordinary increase in fixed asset investments at the macro level, we should put the emphasis on readjusting the investment structure. Investments in the state's key projects and production-oriented projects that should be guaranteed must be guaranteed; nonproductive-type investments should be kept down. We must give full play to the functions of differential interest rates, investment direction taxes, and other economic levers and strengthen the regulation of privately-funded fixed asset investments. 5. We should enhance the state's ability to regulate and control market prices at the macro level. This includes: one, setting up and perfecting a price regulation fund system for key commodities at the central and local levels to promote production, enliven circulation, and curb price increases; two, setting up a special reserve system for everyday necessities to regulate supply and demand and stabilize the market; three, perfecting the market economy's price monitoring system. Currently, prices of the absolute majority of consumer goods and materials and producer goods and materials have already been decontrolled. We need comprehensive economic, legal, and administrative means to strengthen the management and monitoring of the decontrolled prices. On the one hand, we should monitor and check those prices more closely and be resolute in cracking down on price gouging and exorbitant profits. On the other hand, we should strengthen the industrial departments' direct management of various product prices and set up and improve various policies and laws and regulations to encourage competition and curtail monopolies. In addition, it is also very important to provide stronger planned guidance and rely more on effective market exchange formats to reduce the recklessness in production management and price fluctuations and give play to the price regulation roles of various trade associations. 6. Coordinating with the restructuring of the tax system in 1994, we should work harder on collecting and administering personal income tax and inheritance tax to avoid the draining of state revenues, to regulate the citizens' income, and ease the pressure on price increases.
