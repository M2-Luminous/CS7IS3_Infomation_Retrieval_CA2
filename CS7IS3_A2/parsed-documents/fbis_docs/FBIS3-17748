Meshkov"] [Text] President of the Crimean Republic Yuriy Meshkov has issued an edict to have all the conscripts of the spring call-up do their military service in the Crimea only. The acting prime minister of the Crimea, Anatoliy Franchuk, and Military Commissioner Oleksandr Volkov were authorized to implement the edict. In this connection, Volkov told our correspondent that he had received the edict in the evening of 23 March. Just like Ukraine's Defense Minister Radetskyy, with whom O. Volkov discussed the subject, he considers the edict absolutely unlawful. "We will act in conformity with Ukraine's legislation," stressed Volkov. "As before, 80 percent of the conscripts will serve outside the Crimea and 20 percent (those found unfit for health reasons and the Crimean Tatars) will serve in the Crimea."
