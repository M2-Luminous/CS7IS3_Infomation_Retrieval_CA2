The reason is the march into parliament of media clown and agitator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of a group that bears the misleading name of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. Otto Latsis, the cautious, and probably for that reason alone already highly influential, 60-year-old commentator of the Russian newspaper IZVESTIYA is extremely concerned about Zhirinovskiy's surprising election victory. However, it is not the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon itself that frightens him, but the reactions to it, which he considers exaggerated. NATO, which has experienced a serious identity crisis since the disappearance of its enemy, the Soviet Union, is being given an unexpected stimulus to survive by Russia. New members, the countries of Central Europe and the Balkan states, want a place under the alliance's umbrella. In the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, the so-called Zhirinovskiy factor is providing ready ammunition for bringing the defense cuts under fire. In short, the reincarnation of the Red Peril of communism as a poisonous black, fascist threat is being taken extremely seriously. Latsis has always been a party journalist. However, as a qualified economist, he opted for reforms right from the start and also became a strong opponent of Stalinism. He left the party in 1990. "The danger in overestimating Zhirinovskiy lies in setting off a chain reaction. I dread to think that NATO might welcome neighboring countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic republics into the club. The militants here would then immediately cry: `You see, the West is still our rival.' That would not only prove fatal to reaching further arms reduction agreements, but would also kill off Yeltsin's reform policy." That nearly 24 percent of the vote went to the man who intends to drop atomic bombs on Germany if necessary, propagates the idea of a Greater Russia, and commands considerable support within the Army, may well give cause for something more than raised eyebrows in the West. According to Latsis, "I would be the last person to say that there is no reason to remain alert; the question is how to do so. And above all, based on what assessment?" Wrong Track According to Latsis, anyone comparing the present situation in Russia with the situation in Germany during the 1930's, who regards Zhirinovskiy as a new Hitler, is entirely on the wrong track. Zhirinovskiy has managed to get this far not only because his democratic opponents not only underestimated him, but also because of the population's dissatisfaction with the economic chaos and impoverishment, and its dented national pride in a country that was once so powerful but is now in decline. According to Latsis, the votes for Zhirinovskiy are absolutely no proof whatsoever that fascism and extreme nationalism are rampant in Russia. "Under such circumstances, I would even go so far as to say that the Russian population is less nationalistic than the U.S. population. However, there is more. According to my estimates, a maximum of 8 percent of the electorate could be considered hard core militant Zhirinovskiy supporters. The rest voted for the LDPR as a protest." Zhirinovskiy gained his victory entirely from the national party list for the National Duma, the new parliament. His victory was a direct consequence of his personal charisma: He has humor on his side, and is someone who "dares to speak the truth to the motley crew in the Kremlin." However, in the regional lists, which determined over half of the seats in the Duma, Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR did not make a breakthrough there. "The regional candidates were familiar to the people and were judged far more on the content of their platform. That [fact] alone proves that the electorate did not vote `for fascism,'" says Latsis. "The protest was also reflected in the 48 percent [of the population] who did not go to the polls. I believe that half of these people are totally indifferent, while the other half would vote for democratic candidates under better circumstances. Why? If they had wanted to make their protest known, they would have gone to the polls to support Zhirinovskiy. That did not happen," Latsis continued. He sees both the leader of the LDPR and the forces supporting him (Latsis claims that both Zhirinovskiy and his party are an invention of reactionaries from the former KGB and the Army -- GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN correspondent's note) losing ground when things actually have to be done in the parliament. Latsis predicts that in 1996 Zhirinovskiy will play a major role in the presidential elections, but that he certainly will not win. "You cannot play the clown for two years. He will now have to make grotesque promises. We must also wait and see which kind of people his party attracts, and how much support he will receive in daily political practice," he says. Remedy According to Latsis, the only remedy against Zhirinovskiy is to throw overboard any idea of shock therapy. Reforms are necessary, but they must be well-considered and cautious. A second correction must entail the recognition of the dissatisfaction with the fate of the 25 million Russians who have been living outside Russia for generations. According to Latsis: "The democrats have simply given this issue to Zhirinovskiy. I am glad that in his New Year's address, Yeltsin announced that he would respond sharply to discrimination--or even worse--against Russians living outside Russia. A man like Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have done that much earlier, exerting diplomatic pressure on countries that are attempting to force their ethnic Russian citizens into a second-class position, like the Baltics. That policy should also have been presented better to the people. In that way, Zhirinovskiy would have been deprived of an important weapon." The situation will only become dangerous if the democrats continue to refuse to draw the right conclusions from the election result. The West must merely now show its willingness to help Russia in its reconstruction, and realize that the economy of this gigantic country cannot make a 180-degree turnaround from one day to the next, Latsis argued. As for NATO, Latsis advised Yeltsin to first allow some time for guiding Russia inside a joint alliance. Subsequently, the membership of neighboring countries will no longer pose a problem. The opposite is impossible, Latsis warned, because in that case the democrats--and not only they--can probably forget all about it.
