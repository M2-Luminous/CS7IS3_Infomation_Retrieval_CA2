The masses of 25 nationalities live and work in peace and contentment. In 1993, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee made the decision to develop productive forces by leaps and bounds in nationality, border, and mountainous areas. The new body of the provincial government also regarded economic development in support of impoverished areas as the immediate goal, focusing on tackling bottleneck issues in the most impoverished, remote, and backward areas. The Deqen Zang Autonomous Prefecture was slow in economic development. Related departments of the provincial government allowed it a flexible policy to increase input into its infrastructure building, focusing on helping the prefecture decide and implement the program of doing away with poverty by the year 2000 and the development of township and town enterprises. In 1993, Yunnan allotted some 62 million yuan to support the development of some 300 projects in nationality areas. The provincial government has already planned to invest some 10 billion yuan in nationality areas in the 1990's to build a number of backbone projects in transportation, energy resources, and mineral production. Presently, construction of a number of large and medium-sized projects including the Deqen Paper Box Factory, Nawan Power Station, Zhongdian's Jinshajiang irrigation project, Dahaoshan Power Station, and Gaotong Airport are underway or completed. Work in supporting the impoverished in nationality areas has spread from being conducted in separate units to extensive development and regional efforts. The smooth implementation of economic construction has promoted the social stability of border nationality areas.
