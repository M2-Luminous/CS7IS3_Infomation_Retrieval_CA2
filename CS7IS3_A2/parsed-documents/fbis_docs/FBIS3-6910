The group, however, continues to refuse and ignore the offers. Moreover, it has also accused First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of causing the failure of talks in the past. Now the group is nearing an irreversible point where it will inevitably face a danger, since the Khmer Royal Armed Forces have pledged to preserve the unity of the country. The Khmer Rouge should correct their mistakes and proceed along the right path by being content with national reconciliation. With promised aid worth nearly $1,800 million, it would be wise for the Khmer Rouge to join the national community to serve the country and rebuild it toward glory. It is certain that difficulties still remain. However, if the former warring parties, such as the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party, the Cambodian People's Party, and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, can forget past differences and unite for the interests of the nation and people, the Khmer Rouge should follow their fine model and join them. This will certainly allow all of them to live in prosperity.
