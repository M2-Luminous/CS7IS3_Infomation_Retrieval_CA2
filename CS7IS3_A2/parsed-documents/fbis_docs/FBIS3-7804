The HZDS is counting on its coalition partner, the Slovak National Party, in order to form an election bloc, and is also considering as its partners the Christian Social Union, the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, and the Party of the Greens in Slovakia. Preliminary talks have already been held with these parties. We asked the representatives of potential partners of the ruling movement about the conditions under which they would be willing to accept an offer for coalition cooperation. Speaking on behalf of the Christian Social Union [KSU] is Deputy Chairman Viliam Oberhauser: [Begin Oberhauser recording] In a period when further fragmentation of political forces is taking place, the KSU is looking for possibilities to bring these forces together because it is precisely this solution that Slovakia needs in the present period. [passage omitted] We have been engaged in talks with other partners--the Slovak National Party and the HZDS. We are open to everyone willing to form an association on national and Christian principles and on the principle of solving the social problems of the Slovak people. [passage omitted] [end recording] The resolution adopted by the delegates to the Second Congress of the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, which took place in Martin on 26 February, spoke of the party's willingness to cooperate with the HZDS. Miroslav Makson, the party's deputy chairman, outlines his party's position on this issue. [Begin Makson recording] We are and we wish to be a political party of the center. From this viewpoint, the HZDS is objectively the most suitable political partner. I think that, apart from this fact, it is precisely the HZDS that has the same--and on some points even identical--agrarian program as the Farmers' Party of Slovakia. On the basis of this fact, the delegates to the congress arrived at the conclusion that the HZDS is the most suitable political partner for us. The delegates themselves confirmed, as it were, that the HZDS would do more for the farmers than they have managed to do so far if the current political situation were more stabilized. [passage omitted] Just the attitude of the prime minister and HZDS Chairman Meciar toward farming provides a certain political guarantee that farming will gradually be developed. [passage omitted] [end recording] Our colleague Peter Turcik telephoned Jozef Pokorny, chairman of the Party of the Greens in Slovakia, and asked him under what conditions the party would be willing to enter into a coalition with the HZDS. [Begin recording] [Pokorny] [passage omitted] Our condition for a possible entry into a coalition or an election bloc--and by this I do not mean just the HZDS, but also other partners that have already approached us--is respect for environmental protection, a positive attitude toward environmental legislation, and the preservation of the state administration governing the environment, which has been under discussion for more than two years. [passage omitted] [Turcik] Are you ready to enter into this coalition provided the HZDS offer is actually finalized? [Pokorny] I do not link this intention to only one movement--in other words, the HZDS. We have received this offer from the HZDS, but it is up to the party's membership to decide on this issue. In no case do the Greens want to be swallowed--and I can guarantee that this is not going to happen--by another powerful party that talks about the environment only before the elections and forgets all about it after it has joined the parliament. We saw this happen in the past. [passage omitted] [end recording]
