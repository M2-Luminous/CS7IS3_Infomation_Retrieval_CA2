What is your opinion of the present situation in Kashmir? [Zafar-ul Haq] Briefly, I would say that Kashmir is a living example of India's atrocities, Pakistan's mistaken policies, the unprecedented brave struggle of the Kashmiri people, the helplessness of the Islamic world, and the biased policies of the international community. There are 27 places in the world where human rights are being seriously violated. The deplorable fact is that 23 of these 27 places are populated by Muslims. Kashmir is the most prominent place among them. The present movement has resulted from Indian atrocities. India has gone to extremes in committing atrocities during the last four years. But it failed to crush the freedom struggle. I believe that since the partition of the subcontinent, the campaign in Kashmir has never been so widespread or powerful as is now. India has changed governors here three times during this period, and every new governor has claimed that he would crush the movement in little time. Krishnarao said in an INDIA TODAY interview, "If I get three or four more months, I will break the backs of those who want independence." India is continuously increasing its military forces, but the more the number of Indian troops increases--and it increases along with atrocities--the stronger the independence movement becomes. Thousands of people have become the prey of bullets. Those in jail are being killed and tortured. Houses, shops, and villages are being burned. There has been a rapid increase in the incidence of rapes. The movement is still going on, and perhaps it will be impossible for India to crush it. [Siddiqui] What can you say about the success of this movement? [Zafar-ul Haq] I have no good expectations from India's treachery and stubbornness. It does not support resolving the Kashmir issue peacefully, by sitting around a table or by holding a plebiscite according to the UN resolution. We have learned over the centuries that when a community decides to break the shackles of slavery and is willing to make any sacrifice to do so, then no power can keep that community enslaved with military force and weapons. The sooner India understands this, the better. [Siddiqui] Has there been any change in international attitudes? [Zafar-ul Haq] As I mentioned earlier, Kashmir has gotten the world's attention by making sacrifices. Now CNN, the BBC, the Voice of America, and the Voice of Germany are airing news stories about human rights violations there. Last year (1993), the UN secretary general mentioned the situation in Kashmir in his annual report after a long time. The U.S. President also declared Kashmir a disputed area for the first time in his speech to the General Assembly. The countries that adopted a neutral stand have started to talk openly about the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people. But I would still say that the world's conscience has not bothered enough to put pressure on India and to force it to accept the promises made at the international level. In this context, Pakistan has an important responsibility. [Siddiqui] Has Pakistan met its responsibility? [Zafar-ul Haq] Unfortunately, I must say that the attitude of the present government on Kashmir does not reflect the desires of the people. This government is fixated on keeping India happy. The people of Kashmir have made great sacrifices and have worked tirelessly to present their case to the world. They have been successful in this effort. The concrete result of their efforts should have emerged, in the UN resolution in which the attention of the Security Council was brought to the Indian atrocities. This resolution had recommended that the Security Council visit occupied Kashmir and investigate the human rights violations there. The passing of this resolution would have been a major diplomatic defeat for India, and its true face would have been unmasked to the whole world. During that period, there was also strong pressure on India from within, and after a long time, India found itself in a very troublesome situation. It had neither time nor any alternatives. It was coming to face the Security Council forum after many years. This was the time when Kashmiri Governor Krishnarao said he would "crush this movement" if he got three or four more months. India showed great skill in trapping Pakistan by initiating those meaningless talks. This was the failure of our foreign policy. [Siddiqui] Do you think that there should be no talks? [Zafar-ul Haq] In this era, anyone who refuses to hold talks loses the sympathy of the international community. There should be talks; however, the resolution about Kashmir should not have been withdrawn. If India refused to hold talks because of this resolution, then it would have been condemned. Now the Indian press is jumping with joy at the fact that because of these talks, India got new and unexpected relief, and our government, because of the people's pressure, is raising the slogan that we have not lost anything. We could have re-introduced the resolution any time we wanted. The next session of the General Assembly is scheduled for September 1994. How can we introduce the resolution again before that time? [passage omitted on foreign policy] [Siddiqui] In your opinion, what kind of policy should we adopt on Kashmir? [Zafar-ul Haq] Look! The first thing is, our stand should be clear and firm. We must have full faith in our stand. It is a simple fact that after the division of the subcontinent, the people of Kashmir, according to the agreed-upon formula, should have had the right to decide whether to join India or Pakistan by holding a referendum. The UN resolution has used the word "plebiscite." Later, the people added the right of self-determination on their own. The plebiscite should be held on the question of whether Kashmiris want to join Pakistan or India. The states of undivided India were presented with the same question. Confusing this with some other definition aims only at opening other options for Kashmir. Pakistan should know that there is no third option for Kashmir. In fact, there is no second option. There is only one option: the right to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir. At the same time, our government should present this case on the international level and provide the Kashmiris with more opportunities. This is not a question of India or Pakistan, but a question of the rights of 12 million Kashmiris. It is a human issue. Our present leadership puts forth nonsensical statements that confuse this issue even further. Recently, President Farooq Leghari said that Kashmir is the only hindrance to good relations between India and Pakistan. Some other politicians also have said the same. Kashmir is no hindrance to our good relations. The hindrance is caused by India and India only, which has an imperialist mentality and is very stubborn. It has spoiled relations with all its neighbors and is crazy about ruling others. Similarly, Benazir Bhutto said, "The way we swallowed the bitter pill of East Pakistan, India should be ready to swallow the bitter pill of Kashmir." This statement is contradictory to the facts, and it weakens our case. Comparing Kashmir with East Pakistan is unrealistic and unwise. East Pakistan was part of Pakistan. It was never a disputed region. In contrast, Kashmir has been a disputed area from day one. The prime minister's statement means that she considers Kashmir part of India, the same way East Pakistan was part of Pakistan. After sitting in the prime minister's chair, making such foolish statements will lead to being ridiculed by the world. Kashmir is not a bitter or sweet pill for anyone, but a solid problem that is in need of a solution. [Siddiqui] India still declares Kashmir to be an integral part of the nation. [Zafar-ul Haq] This is nothing new. The imperialists always think in this way. They always call areas under their control integral parts. But with time, everything fell asunder. At one time, this subcontinent was also an integral part of Great Britain. America declared its independence when it was influenced by the French Revolution, and Britain's Foreign Ministry issued a statement asking all countries not to interfere. "This is an internal affair," they said. "America is an integral part." When the movement for independence was going on in Algeria, France also sang the same song. History tells us that wherever the lamps of freedom are lighted, this will be the first reaction of the imperialists. The Kashmir issue is totally different, though. India's claim is totally unfounded. The day is not far when Kashmir will be freed from Indian clutches. If India does not compromise on its "part," then all other parts of its body will be dispersed everywhere. [passage omitted on Bosnia] [Siddiqui] You are the secretary general of Motmar Aalim Islami. Please throw some light on the services of this group. [Zafar-ul Haq] The basic work of Motmar is to present the problems of the Islamic world properly and to get the people's support. We are paying special attention to preparing literature in this context. We published literature based on facts about Kashmir and the Babri Masjid crisis and distributed them during the foreign ministers' Islamic conference. Later, we sent this to diplomats all over the world. Last year, at the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Motmar sent a deputation of Kashmiri women, which unmasked the Indian atrocities there. In June 1993, Motmar sent a group, in which I also participated, to the Human Rights Conference in Vienna. We sent Ilama Iqbal's poetry, in Persian with a Russian translation, to the central Asian countries. We also publish a weekly magazine which carries facts and news about the Muslim world. It is circulated in about 70 countries. Last year we sent medicines valued at 83,000 rupees [Rs] to Bosnia, and we have established a fund for Bosnian children. We donated Rs500,000 to this fund. Now we are sending Rs800,000 in aid to the Bosnian people through UNICEF. The Motmar is also giving scholarships to 32 students, who are receiving educations in different countries. We have published books and pamphlets about problems in the Islamic world. [passage omitted on Afghanistan, Somalia] *
