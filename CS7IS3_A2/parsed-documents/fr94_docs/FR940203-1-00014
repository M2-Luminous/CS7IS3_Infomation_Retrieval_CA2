FR940203-1-00014 FR940203-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;183&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary; reporting any findings of discrepancies; replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and verifying that the airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. This action would increase the area to be inspected, delete the reporting requirement, and expand the applicability. This proposal is prompted by reports of fuselage skin cracking in certain areas and findings of additional countersunk fasteners. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage. DATES: Comments must be received by March 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;183&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven C.

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;183&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;183&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On December 19, 1989, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990), applicable to Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 765, inclusive, to require: 1. Repetitively inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary; 2. Reporting any findings of discrepancies; 3. Replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and 4. Verifying that airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. That action was prompted by reports of cracking in the lap joint of stringer 34 near the interface with the wing-to-body fairing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent in-flight depressurization due to undetected cracks in the skin of the airplane.
