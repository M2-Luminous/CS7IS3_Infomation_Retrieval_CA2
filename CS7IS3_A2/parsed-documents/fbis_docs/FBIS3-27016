The question which needs to be studied now is what monetary policy should be adopted under such an economic structure in order to further develop the productive forces. I. The Socialist Market Economy Still Needs a Stable Monetary Policy Under the socialist market economic structure, we must continue to implement a stable monetary policy because, only in this way, will the national economy be able to maintain the following desirable elements: 1. The coordinated, sustained, and rapid development of production. Under the socialist market economy, the operation of the economy and the deployment of resources as a whole will basically be regulated by market forces instead of mainly through planning as was the case in the past. Regulation by market forces must be realized through the money medium. Thus, only by maintaining a stable money market will production be able to develop in a coordinated, sustained, and rapid manner. On the other hand, according to our experience in the 40 years and more since the founding of the People's Republic, and especially in the more than 10 years since reform and opening up, inflation upsets the existing economic structure, disrupts the production order, and results in abnormal economic development. Let us take the situation after the beginning of reform and opening up as an example. An important cause of inflation during this period was the fact that investment in capital construction increased by too great an amount too swiftly. Blind investments produced and intensified the economic imbalance. When this state of affairs became so serious that capital construction funds were not forthcoming and there was a serious shortage of capital goods, readjustment became necessary. For example, in order to halt inflation in 1988, a policy of rectification and readjustment was introduced in the fourth quarter. The result of this was that by early 1990, industrial production was sluggish and the market was slow. There was serious stockpiling of finished products and arrears in payments. The economic performance of enterprises had declined and economic development had suffered. Is it possible, in times of inflation, for the original production pattern to be affected not or for production order to not be disrupted? No, it is not possible. Fundamentally, the effect of inflation is to change the patterns of production and resource distribution. If it does not change the pattern of production and resource distribution, inflation becomes a phenomenon of no real significance. With all other conditions remaining the same, if money supply is doubled and divided equally among the various economic sectors, units, and individuals in accordance with the original pattern of distribution, then the money supply increase will neither bring any benefit nor harm. Although prices will double, the fact that the money in people's hands has also doubled means everything will be the same. It will just be that the current two yuan note will be worth the same as a one yuan note in the past. This was what happened in 1954 when new one yuan notes were issued as replacements when the old 10,000 yuan notes were withdrawn. In reality, however, additional money supply cannot be divided so equally. Quite the contrary because, due to a combination of reasons both subjective and objective, some people end up having more money and others less after inflation; some enterprises are able to grab large quantities of commodities in short supply, while others have difficulty satisfying their normal needs. There is thus bound to be a blind redistribution of funds and materials in society. The original production pattern will be upset and economic development will suffer. This is true under a planned economic structure and also in the process of economic structural reform. Under the socialist market economic structure when microeconomic activities are no longer subject to the restraints of central planning and the guidance of administrative units at the higher levels, and are basically dependent on market forces, this is even more true. 2. Making full use of the material resources of society. The fundamental factor determining the speed of our economic development is goods and materials. Since we already have an abundance of labor supply, we will be able to develop at a high speed provided that we have sufficient goods and materials. If we have a shortage of goods and materials, development will slow down. This basic condition will not change under the socialist market economy. During inflationary times, people will anticipate that prices will further escalate, and goods and materials will be in short supply, and thus they will strive to stock up more, especially those goods in great demand. Subsequently, some enterprises will have stocks that exceed their normal needs. The resultant stockpiling will render it impossible to bring into full play the limited material resources of society and this will further aggravate shortages and production and construction will be subject to even greater material resource restrictions. When inflation occurs, people prefer goods to money. This mentality also has an impact on the consumer goods market. With people buying more consumer goods than they need, the limited supply of consumer goods cannot be reasonably distributed, with the result that the actual needs of the majority cannot be met. 3. Raising more funds for construction. Under the socialist market economy, economic development will accelerate and more construction funds will be needed. Personal bank deposits and the purchase of various types of bonds will continue to be an important source of funds for economic development. In the primary distribution of national income, due to various constraints, it is not possible to retain too great an amount of the funds for construction. On this basis, in order to further increase construction funds and accelerate development, it is necessary to increase bank savings deposits and rationally issue bonds so as to turn more consumption funds into production funds. Absorbing people's savings deposits and selling them bonds is a means of financing which only requires people to temporarily assign the use rights of their money without changing the ownership and payment is offered for the concession. This method of raising funds for construction can truly increase the volume of construction funds, without changing the balance between total supply and total demand, since all that it requires is to use those material resources set aside for consumption on production instead. It can also increase people's incomes or provide them with safeguards against inflation so that they can relax and really devote their energy to work. However, people will only show a positive response to deposit-taking and bond issues if the currency is stable. If inflation occurs, prices go up, money depreciates, and interest rates fall below the degree of devaluation and people will not only fail to get any real interest by putting their money in savings deposit accounts or buying bonds but will also not be able to even maintain the value of their principal. In times like these, bank savings deposit balances and the amount of bonds purchased will not increase and may even drop as a result. This is precisely what has happened in the past. In 1988 China was hit by inflation. In the first seven months of that year, the increase in the balance of urban and rural savings deposits was 4 billion yuan less than in the same period of the previous year. In August, the balance was 2.6 billion yuan less than the July figure, and the annual figure was tens of billions of yuan less. In the first half of 1993, inflationary pressure increased and national retail prices were up by 10.5 percent. Between January and the end of June, urban and rural savings only increased by 124.4 billion yuan, 9 billion yuan less than in the same period the previous year. Sales of state bonds were slow. Although the state could increase its note-issue funds by issuing more bank notes, inflation would reduce bank savings deposits and funds obtained from bond issues. Thus, for the country as a whole, the issuing of more bank notes will not in fact increase the pool of funds, while the reduction in savings deposits and bond sales means that material resources that could have been used in economic construction will be spent on consumption and this implies a real cut in funds. Hence, inflation definitely leads to a reduction in funds for national construction. It must be pointed out that when we spoke of savings and bonds in the previous paragraph, we did not touch on the question of the purchase of shares by individuals. This is because, unlike savings deposits, the purchase of shares is an act of direct investment. The value of shares changes with the financial and profit-making capabilities of the shareholding companies and automatically serves as a guarantee for value in times of inflation. However, as inflation escalates, shareholding companies will not be able to conduct normal production and operations. Profits from production and operations will drop and dividends will fall as a result. This will also dampen people's enthusiasm for share purchases. 4. Giving full scope to the enthusiasm of the broad numbers of workers for labor. Under the socialist market economy, it is necessary to keep workers' wages at a reasonable level when turning production factors into commodities. This is also dependent on the stability of currency value and prices. When currency value and prices are stable, the broad numbers of workers will not have to worry about the devaluation of their income and it will be possible to fully arouse their enthusiasm for labor. If inflation and price rises occur, workers will find their real income diverging from their nominal income and some will even find their real income slashed. Even if the state continues to provide price subsidies, it will be impossible to make up for the losses incurred by individual staff and workers because losses due to devaluation are shared by people's monetary income, savings deposits, and cash in hand and cannot be entirely offset by increased subsidies. Ours is a socialist country where the masses of the people are masters of the country. Workers and other people will understand and accept the need to rationally control the growth of consumption funds in order to more rapidly develop the economy. However, they will have objections if inflation occurs and part of the value already in their hands is taken away. In a socialist market economy, people's income will generally increase and the extent of income growth will exceed that of price rises. Does this mean they are willing to accept inflation? Under the circumstances, they will naturally be less resentful of inflation, but it will be impossible for them to have no objections at all. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, people's income has generally gone up swiftly and the increase far exceeds the average extent of devaluation. During the inflation of 1988, some people complained about various things although their living standards were in fact much better than before. If inflation has too great an impact on workers' income, so much so that many workers are finding their real income slashed, social stability and unity will also be adversely affected. II. The Socialist Market Economy Has the Objective Possibility of a Stable Currency The reason for this is that most of the factors of inflation can be eliminated after the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. As we all know, inflation has occurred a number of times since China's reform and opening. We had inflation in 1985 and 1988. Inflationary pressure was also strong in 1993. In most cases, inflation was the direct result of over-extended investment in fixed assets, excessive growth of consumption funds and huge financial deficits. On a deeper level, it was because, in the current process of reform, the original mechanisms which restrained inflation had been weakened but new mechanisms of restraint suited to the socialist market economic structure had not been established. Also, the macrocontrol mechanism was in a situation where the old had been dismantled while a new one had not yet been put in place. After entry into the socialist market economy, internal mechanisms of restraint against inflation will be developed and there will be objective conditions for a stable currency. 1. Investment entities will have a self-restraint mechanism in respect of their investment in fixed assets. Prior to reform and opening up, all investments in fixed assets were controlled by the state through mandatory plans and funds were basically allocated by the state's financial administration. Although this system was not conducive to arousing the enthusiasm of different localities, departments, and enterprises and needed to be reformed, it was a very effective system of control. As long as suitable arrangements were made by the state in respect of investment in fixed assets, the scale of investment would never become over-extended. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, investment entities have become more diversified and the scope covered by state investment plans has been narrowed. Although this has had the effect of arousing the enthusiasm of all quarters for economic development and invigorating the economy, it has also weakened the state's control of the overall scale of investment in fixed assets. Since the Chinese economy is still rather backward, everyone hopes to speed up economic development and put this backwardness behind us as quickly as possible. This, coupled with the lack of clearly-defined responsibility for decisions made in respect of investment in fixed assets, caused leaders of some localities and departments and the directors and managers of some enterprises to overlook the importance of feasibility studies and to go after quick results. They blindly increased investment in fixed assets and launched new projects, such as embarking on 10 billion yuan projects when they only had 8 billion yuan. As a result, the overall scale of investment in fixed assets has always been over-extended in recent years, especially in years of inflation. Even if we do do not concern ourselves with questions such as whether or not there are any circulating funds and whether or not production can be well coordinated after the completion of the projects, when all funds are invested in fixed assets, the bank will have to issue more bank notes and this will lead to inflation. Assuming that the ratio of circulating funds to fixed capital is 3:7 for most enterprises, and assuming that a locality has 100 billion yuan available for economic development in a particular year, theoretically speaking, they should set aside 70 billion yuan for investment in fixed assets and 30 billion yuan for circulating funds. If all of the 100 billion yuan is invested in fixed assets and circulating funds amounting to 43 billion yuan are needed for various support programs after the completion of the project, it will mean that they have made plans for 143 billion yuan when they only had 100 billion yuan. This is an important reason why we have had an imbalance in construction funds and have been hit by inflation time and again in recent years. Following the establishment of a socialist market economy, the overwhelming majority of state-owned enterprises will become limited shareholding companies or limited liability companies and property relations will be straightened out. Collective enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign joint ventures will have a considerable weighting in the national economy. Investment in fixed assets in society will mainly be undertaken by different types of enterprises and returns on investment will be closely tied to the personal interests of the enterprise decisionmakers. The enterprise decisionmakers will exercise great prudence in matters of investment. They will carefully consider and study the feasibility of investment, the product sales after the completion of the projects, as well as the size of returns and generally will not act blindly. In this way, the problem of the over-extension of investment in fixed assets can basically be avoided. 2. Enterprises will also exercise self restraint in respect of their consumption funds. Prior to reform and opening up, China had a unified wage system, where wage grades and levels were centrally fixed by the state. Without arrangements and planning by the state, no locality or unit had the power to change the wage levels of its workers. At that time, bonuses and other expenditures in respect of workers were scant and were fixed by the state. Provided that appropriate arrangements were made by the state, consumption funds would not inflate. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the original mechanism of restraint on consumption funds has basically lost its effect. Since a new mechanism of restraint has not yet been fully developed, control over consumption funds has been weakened. This makes it possible for desires cherished by workers for higher wage and bonus levels to assert themselves. At present, state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in the economy. The operational mechanism of the majority of these enterprises has yet to see a significant change. Directors and managers not only have the same fundamental interests as their staff and workers but also enjoy basically the same direct economic benefits. This was the ideological foundation which enabled directors and managers to unify all staff and workers and work with one heart and one mind in making their respective enterprises a success. This was the strong point enjoyed by state-owned enterprises. However, the fact that directors and managers enjoy the same economic benefits as their staff and workers also deprived enterprises of the ability to control their own consumption funds. Staff and workers hoped to have higher wages and more bonuses. Out of personal interest, directors and managers also wanted the same. Moreover, there has been an increase in the number of shareholding enterprises, private enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises since reform and opening up and the wage levels in these enterprises are much higher than those in state-owned enterprises. In the wake of the invigoration of the economy, some people made a fortune after quitting their jobs for business. This set an example for others and strengthened the desires of state-owned enterprises and institutions, state organs, organizations, and military units to raise the wage levels of their employees. This in turn encouraged these units to raise the wage levels, bonuses, and other fringe benefits for their staff and workers without authorization, thereby causing the consumption funds to inflate. Following the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, not only will the interests of the decisionmakers in collective enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign joint ventures be tied to the profits or losses of their respective enterprises but the income of the decisionmakers in limited shareholding companies, limited liability companies, and state-owned enterprises will also be tied to the performance of their respective enterprises. This will separate the interests of the enterprise decisionmakers from those of the staff and workers. If an enterprise has a high wage level, its costs will increase and its profits decrease, meaning that its decisionmakers will earn less. Conversely, if the wage level is reduced, costs will decrease and profits will increase, meaning that its decisionmakers will earn more. If the income of the decisionmakers is too high and the wage level of workers is too low, the latter will find this intolerable. Similarly, the decisionmakers will also find an unduly high wage level for workers unacceptable. This will guard against a situation where consumption funds expand faster than economic growth. 3. The government function will undergo a change but the power of macrocontrol will still be in the hands of the central government. Prior to reform and opening up, economic operation was led and managed completely by the government. Since reform and opening up began, enterprises have been given increasingly greater autonomy. Although the function of the government in direct economic management has been weakened, local governments still bear considerable responsibility for the development of their local economies. Since local governments are elected by the local people, they all hope to provide more tangible benefits for their people. In particular, they hope to start more projects to bring about faster economic development. Of course, the local people will benefit from any new projects launched. However, since the renminbi is a national currency and the money market is unified, losses resulting from devaluation due to over-development in one place are borne by the whole nation. Thus, local governments often ignore the need to strike a balance between total supply and total demand, thinking that this is mainly the responsibility of the central government. Instead, they vie with one another to launch more projects and demand more construction funds. Even when total supply and total demand fail to balance, some still say that "other places have `overheated,' we have not even started `heating up.'" They still hope that none of their projects will be slashed and some even hope that they will be allowed to launch more projects. We can understand why they all want to speed up their own economic development. It provides the drive for national economic development and is a good thing. However, ignoring the need to strike a balance between total supply and total demand and putting too much emphasis on speeding up local economic development will adversely affect the sustained and stable development of the national economy. This is precisely what has happened. The successive rounds of inflation which have hit our country in recent years had a lot to do with the fact that local governments, oblivious to the need to strike a balance between total supply and total demand on a national level, blindly pooled funds, tried by all and every means to secure bank loans, and vied to speed up their local economies, with the result that money supply grew too fast. After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the government's economic function will mainly be to exercise macroeconomic control, create a fine environment for economic development, and properly manage state-owned assets. Meanwhile, the government will rely mainly on economic and legal means, supplemented by the necessary administrative means, to influence and manage the microeconomy. The functions and powers of the central and local governments in the management of the economy will be clearly divided. The power of macroeconomic control will be in the hands of the central authorities. The local governments will only be able to give positive support to, and will not be able to interfere with, the central government's macrocontrol measures. 4. An effective macroeconomic control mechanism will be established. In order to ensure the smooth development of the national economy, it is necessary to establish a macroeconomic control mechanism that can ensure effective control of the macroeconomy while invigorating the microeconomy. This means that we must rely mainly on economic measures in effecting regulation and control. However, in the process of economic structural reform, because of the low percentage of business-oriented enterprises in the overall economy, the use of economic measures to effect regulation and control is still not able to achieve the desired results. For example, the central bank tried to keep a lid on loans by raising interest rates but this failed to get major state-owned banks and enterprises to reduce their demands for credit funds. The reason is that these state-owned banks and enterprises did not attach the necessary importance to cost and profits and would pay any amount of interest to get more funds. By raising the deposit reserve rate, the central bank had weakened the ability of major state-owned banks to generate more deposits and expand loans. However, if they faced a shortage of credit funds as a result and could not accomplish the prescribed lending tasks, particularly policy-lending tasks, the central bank would have to increase its loans to them to make up for their shortage of funds. Thus, for the time being we can only rely on administrative measures, that is, management by quota, to control total credit and money supply. However, since economic activities as a whole have been invigorated and the concept of planning has been weakened, administrative measures are no longer as effective as before. Many localities have successfully bypassed the quota restraints in obtaining more state credit funds. According to estimates by the departments concerned, between 1992 and the first half of 1993, apart from the more than 100 billion yuan obtained through inter-bank borrowing and bank credit as mentioned above, an additional 100 billion yuan and more had been pooled through blind fundraising. Although funds thus raised were directly borrowed by enterprises or local governments from the masses, most of the money still came from bank deposits or deposit sources (that is, money which people intended to deposit into their bank accounts). The issuing of shares and bonds by enterprises is an important measure for transforming the operational mechanism of enterprises and, as such, should be supported and promoted. However, if overall arrangements are not properly carried out and banks are not suitably relieved of some of their lending tasks after enterprises have sucked up credit funds through issuing shares and bonds, bloated credit and inflation will occur. After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the People's Bank of China, as the central bank, will free itself of various types of business activities and will take the strengthening of macroeconomic control and the safeguarding of the value of the renminbi as its most important tasks. Policy-lending banks have now been established. They will take over the general banking activities currently handled by the central bank, as well as the policy-related banking business which is currently handled by major state-owned banks and which must be placed under the direct management and control of the government. Various major state-owned banks have already been turned into commercial banks. Meanwhile, a number of national joint-stock banks have been established. In this way, there is keen competition between financial institutions in the urban and rural areas and in areas such as foreign exchange. The money market has been further liberalized and standardized and interest rates have also been liberalized in a controlled way. Moreover, a modern enterprise system has been established and the concepts of profit and interests have been strengthened in the whole society. An effective mechanism of macroeconomic control will soon take shape, after which it will be possible to keep currency value and prices basically stable. III. Strengthen Control and Stabilize Currency Value In the first half of this year, retail prices on a national level were up by 10.5 percent, while savings deposits by urban and rural residents between January and late June increased by only 124.4 billion yuan, or 9 billion yuan less than in the same period of last year. Faced with a new round of inflation, we must conscientiously sum up historical experiences, unify our understanding, and firmly uphold the idea of a stable currency. 1. It is necessary to further eliminate the influence of the "theory that inflation is harmless." In the 1980's, some economists preached the "theory that inflation is harmless," which is otherwise referred to as the idea that "inflation is useful." Through the government's monetary policy, this theory became one of the causes of inflation. However, as many economists pointed out, the results precipitated by this theory, in turn, ruthlessly refuted the theory itself. A. People who uphold the "theory that inflation is harmless" believe that inflation had the effect of "compulsory saving," thereby increasing state construction funds. This is superficial reasoning which shows a mechanical copying of Western economic theories without a thorough study of China's national conditions. Inflation produces little "compulsory saving" in our country and, compared with the reduction in normal savings deposits, the loss far outweighs the gain. In our country, a large part of the nominal monetary funds obtained through issuing more bank notes will inevitably be used to cover the increased expenditure resulting from this. There are the following general types of money holders in China. The first type is state-owned enterprises. Other conditions being constant, the value of the money in their possession lost as a result of currency depreciation normally has to be made good through financial appropriation or additional bank loans. If this is not done, they will have to reduce the scale of their production and operations. The second type is government organs and organizations, armed forces units, and institutions that are dependent on financial appropriations. When depreciation of their currency holdings exceeds a given percentage, it is necessary for the financial administration to increase appropriation to them in order to maintain their normal operations. The third type is residents. In capitalist countries, the value of money depreciated may be regarded as additional taxation on individuals by the state and has the effect of "compulsory saving" but in China it does not have the same effect. Reluctant to see the people's living standards drop as a result, our party and government will, when price levels go up, suitably increase price subsidies to make up for losses sustained by staff and workers. The fourth type is limited liability companies, joint-stock companies, private enterprises, individual operations, and foreign-invested enterprises. In joint-stock companies with state capital, when inflation occurs, the value of that part corresponding to the state's share and manifested as state funds will see a reduction in value. But even so, the state will not on this basis issue more bank notes to cover this loss, thereby increasing the value of its holding and bringing about compulsory savings. The private holding will also see a reduction in the value of private capital. In times of inflation, the money held by private enterprises, individual economies, and foreign-invested enterprises will all see depreciation. However, viewed from the organization of enterprises and the economy as a whole, the situation is as follows: First, their funds mainly take the form of raw and semiprocessed materials, fuel, goods in process, and manufactured goods. They only have a small amount of cash. Moreover, the stock of money held by most enterprises is far smaller than their bank loans. In times of inflation, when the value of money depreciates, the value of bank loans drops. With the rise in commodity prices, most enterprises will find that the value of their property has increased rather than decreased in the final settlement of accounts. Second, enterprises may pass on losses from devaluation of currency by raising the price of their products. Third, when inflation occurs and the real wages of staff and workers declines, it is possible to lower costs and increase profits by not giving staff and workers appropriate subsidies. In short, if we do not take into consideration the disruption of the production order and the losses inflicted upon production and operation and only concern ourselves with the value inventory, enterprises will not have to expend their "compulsory savings" and may obtain more wealth from society. B. Whether or not inflation is conducive to the utilization of "idle resources" is also worth studying. The utilization of "idle resources" is primarily a question of how we should make use of idle resources. China is a developing country. In our country, the principal contradiction of the commodity market, particularly the capital goods market, is that demand exceeds supply. When inflation occurs, some enterprises are afraid that they will not be able to buy the materials they need in time. In order to sustain production and operation, they scramble to stock up on goods and materials at the risk of losses in the form of credit interest and storage fees, thereby making the distribution of goods in short supply even more irrational and making it all the more difficult to make full use of these materials. Second, it is a question of utilizing idle labor. With the huge number of people unemployed in capitalist countries, there is a great waste of labor resources. If slow inflation can stimulate economic development, it can also increase the number of persons employed and utilize more of the idle labor. However, our country's labor employment rate is very high, the speed of economic development is very fast, and there is no need to further boost the employment rate through inflation. Further, as has been noted above, in our country inflation is not advantageous to the full utilization of goods and materials, it cannot accelerate the speed of economic development and, speaking in overall national terms, it cannot increase the number of persons employed. The people who uphold the "theory that inflation is harmless" say that by using inflation and issuing a little more money, a number of construction projects will very quickly be able to raise funds and "go ahead." This is true. By using this method it will be possible to complete a few more projects. However, the price we will have to pay is really too great. Actually, while the issuing of money can be carried out in a centralized way, the devaluation of currency is generally manifested only gradually. If the original money circulation is normal and there is a basic balance between overall supply and demand, the value of the currency will be stable. If a further 10 billion yuan in currency is issued, it will be possible to carry out some more projects. When this 10 billion yuan is put into the market and the purchase of materials needed for construction commences, it will be possible to buy the materials and the price will not rise too much. This is because: First, the tightness of materials and the decline in the value of the currency will occur only gradually after the purchasing has begun. Only after the entire amount of money has been used up in purchases will the effects be fully manifested. The purchasing occurs first and the tightness in materials and the decline in value appear subsequently. When the tightness in goods and materials, the currency devaluation, and the rise in prices caused by this are fully manifested, the newly-commenced projects have already obtained all the goods and materials they need. Second, the losses resulting from the tightness in goods and materials, the devaluation of currency, and the increase in prices caused by this 10 billion yuan are jointly borne by all sides throughout the country. For example, if this 10 billion yuan eventually gives rise to a 1 percent rise in prices, then all the money in the hands of every unit and every person throughout the country will have lost 1 percent of its value. Even during the process by which it is being used for purchases, when prices have already begun to rise, it will still buy over 9.9 billion yuan of goods and materials. From this we can clearly see that using the issuing of more money to fund new projects is actually a method of using the devaluing of money to take back some of the value represented by the funds already supplied to all sides. This results in some enterprises and construction units being unable to obtain the goods and materials they had planned on using. Thereby, some enterprises cannot complete their production plans and some construction projects cannot be completed on time. Very clearly, using the increased issuing of money to fund some more construction projects is done at the cost of some other enterprises being unable to complete their plans and the completion of some construction projects being delayed. Using the issuing of money to fund more new construction projects is, both from the overall and long-term viewpoints, truly not worthwhile. Second, in terms of monetary policies, we should negate the theory of dual goals and establish the single goal of stable currency. In our country's economic circles, some persons have advocated implementing a dual-goal monetary policy. That is, they advocate a stable currency value and stable prices together with support for economic development as concurrent economic policy goals. They hold that while formulating and adopting monetary policies, it is necessary to consider both the stability of the currency and also ensure that the policies are beneficial to economic development. The people who uphold this view say that while ensuring the stability of prices does provide a necessary condition for economic growth, it is only when there is economic development that there is a dependable base for price stability. Of course, we cannot use inflation to spur economic growth but, likewise, we cannot seek currency stability just for the sake of currency stability. A stable currency and the development of the economy should complement each other. If monetary policy could concurrently achieve these two goals, naturally, it would be ideal in the extreme. However, the experience of our country over many years indicates that the result of implementing dual goals is not beneficial to currency stability. Over the last 10 years and more, our country has seen repeated bouts of inflation. This was related to the dual-goal monetary policy we actually implemented. The governments of socialist countries are the organizers and managers of economic construction, the ones who require the funds for construction as well as the controllers of money-issuing powers. This is like a situation where when one hand needs money, the other hand produces it. It is thus very easy for excessive issuing of money to occur. In implementing a firm policy of currency stability, it may sometimes happen that there is excessive money supply. If we implement a dual-goal monetary policy, it will be easier for there to be excessive supply of money on the pretext of supporting economic development, thereby leading to inflation. On the basis of experience over many years, we must firmly negate the "theory that inflation is harmless" and the "theory of dual goals," and take stable currency as the only goal of the central bank's monetary policy. Only if the currency is stable will it be possible for the economy to see sustained and smooth development. A stable currency is a precondition for economic development. If the central bank can maintain a stable currency market for society, it will make the greatest contribution to economic development. As compared with increasing the supply of money to support more construction projects, the importance of maintaining a stable currency market is far greater. This is very obvious. The benefits of building projects in excess of objective conditions are immediate and limited while the harm this brings is overall and deep. The reason we do not agree with the dual-goal theory, instead stressing a stable currency as the sole goal of monetary policies, and urge the implementation of stable money policies is that a stable currency and stable prices as a goal is on a different level to economic development. A stable currency value and stable prices is a direct goal of monetary policies while developing the economy is also one of the major goals of a stable currency and stable prices. In other words, developing the economy is a goal of the monetary policy but an indirect and higher-level goal. Upholding a stable currency as the sole goal of monetary policy does not mean ignoring economic development but is aimed at putting in order the relationship between a stable currency and economic development to support faster and better economic development. If we make economic development one of the direct goals of monetary policy, the point of departure will be stressing economic development but actually this will reduce the important position of economic development. Developing the economy is the overall goal of various types of economic policies. Of course, this naturally includes monetary policies but it should not be the direct goal of monetary policies. At the same time, this causes a dispersal of the attention of monetary policies and concentration cannot be centralized on maintaining a stable currency. This is not beneficial to the stability of the currency or of prices and eventually will be disadvantageous to the development of the economy. Believing that monetary policies should have dual goals is, to a certain degree, putting economic development in opposition to currency stability and suggests that stable currency is not beneficial to economic development. However, we have noted above that only with a stable currency can the economy see smooth development. In brief, only by taking a stable currency as the sole goal of monetary policies can we implement firm and stable money policies. In a situation where paper money is circulating, only by implementing such a monetary policy will it be possible to truly stabilize money and develop the economy more swiftly. Third, strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to strive for the stability of currency and prices. In order to truly stabilize currency value and prices at present, it is necessary to fully understand the money market in a timely way and use various sorts of relevant economic measures flexibly to do well in macroeconomic regulation and control. The state should clearly set down that the central bank must take as its major tasks doing well macroeconomic regulation and control, and guaranteeing the stability of currency value and of prices, and require that it puts all of its efforts into this. At present, the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control must continue to be placed on controlling the money supply and, through this on, achieving a balance between total supply and total demand and the stability of currency and prices. What is referred to as the total volume of money supply is the amount of cash and transfer funds put into the market. This is formed through the utilization of funds by banks. Of the funds used by banks, 95 percent are credit funds and, thus, basically these are formed by bank credit. The funds activities by other sectors of the national economy can only affect the speed of turnover in the distribution of money in society. That is, they can transfer money from their sector to other sectors and they can accelerate or slow down the the speed of turnover of money but they cannot directly increase or reduce the supply of money. The financial administration's receipts and expenditure are also like this. In a situation where receipts and expenditure are balanced, the finances are obtained from society and used in society. They only increase the number of times money in society is turned over and carry out the redistribution of the volume of money in society. When surplus or deficits occur, although the amount of social money which the financial administration draws in from society may increase or decline, this is realized through increasing or decreasing the savings account which the financial administration has in the banks or through borrowing or overdrawing from the bank. In the end, it is still changes in bank credit influencing the total volume of money supply in society. Of course, this is not to say that the influence of the economic activities of nonbanking sectors on total social demand is negligible. On the contrary, the economic activities of these sectors are the basis which determines whether or not the flow of money is normal and whether or not the value of the currency is stable. That is to say, the banks are the source of the social money supply and, more precisely, the central bank. Thus, the central bank should now continue to carry out regulation and control of the total volume of credit in the whole society and use this to regulate and control the total volume of money supply in the whole society. As to regulation and control measures, of course we cannot continue to use management by quota. Rather, we should use mainly economic measures, such as central bank credit rates, deposit reserve rates, and open market business. Only by controlling the amount of credit and the volume of money supply in the whole society will it be possible to achieve a balance between total social supply and demand and will it be possible to achieve stability in currency value and in prices.
