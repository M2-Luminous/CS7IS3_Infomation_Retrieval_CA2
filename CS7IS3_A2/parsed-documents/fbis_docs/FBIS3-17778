"The talks focused on problems concerning the maintenance of a city in the steppe where the cosmodrome's workers live. We have solved this issue. I am confident that our children and grandchildren will use Baykonur in the 21st century in the interests of both Russia and Kazakhstan," Yeltsin was quoted as saying. For his part, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put a special emphasis on Russia's important role in the development of Kazakhstan's scientific, technological and cultural potential. No speculation about Kazakhstan's alleged cooling towards Russia have any grounds, he added. The two presidents signed four main documents out of 23 bilateral accords adopted as a result of the summit, including treaties on the further enhancement of economic cooperation and integration, on the strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed in Kazakhstan, on military cooperation and a memorandum on the basic principles for the resolution of issues related to the citizenship and the legal status of Russian and Kazakh citizens residing on the territory of the other state.
