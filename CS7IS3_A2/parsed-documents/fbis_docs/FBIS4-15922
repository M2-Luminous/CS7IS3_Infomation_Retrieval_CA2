On a visit in Moscow on 5-10 April Semyonov handed Yeltsin an estimate of the city's needs in supporting the infrastructure and social sphere of the Black Sea Fleet. According to the Sevastopol Statistical Agency, nearly 33,500 Black Sea Fleet officers and warrant officers resided in the city. The fleet supported 75,000 employees and their families. In effect, every fourth Sevastopol resident was directly dependent on the Black Sea Fleet. Semyonov believed that it was Russia's duty to contribute to the city's infrastructure and social sphere. According to Sevastopol economists, Russia must allot the city 1,072,912 Mn [million] karbovantsi, or about 52 Bn [billion] rubles. Semyonov said that talks with Yuriy Dubinin, Russia's chief negotiator on the Black Sea Fleet, convinced him that Russia stood by the protocol of the Massandra summit. Semyonov believed that a Ukrainian-Russian commission on evaluating the assets of the Black Sea Fleet should be composed of civilian defense industry engineers because personal rivalries between military officers of the two countries made this task impossible. Semyonov said that the Moscow City government would allocate Sevastopol 500 Mn rubles to finance the festivities marking the 50th anniversary of liberating the city from the Nazis.
