"In a sense, forcing a settlement on that aggrieved party (the Bosnian Muslims) requires a very strange moral calculus," said Mike McCurry, U.S. State Department spokesman. This was in response to Juppe's comments to the NEW YORK TIMES late Monday that if Washington did not exert pressure on the Muslims, it would be a catastrophe and the U.S. would be responsible. This latest exchange of recriminations marks a rising rift between Washington and Paris on ending the two-year-long ethnic fighting in the former Yugoslavia. During a recent visit to Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher brushed away suggestions for the imposition of a peace settlement in Bosnia, saying Washington was unwilling to commit the large number of troops required. Forcing peace on unwilling parties "just doesn't logically make much sense to the United States at this point," McCurry said. As the Balkan fighting drags on, the West is apparently losing patience, as France, Canada, and Britain threatening to pull out their troops stationed in Bosnia under the UN flag. There are no U.S. ground troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a situation often criticized by the nations with forces deployed there. On a related matter, McCurry said it was "very doubtful" that a meeting of UN Security Council foreign ministers, as suggested by Russia, would "have any greater success" than the European Union's recent failed efforts.
