The source said that it was not strange for the trumpets of this gang to continue the course of lies, misleading reports and deceptions with the objective of falsifying the realities at the battle fronts and concealing its defeats and its enormous human and material losses. The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic of Yemen recalled the obvious and scandalous contradictions in the statements issued by the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, head of the ruling gang in Sanaa, in his press conference held this morning when he pointed out that his forces had destroyed 80 percent of the weapons and machinery of our steadfast armed forces. At the same time, he admitted his inability to determine the outcome of the battle quickly because of what he called the existence of a huge military arsenal belonging to our forces. The responsible military source ridiculed the misleading information given by the ruler of Sanaa that three brigades in Shabwah had surrendered. The military source pointed out that had this claim been true then the forces of the ruling gang would have occupied Shabwah in its entirety where the brigades which the war general claimed had surrendered to him were based. He is seeking imaginary gains which have been difficult for him to achieve in the battlefields due to the steadfastness of our armed forces and the masses of the people which supported them and out of their conviction in the justice of their right to life. The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic of Yemen has reiterated that the misleading media reports of the dictator, the dictator of Sanaa, are tantamount to confused dreams and that the road to Aden is a very long and thorny one. It will be the graveyard of the new invaders before their delusions can touch proud Aden.
