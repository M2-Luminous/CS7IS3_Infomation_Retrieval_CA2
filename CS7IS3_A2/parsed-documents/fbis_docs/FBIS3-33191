Casas Regueiro heads a ministerial commission which includes the heads of the Construction and Water Resources Ministries, the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television, and the construction materials industry. Their visit, which concluded at noon today, included socioeconomic projects in Guantanamo and Caimaneras Municipalities and farming areas of San Antonio del Sur Municipality. Div. Gen. Senen Casas told reporters that the two months since the commission's last visit show significant progress in recovery efforts and demonstrate the extraordinary efforts of Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba construction workers despite supply shortages. Senen Casas, who is also the transportation minister, relayed kudos to the people of Guantanamo on behalf of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro; Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces; and the government for the progress they have achieved in such a short time; however, there is still much to be done. The ministerial commission oversaw the level of fulfillment of the recovery effort and the prioritized socioeconomic program undertaken following the Politburo committee's visit of April 1992.
