Conversation With Political Weekly's Chief Editor"] [Text] We have already reported that the political weekly GLASNOST has begun publishing once again after a gap of several months. At the request of readers, I met with Chief Editor Yuriy Izyumov and asked him a number of questions. [Kozhemyako] Yuriy Petrovich, not everyone is aware of what happened to your newspaper. Why were readers deprived of it for so long? [Izyumov] GLASNOST, along with PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and other opposition publications, was banned by order of the Russian Ministry of the Press and Information on that fateful 4 October last year. Moreover, that same day people burst into the editorial office armed with sections of steel pipe and other equipment. The place was ransacked. Then, on the instructions of the presidential administration, the journalists were robbed of the building that we had legally occupied since the day the newspaper was founded. I filed charges with the People's Court in Moscow's Sverdlovskiy Rayon protesting flagrant tyranny. The case has finally has been examined. The court found the Ministry of Press and Information order banning the weekly unlawful and overturned it. The newspaper is with us again! [Kozhemyako] How do you define your present stance in the multifaceted world of newspapers? What guides you in shaping your course? [Izyumov] We are still a communist newspaper. We have close links with the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU and will, as far as we are able, promote the restoration of the CPSU as a unified Communist Party and the USSR as a unified state. We are convinced that the USSR cannot be restored without the restoration of a unified Communist Party. The sooner all communists join forces, the faster such vital tasks for all the peoples as the cessation of fratricidal wars and the restoration of Soviet power will be accomplished. [Kozhemyako] How do you see the weekly taking shape as a unionwide newspaper? [Izyumov] No borders and customs houses can prevent us from writing about the life of working people and pressing problems throughout the territory of the Soviet Union. We are trying and will continue trying to provide articles from every republic in each edition and tell the truth about what is going on there. It is important to help people grasp the political hurly-burly around them. To this end we will talk about the nature of various parties, political associations, major firms, and banks. Whereas others paint some as angels and others as devils, we plan to publish objective portraits of the best-known figures from all the republics. [Kozhemyako] What can you say about your political opponents' attitude to the weekly? [Izyumov] Our motto is only to tell the truth about everything, whether anyone likes it or not. To our great regret virtually no one likes the truth. That is why we have so many enemies among our political opponents. Regrettably, we are experiencing some animosity from some of our comrades in arms. Their long CPSU membership has not taught them to respond correctly to criticism. [Kozhemyako] What difficulties is the editorial office experiencing? [Izyumov] There are certainly many difficulties. We are glad that despite all the ordeals, the material hardship, and the severe repressive pressure the editorial collective has survived and even grown stronger -- as a collective of like-minded people working not so much for their pay as for a noble idea. But our money problems are extremely acute. In addition, subscription has been wrecked and the distribution system disrupted. During the four-month ban the editorial office lost all its financial income and its bank account was seized. That is why GLASNOST asks communists and all the newspaper's friends to: -- collect donations to enable us to continue publishing the newspaper; -- organize circulation of GLASNOST via party organizations; -- promptly convey urgent information to the editorial office. Our mailing address is: GLASNOST Editorial Office, 14 New Square, Moscow 103132. Telephone: 231-47-18.
