He said in press statements today that all recent indications pointed to the fact that Yemen was on the brink of a dangerous situation. He said: We believe that the use of wisdom and intelligence and concern over Yemeni unity should prompt the Yemeni leaders to stop the fighting immediately. He noted that Syria was hoping the Arab countries would be able to resolve this problem, and urged the Yemeni brothers to preserve their unity. The Syrian foreign minister said that the issue of fighting in Yemen is a hot issue and that many speakers touched on that matter today during the sessions of the Non-Aligned Movement's ministerial conference. It might also be discussed later during the conference. He said that the brothers in Yemen, whether in the north or the south, want Syria, along with some other Arab brothers, to provide good offices. He pointed out that there is no Syrian initiative in this regard but Syria is working to stop the fraternal violence in Yemen. On the resumption of the Middle East peace talks, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track, al-Shar' said that before Secretary Christopher returns to the region and we hear the response of the Israeli side to the Syrian ideas, which stressed that the beginnings of a new and serious peace process on the Syrian track depends on full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines, a new and united stand should be reached regarding resumption of negotiations in Washington. Answering a question on the possibility of Syria accepting an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights over a period of three years, al-Shar' said: We will not talk about these details until after Israel agrees to the principle of full withdrawal. To a questiion regarding announcements by the Israeli prime minister that Syria is not committed to peace, al-Shar' said: I believe he is talking about Israel and not Syria. Everyone knows that Syria is fully involved in peace. We have been saying this for the past two years and we have affirmed that the absence of progress in the Washington peace process goes back to the Israeli stalling in the negotiations.
