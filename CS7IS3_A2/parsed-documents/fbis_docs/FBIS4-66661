These include two commissions headed by the prime minister, Dr. 'Atif Sidqi: The High Commission for Export Promotion and the Supreme Export Council. A third, headed by the economy minister, is the Export Promotion Commission. There are also numerous others, including the Central Council for Export Promotion, the Commission for Export Support, Export Oversight Authority, and the Export Development Bank. Dr. 'Atif Sidqi announced at a recent meeting with the Federation of Industries and Chambers of Commerce that he would soon create [another] high commission for export promotion, to be headed by him. How much longer will the government keep on forming commissions that convene and meet to no other end than the formation of still other commissions and organizations, thereby restarting the cycle anew without the adoption of effective measures? How much longer will government policies continue to be mere slogans and more commissions that exist on paper only and are removed from reality? Do we in fact have need for new commissions to promote Egyptian exports? What are the obstacles difficulties that prevent existing commissions from doing their job? How can we free Egyptian products from the bottleneck and ease their flow into foreign export markets in order to compete with international products? The strategy for economic relations with the outside world determines the course such relations must take in the years to come. As such, they are supremely important, have the most profound impact on the development of the national economy, and are inexorably tied to and have a correlation with domestic economic policies and with regional and international developments. A report issued by Specialized National Councils pointed out that the primary purpose of devising a strategy for economic relations with the outside world is to cultivate contacts that will lead us to define objectives for that strategy that would serve the public interest at the various stages of the national economy, ensuring that those objectives are in harmony with domestic economic policy objectives and with the capabilities of the national economy as well as with the world economic developments, especially international trade, capital movements, and the type and intensity of competition in world markets and the regional and international combinations that govern them. Once the objectives of the new strategy are defined, policies must be devised for their realization. A specialized report emphasized that, in the absence of a clear international economic strategy, the various economic policies being pursued will, in fact, result in a haphazard strategy lacking a logical method for defining objectives and policies establishsed to achieve them. Such a stragety will also not take into account the coordination of these objectives with other national economic goals as well as regional and world developments. This is the basis upon which the policies that will achieve those objectives will be selected. The report discusses the current status of our economic relations with the outside world and points out that the trade balance of commodity exports and imports has been consistently in deficit over the years. The trade deficit gap widened from 64.1 million pounds in 1952 to 162.4 million pounds in 1970 to 19,115.8 million in 1989/90, for a 300-percent growth. The trade deficit is worsening because commodity imports are growing at a faster rate than commodity exports; the ratio of exports to imports having declined from about 70 percent in 1952 to about 23 percent in 1989/90. The ratio of the trade balance deficit to GDP is also considerable. Raw cotton is no longer in first place among commodity exports. Whereas it accounted for 85 percent of total exports in 1952, now it is almost not exported and accounts for only 33 percent of aggregate exports in 1989/90. If we factor in Egypt's imports that year of short-staple cotton, it becomes clear that Egypt has become a net importer of cotton. The report went on to point out that the character of the balance of payments in previous years is but the end result of the strategies pursued in those years, whether deliberate and planned, as such, or simply the cumulative outcome of successive decisions and choices made over time. But those developments mandate a reevaluation of Egypt's strategy for its economic relations with the outside world in order to keep it in tandem with domestic and international developments and in order to optimally serve the interests of the Egyptian economy. The report urged that industrial and agricultural commodity exports and tourist revenues be increased at higher and accelerating rates--since these components inevitably carry the major burden of accomplishing the desired balance of payments. However, this in no way ignores or diminishes the importance of other balance of payments revenues. The report also advised that agencies with oversight over commodity exports should be scrutinized again in order to facilitate and abbreviate the procedures involved in dealing with them. Stricter standards should be enforced in order to improve the quality of exports to the level necessary for efficient competition in overseas markets. Government and quasi-government agencies concerned with foreign trade and its development should undertake detailed marketing studies of potential exports and of likely markets, and should publish those studies and make them available to all who are involved with exports in Egypt. The tax structure and the various fees applied to exports should also be reexamined. Export operations should be granted ample and wide-scale exemptions. The pricing system for agricultural exports should be abolished. Relations should be bolstered with economic blocks in Europe, Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. For our exports to those blocks, we should seek the same preferred nation treatment granted other categories of developing nations. Will the commission soon to be formed under Dr. 'Atif Sidqi keep those considerations in mind? Will it accomplish its targeted objectives in order to enable Egyptian exports to compete in world markets? Change of Policies Egyptian exports, including petroleum, have a total value of $4 billion. The value of petroleum exports is slightly more than $2 billion. Exports other than oil are valued at less than $2 billion, according to economic experts who point out that this ratio is minimal in comparison with many other countries. We are supposed to bring the volume of exports up to a reasonable level since our experts are currently at no more than 5 percent of GDP. We must bring this ratio up to at least 15 or 20 percent. This means that we must boost exports three-fold. This would require a lot of things, such as improving and raising performance levels in order to compete in world markets. We must begin by identifying that group of goods in which Egypt could have a comparative advantage and, consequently, with which Egypt can face world competition. We should also produce products suitable to the tastes of consumers abroad. The study of foreign markets, their needs, patterns of consumption, and specifications of popular goods is therefore of value for promoting future exports. We must wade through the arena of establishing export services companies whose preoccupation would be to study markets and their needs and define specifications for the products they want, thereby establishing a link between Egyptian producers and foreign importers. Experts likewise emphasize that we must change our mind-set, from merely exporting surplus to establishing firms for the sole purpose of exporting. We should also attempt to prepare ourselves for world market developments, and the liberalization of foreign trade, anticipated as a result of signing the Uruguay Round agreement. This requires effort on the part of Egyptian exporters in order to meet the challenge of penetrating world markets and protecting domestic industry by improving quality and features and offering products at reasonable prices. Pressures Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, formerly dean of the faculty of economics, points out that the Cabinet has instructed the economics minister to form a general committee to study the economic impact of the new GATT agreement and formulate future economic policies in order to take advantage of the agreement and avoid its negative impact. Such is a commendable action taken by all countries. However, that committee's report should avoid generalities and should draw a detailed future program. I believe that this is no more than tactics, since we have persistently taken a flawed approach to the export problem long before the current cabinet. To promote exports is to restructure the Egyptian economic structure. Resolving the problem of exports in Egypt, in the sense of relying on exports as an essential means requires changing the nature of the Egyptian economic system by focusing its policies, procedures, and administrative structure on reducing production costs, improving product quality, linking the Egyptian economy to the outside world with advanced information systems, and giving enlightened institutions charge of the new national undertaking, because this is a matter of "life and death." In dealing with the export problem in this fashion, the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has equal, if not less, responsibility for exports than the Ministry of New Urban Commnities. Building worker housing in new cities helps exports more than anything imaginable that the Ministry of the Economy can undertake at the present time. The Ministry of Industry could likewise do more for exports than the Ministry of the Economy by offering technical assistance to all industrial units in Egypt. The same goes for other ministries. Dr. Ahmad al-Ghandur, commenting on the story about creating a new export commission in the next few days, said that the only explanation for this is that the government is under pressure to transform the Egyptian economy into an export economy in order to break free of the current crushing crisis. Another explanation he cited was that all previous export promotion commissions and institutions have had very little output and that the prime minister has come to believe that the solution lies in changing the nature of the economic system in its entirety. The creation of the new commission is therefore dictated by political considerations. All we have to do is quicken the pace of our basic thrust to transform the economy into an export economy and simultaneously announce the failure of steps based on the philosophy rooted in creating one institution or making minor adjustments to another. People are well-aware that the institutions created for that purpose have failed to achieve their goals and that export promotion has been relegated to the media "headlines." Focusing on the actual performances of institutions such as the Export Oversight Authority, the Export High Commission, and the Export Development Bank, and others, we find great disparity between nomenclature and function. Exporters view the performance of Export Oversight as restraint of the export function that does not go beyond good intentions. The Misr Export Development Bank is no different in function or performance from any other commercial bank. The Bottleneck "We all must concur that we need to promote exports and that that is a major development for us if we are to emerge from the bottleneck and overcome our balance of payments and general budget deficits," thus began Dr. Hasan Ghallab, dean of the College of Commerce at 'Ayn Shams University. He explained that there is no disputing the need for a commission that would work to provide the elements needed for the promotion of exports; but that the multiplicity of commissions without well-defined responsibilities causes the emergence of conflicting procedures, except perhaps if the creation of the proposed commission means making its predecessors obsolete. The methodology of providing procedures conducive to export promotion is a function of market mechanisms and also a function of other societal factors and variables. The strategy, for instance, is to avoid exporting products that society needs, especially at prices lower than those of comparable imports. In other words, there is no harm in exporting a product that has a substitute of reasonable quality that can be imported at lower cost. Naturally, both products cannot be of identical quality if imports are lower in price. Furthermore, there are certain products that distinguish the Egyptian market, for example long-staple cotton. There is no reason at this time why we should not import short-staple cotton, since it is cheaper, while encouraging the export of long-staple cotton, provided that Egypt has mechanical systems capable of the optimum utilization of imported products. We should not lose sight of production for the sake of export promotion. It should be noted that I would not permit the exportation of certain commodities and encourage the importation of alternatives if costs to importers were lower since that would create idle capacity in society at a time when the state is diligently seeking a solution to the unemployment problem. The proposed commission must also simplify export formalities." Dr. Ghallab concluded: "I hope that the issue of export promotion will not come at the expense of what is necessary to keep food in people's mouths. I also hope that export revenues of foreign currency will be retained in the country and put to work here; and that the magnificent national capitalism would restore the glory Egypt once had in the era of Tal'at Harb, 'Abbud Pasha, and other ingenuous patriotic businessmen." Production and Marketing If the issue of export promotion is an important matter for the economies of all countries, then the success of that policy would depend on two important factors--production and marketing, and opening new markets, according to Dr. Faraj 'Abd-al-Fattah, instructor in economics at Cairo University. On production, he says that we must utilize the concept of comparative advantage when producing all products by determining that their requirements are particularly available plentiful and that conditions are conducive to their production--farm products, for instance. The concept of comparative advantage-based production means producing at world standards but with less cost than in other countries. For marketing purposes, we must promote our output through the coordinated efforts of sponsors as well as of diplomatic missions (trade representatives) in various countries. This would necessitate scrutinizing many aspects of marketing, such as the positions of our competitors in those markets as well as consumer tastes in those markets, their incomes, and the degree to which they would accept substitute products. It takes this two-pronged approach to develop and revive our exports. A single approach is not sufficient to market a product and export it. That product must first conform to international standards and must be produced at low cost. But markets must also exist. The professor of economics added: "The uniform tax law provides exporters with tax incentives in order that they may boost their exports, but this is not sufficient in itself. Exporters need the availability of extensive but reliable information in order to accurately define their markets. Such an information network should be a priority of the various commissions concerned with export promotion." Export Surge Dr. Rida al-'Adl, professor of economics at 'Ayn Shams University's College of Commerce, has no objections to adding new commissions to those already in existence or to restructuring existing commissions or redefining their functions, because this is all perfunctory and natural. The issue of forming a new commission headed by Dr. 'Atif Sidqi may explain the special importance currently attached to exports which have become a question of life or death for us. If we could sustain current markets as we penetrate new ones, we could first utilize idle capacity and develop new production lines to create new jobs for workers, raise incomes, and improve development in general. This applies to all sectors whose products or services may be in demand abroad. Exports today are the checkpoints on the road to economic prosperity, and a new high commission must be created for them. Egypt has great economic potential, but actual exports are low. We must diligently work for a substantial surge in Egyptian exports. Duplication Economist Dr. Sharif Lutfi believes that some of the agencies that oversee exports, such as the Export Development Bank, have distinct functions that they are indeed performing. Commissions concerned with policymaking, on the other hand, include some that were created but have never functioned and therefore do not get to practice their specialties. He said: "I am less concerned with commissions than I am with the policies pursued, because it is those policies that will determine our success or failure in export promotion. Such policies include aspects dealing with taxation, with shipping exports and raising them to the standard needed for exportation, and with government or private efforts to expand export markets. "In any case, it is necessary that exporters participate in devising and categorizing such policies so they will not exclusively reflect government outlook that may be removed from commercial reality. "It is also of value to select a number of nontraditional exports and focus on propelling them in such a manner that the push is concentrated on a limited and specific number of nontraditional exports. When we have succeeded in doing this, then we can move on to another group of nontraditional exports in order to expand their markets. "Pound exchange rate policies must also be taken into consideration because of their great impact on export profitability."
