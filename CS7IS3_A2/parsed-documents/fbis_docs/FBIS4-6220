ASEAN senior officials will gather in Phatthaya for a three-day meeting starting on Monday to prepare agendas for the foreign ministers' meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum in Bangkok in July. The Foreign Ministry would use the opportunity to sound out "opinions of other ASEAN countries" about the sour relations, said Sqn Ldr Prasong while participating in the Ministry's 119th anniversary celebrations. He denied that the scrapped visit to Cambodia by Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari was a protest against the Phnom Penh government. ACM Woranat was possibly not ready for talks with Cambodian officials, he said. ACM Woranat's plan was to hold discussions on border conflicts with high-ranking officials in Phnom Penh. Thailand has protested against Cambodian accusations that Thailand is supporting the Khmer Rouge. A letter will be handed to the Cambodian foreign ministry. Sqn Ldr Prasong said he did not expect to hear any response to the move which was aimed at explaining the truth as well as explaining Thailand's generosity to Cambodia. He said Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had no time, because of a tight schedule, to host Cambodian co-premier Hun Sen's planned visit to Bangkok. The premier was scheduled to visit Malaysia on Thursday. Sqn Ldr Prasong leaves for Rangoon today for an official visit as chairman of the ASEAN standing committee. The visit is an attempt to invite Burma to be a guest at the ASEAN foreign ministerial meeting to create mutual understanding and bring Burma into the outside world under ASEAN's "constructive engagement" policy. Meanwhile, the Cambodian government yesterday closed the Poipet-Klong Luek border pass in Aranyaprathet. The shutdown came more than a week after the Thai military closed this important border point in retaliation for cross-border shelling by Khmer forces. A Cambodian official based in Poipet said yesterday the Thai action was unjustified and unreasonable. He admitted that closing the border would have a detrimental effect on the Cambodian economy and tourism, especially at the usually busy Poipet market which is now deserted. All consumer goods and services that have to be imported from the Thai side are becoming scarce and prices are soaring, said the official, noting that a big chunk of ice which fetched only 60 baht in Poipet before the closure of the border was now priced at 280 baht.
