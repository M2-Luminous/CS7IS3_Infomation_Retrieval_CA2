Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Provincial State Land Department, said that a unified tax rate will deter foreign businessmen from coming to Guangdong and inland cities to develop property markets, adding that Guangdong will consider taking emergency measures. Liu Zhongli, who is also director of the State General Administration of Taxation, announced yesterday the three principles for the land VAT. 1) The land VAT tax shall be levied and equal treatment will be given to investor outside and inside the borders. 2) The same tax law shall be applied to all areas of the mainland. And 3) the government will take opinions of various localities into consideration and formulate appropriate detailed regulations and rules for enforcing the law. In an interview with this reporter through the trunk-line exchange last night, Yuan Zheng said: "Under Guangdong's land VAT policy, which was introduced earlier, the tax rate ranges from 20 to 60 percent. To lower property prices, the Shenzhen government has raised the rate to 60 or even 100 percent. If the land VAT is fixed at 50 percent as required by the central government, it will be a blessing for Shenzhen, because the national tax rate is lower than the local one. But the 50 percent tax rate will have a fairly big adverse impact on other areas in the province, especially areas in northern Guangdong, because the national rate, which is higher than local ones, means a greater burden for investors and thus prevents them from investing in the real estate industry in poor areas." Yuan continue: "As the land VAT will go to local funds, we hope the central government will listen to our opinion and grant us greater authority in enforcing the tax law so that we can implement the law flexibly in accordance with actual conditions. When the detailed regulations and rules for implementing the tax law are published, we will take emergency measures after study." Asked if the land VAT policy, which treats domestic and foreign investors alike, will deter foreign businessmen from investing in Guangdong's real estate industry, Yuan said: "Guangdong presently gives equal treatment to foreign and domestic investors in collecting land gain fees, so it is fair to apply to them the same land VAT rate. For foreign property developers, the matters uppermost in their minds are local investment environment and the rate of return on investment rather than the tax policy. Of course too high a tax rate will dampen their enthusiasm." Yuan continued: "Guangdong's real estate industry has developed rather rapidly, the land VAT policy will probably slow down the pace. The land of which the service life was transferred last year totaled 256,000 mu (excluding land transferred by administrative means), of which 128,000 were for property development. Last year, foreign businessmen invested in 577 projects related to property development with a contracted amount of $14.87 billion. Also last year, land used by foreign businessmen stood at 68,000 mu, most of which was developed by businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 1993, Guangdong's land revenues hit 11 billion yuan, up 17 percent from the previous year. This year Guangdong will reduce land for property development by 10 percent and will concentrate funds and land on 33 major capital construction projects." Yuan pointed out: "Since Guangdong borders on Hong Kong and Macao, it has an edge over other provinces in selling houses to overseas buyers. As Guangdong enjoys a higher economic growth rate than many other provinces, the coastal cities in Guangdong will remain superior to other provinces in introducing foreign funds for property development after the unified land VAT law comes into effect."
