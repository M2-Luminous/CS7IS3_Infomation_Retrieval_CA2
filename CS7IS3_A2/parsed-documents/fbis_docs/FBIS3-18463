Mr. Pangalos stressed that intensive efforts and prudence are needed during the process of accepting three new partners into the EU, and added that his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel had contributed considerably to these efforts. Our correspondent Mirela Kalostipi has the following report. [Kalostipi] Mr. Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou returned from Brussels with harsh reproaches for the European press for its systematic attacks on the Greek presidency. The alternate foreign minister and the deputy foreign minister, who successfully concluded the marathon meeting of the Ministerial Council on the expansion of the EU, expressed great unhappiness with press reports that undermine the Greek presidency's efforts. However, Mr. Pangalos expressed gratitude for the support of German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who--contrary to the UK, French, and Spanish foreign ministers--has contributed substantially to the presidency's efforts. Mr. Pangalos said: Intensive efforts and prudence were needed. The negotiations have been concluded with three of the four countries--that is, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. By 1 January 1995 they will participate in various EU bodies by sending ministers as observers and they will also participate in the EU Council meeting to be held in Corfu. The alternate foreign minister particularly referred to Cyprus, saying that it should have already been included as a candidate country if former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis had taken care of this in time at the European meeting in Edinburgh. In any case, Greece will see that the process for Cyprus' accession is speeded up--that is, earlier than 1 January 1995. Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou described the European press attacks as unfair, but added that key elements of the EU recognize Greece's efforts. Responding to a question on an initiative by the EU Commission president on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] problem, Mr. Pangalos made it clear that yesterday he conveyed the prime minister's letter officially. He said Mr. Jacques Delors is following the issue carefully. Referring to Greece's legal arguments on the measures against Skopje, Mr. Pangalos described them as sound.
