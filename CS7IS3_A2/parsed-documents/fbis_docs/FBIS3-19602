Party Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez closed the congress. Antonio Criado reports from Madrid's Palace of Congresses. [Criado] This congress will go down in history because it marks the difference between one period and another. This is what Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez said in his closing address to the 33d congress. According to Felipe Gonzalez this has been the best congress in the past 20 years. In short, he was extremely satisfied both with the renewal and the integration that the party has undergone. According to Felipe Gonzalez, wounds have to be healed with generosity -- a generosity that has to be extended to integration of all wings in the party during the provincial congresses.
