FBIS4-45475 "jptdd027__l94053" JPRS-TDD-94-027L JPRS Narcotics 14 June 1994 WEST EUROPE GREECE Police Concerned Over Increase in Drug Trade, Other Crimes Police Concerned Over Increase in Drug Trade, Other Crimes NC1406161094 Athens ATHENS NEWS in English 14 Jun 94 p 8 NC1406161094 Athens ATHENS NEWS English BFN [Text] Attika has been an unwelcome host to a crime wave over the past five years. From 22 murders in 1989, this figure more than doubled two years later, reaching a record number of 56. 1989 was the most successful year for the police: Only two of the 22 murders still remain a mystery. But 1991 was both busy and difficult: Only 39 cases out of 56 were solved. So far, 23 out of last year's 42 murders have been put to rest. The homicide department is regarded as one of the best organised branches at Attiki police headquarters. From 199 murders committed in the last five years, 138 were solved, a satisfactory percentage bearing in mind the shortage of specialised staff in the department. However, as the chart shows, the percentage of murders solved has declined rapidly since 1989. 11,750 burglaries and thefts were reported last year, compared to 8,100 in 1987. The rising quantities of drugs confiscated by the police are indicative of the increase in drug trafficking, since only a small percentage of the total is confiscated. About 37 kilos of hashish and seven kilos of heroin were seized in 1985 but in 1992 the numbers jumped to 102 and 79 kilos respectively. Overdose deaths soared accordingly. 14 persons died in 1985 while 66 deaths were recorded in 1993. In 1993, the drug squad arrested 546 persons and confiscated about 41 kilos of hashish and 37 kilos of heroin. The increase in crime is obvious but, equally challenging to police, is that criminals have become more organised. The police statistics contend that the influx of Albanian immigrants into Greece has contributed to the rise in crime. Felonies committed by them are difficult for the police since they have to chase people "without identity". Organised gangs carrying out armed bank robberies are another headache the police could well do without. The department investigating burglaries and thefts has not been as successful as its murder counterpart. From a total of 52,610 cases reported in the last five years, only 9,210 were solved. In 1993, out of 11,750 thefts 2,320 were solved and 1,320 people arrested.
