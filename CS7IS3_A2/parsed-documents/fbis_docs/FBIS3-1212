African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve Brig Gqozo of his post. He was supported by government delegate Roelf Meyer. He said the South African Defence Force could become involved in restoring law and order in the territory. Ciskei representative Mickey Webb said the homeland had requested South African Police and SA Defence Force intervention. Mr Meyer said a South African Government representative, Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans, should be dispatched to the homeland. Mr Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property. He said the Ciskei cabinet should draft a decree giving effect to the TEC's resolution. Mr Ramaphosa said the Ciskei government had lost control in the homeland. "There is no way Brig Gzozo can begin to reinstate himself as head of the area. It is not out of kindness that he is stepping down." TEC Chairman Pravin Gordhan said the TEC acknowledged that Brig Gqozo was stepping down. He said a two-member team from the management committee would be sent to Ciskei. The TEC team would be assisted by Mr Evans as well as trade unionist Philip Dexter and Administration minister Sam de Beer who have been appointed by the TEC to oversee civil service rationalisation. Mr Webb said Brig Gqozo's proposal that he step down was tabled to the TEC at lunchtime. Mr Ramaphosa confirmed that the SAP's [South African Police] Internal Stability Unit had been deployed in the homeland and suggested it be withdrawn as there were indications that they would clash with Ciskei government troops.
