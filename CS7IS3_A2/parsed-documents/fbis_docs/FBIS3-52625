Among the most important of these objectives was extinguishing the struggle against the occupiers of Jerusalem and fomenting a conflict among the Palestinian groups. During the period since 'Arafat's agreement with the Zionists, have they been able to approach their objective? [Larijani] The United States and Israel expected that most of the Palestinians would accept the Gaza-Jericho accord. They claimed that 65 percent of the Palestinians would accept this accord. What Israel truly wanted was to hand over a small piece of populous land like Gaza or Jericho in exchange for the disappearance of the intifadah. It also wanted the doors of the world of Islam to be opened so that it could enter this world. Of course, the oppressed Palestinian people displayed very sharp political instincts during this phase. No matter how I examine this issue, I think that the first phase of the plan has been a complete failure because the intifadah is intensifying. The Israelis are saying that elections will take place if the intifadah ends but that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot gain the majority of votes! Therefore, the Israelis have reached an interesting impasse that has revealed many things. They came forward in the name of democracy. But because it was possible that 'Arafat would not gain any votes, they decided it would be advisable to put an end to democracy and to select a group of people to manage the area themselves! I think that the failure of these two phases is very substantial, and, God willing, other defeats will come. There was a time when Israel only faced the armies of Arab countries. Today it is facing an extremely strong and growing body--the body formed by awakened Muslims. This body is much stronger and more dangerous than the armies and their weapons. For example, once Israel became friends with the Egyptian Government, the Egyptian Army was no longer considered a threat to Israel. Israel has not been able to ignore the people and the Muslim masses that have started to advance, however. Therefore, there is an immense Islamic movement facing Israel today, and this is much worse for it than an army. Israel insists that, along with the compromise plan, the doors of the world of Islam must be opened upon it. It believes that if these doors are not opened now, it will be more difficult to do so in the future. This is also proof that the Islamic movement is advancing. God willing, this Islamic movement will become established in the world of Islam, and it will save the world of Islam from Israeli domination and plots. [RESALAT] Can the contrariness that has emerged in Islamic and Western cultures be resolved? Some people might think that we can work together on common points. Is this contrariness such that they can justify this way of thinking? [Larijani] The correct word here is not contrariness or equivocation. The Westerners influence the world of Islam and want to expand and maintain this influence. Therefore, they have started an onslaught against our wealth, our independence, and our culture. But the world of Islam is resisting. This onslaught is aimed at gaining influence over the world of Islam. Its history can be traced. Over the past century, the West has been able to split the world of Islam into small pieces, plunder Islamic resources, and place its own men in power in many key parts of the world. In other words, their political influence and economic plundering have very extensive cultural aspects. And it is against this Western onslaught that the world of Islam is defending itself. [passage omitted] The reason why Iran is a target of this onslaught is because we have hoisted the banner of confrontation. Fortunately, this banner is now in the hands of all Muslims and will be handed to the next generation. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] France's decision to grant refuge to a number of terrorists has enraged the people of Iran. What steps does the Majles intend to take to confront this act by France? [Larijani] Of course, I did not want the West and France to act differently toward the world of Islam, but we do not fear anyone when it comes to safeguarding our interests and our security. Fortunately, our country is an extremely strong and stable country. There are not many countries in the region that enjoy the power and stability that we do. I believe that the world cannot advance on the basis of the hostilities that the Westerners are creating today and on the basis of their overt intervention, lies, and duplicities. They have seen that we are serious about confronting terrorism, and yet their countries are the hearths of terrorism! They say that insulting a prostitute is tantamount to a violation of human rights, but they are prepared to place thousands in front of their own firing squads! I think that this era is ending, however. As far as establishing relations with the world is concerned, we should keep two points in mind. The first is that we should get to know ourselves--get to know what we have to say and where we are going. The second is that we should be able to stand on our own two feet. If the esteemed leader emphasizes the need for self-sufficiency and for standing on our own two feet, it is because we must be able to express ourselves in the best possible way to continue living in this world and to be able to say what we have to say to the world. This is the only way our relations with the world can have a completely logical basis. Of course, these principles are more or less observed today, and I think that the West should not expect to have logical relations with us by imposing things on us. All the governments that tried to do so have failed. Experience has shown that cooperation with Iran can only be on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocal interests. [RESALAT] How real do you consider the differences between Europe and the United States to be? What is our opinion of this? [Larijani] Of course, this difference is deep-rooted, and it is still the beginning. The root of the differences between the two is economic rivalry. [passage omitted] I think that the smaller the power monopoly in the world, the better it is for us. In other words, we can live in a world with a great deal of competition instead of a world divided into competitive blocs. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] In the new world order, the United States has made great efforts to impose itself as the sole superpower in the world. However, it has been unable to do so, and the weaknesses in Clinton's personality, as well as the extensive criticisms against U.S. foreign policy, are good examples of this failure. What is your opinion? [Larijani] What can be said to have definitely ended are the claims of world leadership by the United States. In other words, the world is not ready for a country like the United States to say that it is the leader of the world, nor is it ready to see the establishment of an exclusive club for world leadership. [passage omitted] The West wants to transform the United Nations into a headquarters for world leadership. But the philosophy behind the formation of the United Nations was that it should be a forum for discussions among nations and not the headquarters of a world leadership. When they say that the United Nations should be decisive, have an army, safeguard peace, and--according to themselves--prevent any threats to peace, these are all incorrect charts of the course that the United Nations should take. I think that the United Nations is extremely decisive and that this is sufficient. It should let the people of the world defend themselves. We should not expect the United Nations to send forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations has tied the hands of the Muslims there. I think that there should be some changes in the United Nations. We should support a decrease in the power of the Security Council and efforts to transform the United Nations into a forum where more discussions and debates take place. We should not expect the United Nations to act. We should ask all those who say that the United Nations should have the power to act: Under whose leadership? Where should it receive its orders from? They say: We will form a world rule for you. But world rule will be established when the imam of the ages reappears, God willing. As for whether those who have strength should once again rule, I believe that in our strategy at the United Nations and in the Third World, we should support the idea of extracting the extra teeth of the United Nations because these teeth have always been beneficial for the hegemonists. Therefore, in this new phase a type of joint leadership for the world is a theory on which they are working and for this reason Japan and Germany too want to enter the Security Council. In other words, if one day the Americans opposed this idea, today they are insisting on it. Therefore, today they have descended one step from their previous position. But, God willing, their new theory too will soon be defeated and the human race will see better days.
