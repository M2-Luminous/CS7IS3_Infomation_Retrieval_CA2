The 120 member states of GATT will finally be able to end the talks on the Uruguay Round that lasted for several years. The United States has not succeeded in ensuring the inclusion of standards for the rights of employees. No matter how important topics like minimum wages and child labor are in developing countries -- they must not prevent the signing of an agreement at the last minute that at least curbs protectionism. The Social Democratic Party of Germany should have thought about that before demanding that Bonn not sign a WTO treaty without clauses on the rights of employees. French farmers, European film lobbyists, and others have long enough been trying to prevent the signing. According to GATT calculations, the agreement will result in an increase in world trade by $750 billion within 10 years, which is a 12-percent increase. Those who want prosperity must not give away this potential carelessly -- let alone because of the topic "social issues in the Third World." This is a very sensitive problem. Developing countries usually reject interference in their own affairs. Thus, serious negotiations and not hastily formulated commonplaces are required.
