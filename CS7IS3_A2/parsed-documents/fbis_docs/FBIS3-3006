In response to a question at a news conference here today, Qian said the "Investment Protection Law for Taiwan Compatriots" to be enacted by the NPC is "more comprehensive and authoritative" than what he called "the 22 regulations" previously formulated by mainland authorities concerning investment in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots. On the possibility of the signing of an agreement on investment protection by non-governmental organizations from both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Qian said he cannot rule out such a possibility from a long-term of view. "But, at present," he said, "conditions are not ripe since there aren't two-way exchanges between the two sides."
