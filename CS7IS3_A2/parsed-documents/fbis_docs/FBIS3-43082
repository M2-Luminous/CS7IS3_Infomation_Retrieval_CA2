There also is cold in the hearts of scientific specialists forever awaiting budget reductions or a simple cutback. The most warmth-loving long ago were drawn to the south, but more likely to the west... Our correspondent took advantage of a visit of Boris Saltykov, Minister of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian Federation, to Novosibirsk, to inquire when there might be a thaw for science. Kolesova: Boris Georgiyevich, two years in the ministerial seat these days is not a short time. So many changes have occurred that each year one can count on three, and maybe even ten. Have you had a change in your points of view on the goals and methods for the reformation of science? Saltykov: There has been a definite evolution in points of view, I think, among all members of the government and among all the citizens of Russia. We began reforms in 1991 without having had any practical experience in carrying them out and therefore there was a definite idealism, purely theoretical ideas of what had to be done. On the whole the strategic ideas on the principal goals of science reform have almost not changed. However, the forms, the methods and the sequence of different measures had to be changed as we went along, taking the developing economic and social conditions into account. It was immediately clear to us: the model of science which had been adapted to the administrative-command control system inevitably had to be changed because by that time the system had already changed. By late 1991 all the branch ministries had collapsed and this means that all the branch science which they fed had already come apart at the seams. It was necessary to construct new mechanisms, to devise new structures for its funding and control. The idealism was manifested in the fact that we clearly had underrated the stability of the old system, its capacity to resist. When reforms began in the economy science (however, like culture as well) suffered more than other branches. This was not the fault of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, but its misfortune. A substantially lesser growth of prices was predicted for early 1992. We anticipated that in 1992 the budget would be reduced by 40-50%, but the results for the year showed that it had fallen by almost a factor of three. This was a shock for science. And our role under these shock conditions was to react rapidly, to devise survival mechanisms. In short, whereas initially the first priority was to bring the system for organizing and funding science into line with the conditions of the expanding market, by the spring of 1992 the problem of elementary survival had already arisen. And it was important (this, incidentally, was the most difficult task) to save the best, sacrificing -- if necessity dictated -- that whose loss would not exert too great an influence on the scientific capabilities of the country. To be sure, the principal difficulties arose in the choice of priorities due to the enormous inertia of the former system. Let's say that we inherited about 40 scientific-technical programs -- strongly validated, organizationally formulated, but in many respects no longer corresponding to the needs of 1992, much less 1993. It was very difficult to change them. A start was made by replacing several program directors. In general I would say as follows: life constantly teaches its lessons. The changes which occurred dictated that we take new approaches. For example, the implementation of the program for state scientific centers in early 1992 was planned in a different form. But the crisis in branch science already by late 1992 forced a search for new forms of immediate assistance to the best scientific and technical organizations in Russia. And evolution of points of view of the type: we thought, it is necessary to go to the market, but now we understood that it was necessary to leave everything as it was, something which, Thank God, did not occur. In general, however, the process of acquiring work experience under conditions which were unusual for us turned out to be not very easy. And this experience, especially for high-level directors, in my opinion, was invaluable. Kolesova: ``There is too much science in our country'' -- that is a contention with which everyone mercilessly scolds you -- from academician to common folk. Do you by chance not intend to refute it? Saltykov: This thesis in actuality was advanced by me early in 1992, but it was employed in a definite context. There was probably as much science as was required by that system which existed several years ago: a system which was ideologized, militarized, oriented on the needs of a great military power. But we changed the system: we decided that it was necessary to cut the army in half, to reduce unnecessary expenditures on defense because precisely they stifled the civilian branch (we had five times more tanks than did the United States!). Accordingly, in our country there came to be many who were employed in the research, development, testing and engineering fields, especially those who were related to defense orders. This does not at all mean that we have too many educated or too many talented people (and sometimes it is precisely so interpreted to me). But it is just the other way around: the more educated and talented people there are in society, the better. But, after all, scientific specialists and engineers are not simply educated people, but people producing some product which must be required by society. Either fundamental knowledge is involved, or practical development work, oriented on industry, defense, etc. Specialists at any scientific research institute know very well that each institute has been supersaturated with people -- in the distant golden 1960's when petroleum dollars flowed in a river and virtually everything which was applied for was funded. To be sure, I exaggerate, but not by much. A civilian society, in which the interests of all layers of society are balanced, must count its resources and also must count its expenditures on science. All the time they say about me: ``He wants to cut back on fundamental science.'' However, even fundamental science has its funding sources. It is known that even the Academy has received 30-40% of its funding from defense orders. And if we all are in agreement that expenditures on defense must be reduced, it is inevitable that the Academy will be allocated 30-40% less. Or that this percentage must be taken from another part of the budget. But from what part? At whose expense? Incidentally, one of the results of activity of the Soros Fund was the appearance of interesting statistics. It was found that from almost a million ``statistical'' scientific workers in Russia during the last five years only 21 thousand have three (or more) publications in prestigious scientific journals, ours and foreign. Well, let's assume that an equal number simply did not submit applications. And, unfortunately, this is a quite objective evaluation of those really ``producing'' new knowledge in fundamental science! Our drama was that in our country there was a very labor-intensive (in contrast to fund-intensive) development path, including in science as well. Whereas, for example, in Europe, United States and Japan one scientist and corresponding equipment are adequate for performing any work, this would take us three researchers and five technicians. That is, we have made up for the shortage of modern equipment by work, sometimes even work by highly skilled specialists. Accordingly, in the event of a changeover to advanced research technologies reserves will be found for reducing numbers. On the other hand, these people could successfully find themselves in such organizations necessary for a market economy as those introducing new technologies, consulting and servicing firms, certification and information centers, etc. In the technically well-developed countries this infrastructure is extremely well developed and a great number of specialists are employed in it. Kolesova: Many provincial scientists, including those in Siberia, have suspected: the minister -- in any case at the beginning of his activity -- held the opinion that all science was concentrated within the limits of the Sadovoye Ring. Saltykov: Just plain slander. I always criticized the organization of our science precisely for the fact that in the administrative system all decisions were made at the center. And certainly in this sense Moscow made mistakes in the distribution of resources. Accordingly, I am speaking out precisely for the maximum decentralization of the making of decisions, in particular, with respect to the allocation of funding. But when they tell me that it is necessary to elect scientists to the Academy of Sciences not only from Moscow, but from each provincial city because ``there are no academicians there,'' I protest. Despite this, members must be elected on the basis of the results of their work, not by place of residence. Kolesova: Could you not formulate the key points in the present-day scientific policy of the government, since sometimes the fear arises that there simply is none... Saltykov: There is a concept, and it is not the result of office meditations of ministerial officials. It was formulated together with the leading scientists of the country and was discussed at the All- Russian Conference of Scientific Workers and in the government. In the concept which is today being implemented there are two main goals: creation of new mechanisms for organizing and funding of science corresponding to a market economy and conservation of the capabilities accumulated over the course of the entire evolution of Russian science. Among the methods for implementing these goals it is necessary to mention the creation of alternative extradepartmental funding sources. This funding system is primarily governmental. One fund, for fundamental research, has already been established; we are striving to set up a second for research in the humanities. We also are approving the setting up of regional funds. Incidentally, a good example is in Siberia: the Krasnoyarsk Regional Science Support Fund. With respect to applied science, there, as it seems to us today, two processes should be at work. First, transformation of some of the former branch institutes by means of organization of joint stock companies, privatization and merging with some production structures into companies heavily oriented on science, large or small, which will live, as they say, ``from the market,'' filling orders of consumers, among which the state may be one. However, the institutes most important for the state itself and for the time being (or in principle) not intended for the market consumer are being transformed into state scientific centers and are receiving considerable support from the budget, although, to be sure, a search for clients is not forbidden them. If one speaks of the entire innovative sphere, we will assume that it is necessary to develop small-scale innovative business. We allocated an item in the budget for the funding of business insurance policies and business motor pools, the ``incubators of business,'' but for the time being there are no good mechanisms for such support. Still another of the principal points in our scientific policy: a system for selecting priorities and funding in priority directions, finalized, primarily, in the form of state scientific and technical programs. This will make it possible to fund important research within the framework of fundamental programs having good coordinating structures: ``High-Energy Physics,'' ``Human Genome,'' ``New Methods in Bioengineering,'' etc. Another part is programs oriented on use in the economy. Here, for the time being there are difficulties because it is unclear how under market economy conditions it is possible to distribute the rights of ownership for the results obtained during work under a government program. Finally, in the present-day difficult situation an acute problem, as before, is the brain drain and ways to contend with it. The ``Government Professor'' project already has been in preparation for a year. The essence of this project is the payment of the elite part of our scientists such sums as would enable them not to think of departure for abroad. Kolesova: Insofar as I understand, this idea found its reflection, highly distorted, to be sure, in a recent presidential decree entitled ``Material Support of Scientists.'' Under the circumstances of adoption of this decree, once again there is evidently a manifestation of the disagreement between your ministry and the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences, already becoming traditional, which in no way strengthens the position of scientists in society and the government... Saltykov: We worked on the ``Government Professor'' draft together, both the Academy and the Ministry. A working group was organized in the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy which included representatives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, universities and government agencies and these were the authors of this project. And we thought out the details: selection method and organization of expert councils which would include foreign scientists. But it turned out that the preparation of the decree on ``Material Support of Scientists'' went right past us, it did not receive the OK from either the Minister of Science and Technical Policy or the Minister of Finance or the science section of the government. Kolesova: Why? Saltykov: Don't ask me. They simply did not present the draft to us. The first point in this decree is seemingly a weak reflection of the ``Government Professor'' idea. But I assume that only the vocabulary of the project was adopted: ``outstanding scientists,'' ``stipends,'' etc. However, its essence has nothing in common with the idea of contending with the brain drain. First of all because there is violation of the extradepartmental principle. With all respect to the Academy of Sciences, it must be admitted that outstanding scientists are working in both the higher educational institutions and in the branches. It would be more natural to establish extradepartmental councils for the selection. Incidentally, this is not just my point of view -- after issuance of the decree there was immediately a rain of accusations that the universities and some ministries (the Ministry of Nuclear Energy, for example, has excellent institutes at the academic level) had been forgotten. But the most important thing is the figures: the stipend for an outstanding scientist, 75 thousand rubles, to be sure, cannot pretend to be a realization of that idea which was embodied in the ``Government Professor'' project. It is something else that today any money is worth getting. But this is not a project for contending with the brain drain; this is simply still another stipend for some group of scientists. The ``Government Professor'' project provided for a stipend in the amount of a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars or five hundred -- that can be debated -- but as you see, the scale is completely different. It is not a matter of a dispute between the ministry and the Academy, but an old fear: whether the remaining scientific community will be insulted by designation of such an elite? I have dealt a great deal with the truly outstanding scientists of our time and they are convinced: this would not happen. Any proper differential treatment, for example, when a person sells a license and receives three million, arouses no envy among colleagues because they know that this money was earned. It is far more dreadful when in such selections of the elite one or two ill-chosen, inadequate persons are included. The entire scientific community, indeed, knows what's up, who's worth what. Such accidents therefore cannot be allowed. But in the decree there is reference to such sums relative to which the lofty words ``material support of scientists'' are inappropriate. For that reason as well the decree ought not have been issued; a directive of the government would have been entirely sufficient. Because scientists, to be sure, expected major decisions. Kolesova: Both during your visit to Novosibirsk last year and today you spoke of the complex situation in the government arising due to the strong pressure of some branches. Did you make any attempts at organizing a strong science lobby? Saltykov: Lobbying is not exclusively something Russian, it is observed in all countries. If one speaks of the relation of forces in the past parliament, there was a strong agrarian lobby there, and it also exists in the government. The organization of something similar for science is possible through an adequate makeup of the State Duma, which need not necessarily include scientists, but in any case intelligent people understanding the role of science in the fate of Russia and who understand clearly that expenditures on science must not drop below a certain level. Kolesova: Insofar as I know, you are running from Novosibirsk Oblast in the ``Russian Election.'' In this connection I ask the standard ``Bolshevik'' question: a minimum program or a maximum program? Saltykov: I have already set forth a maximum program: to realize an increase in the fraction of the budget for science in the coming year. The minimum program is to hold at the same level. But I nevertheless will strive to achieve the maximum program because this is an entirely realistic parliamentary struggle. Excuse me for an entirely Bolshevik answer: if the ``Russian Election'' turns out successfully we will do everything in order to augment appropriations for science. Kolesova: Pardon me, but here's the traditional challenge in the ``Russian Election,'' especially for candidate ministers: you already have been in authority but expenditures on science have in no way increased. Saltykov: That is in error. We were in authority only in 1992 and in 1993 the government became a coalition. I don't have to tell you that the authority was in the hands of the Supreme Soviet, not ours. A struggle of opinions developed, alas, not to the advantage of science, although I also must bear my share of responsibility. And nevertheless our principal task now is to achieve an increase in the fraction of expenditures on science in the Russian budget. Kolesova: The last, purely personal question: are you not weary of all this? Saltykov: Fatigued, but also hardened.
