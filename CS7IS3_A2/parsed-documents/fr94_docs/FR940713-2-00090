ACTION: Notice of Remand Determination. SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of a final court decision affirming its final negative determinations, made pursuant to court remand, in the above-identified antidumping duty investigations. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrea C. Casson, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436; (202) 205&hyph;3105. Hearing-impaired individuals are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal at (202) 205&hyph;1810. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 19, 1990, the Commission published its determinations that an industry of the United States was materially injured by reason of imports of manmade fiber (``MMF'') sweaters from Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan. 55 Fed. Reg. 38588 (Sept. 19, 1990); Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Manmade Fibers from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, Invs. Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;448&hyph;450 (Final), USITC Pub. 2312 (Sept. 1992). The Hong Kong, Korean and Taiwanese producers of the subject MMF sweaters sought review of those final determinations in the Court of International Trade (CIT). On July 28, 1992, the CIT issued an Order, finding that the Commission's final injury determinations were unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise not in accordance with law, and remanding the determinations to the Commission for further proceedings. Chung Ling Co. v. United States, 805 F. Supp. 45 (CIT 1992). On November 23, 1992, the Commission submitted its remand determinations to the CIT, finding on remand that an industry in the United States was not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of the subject MMF sweaters, which the Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') had determined are sold at less than fair value. Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Manmade Fibers from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, Invs. Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;448&hyph;450 (Final) (Remand), USITC Pub. 2577 (Nov. 1992). The trade association representing the domestic sweaters producers, the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association (``NKSA'') challenged the remand determinations before the CIT. On August 11, 1993, the CIT issued an order finding that the Commission's remand determinations fell within the scope of the remand order, and were supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the CIT sustained the Commission's remand determinations. Chung Ling Co. v. United States, 829 F. Supp. 1353 (CIT 1993). Notice of the CIT's decision was published by Commerce, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(c)(1), on November 12, 1993. 58 Fed. Reg. 59987 (Nov. 12, 1992). In accordance with Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), Commerce stated that it would continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise. Commerce's notice also indicated that, if the CIT decision was affirmed on appeal, the antidumping duty orders would be revoked. Thereafter, NKSA appealed the CIT's judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 15, 1994, the Court of Appeals affirmed, without opinion, the CIT's final judgment upholding the Commission's negative remand determinations. Chung Ling Co. v. USITC, No. 94&hyph;1028 (Fed. Cir. June 15, 1994). On July 6, 1994, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate. The judicial proceedings having ended and the final court decision having been issued, the Commission now, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), publishes notice of the final court decision affirming its negative remand determinations. By order of the Commission. Issued: July 6, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16995 Filed 7&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
