You no longer see the headline: "Why Should NATO Exist?" Many countries wish to join our alliance or, at least, to develop closer ties with it. There is nothing surprising about this. Since our international scene is continuing to be shaken by instability and conflicts, people are reassessing the organizations that can effectively maintain their security, and NATO is one of them. In fact, it is the only collective defense organization operating in the entire world. But this is not NATO's sole attraction. After all, the alliance is the main security link connecting the West's two most important power centers. Hence it is the key factor for stability in an unstable world. No new security order in Europe can be imagined without our alliance. NATO remains the main forum in which the West can formulate and coordinate joint political decisions. Under its umbrella, the dynamism of European unification can develop. Since the end of World War II, two new elements have been added to NATO's traditional role of collective defense. One is crisis control and peacekeeping operations; the other is the projection of stability toward the countries of Central and East Europe, and toward those of Central Asia. Our aim is to help them readjust their defense policies and to assist them throughout their difficult transitional stage. No other international organization could replace NATO in these tasks. Only NATO has such an impressive set of political and military instruments for crisis control. Only the Atlantic Alliance has the means to transform political statements into coherent actions. Hence it is the basis on which any new Euro-Atlantic security structure should rest. The setting up of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the development of a new strategy, a new force posture, and a strengthened European pillar show the essential role which our alliance continues to play in Europe's security. The summit which we have just held in January was an impressive demonstration of what can be achieved if the political will, energy, and creativity of North America and Europe are combined: What we did was no less than to open a new chapter in our alliance's history. Deepening the conclusions of the 1990 London and 1991 Rome summits, the NATO heads of state and government have given our alliance the necessary means and instruments to be able to face up to the challenges of post-Cold War Europe. 1) -- We reaffirmed the importance of transatlantic relations, as well as our unqualified support for the European security and defense identity. Transatlantic solidarity and European integration are not alternatives -- still less contradictions. Europe must acquire unity and strength in order to be able to take up the share of responsibility and leadership which rests with it in our alliance. This is to the benefit both of the alliance and of North America and Europe. The reform of NATO and European integration are interconnected. A stronger Europe and Western European Union [WEU], able to intervene, will make it possible to share responsibilities within the alliance more fairly, without jeopardizing its role as the main forum for consultation and prime instrument of European security. 2) -- We decided to effect important changes in our alliance's structures in order to make them more flexible and to enable the advantages which this offers to be turned to account more effectively in crisis control and in peacekeeping operations. Specifically, we will develop a concept which, if necessary, will enable the European allies' forces to operate under the WEU's aegis. However, more flexible structures will be of use for what we want only if we maintain an adequate level of well-trained and well-equipped armed forces, backed by adequate resources. The fewer means we have at our disposal, the fewer choices we will have. 3) -- We decided in principle to open the alliance to new members. Since our security is inseparably linked to that of the other European states, NATO remains devoted to the consolidation of the security and stability of the democratic states to the east of our borders. In launching the Partnership for Peace initiative, we have embarked on a process which will transform relations between NATO and the states joining in the initiative. This new program goes beyond dialogue and cooperation in order to attempt to forge a real partnership. With the speed and scope set by each country's wishes and ability, we will seek specific channels for joint planning and joint military maneuvers, and we will give these countries the opportunity to work with NATO's forces in fields such as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Prompted by a desire for cooperation, we will also encourage transparency in defense budgets and democratic oversight of defense ministries. These measures, with the right of the partners for peace to consult with the alliance whenever they feel threatened, will afford the tangible benefits for security stemming from moving closer to NATO. We will be holding the first joint maneuvers with the partners for peace at the end of this year, and we will rapidly proceed to set up a division for the coordination of peacekeeping operations close to the headquarters of the allied forces in Europe and to NATO [as published]. The Partnership for Peace is no substitute for joining NATO. On the contrary, we applaud the alliance's enlargement as part of an evolutionary process which will be to the advantage of security and democracy throughout Europe. The Partnership for Peace will help prepare the countries concerned for possible entry into the alliance. Hence putting this initiative into practice will be one of our main tasks over the next few months. Our prime aim is still to build a new Euro-Atlantic security architecture with Russia, rather than without or against it. Nobody should be isolated. We must build bridges, not barriers. 4) -- We decided that NATO should face up not only to the traditional security challenges but also to those emerging from new political and technological developments. This is especially true of the increasing danger posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Stopping this proliferation by political and diplomatic means remains our priority, but this may not be enough. We must also seek adequate means of protection. For this reason, we have entrusted to the alliance's appropriate political and military bodies the formulation of an overall political framework for exploring the way in which NATO can best help achieve this aim. The work will begin without delay, and a working program and list of priorities will be submitted to the foreign ministers within six months. The important initiatives adopted at our last summit highlight the constant need for this alliance and its vitality. NATO has charted a course which will take it resolutely to the 21st century.
