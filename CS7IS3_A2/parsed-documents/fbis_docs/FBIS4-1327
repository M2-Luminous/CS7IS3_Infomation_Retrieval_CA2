Patterton] [Text] Pretoria April 26 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on Tuesday encouraged people to vote, saying polling stations were perhaps the safest places in South Africa with "tremendous" safety measures taken by security forces. He promised a clampdown by government on those responsible for the spate of bombings linked to the elections. He was speaking at the Karmel old age home in Pretoria where he had taken his mother, Mrs Corrie de Klerk, aged 89, to cast her special vote. Mr de Klerk told journalists that the government and the new government of national unity would act sternly against those responsible for the bombings, thought to be a "lunatic fringe on the right". He said no conclusions could be reached from voting patterns so far, adding that he expected a high average percentage. He was glad that technical hitches experienced at some polling stations on Tuesday morning had been ironed out.
