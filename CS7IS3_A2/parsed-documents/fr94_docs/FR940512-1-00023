The plan provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposes to revise are (1) UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;25, lands and water eligible for reclamation; (2) UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;27, entry upon land adversely affected by past coal mining practices, State acquisition of land and public sale, and water pollution control and treatment plants; and (3) UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land. Following are more specific descriptions of the revisions that Utah proposes to make to the above-listed sections of its statute. These descriptions do not address several editorial revisions including changes in punctuation and capitalization; recodification; replacement of the word ``regulations'' and the term ``rules and regulations'' with the synonymous word ``rules;'' the joining with the conjunction ``and'' of the last two provisions in a series of three or more provisions joined by semicolons; the use of Arabic numbers instead of spelling out the numbers; and the deletion of the word ``this'' prior to the word ``Subsection'' when it is followed by a specific statute citation. Utah proposes the following revisions to its program provisions. Utah proposes to add new definitions for the terms (1) ``adjudicative proceeding'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(1) to mean ``a division or board action or proceeding that determines the legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities, or other legal interests of one or more identifiable persons, including all actions to grant, deny, revoke, suspend, modify, annul, withdraw, or amend an authority, right, permit, or license;'' (2) ``lands eligible for remining'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(8) to mean ``those lands that would otherwise be eligible for expenditures under Section 40&hyph;10&hyph;25 or 40&hyph;10&hyph;25.1;'' and (3) ``unanticipated event or condition'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(21) to mean ``an event or condition encountered in a remining operation that was not contemplated by the applicable surface coal mining and reclamation permit.''
