To express the so-called "aspirations of the Taiwan people," they also wanted to deliver the white paper to members of the mainland's Associations for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait who went to Taiwan to hold talks with the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation. Regarding the two sides of the strait as "two countries," the "white paper" said: "The two countries must respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, refrain from invading each other, treat each other as equals, benefit each other, and establish normal diplomatic relations," and so on and so forth. Obviously, this is a farce instigated by a handful of "Taiwan independence" elements who have made use of the "nongovernmental organizations" to attempt to split the nation under the banner of "Taiwan people deciding for themselves." In reply to reporters' questions in Seattle last year, State President Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: China means the PRC, and Taiwan is a province of China. In a white paper entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which was published on 31 August last year, the Chinese Government systematically and in great detail expounded the Chinese Government's principled stand and basic principle and policies on the Taiwan issue. It was firmly opposed to any words and deeds aimed at splitting state sovereignty and territorial integrity. With the founding of the PRC in 1949, the old regime's ruling power over China as a whole was replaced. There was a succession of governments. The succession did not bring about any changes in China's territory and Taiwan is still an inalienable part of China's sacred territory. The present state of affairs between the two sides of the strait constitutes only a split of jurisdiction; the sovereignty is still that of a unified state. This fact is not only confirmed by the international law, but is also a common understanding of the people of the whole China. In ancient China, over the past thousands of years there have always been three factors in the founding of a state, namely "territory, sovereignty, and people." In its history, wars on the Chinese territory have created chaos, and there have been many regimes. In spite of this, there have never been "several Chinas" as a result of "sovereign states not subordinated to one another." It is sheer daydreaming on the part of a small handful of "Taiwan independence" elements to attempt to found another "sovereign state" on the Chinese territory of Taiwan. As a commentary of SHIH-CHIEH LUN-TAN PAO [WORLD TRIBUNE] in Taiwan pointed out: To pursue their own selfish interests, these people have willfully trampled upon the dignity of the "Taiwan people" in the face of the people of the world as if it was a joke. They are indeed guilty of the most heinous crimes and make all "Taiwan people" feel ashamed! From the overall political and economic situation of the world, we can discover that all separated countries belonging to a nation will eventually be reunified. The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same roots and origin. Our spoken and written language, customs, and blood relationships can be traced to the same origins. There is no reason whatsoever to be separated for a long time. Regarding themselves as Chinese, all the people on both sides of the strait need only one China. The "Taiwan independence" elements, however, do not recognize themselves as Chinese, and they vainly try to cut away a piece of Chinese territory and found another state. How can the 1.2 billion people of China, including Taiwan, sit by idly and remain indifferent? The "Taiwan independence" elements vilify the Chinese people's consistent stand on safeguarding state reunification and territorial integrity as a "distortion of the international law and international treaties" and, at the same time, describe their attempt to split the country as a "principle of modern international law." Their so-called "principle of modern international law" means allowing this scum of the nation, out of their selfish interests, to willfully cut a piece of land from a sovereign state and found another state. Even some democratic countries in the West will never tolerate this open act of splitting state sovereignty. Just think. It would be strange if some people would not be immediately condemned if they attempt to found another country in a U.S. state. According to the white paper, which advocates "two countries, two systems," "it is necessary for Taiwan to join the United Nations and other international organizations as soon as possible." This is only daydreaming. In 1971 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passed Resolution 2758, "recognizing the PRC as the only legitimate representative of China in UN organizations" and stating that, as a part of China, Taiwan is not qualified to "join the United Nations." This is something known to all. In whatever name Taiwan joins the United Nations, it is tantamount to creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan." This is absolutely out of keeping with the principle of China's reunification. Since state reunification is the common aspiration of the people on both sides of the strait, the Taiwan independence forces on the island should not play with the fire of the principled issue of state reunification or they will have only themselves to blame.
