FBIS4-32461 "dreeu122_m_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Albanian Clerks Boycott Public Census Albanian Clerks Boycott Public Census AU2406101294 Skopje MILS-NEWS in English 24 Jun 94 AU2406101294 Skopje MILS-NEWS English BFN [Unattributed report: "Census '94"] [Text] Although the census entered its 3rd day, Albanian census clerks are still not doing their part of the job in some cities (Kumanovo, Kicevo, Debar). The census has also not yet started in the part of Makedonski Brod, inhabited by the Macedonian Muslims and the Turks. The situation in Tetovo is the same despite the fact that all preparations are completed, because of Article 30 of the Census Law. The census in Gostivar has also not begun although the training of census clerks has. The operation in Debar did start but the census committees asked for a delay. In parts of the Skopje central settlement inhabited by heterogeneous populations, census clerks refuse to go in twos. In all remaining cities, the census operation is carried out normally. Meanwhile, representatives of PDP [the Party of Democratic Prosperity] and the Albanian Liberal Alliance-Democratic Party met with the Council of Europe's experts in parliament yesterday. The resident of the expert team (Verner Haug) stated there were no objective reasons to boycott the census and parties refusing to take part in it would have to take on the entire responsibility, regardless of their reasons. As for demands by Albanian parties for postponement of the end deadline, he said it might be a solution for overcoming all current problems. He pointed out it would be better to have a little longer-lasting census than to have no census at all. However, he stressed this was only a suggestion on which the Macedonian Government and parliament will have to bring a final decision about.
