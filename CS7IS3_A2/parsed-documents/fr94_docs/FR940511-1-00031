FR940511-1-00031 FR940511-1-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;38&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. This proposal is prompted by several incidents in which the flight crew did not depress both halves of the autopilot disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 approach and, as a result, one autopilot remained engaged. This condition resulted in unanticipated movements of the stabilizer trim and higher than anticipated control forces of the flight controls. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the flight crew from inadvertently disconnecting only one autopilot when both autopilots are engaged, which could result in unanticipated control surface movements. DATES: Comments must be received by June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;38&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
