FR940603-0-00055 FR940603-0-00025 During the comment period, NMFS received several requests for public hearings on the proposed designation. Public hearings were held in Boston, MA, on August 25, 1993; in Port Canaveral, FL, on August 24, 1993; and in Brunswick, GA, on August 25, 1993 (58 FR 41454, Aug. 4, 1993). The comment period was extended until August 31, 1993, to allow commenters the opportunity to respond to concerns voiced at the public hearings. After consideration of public comments, and based on the best available scientific information, NMFS is designating critical habitat for the northern right whale as described in the proposed rule. Definition of Critical Habitat ``Critical habitat'', as defined in section 3(5)(A) of the ESA, and the term ``conservation'', as defined in section 3(3) of the ESA, were provided in the preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 29186, May 19, 1993). Essential Habitat of the Northern Right Whale Biological information for the northern right whale can be found in the Recovery Plan (NMFS, 1991), and in recent scientific literature (Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986; Kenney et al., 1986; Wishner et al., 1988; Mayo and Marx, 1990; Payne et al., 1990; Kraus and Kenney, 1991; Kraus et al., 1993; Kenney, Winn and Macauley, 1994). The physical and biological habitat features of the critical habitat are discussed herein. Foraging Habitat of the Northern Right Whale Right whales have been characterized principally as ``skim'' feeders (Kawamura, 1974; Nemoto and Kawamura, 1977). They subsist primarily on dense swarms of calanoid copepods, notably Calanus finmarchicus in the North Atlantic (Mitchell, 1975; Watkins and Schevill, 1979; Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986; Wishner et al., 1988; Mayo and Marx, 1990; Kraus and Kenney, 1991). Northern right whales are also known to prey on other similar sized zooplankton. Two other zooplankton species preyed upon by northern right whales in CCB include Pseudocalanus minutis and Centropages spp. (Mayo and Marx, 1990). A strong positive correlation between the abundance of right whales in the southern Gulf of Maine and densities of C. finmarchicus has been described by Kenney et al. (1986), Wishner et al. (1988), Payne et al. (1990), and Kenney, Winn and Macauley (1994). The two recorded time intervals when right whales were most abundant in the CCB/Stellwagen Bank area (April 1970, reported by Watkins and Schevill, 1982; and during 1986, reported by Payne et al., 1990) were during periods of observed peak densities of copepods. While the size and density of copepod patches are important to the feeding energetics of right whales, so are the relative proportions of adult copepods within each patch (Kenney et al., 1986; Wishner et al., 1988). Although the feeding ecology of right whales is likely more complex than previously thought (Mayo and Marx, 1990), dense aggregations of older, caloric-rich copepods seem to be the required characteristics for energetically successful foraging by right whales. If copepods in these caloric-rich, adult developmental stages are not available to northern right whales in sufficient densities, there may be insufficient prey available in the remaining developmental stages (independent of abundance) to provide right whales with the required energy densities (as described by Kenney et al., 1986) to meet the metabolic and reproductive demands of the right whale population in the western North Atlantic (Kenney et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1990). Foraging Habitat: The overall spatial requirements for right whales are not well defined; however, the distribution pattern observed for northern right whales indicates that four of the five principal habitats occupied by right whales in the western North Atlantic are used for foraging, and possibly reproductive activities: The GSC, CCB, the Bay of Fundy, and the Scotian Shelf. Neither feeding nor courtship behavior has been observed along the SEUS. Scientists believe that subadult and adult baleen whales fast, or feed rarely, during the winter calving period. Based on observed distribution patterns compared to oceanographic conditions, scientists speculate that the topographic and seasonal oceanographic characteristics of foraging areas are conducive to the dense growth of zooplankton. These high-use areas may comprise the minimal space required for normal foraging behavior that will support the northern right whale population. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada) has already designated two foraging areas as right whale sanctuaries_one in the Bay of Fundy and another on the Scotian Shelf. The remaining two foraging habitats, the GSC and CCB, are found in the United States and are included as critical habitat for the northern right whale. Great South Channel: The GSC is a large funnel-shaped bathymetric feature at the southern extreme of the Gulf of Maine between Georges Bank and Cape Cod, MA. The GSC is one of the most used cetacean habitats off the northeastern United States (Kenney and Winn, 1986). The channel is bordered on the west by Cape Cod and Nantucket Shoals, and on the east by Georges Bank. The channel is generally deeper to the north and shallower to the south, where it narrows and rises to the continental shelf edge. To the north, the channel opens into several deepwater basins of the Gulf of Maine. The V-shaped 100-m isobath effectively delineates the steep drop-off from Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank to the deeper basins. The average depth is about 175 m, with a maximum depth of about 200 m to the north.
