Constand Viljoen on Tuesday [1 March] said he seriously doubted whether many right-aligned soldiers would be willing to collaborate with the government in its efforts to suppress "their own people. Gen Viljoen was reacting in a statement to State President F.W. de Klerk's "continued threats" to clamp down on Afrikaners with the help of the security forces. Mr. de Klerk warned in Parliament on Monday that the government would use every means at its disposal, including security forces to prevent any party from hindering any person in his democratic right to vote, or from hampering the elections. The Freedom Alliance has indicated it will boycott the elections. Gen. Viljoen said problems should not be solved through force but through negotiations and, if necessary, the elections could be postponed. "I would like to remind the state president that the South African Defence Force [SADF] of 1994 is not the SADF of 1984. Not in capacity, training or experience. Yet a very competent part of the defence force, the most competent part, consists of many of our supporters." The government and the African National Congress [ANC] had failed to grant the Freedom Alliance its right to self- determination, he said. "Through their arrogance and complete disregard for the just demands of the Alliance, they have created anger and frustration which is bound to burst out in the open. It is time they accept the responsibility for this anger. The correct way to solve these problems is not through force but through negotiations and, if necessary, to shift the election date. It will be justifiable in the light of the requirement for peace in this country." Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the government and the ANC "we are now threatened with force if we do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which amounts to terms of surrender." Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the government and the ANC, "we are now threatened with force if we do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which amounts to terms of surrender." The AVF's action thus far had been directed against the interim constitution that could result in a communist state, Gen. Viljoen said. "A soldier is loyal to the values and norms of his nation, of which the constitution is intended to be the product. Our people, being part of the defence force of this country ... realise that it (the interim constitution) does not represent their values. I sincerely doubt whether many of our soldiers, under these circumstances, will be willing to collaborate with the government in its intended efforts to suppress their own people." Gen. Viljoen wanted to know why the government was suddenly so keen to act against Afrikaners while, he said, the ANC continued with its "political cleansing campaign" countrywide. "Why does the government threaten to bomb us into submission by using our own security forces, while Azanian Peoples Liberation Army terrorists are granted indemnity for terror acts such as the St. James church massacre?"
