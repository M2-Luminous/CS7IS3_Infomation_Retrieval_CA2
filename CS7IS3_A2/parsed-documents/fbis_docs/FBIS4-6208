He said that the United Nations had declared Gorazde a safe haven and that no party could interfere there. Therefore, according to the resolution, the United Nations and NATO should take firm action against the Serbs for violating the United Nations resolution several times. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that the Foreign Affairs Department is continuously monitoring the situation in Gorazde and is making efforts to seek the release of five Indonesian military observers taken hostage by the Serbs. He said the worrying situation in Bosnia does not change Indonesia's wish to send health officials or other military observers to Bosnia.
