Kononenko under the rubric "There Was Such a Case": "SOS in the Iranian Sky"] [Text] Was our country selling weapons in the world market? The answer is unequivocal--yes, we were selling weapons and combat hardware. The only thing that cannot be understood is, why hide it from our own people? Quite a few articles have been published on this score in the open--but foreign (!)--press, citing figures that testify eloquently that the trade was profitable for us. And not only in a financial regard, but first and foremost in a political one as well. There, as they say, we were at the top. An entirely concrete instance compelled me to take up the once-forbidden topic. I found out about it in a fighter air regiment armed with MiG-29 aircraft. I was interested, in a conversation with an engineer of the regiment, how matters stood with the delivery of spare parts and units to the technical maintenance unit [TECh]. In reply he only spread his arms--a total back-up, he said. It turned out that the "back-up" dictated its own rules. Some equipment in good working order was removed from an interceptor that had just come into the TECh and installed on an aircraft on which the regular maintenance work was almost completed. The newly arrived fighter was expected to be "stuffed" with parts from another one waiting for preventive repair. And so it goes around and around from month to month. "We are selling MiGs abroad and sending the spare parts there, and we are left with nothing," summed up an officer in a fit of temper. It was not all that hard to find out that some pilots in the regiment have already flown to Iran several times, ferrying MiG-29s procured by that country to them. The fliers, true, got no pleasure from these overseas trips--there were too many of all sorts of conventions in making the ferry flights. The notorious "just-in-case" was in effect here as well. Everything was heading toward something bad happening. And it did not take long. The latest pair of fighters, piloted by deputy squadron commander Major A. Yermakov and senior pilot Captain S. Nikulin, headed off for Teheran at the end of September 1990. The pilots crossed the border of the USSR at a location coordinated in advance at the stipulated time. They then took a heading of 120ï¿½. It became clear that an instrument in the wingman's cockpit was steadily reading thirty degrees more than the lead pilot's. The latter unfortunately neglected the report of his subordinate on this, assured of his own infallibility. And when he finally thought about it, it was too late to make corrections. The nominal flight time had expired. Teheran should have shown up below, with the airfield a little further. But... Flight operations officer Major A. Berzan, who had arrived at the Mehrabat air base earlier to meet his countrymen, looked up at the sky in vain, listening for the characteristic drone of the fighters. He, after all, while controlling the fighters from the ground, had been left "blind"--radar monitoring of the air traffic in the area of the landing airfield was not being conducted for the pair of Soviet MiGs. The situation was clarified by a report over the air by the lead aircraft regarding a loss of orientation. Yermakov did not conceal the fact that his last hope in the prevailing situation was an escort aircraft, using which the possibility remained of reaching the end point of the route. The commander of the Iranian air base, however, did not fulfill his promise to help, and an F-5 that was in reserve for such a situation did not go up. The pair of MiG-29s loitered for forty minutes over Iranian territory. Nikulin suddenly lost sight of the lead aircraft on one of their turns, after which he independently made the decision to look for the nearest airfield. The wingman was lucky. The captain unexpectedly saw a runway right on his heading and landed safely--now with almost no fuel in the tanks--at the Savi airfield. "I was born lucky," he commented laconically at the time on his good fortune. But Yermakov, who had waited unsuccessfully for a guide aircraft, tried to land on a highway, but was hindered by the heavy vehicle traffic. Seeing the hopelessness of the situation, he ejected after an hour and fifty minutes of flying. "There was no damage on the ground. The pilot was unharmed," were the notations in the report. Maybe so, but we know how to give a good spanking. So they exhaustively investigated the sad results of a generally ordinary flight, and the measures taken, judging by the official documents, were the strictest. Major Yermakov was relieved of his duties and dismissed from flight work, and the "lucky" Nikulin was disciplined as well. All's well that ends well. Nonetheless, in my opinion, the materials from the investigation did not reflect the main causes that led to the flight accident. One of them was the unsatisfactory preparation and support of the ferry flight. The regimental command did not know the concrete date of the ferry flight to fill out the necessary documents until the very day of departure of the pilots for Moscow. The fliers (called back the day before from leave, by the way) were given just seven days instead of the required 20 to prepare for the performance of this task. Communications specialists had appealed more than once to higher-ups on the question of providing reliable radar control of the aircraft being transferred, but that was not resolved either. It turned out that the organizers of the flight had simply not stipulated in the agreement the necessity for the receiving side to turn on its tracking stations, or the amount of payment for their operation either... They economized themselves into disaster. And here is a fact that is quite interesting, although it was not taken into account in the final order. Captain Nikulin made a forced landing at the airfield at Savi, which was not even indicated on his flight map, and indeed could not have been, since it was published in 1966, with some changes on it dated 1981. It is incomprehensible why satellites are plying outer space--perhaps to photograph the license plates of cars... Yes, the times are such that we have to economize in everything. But in this case they cannot bring themselves to call this economy squandering by the true steward. Is that not why the pilots are so reluctant to agree to the commercial ferry flights for which the Russian state pays them in dollars? Not everything is for sale...
