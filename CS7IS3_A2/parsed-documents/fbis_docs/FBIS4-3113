Watanabe, a faction leader within the fractious LDP, told reporters, "I will give up my party membership as a matter of course." Watanabe, also a former deputy prime minister, has vowed to run in the Diet (Parliament) premiership election which will select the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation on April 8. On Friday, LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe and asked him not to leave the LDP, the largest single party in the Diet. The LDP lost its parliamentary majority after 38 years of rule last summer in the wake of major defections led by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata and former LDP Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa later formed Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), now one of the key components in the seven-party ruling coalition.
