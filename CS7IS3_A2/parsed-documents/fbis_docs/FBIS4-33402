This is the war cry of subversives who are against the "new and great definition" imparted from prison by Abimael Guzman Reinoso: "To struggle for the achievement of a Peace Accord." This is a clash between the "Leftist Annihilation Line (LLI)" headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, who is supported by the "cadres" (highly trained militants) who are not in prison, and the "Right-Wing Opportunist Line" (LOD), headed by Guzman, who is supported by the majority of SL members in prison. LOD members were the first to propose an end to the armed struggle in view of the severe blows sustained by the party leadership and of the need to end the bloodbath. Guzman has decided to hold a second SL congress so the "new and great decision" will be adopted by all combatants to thus recover party authority and avoid internal party divisions. Ramirez Durand, however, has not remained idle. In February, LLI members were able to get the SL Central Committee to hold a meeting in Ayacucho. They were not only able to restructure the main party leadership organization with acting members elected during the first congress in 1988 but also ousted Guzman and all of his close advisers from the organization by adopting the following agreements: A) Neither the war nor the party can be led from prison because combatants behind bars are inoperative and disconnected from reality. This is the reason for adopting the slogan: "An imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist." B) Those who favor a peace agreement are violating basic Marxist-Leninist-Maoist principles, particularly the "Gonzalo Thought" principles, and, therefore, isolating themselves and, by their own initiative, deserting the party. They also reasserted an agreement already approved during two other previous high-ranking meetings (Central Committee "working sessions" of a "resolutory nature" in December 1992 and August 1993) that obviously were not attended by Guzman: to continue "the people's war." Public attention is again centered on those SL members out of prison headed by Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," because of recent terrorist actions (car bombs, an "armed stoppage," an attack on a section of the oil pipeline, and armed propaganda). Since the disclosure of Guzman's letters to President Alberto Fujimori and details on the peace agreement negotiations, the government has only disclosed details on the movements of Guzman's faction and its leaders but has concealed the reactions of Maoists out of prison regarding the conduct of their "leadership and authority." It is now known that LLI members, also known by their LOD enemies as "traitors" and "military goons," did not resign themselves to accepting Guzman's capitulation. They allege that the videos are a sham, the letters false, and the agreement a hoax with the ultimate objective of assassinating "President Gonzalo" and destroying the armed struggle. With this excuse, they proceeded to restructure the entire party apparatus. They have filled vacant posts left by their leaders and dead or imprisoned "cadres" and resumed the implementation of plans approved by Guzman at the Third Central Committee Plenum meeting in August 1992, just a few weeks before his arrest. That is why the government strategy of strengthening the leadership of Guzman and the arrested Central Committee members and presenting them as the real SL representatives (recent intelligence reports recommend breaking the isolation of Guzman and his aides, allowing them to visit other inmates or vice versa to allow them to intensify their propaganda campaign to promote a split in the SL organization) will have to be reconsidered given that the organization has begun to be represented by the LLI. To begin with, the government must resume the talks, which have been paralyzed for the past seven months according to LOD leaflets. Guzman needs new arguments to attract a new public--the "glorious combat trenches" and the inoperative militants currently have very little or no influence on the course of the war--because the same speech for imprisoned SL members and those who are operational outside has not yielded results. Statements like "a golden page was turned with the people's war; we are now beginning a stage of bloodless war that means politics without bloodshed; a bloody war is politics with bloodshed," can affect an SL member burdened by the humiliating prospect of being able to enjoy sunlight for only 30 minutes a day for the rest of his life. Such statements do not have the same effect on a "military commander" who, for example, conducts a column and has seen his subordinates fall precisely in the name of the "people's war" that, according to Guzman's new position, does not mean "giving up or abandoning the revolution but to continue fighting our new conditions." They also will have no effect on an Upper Huallaga column that lives from the "protection money" it charges drug traffickers. The deadlock of the talks between the government representatives and the imprisoned SL spokesmen can be explained by the conditions demanded by the SL, which have annoyed President Fujimori, who said the only result he expects from the agreement is "unconditional surrender." LA REPUBLICA had access to the documents the SL members circulate inside the prisons, which contain 15 points divided into four sections as an "introduction" and 11 other points listed as "basic proposals." These "guidelines for basic documents," that is, the Maoists' expectations of the benefits they expect to obtain after laying down their weapons, do not correspond at all to an "unconditional surrender." By granting the following concessions: "To cease the people's war that began on 17 May 1980 in its four wartime expressions of guerrilla actions (selective annihilation, sabotage, political agitation, and armed propaganda and guerrilla warfare), to self-dissolve the People's Guerrilla Army, to destroy their weapons and combat means, and also to dissolve the Popular and Grass-Roots Committees that support the RPND [Republica Popular de Nueva Democracia--New Democracy People's Republic]," Guzman intends to obtain: A) the end of antisubversive operations by security forces; B) the release of all the men and women accused or sentenced for terrorist actions and the improvement of the prison conditions as long as the release process lasts; C) ending all trials for terrorist crimes; the opening of new court proceedings; and the nullification of all subpoenas and arrest warrants submitted against combatants, collaborators, and sympathizers both in Peru and abroad; D) ending the government campaign "conducted in the country and abroad against the people's war, the party, and its members and sympathizers"; E) reinstating the legal status of SL members, including those living abroad; F) returning the SL "museum" seized from Abimael Guzman in 1990, including the video in which he is seen dancing a Greek dance and the books from his personal library; G) allowing an "honorable" burial for Augusta La Torre Carrasco, "Comrade Norah," whose body currently is buried in a secret tomb; H) promulgating a general amnesty law "that will reconcile the nation, without victors or vanquished, without reprisals or shame"; Pardoning all SL members, releasing them from jail, and letting them go free is not exactly what the government had in mind with Guzman's surrender, particularly because he does not believe this agreement is tantamount to a defeat or a surrender but "a period between an end of a stage in the International Proletariat Revolution and the future Great Wave itself. This justifies the general political withdrawal. We have started to manage the general military withdrawal as a result of the general political withdrawal, which is complex and difficult but necessary to develop other forms of struggle under new conditions." Guzman and his followers simply believe that the people's war will continue but under different forms of struggle. These new forms of struggle will establish the conditions for the advent of that "future Great Wave." At the other extreme there are Ramirez Durand and his people, who reasserted their leadership at the February Central Committee meeting, during which they achieved several agreements to guarantee the armed struggle's continuation. Some of them are: "To struggle to impose Maoism as the new, third, and superior stage of Marxism; to tenaciously combat imperialism, revisionism, and international reactionary movements; to reassert the principle of revolutionary violence as the universal law achieved during the people's war; to work among the masses in and for the people's war; to struggle to vindicate power; to incorporate the masses in the people's war; (and to organize) the arming of the masses." The 14 years of armed struggle, therefore, are taking by surprise an organization whose combatants out of prison have started the reorganization of their party leadership and continues to implement a guerrilla campaign interrupted in view of the arrests that were made and that has isolated their "prisoners of war" (including Guzman and its Central Committee). They are considered nonoperational cadres unable to lead the party and the war. In view of this, the SL radical group has been able to describe the peace agreement as a desperate proposal made by combatants who find themselves pressured by the prospects of life imprisonment or, in the best of cases, who will be in jail for at least many decades. Everything indicates that the government will continue to strengthen Guzman's authority and undermine Ramirez Durand's and his real power over the combatants out of prison. Under these circumstances, "Feliciano" will increase the levels of violence to obtain more attention and recover the war initiative. From now on, should antiterrorist forces ask whether or not they support the peace agreement when they arrest SL members? If they say they support it, should they let them go free? This is one of the several contradictions of the new course of the war. Before, a jailed Maoist was a key figure in the armed struggle, a fortunate member of a "luminous combat trench." Nowadays, to be jailed is tantamount to being buried alive. A jailed Maoist is the same as a dead Maoist. The dead have little or no influence on the war's course.
