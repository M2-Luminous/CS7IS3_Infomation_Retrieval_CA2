"My schedule is full," the official said in statements published Tuesday in the influential newspaper EL TIEMPO. According to media reports from Cuba, the two countries will sign a trade agreement in Havana next April at a ceremony which Santos will attend. "My visit to Cuba is still not definite", the Colombian trade minister said in explaining that "the agreement only revises the partial agreement Colombia has with Cuba within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)." According to Cuban versions, a bilateral delegation recently studied the treaty. It reviewed tariffs and analyzed a list of more than 800 products to be included in the document. Santos' denial was made within the framework of an offensive against Cuba by local right-wing groups as a result of the release of information on the presumed presence of Colombian guerrilla commanders in Cuba. The Santa Fe de Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO published this story shortly after Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule returned from Cuba and announced Colombia would sell between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island. Colombia and Cuba renewed diplomatic relations on 28 October after a 12-year suspension given the Cuban Government's presumed interference in Colombia's internal affairs.
