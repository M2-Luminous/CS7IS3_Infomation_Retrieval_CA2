The quarrel, which has set Britain and Spain against their 10 EU partners, is blocking the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the Union by a target date of January 1 next year. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there had been no movement in negotiations Tuesday and that no acceptable compromise was in sight. "We're not moving. It's a position of principle," he said over Spain's refusal to allow any weakening of its ability to block decisions when new members are accepted. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: "I am not very hopeful of reaching an answer today. ... So far we do not have on the table a proposal satisfactory to Britain." Earlier the Belgian, Dutch, German, French and Luxembourg ministers, who oppose the British-Spanish stand, all expressed doubt that the quarrel could be overcome at Tuesday's meeting -- the fourth in so many weeks. Dutch diplomats said 10 of the EU's 12 countries had hardened their refusal against compromise to satisfy the British and Spanish demands. On the sidelines of the meeting, Swedish European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel warned that the dispute could affect the chances of the Swedish electorate accepting entry into the Union. The four applicants, which completed negotiations to join the EU earlier this month, must all hold referendums before the end of the year to ratify their membership accords. Asked whether the EU quarrel could turn the Swedish electorate against EU membership, Dinkelspiel said: "Yes, certainly" -- an answer which diplomats say applies equally to the other three applicants. Commenting on Tuesday's meeting, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said: "Nobody is moving. Better no accord than a bad accord." Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement of the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger countries to block decisions they do not like. The Spanish want to maintain the power of three countries to block unpopular decisions. The British want to brake the accelerating shift of power from EU governments to a central authority. The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshold of blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of 90 to take account of the incoming members. But this would weaken the ability of the EU's bigger countries to block controversial decisions, because a coalition of one small and two large countries could no longer make their "no" stick. The issue involves a balance of power between north and south, between big countries and small, between free traders and protectionists. Prominent members of the European Parliament have warned the Euro-Parliament will not ratify the enlargement accords if concessions are made to Britain and Spain. Euro-MP Jean Cot said Tuesday: "The British will be to blame if the enlargement fails. They want to widen Europe but they are trying to weaken it too." Cot is the leader of the Socialist group, the largest bloc in the Euro-Parliament. "Douglas Hurd is playing with fire," he said, adding that the parliament would accept no compromise to satisfy the British or Spanish. But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in the four applicants. "We intend to work until we get a satisfactory result," he said. If there is no agreement Tuesday, the issue is likely to dominate a meeting of the EU foreign ministers at Ioannina, in northwest Greece, Saturday and Sunday.
