[Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have concluded a first phase. There is stability; inflation is well under control, and we have access to international credits, and conditions have been created--it is not that broad exonerations have been granted--so that certain sectors may contribute to vitalizing the economy. In 1994, we are going to give priority attention to reactivating the economy. Two sectors can contribute to this right now: the construction and tourism sectors. There is good development already in the agriculture, fishery, and mining sectors. [Unidentified reporter] Will there be cabinet changes after the promulgation of the Constitution, or will all the ministers be maintained? [Fujimori] I evaluate the situation every six months, but you have seen that all of the ministers have managed well the government programs. [Reporter] Could there be some changes? [Fujimori] This possibility can never be discarded, but I repeat: The ministers have done an excellent job. [Reporter] The general sales tax [IGV] will be maintained at 18 percent? [Fujimori] The IGV will be maintained, with the exceptions established by the Constituent Congress, especially for foodstuffs. [Reporter] The government will not object the law approved by Congress and will promulgate it? [sentence as heard] [Fujimori] We fully agree with its essence. [end recording]
