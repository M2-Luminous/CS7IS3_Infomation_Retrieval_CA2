Several days after Slovak President Michal Kovac's address in parliament, considered to be the start of the process which led to the dismissal of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet, 17 district council chairmen and two government commissioners signed a statement accusing the president of "gross insult to parliamentary democracy." They said Kovac deliberately destabilized the political scene and discredited Meciar's government in his speech. "The district council chairmen who signed the statement violated the professional honor and committed a serious offense incompatible with the exercising of high administrative functions," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan Simko told journalists today after the cabinet meeting. Moravcik's government believed that after taking the office it provided these district council chairmen enough time to apologies to President Kovac and to reassess their stand, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said. "This is a moral appeal and not an appeal for political reasons," he added. Asked if controls of district councils' activities could be expected Simko said that the government had ordered internal controls in all branches including the central state administration bodies.
