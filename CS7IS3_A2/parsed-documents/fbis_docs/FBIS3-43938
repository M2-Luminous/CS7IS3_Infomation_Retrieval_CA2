Presidential aides said they had received reports that a small group of blacks pelted a larger group of National Party [NP] supporters in Kokosi township. A NP media bus scheduled to stop there was diverted to Potchefstroom where Mr de Klerk addressed two meetings. No immediate comment could be obtained from Western Transvaal police and NP aides said they had no further information. Mr de Klerk was received warmly by an audience of mostly first-year students at the University of Potchefstroom, and applauded when he addressed a meeting of NP organisers in the town's banquet hall. The president's Western Transvaal tour, amid tight security, will continue to Saturday. He was scheduled to make three stops in Klerksdorp and visit a Ventersdorp farm on Friday. Mr de Klerk told the Potchefstroom students to forget polls which showed 70 per cent support for the African National Congress, [ANC] saying the NP's own surveys showed the party could win the election if it could garner the support of undecided voters. A small section of the students hissed briefly when he started his address. Mr de Klerk said the NP did not have self defence units as did the ANC and which ran wild and intimidated the public. At the banquet hall, he called on np organisers to alert the NP to cases of intimidation so that guilty parties could be charged.
