Take notice that on October 21, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission (NorAm), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;31&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery tap for service to ARKLA, a division of NorAm Energy Corp. (ARKLA), in Logan County, Arkansas, under NorAm's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000 et al. pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. NorAm proposes to install the tap on its Line BT&hyph;14 for ARKLA to make deliveries to a single customer in Logan County. It is stated that deliveries through the proposed tap would be 1 MMBtu equivalent on a peak day and approximately 85 MMBtu equivalent on an annual basis. It is estimated that the cost of construction would be $1,400, for which NorAm would be reimbursed by ARKLA. It is asserted that NorAm has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers and that NorAm's tariff does not prohibit the addition of new delivery points. It is further asserted that the deliveries would be within ARKLA's certificated entitlement from NorAm. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protect to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
