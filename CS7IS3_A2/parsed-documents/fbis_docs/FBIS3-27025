This has disrupted the normal order of the compact disk industry and infringed upon the interests of copyright holders. Through investigation, this reporter has discovered that in 1992 China had only one CD production factory, the Xianke Corporation in Shenzhen. Later, there were three factories and three production lines. By the end of 1993, however, the figures jumped to 25 factories and 30 production lines. What impact do 30 production lines have on the CD market? In 1992 the total annual CD sales in China were around 3 million, but a Xianke CD production line in Shenzhen alone had an annual production capacity of 5 million CDs. We can thus see that even if the domestic CD sales market grows several fold, a few CD production factories can sufficiently saturate the market. What is terrible, however, is that in less than 18 months 10 times as many production lines have emerged, with a full-load production capacity of nearly 100 million CDs. Moreover, new CD production lines are still being imported. In March 1993 the State Planning Commission and the department concerned studied the issue of importing CD production lines. Taking into consideration the domestic market demands at that time, the commission explicitly stipulated that before the country's overall development plan for CD players and laser disk players is promulgated, no department or locality may approve the construction of new factories and the expansion of existing production capacity. After the planning commission document was transmitted to the lower levels, some localities and departments, in total disregard of the document provisions, blindly approved the construction of CD production factories, with the result that CD output far outstripped domestic market demands. What was especially serious was that some unscrupulous overseas businessmen have taken advantage of the opportunity to make an inroad and engage in large-scale pirating activities. This has not only disrupted the domestic video market, but also the international disk market. The Shanghai office of the International Disk Industrial Association recently officially brought a suit in the Shanghai Municipal Intermediate People's Court against a certain Taiwan businessman called Hsu for carrying out illegal pirating activities on the mainland. Hsu was tracked down by the Taiwan authorities for carrying out illegal disk pirating activities in Taiwan. Pending trial, Hsu entered China in early 1993 and engaged in illegal CD copying activities. While serving as deputy general manager of business at Baodie Laser and Electronics Company Limited, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, he provided the company with the masters of programs produced by the International Disk Industrial Association, which has the right over the programs, and copied 121,000 CDs in 35 varieties. He also accepted a processing task for Huadie Guangdian Company Limited, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Hangzhou, and produced 18,000 CDs in 14 varieties. Most of the copied and pirated CDs have entered the international market. At present, the issue of illegally importing CD production lines has drawn the close attention of the relevant government department. The department deems it necessary to immediately stop importing CD production lines from abroad and exercise strict and necessary standardized management over CD factories currently in production and operation. Otherwise, the factories will face the risk of bankruptcy and it will be impossible to curb piracy in some domestic markets.
