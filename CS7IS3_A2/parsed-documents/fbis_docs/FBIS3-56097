[Gamov] Georgiy Grigoryevich, are you in the hot seat? [Lukava] I certainly am.... [Gamov] When you opened the Duma session many people drew attention to your slight Georgian accent... [Lukava] I am indeed a Georgian by nationality. [Gamov] Since Stalin not a single Georgian has held such a high post in Russia. [Lukava] To be frank, I am very calm when it comes to such idle talk. [Gamov] Georgiy Grigoryevich, forgive me, but it is said in the corridors that Zhirinovskiy specially nominated Lukava, a member of an "alien party," as a deputy on "his own" list. [Lukava] Certainly not... Although I am in reality a member of the Russian Communist Party I was nominated to the Duma by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia on the grounds that in July last year I took part in that party's scientific and practical conference at which I delivered a report entitled "Spiritual Readiness and Its Role in Overcoming the Crisis." But having found myself in the chair I am trying to be absolutely impartial and I am giving all deputies irrespective of party allegiance the opportunity to speak. [Lukava ends] Yesterday several deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava surrender his seat to a more competent deputy. But Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, from a microphone, gave the provisional speaker categorical instructions not to go anywhere, to turn off the microphones, and not to allow anyone onto the platform and if necessary to "call the militia."
