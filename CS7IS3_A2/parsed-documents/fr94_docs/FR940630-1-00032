FR940630-1-00032 FR940630-1-00009 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;6 Fire Protection Engineering AGENCY: Public Buildings Service (PBS), GSA. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The General Services Administration has proposed a regulation to further define the term equivalent level of safety (59 FR 26768, May 24, 1994). The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 amended the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to require sprinklers or an equivalent level of safety in certain types of Federal Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing units. This regulation establishes certain criteria which alternative approaches must satisfy to be judged equivalent. These criteria have been selected to provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act. DATES: To ensure consideration, comments must be received at the address, as provided below, no later than 5:00 p.m. on July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail comments to the following address: General Services Administration, Safety and Environmental Management Division (PMS), Federal Fire Safety Act Comments, 18th & F Streets, NW, Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald G. Bathurst, (202) 501&hyph;1271. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: At the request of the Department of Defense, the period for public comments on the proposed rule further defining an equivalent level of safety is being extended. The public will have until July 25, 1994, to comment on the regulation. A survey of individuals involved in fire protection, conducted by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, indicated a number of people were unaware of the proposed rule and the request for public comments. A thirty-day extension of the public comment period should provide sufficient time for interested individuals to respond. Consideration of all substantive issues is important is ensuring that the rule reflects sound state-of-the-art fire protection engineering principles, fosters science and technological advancements, and provides reasonable flexibility. Dated: June 22, 1994. David L. Bibb, Acting Commissioner, Public Buildings Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15898 Filed 6&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;23&hyph;M
