He handles the last refuge of subversion and the natural habitat of drug traffickers: the San Martin and Huanuco Departments. This is an explosive zone, but he is not worried, because in some ways he knows the situation: "El Cholo," as he is known, was the political-military chief of Cerro de Pasco before being assigned to Upper Huallaga. Although he did not elaborate, when asked about accusations that the Army is linked with trafficking, the general said he was inflexible over detecting and sanctioning any cases of immorality in his institution. If there were any doubts about his intentions, a few days after taking over the Huallaga Front command he sanctioned an officer. It was a warning for everyone. It is incredible but Rodriguez Riveros is ready to show -- papers in hand -- that not a single light plane has entered the Upper Huallaga zone so far this year. Daily DEA reports confirm this. He said that although the Army was responsible for coordinating the struggle against trafficking, he was not in charge of direct interventions. The police have that responsibility. Today that situation has changed. In October 1993, a decree was issued stating that in emergency zones the Army fights subversion and drug trafficking. All antinarcotics operations by any of the forces in Upper Huallaga (National Police, Air Force, or DEA) must be cleared in advance with the Huallaga Front commander. No operation is authorized without Army coordination. "The control of drug trafficking is an objective today," said Gen. Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros during this interview that was arranged in principle as "a conversation," but which thanks to his kindness was authorized for publication. [Chavez] Army members have been accused of maintaining contacts with drug traffickers. What is your opinion on these charges? [Rodriguez] The commander reacted positively. Last year we had three inspections. This year we will have four. Perhaps out of fear, mistakes used to occur internally, within the units. Each commander had his policy and made his own decisions on penalties against his troops and on how to correct wrongdoings. This policy changed in 1992 and 1993. Officers are no longer reported to their commanders within the larger units; they are reported to the Army Inspector's Office and then to the Military Justice Supreme Council. [Chavez] How many cases are being investigated in the Huallaga Front? [Rodriguez] We already have investigated 15 cases. These cases are duly documented and ready for sentencing. The sentence will vary according to the degree of participation: They may be removed from the Army, placed at the disposal of the commander, retired, or referred to civilian courts. [Chavez] Have you reported any cases since you were appointed as the Huallaga Front political and military chief? [Rodriguez] Yes. I reported a case 24 hours after I discovered it. The problem was an old one, but we detected it. Our commander is aware of the case and documents are being prepared for his trial. [Chavez] Who is he? [Rodriguez] An officer. We caught him in the simplest of ways. He was attending a meeting outside the base and we looked for him because he left the base. During the investigation we learned that the officer "met" with a group (of drug traffickers). The rest followed this lead. I am unable to give you his name because he is still on trial. Let us just say this was a message for all officers assigned to the Upper Huallaga front. I think we have all come here with the same spirit: To work for our fatherland and to work for our institution. [Chavez] In other words, a war with a loud warning does not kill people. [Rodriguez] That is right. [Chavez] How do you detect an officer involved in trafficking? Only through the inspectors? [Rodriguez] There are various ways. One is through his lifestyle. With our salaries we cannot have certain luxuries. These people are also known for the way they talk. We are not isolated from society. We participate in all social activities and social meetings. Another way to detect them is by the way they brag about the money they have. This prompts us to investigate. [Chavez] General, is this a certain "esprit de corps," seeking to cover up mistakes made by some officer? [Rodriguez] This command has never allowed that to happen for ethical reasons. We will not cover up for anyone. Our commanders understand that trafficking is a scourge we must eliminate. That was the reason behind the law authorizing us to directly intervene in the fight to eliminate trafficking. [Chavez] What can you do to prevent further corruption? [Rodriguez] It is very difficult to be inside every officer's head. We are implementing measures, for example, by rotating duties. We think it is harmful for an officer to stay too long at one particular base. The social interaction with people in the zone could make him feel secure and might tempt him to get involved in illegal activities. [Chavez] What can you tell us about the illegal drug trade? Is it moving somewhere else? [Rodriguez] We have information that trafficking activities are gradually moving toward Loreto and Madre de Dios, that is, outside San Martin and Huanuco. We no longer see opulence in shopping malls. We see abandoned towns. Tocache and Uchiza used to be trafficking centers, but today these towns lack the economic resources to continue to develop. [Chavez] So trafficking is moving to Loreto and Madre de Dios? [Rodriguez] Yes, at least according to the information we have. We work day and night to detect light planes. [Chavez] With what results? [Rodriguez] Results have been negative lately. They no longer come to this area. If they do, it is not like in the past, that is, three to four times a day. They come once a month and run the risk of being caught. [Chavez] How can you be sure if the Army does not have the adequate technological means to detect light planes flying at night, which is when traffickers move? [Rodriguez] We work with the DEA. They can detect planes with their radar in Yurimaguas. They transmit the information to the Huallaga Front and we re-transmit it to the base closest to where the plane might land. [Chavez] Does that mean the DEA tells you the exact moment a small plane enters Upper Huallaga? [Rodriguez] Yes, it takes us an average of two minutes to learn about it. [Chavez] Do you depend on information supplied by the DEA? [Rodriguez] That's right. [Chavez] How often do you receive DEA reports? [Rodriguez] Daily. [Chavez] How many small planes enter the region daily? [Rodriguez] Currently, none enters this region. This is why we are seeking other possible routes (ground and river routes) for drug trafficking. [Chavez] The people, however, say that they see small planes entering the region. [Rodriguez] Well, they may say planes arrive here all the time. It may have occurred before. [Chavez] According to your reports, when did the last plane enter the region? [Rodriguez] We do not have this data. [Chavez] Are you telling me that so far this year no plane has entered the Upper Huallaga region? [Rodriguez] That's right. [Chavez] Are you sure? [Rodriguez] I repeat, according to our reports, no plane has entered the region. They are probably seeking other routes -- probably along rivers or roads. In the 90 days we have been here, no flights or large shipments have been reported. [Chavez] Do you think the Intelligence Service is mistaken, general? [Rodriguez] I don't think so. [Chavez] What do you believe is the main problem in 1994: The Shining Path or trafficking? [Rodriguez] They go together. In the field of subversion two areas interest us: Sisa and Tingo Maria. Although we have temporarily neutralized Sisa, we want to clearly identify the group to be able to dismantle it. This, however, does not apply to Tingo Maria in Leoncio Prado Province, where there are permanent clashes. Both sides have casualties. It will take some time to resolve. The problem will not disappear in the near future, but we are sure we will finally eliminate them. [Chavez] President Fujimori said in Colombia that the millions of dollars invested by the United States in the antinarcotics effort have yielded no results. What do you think of that? [Rodriguez] Considering the actions so far, I could not comment on the issue. I have been here for too short a time. Talking with the people who live here, however, I have learned that they believe funds should not be allocated to the antinarcotics effort but to the coca replacement program. Rice, yerbaluisa, corn, and grapes are the most promising products in the region. Grapes, for example, are harvested three times in a year here while near the coast they are harvested only once. This occurs at the Cumbaza Valley, where grapes are harvested three times a year. That is why coca is not planted there. [Chavez] Do you believe that in addition to being an economic, police, and moral problem, coca growing is also a social problem? [Rodriguez] Yes, but this problem can be solved by helping the most needy people and by bringing together all institutions in an effort to find solutions to their problems. Those who told us they were ignorant and as a result they grew coca can now improve by growing more profitable products. [Chavez] Do you believe peasants grow coca because they are ignorant? [Rodriguez] Not because they are ignorant. I believe that at a certain moment they were pressed to do it and that for a while it was the most profitable crop. [Chavez] What about poppies? [Rodriguez] We have been patrolling the forest for 30 days looking for the sites where poppies were allegedly being grown. We have found nothing, but we will continue to look. [passage omitted]
