FR940617-0-00013 FR940617-0-00003 Several federal agencies cited concern for the application of the FPPA to land acquisitions by these agencies, providing temporary, intermediate ownership by the Federal Government such as through foreclosure, the acquisition of assets of an insolvent thrift institution or through forfeiture in criminal law enforcement proceedings. They expressed concern for potential conflicts between their statutory responsibilities to obtain prompt, high value disposal of these assets and the analysis procedures required under the FPPA. The definition of ``Federal program'' in the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(4), extends the coverage of the FPPA to ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.'' If an agency determines that its program does not result in a sufficient acquisition of legal or equitable title by the United States to characterize the property as ``Federal land or facilities,'' then the agency may exclude such land through its own policies and procedures for implementing the FPPA. However, the Department has determined that an interpretive clarification of the term ``Federal land and facilities'' as used in the definition of ``Federal programs'' covered by the FPPA would be useful. In that regard, the Department believes that the use of the word ``Federal'' to modify the words ``land and facilities'' indicates an intent by Congress to focus the scope of federal programs covered by the FPPA to lands and facilities acquired or managed by federal agencies as necessary proprietary elements of federal programs, such as national forests, national parks, or military bases. The use of the modifier ``Federal'' is significant; if the intent was to include the acquisition, management, or disposal of any land or facility by a federal agency, regardless of the purpose of the use of the land or facility, Congress could have omitted the modifier and simply stated, ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of lands and facilities.'' Accordingly, the Department has amended the definition of ``Federal program'' contained in ยง658.2(c) to clarify that, for the purposes of the FPPA and these regulations, the phrase ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of federal lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, managed, or were used by a federal agency specifically in support of a federal activity or program. It does not include lands or facilities that are acquired, managed, or disposed of by a federal agency as the incidental result of actions by that agency through which the agency has temporary ownership or custody of the land or facility, such as acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes, the exercise of conservationship or receivership authority, or the exercise of civil or criminal law enforcement forfeiture or seizure authority.
