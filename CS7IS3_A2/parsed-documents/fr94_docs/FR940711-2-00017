FR940711-2-00017 FR940711-2-00007 Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180&hyph;1 1994 May 31 Announcing the Secure Hash Standard Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. Name of Standard: Secure Hash Standard. Category of Standard: Computer Security. Explanation: This Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm, SHA&hyph;1, for computing a condensed representation of a message or a data file. When a message of any length <2 64 bits is input, the SHA&hyph;1 produces a 160-bit output called a message digest. The message digest can then be input to the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which generates or verifies the signature for the message (see Figure 1). Signing the message digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the message digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm must be used by the verifier of a digital signature as was used by the creator of the digital signature. The SHA&hyph;1 is called secure because it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a given message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest. Any change to a message in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to verify. SHA&hyph;1 is a technical revision of SHA (FIPS 180). A circular left shift operation has been added to the specifications in section 7, line b, page 9 of FIPS 180 and its equivalent in section 8, line c, page 10 of FIPS 180.* This revision improves the security provided by this standard. The SHA&hyph;1 is based on principles similar to those used by Professor Ronald L. Rivest of MIT when designing the MD4 message: *Modification In Section 7 of [1] (page 9), the line which reads (b) For t=16 to 79 let W t = W t-3 XOR W t-8 XOR W t-14 XOR W t-16 . is to be replaced by (b) For t=16 to 79 let W t = S 1 (W t-3 XOR W t-8 XOR W t-14 XOR W t-16 . where S 1 is a left circular shift by one bit as defined in Section 3 of [1] (page 6), namely S 1 (X) = (X < <1) v (X > > 31).
