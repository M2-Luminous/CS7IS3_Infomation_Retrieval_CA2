The king, however, says that his Chinese doctors have prohibited him from going out of the royal palace to visit various provinces because of his health. In his previous message he said that he planned to visit some provinces in May, after his arrival in Cambodia on 8 April; however, these visits have to be canceled because of his doctors' instructions. The previous message also reveals that the king also plans to mark the 90th anniversary of his late mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak; meet with the royal government; and receive guests and various credentials, and so on. The king notes that Chinese doctors have suggested that he return to Beijing in May to continue the treatment of his bone marrow cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The Prince Father, however, insisted that he wanted to stay in Cambodia for two months saying that he seems to have recovered his strength. The prince says in a moving sentence that "If I am still alive and my health gets better, I want to visit Kratie, Pursat, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, and Koh Kong Provinces." Since the king cannot visit the provinces, he has invited delegations from over 10 provinces to see him and the royal consort for about an hour at the Tevea Vinichhai Pavilion in the royal palace. He has also asked that careful protection be given to avoid incidents when these provincial delegations travel to Phnom Penh.
