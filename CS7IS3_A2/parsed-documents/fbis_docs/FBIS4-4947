In his letter dated 23 March, which was opened to the public by the United Nations on 4 April, Minister Kim threatened that the Korean peninsula would again face such unfortunate history as that of the 1950's if the UN Security Council yields to U.S. insistence on adopting a resolution unfavorable to North Korea. In the letter, Minister Kim also said that North Korea would resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it is possible for North Korea to adhere to its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was made last year. In March, when the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team reported that the recent inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities was insufficient, the United States asked member nations of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to adopt a UNSC resolution urging North Korea to allow additional inspections.
