Industrial enterprises are called upon to further readjust their production patterns to meet market demand. As a result, large industrial groups will be formed and overseas economic contacts will be greatly enhanced, the officials said. The city is now making efforts to promote some of its pillar industries, such as automobiles, program-controlled telephones, facilities for power stations and computers. A number of leading state enterprises, especially some chemical firms, will co-operate with established international companies to turn out high-tech products with great market potential. Statistics show that last year the total industrial output of Shanghai increased by 18 percent over the previous year after three years of two-digit growth. The growth rate has been set above 15 percent this year.
