This was no surprise for Japan, but we are concerned about the U.S. decision. However, Japan must have an eye on the real substance of the bilateral trade imbalance. From here Japan may do nothing, or engage in an anti-U.S. trade war by taking action to counter the Super 301 provision. If Japan were, however, to take either of these courses of action, it would damage its national interests. As a matter of fact, the U.S. decision conflicts with GATT's principle of "multilateralism." Even the European Union (EU) is questioning the U.S. decision. But this does not justify Japan's current attitude toward the trade imbalance issue. The nature of the trade imbalance has substantially changed. We must pay attention to the following points: 1) Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world currently amounts to $100 billion per year, and this is too much trading profit for one nation. So the problem is rather more than simply the $60-billion trade imbalance with the United States. 2) Unlike the economic background to the 1985 Plaza agreement, Germany now has a deficit trade balance and Japan is the only country producing a huge trade surplus today. 3) Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the United States is reviewing the significance of the Japan-U.S. alliance. Not only the United States, but many other countries are beginning to consider economic issues are as critical as security affairs. While economic frictions used be settled more easily under the pretext of "the need for a healthy alliance" to cope with the Cold War, this is no longer true. The Clinton Administration is the United States' first post-Cold War administration, and its Japan policy is obviously different from those of preceding U.S. Administrations. It appears Japan is too dependent on the alliance of the Cold War era. In fact, the unilateral actions of the United States raise some questions. The U.S. demand for "numerical targets," for example, does not look reasonable. However, to neglect the U.S. demand is to remain idle despite the seriousness of the situation. Japan's idle attitude toward the trade issue may result in further appreciation of the yen rate. Even if the United States imposes economic sanctions against Japan according to the Super 301 provision, they will not redress the trade imbalance between the two nations. After all, the huge trade surplus and the high level of the yen rate will remain unchanged until Japan takes action. If Japan makes antagonistic counter moves against the United States, it would be as good as declaring a "trade war." At least, that would be the reaction of the market. If the market views Japan's countermoves as the nation's "resolve to stick to idleness," it will be the market that takes over readjustment of Japan-U.S. relations. If that happens, the foreign exchange market would be driven into confusion, and Japan would be isolated on the international political scene. Neither idleness, therefore, nor countermoves should be Japan's response. It may be possible for Japan to file a complaint to GATT against the unilateral action taken by the United States. Yet, taking into account how Japan's trade surplus affects the world economy, such a complaint would never be justified by Japan's current trade policy. Fortunately, the United States has decided to prepare several months for negotiations on whether or not sanctions should be imposed. As a trump card, the Super 301 provision will be played slowly, but in earnest.
