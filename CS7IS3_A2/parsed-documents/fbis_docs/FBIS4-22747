Shandar, correspondent: "It's Already Time for Sowing, But Sunflower Seeds are Still in Storage Facilities"] [Text] The apricot trees have begun to bloom, and that is a sure sign that it's time to sow sunflowers. But their seeds are not being bought by collective and state agricultural enterprises, nor by private farmers: They simply do not have the money to do that. Approximately 60 tonnes of such seeds are in the storage facilities of the Kholmskyy and Hlavan KSP's [collective agricultural enterprises] in Artsyzkyy Rayon and other farms, which have been growing the Odessa 122, Odessa 123, and Odessa 249 hybrids from the Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute on a contractual basis. There are enough seeds here to sow 12,000 hectares. On some collective and state agricultural enterprises located in Zaporozhye, Poltava, and Lugansk oblasts the persons in charge intend to sow their fields with random varieties and hybrids, while keeping their own high-quality, enhanced hybrid varieties in storage facilities. The agricultural producers have been compelled to knowingly take the path of a shortfall in the harvest by from four to five quintals per hectare. That is the added amount of the yield from the hybrids from the Plant-breeding and Genetic Institute in Odessa. An even more alarming situation is evolving with regard to the native forms of hybrids stored in sections here. The Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute has received requests to obtain 50 tonnes of such seeds, but only about 10 tonnes have been purchased. These will be enough to sow no more than 2,000 hectares within a total need for 10,000 hectares. "Because of this situation," says Doctor of Biological Sciences V. Burlov, chief of the Institute's Plant-Breeding and Vegetable-Oil Crops Section, "as early as next year Ukraine will not have enough high-yield, high-quality hybrid seeds for commercial sowings." Therefore, we could be faced with a situation whereby--because of our present-day poverty and short-sightedness--we will be without vegetable oil as early as next year. In order to prevent this from happening, staffers of the Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute, along with its choice seed organizations, are proposing that farms and private farmers accept seeds on credit. This would be in exchange--on the basis of mutually agreeable conditions--for a portion of the crop after it is harvested. In particular, they would agree that the agricultural producers--in exchange for the hybrids obtained from them--would give them 100-120 kilograms of seeds from each hectare 0f sowings. The advantages to be gained by the farmers and private farmers from this arrangement are obvious. Because certainly the additional yield from the Odessa hybrids is substantial, and the oils derived from them is much higher than that obtained from random varieties and hybrids. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food must also pay heed and concern itself with solving this extremely important problem.
