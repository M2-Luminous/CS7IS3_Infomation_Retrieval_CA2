Cerny; place and date not given: "Central and East Europe Is Not To Become a Sphere of Influence for Russia or Any Other Power"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Cerny] What do you think of the statement by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian minister of foreign affairs, who said that the countries of Central and East Europe may not become members of NATO without Russia? [Lebedyev] Statements by Kozyrev, and not just by him, are being interpreted very loosely by the Czech press. This is not criticism--just a simple statement of fact. Two or three sentences taken out of context are used to create a simplified picture. In all of his statements, Kozyrev had emphasized that the Czech Republic and all the countries of East Europe have a right to enter any international structures they consider suitable for themselves. Moscow merely desires that, while making these decisions, those countries should bear in mind Moscow's viewpoint and its security interests. [Cerny] Why does Moscow have this interest? [Lebedyev] The Warsaw Pact has been dismantled, while NATO continues to exist and is preparing itself for a transformation. I have heard from my colleagues, ambassadors of other countries, that intensive work is in progress on this transformation. Yet, while one system has been dismantled and the other still exists, the concepts upon which NATO was founded were not abolished. [Cerny] NATO is not an enemy. [Lebedyev] The principal concept that postulated that the Soviet Union, whose successor state Russia is, was the principal enemy has not been called off by anyone, except in the political sense. True, on the political level, NATO has already stated that Russia is not the enemy. For our part, we have done the same; Russian leaders have stated that we do not view NATO as an enemy. However, all of this must be anchored in some kind of a system of new relations between NATO, Russia, and the countries of Central and East Europe. If that does not happen, the membership of the countries of Central and East Europe in NATO will cause Russia to feel threatened. Today it can be the Czech Republic and Slovakia, tomorrow perhaps Ukraine and the Baltic states. This perception of danger and instability, stemming primarily from our historical experiences, unfortunately has an impact on our internal situation. That is a very delicate aspect that must be kept in mind, and that is exactly what Kozyrev was talking about. [Cerny] When will Russia make an effort to become a member of NATO? [Lebedyev] As regards Russia's NATO membership, it is not being contemplated at the moment, but it is very important to establish guidelines suitably reflecting the partnership relations between NATO and Russia. Some kind of structuring is needed for this. [Cerny] Partnership for Peace? [Lebedyev] Russia is a member of the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), as is the Czech Republic and other countries. Perhaps it would be possible through this organization to widen the concept of "Partnership for Peace," which will be concretized at the NATO summit in Brussels. Tn any case, Partnership for Peace provides an opportunity to give the relations between the individual countries a concrete shape. That would neutralize the growth of an incipient danger--namely, a security structure that includes the greater part of Europe and casts Russia off somewhere to the outskirts. Such an arrangement would even mean danger for the countries of Central and East Europe. During the past 200 years, Russia took part in almost all of the wars on the European Continent and also in all of the security structures that were formed at the end of those wars--for example, the Vienna Congress of 1815 comes to mind. It is necessary to emulate these structures also in the present, to make room for Russia in them, so that a feeling of isolation is not created inside Russia, so that Russia can take its place as a dependable participant and guarantor of the new security systems that are being formulated. [Cerny] What are the main spheres of Russian interest inside the Czech Republic? [Lebedyev] First, I would like to differentiate between the expression "sphere of influence" and "sphere of interest." I resolutely reject the assertion that Central and East Europe is to be the sphere of influence of Russia or any other world power. By the expression "sphere of influence," I understand a seizure of certain strong positions by one country inside another country. These positions then make it possible for the first country to directly influence matters of internal policy, foreign policy and other areas, inside the target country. For example, the fact that the Czech press devotes a lot of attention to events inside Russia shows that Russia is within the Czech Republic's sphere of interest. This is logical because events inside Russia may have a substantive impact on the development of the situation in your country. By the same token, the countries of Central and East Europe are within Russia's natural sphere of interest because Moscow is interested in maintaining a commercial partnership with these countries and, also important, in keeping the region stable. A threat to Russia could develop there. In such a context, we cannot view, for example, Honduras to be within a similar Russia's sphere of interest, while Germany and Austria, as well as the Czech Republic, are; this is caused by their geographical position in the center of Europe. [Cerny] To keep stability in the region? [Lebedyev] Central Europe also belongs to the sphere of interest of the United States, as stated by Washington. Stability of the region has great political and military importance also for the United States, and, in this sense, strategic interests of world powers are similar in respect to Central Europe and the entire European Continent. This fact must be the cornerstone of the partnership. The principal Russian interest in the Czech Republic, in my view, is the establishment and development of economic cooperation. This will help, among other things, to solve the question of Russian indebtedness to the Czech Republic, which is very important. In the political field, it is very important for us to maintain normal relations of European standard with the Czech Republic. We also regard it as desirable to have cooperation between political parties of the democratic type. I see this as an important factor in maintaining an atmosphere of confidence. Such understanding of the situation and approach to it will, over time, weaken that certain "allergy" of some of our politicians toward NATO. [Cerny] Do you mean to say that, in the vocabulary of Russian Government leaders and diplomats, there is no room for the expression "sphere of influence"? [Lebedyev] I think that our politicians must first precisely formulate the concept. What I have stated here is merely my personal opinion. But I do know that the official Russian foreign-policy line does not contain this concept. Perhaps there are politicians, such as Zhirinovskiy, who do want to attempt to define the Russian "sphere of influence." But I would be the first to oppose such efforts." [passage omitted]
