The denial was made in reaction to claims by Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Eli'ezer Sandberg, who resides in Haifa. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports: [Begin recording] [Schmerling] Tzomet MK Eli'ezer Sandberg fears that the Haifa Bay will be exposed to possible leaks of radioactive materials or even to a nuclear disaster if Haifa Port becomes the U.S. 6th Fleet's home base: [Sandberg] A home base means the long-term physical presence of nuclear-powered vessels and ships carrying nuclear weapons in Haifa Bay. I queried the defense minister about this issue; I also asked whether the ongoing negotiations regarding turning Haifa Port into a home base for the 6th Fleet are somehow tied to Israeli promises of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights and meant as a sort of alternative security guarantee. [Schmerling] The Defense Ministry's answer to the residents of Haifa is that there are no negotiations with the Americans on turning Haifa Bay into a home base for the 6th Fleet as an alternative in the event of a possible withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Defense Ministry confirmed, however, that nuclear-powered vessels and submarines have visited Haifa Bay dozens of times. They have taken all possible precautions, however, while keeping the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, the Environment Ministry, and the Ports Authority informed and involved. The Defense Ministry promises that now, too, all the necessary measures are being implemented to make sure there are no leaks and disasters resulting from radioactive materials. [end recording]
