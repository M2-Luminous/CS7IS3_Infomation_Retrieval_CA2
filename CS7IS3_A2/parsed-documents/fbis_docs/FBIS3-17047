Nazarbayev. According to State Counselor K. Suleymenov, there are fewer burglars, thiefs, and muggers in the republic now, but more...call girls and racketeers. Crime has become an economy and a business. Passive work on the part of the internal affairs organs, the state counselor believes, is the main reason why organized forms of crime have started to flourish in the republic. "Unfortunately, gangs have established a strong foothold in our country." In view of this Kazakhstan's president signed a decree on stepping up the fight against crime. It provides for the creation of special investigative groups comprising staffers from the Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Committee which will fight organized crime. Moreover, the president adopted a decision to set up a tax militia. Henceforth in Kazakhstan, instead of the notorious LTP's [occupational therapy rehabilitation centers], LPU's -- preventive treatment establishments -- will come into operation under the Ministry of Health. Moreover, in view of the decline of moral standards, a morals militia will come into being. Among other things, it will deal with the morality of the press.
