FR941017-0-00012 FR941017-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;21] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Muskegon, MI AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. Presently, this area is designated as Class D airspace when the associated air traffic control tower is operational. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control tower located at this airport is closed. The intended affect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when the control tower is closed. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Angeline Perri, Air Traffic Division, System Management Branch, AGL&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (708) 294&hyph;7571. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On July 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI (59 FR 35492). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. Currently, the airspace is designated as Class D when the associated air traffic control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control tower located at this airport is closed. The intended affect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations when the control tower is closed. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
