The 12-nation union agreed in December to scrap import quotas on 44 Japanese-made items imposed by France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. The 44 items include cars, automotive components, motorcycles, fruit juice and natural honey. The import restrictions on about half of them had already been dropped separately by the five countries, so the EU decision affects 24 products which were still subject to restrictions. The sources said the EU also agreed to end discriminatory treatment of imports from other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
