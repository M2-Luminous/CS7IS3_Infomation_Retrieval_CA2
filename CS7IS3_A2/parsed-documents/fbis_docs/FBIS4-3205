Zhu Xiaohua, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and director of the State General Administration of Exchange Control, said that in general, the supply of foreign exchange has exceeded the demand. At a ceremony to mark the opening of China's foreign exchange center in Shanghai, Zhu said that last year, the contracted foreign investment in the country amounted to 25 billion U.S. dollars, of which most would be transferred to China this year or next year. He revealed that from April 1, the foreign exchange in the special account in the people bank of China reached about 40 million U.S. dollars. He said that once the demand for foreign exchange is higher than the supply, the foreign exchange in the special account of China's central bank will be used to make up the deficiency. On the cause of the drastic increase of the foreign exchange reserve, he mentioned three factors: increase of in-float overseas capital, export value and income of tourist services.
