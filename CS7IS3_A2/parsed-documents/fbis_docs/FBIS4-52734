For some bizarre reason, the prime minister, who, under normal circumstances, would be considered the nation's top law-enforcement official, has decided to adopt a "hands-off" policy in the scandal involving 45 tonnes of Thai marijuana shipped from either Thailand or nearby countries to the United States between 1973 and 1987 allegedly involving an opposition lawmaker from Nakhon Panom province. Strange, incredible and incoherent statements were made by all concerned from the very first day this story broke into the open here about two weeks ago. Nobody should have been taken aback of course when MP Thanong Siriprichaphong denied it all. That he backtracked somewhat to admit some of the claims made by the U.S. Information Service was only to be expected. It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a certain extent. If the timing of the "leak" was suspect, the drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the law -- American and Thai. But the government has mishandled the scandal from the outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters' questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and allowing the accused to state his case. Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry, presumably the only official channel through which the U.S. Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment, failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long. The country's top drug enforcement agency under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion. While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to the post as party leader -- one year and four months after the Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the court case in San Francisco. That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government. The House of Representatives may have named a committee to look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in salvaging its reputation. But the government has yet to come up with any convincing move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall social and economic fabric -- and the government's political credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on drugs and illicit drugs. Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this connection: 1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics agency informed about the request? 2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of public servants in this country? 3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the United States were in no way related to Thailand -- and that they did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all? 4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a no- confidence motion -- and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government? In other words, can the government get away with its apparent inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain and simple, is no.
