It was learned on 17 June that the U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to cooperate in airlifting foreigners, including Americans, from South Korea when it airlifts Japanese in South Korea back to Japan. Upon receiving the request from the U.S. Government, the Japanese Government plans to do its best for an early enactment of an amendment bill to the Self- Defense Forces Law [SDFL] to make it possible for the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] to send its transport planes to South Korea to airlift them back to Japan. The Japanese Government also has begun studying ways to revamp the current customs system and the current immigration process, and to use naval ships which can transport more people than aircraft. According to a 17 June disclosure by a government source, the U.S. Government has made the request to the Japanese Government through diplomatic channels, and during his 14 June telephone conversation with Prime Minister Hata, President Clinton told Hata that the United States intended to reinforce U.S. forces in South Korea and then asked Japan's cooperation in airlifting foreigners, including Americans, in South Korea back to Japan. The President is believed to have asked Japan to cooperate in airlifting Americans in South Korea after concluding that Japan cannot take any military action because of its constitutional constraints and Japan's possible contributions must be confined to nonmilitary areas like "rear support." About 30,000 dependents of U.S. military personnel reside in South Korea. The situation is that they must be evacuated from South Korea via Japan to the United States and Japan's cooperation is indispensable for their evacuation. The amendment bill to the SDFL is under deliberation in the Security Committee of the House of Representatives. If the amendment bill to the law were enacted, it would make it possible for the SDF to use its airplanes to airlift Japanese and foreigners in South Korea back to Japan. The prospect of enacting the amendment bill during the current Diet session is slim because of the failure to adjust between an amendment bill proposed by the government and another amendment bill proposed by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. There is a possibility that the Diet will take up the amendment bill for deliberation in the closing days of its current session depending on how the UNSC handles the question of imposing sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of nuclear weapons and how North Korea responds to the sanctions in the future. There is a strong view among experts that airports will be targets of attacks in the event of an emergency and ships are more efficient than aircraft in terms of transport. Neither the current SDFL, nor the amendment bill allows the use of SDF ships for transport of such people. The Japanese Government, therefore, has no choice but to use civilian ships for their transport. The government is expected to be pressed to adjust domestic opinions on the use of civilian ships.
