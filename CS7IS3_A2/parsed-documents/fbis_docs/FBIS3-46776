They are seeking compensation of 300 million U.S. dollars for illnesses caused by the herbicide agent orange, and were offered 30 million dollars in August last year by the U.S. chemical companies, which include Dow Chemical Co. and Monsanto company. Spokesman Pae Nam-su, 50, said he filed the suit against the seven manufacturers of the dioxin-based herbicide, widely used as a defoliant in the Vietnam war, in May 1993 on behalf of 204 Korean victims in the State Court of Texas and expects the first hearing this April. The veterans association sent a list of 100 names, including Pae's, who have been recognized with agent orange sequelae by the Patriots and Veterans Affairs Ministry, and documentary evidence of their service in Vietnam to American lawyers in March last year and sent documents on 104 additional victims in August. The Rev. Yi Su-man, chairman of the association, said the chemical companies offered 30 million dollars for the estimated 3,000 agent orange victims in Korea on line with the compensation paid to American victims in 1980 through the association's lawyer in August. "But I concluded that the sum is too small considering the cost of treatment over the years and us being a minority race, and so I have refused the offer," Yi said. "Even if it takes us two or three years, we are determined to get every penny of the amount we demand," he said. Six lawyers will defend the victims in the United States and two lawyers are offering legal advice in Seoul. The Korean Veterans Association plans to file a separate suit against two American chemical companies on behalf of Korean agent orange victims.
