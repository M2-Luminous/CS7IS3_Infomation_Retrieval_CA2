We discussed bilateral issues and the Yugoslav Prime Minister Kontic adopted a positive stand towards the problems faced by UNPROFOR, the UN secretary-general's envoy told a press conference after his meeting with the Yugoslav prime minister in Belgrade. Kontic on his part expressed his satisfaction that a man from Japan, country which has always led a principled policy towards the crisis in former Yugoslavia, had come to head the UNPROFOR. Akashi told Kontic that he was aware that some of the UN Security Council decisions had caused the suffering of the Yugoslav population which was all the more reason why solutions had to be found that would lead to their cancellation. The United Nations had introduced sanctions against Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even though Yugoslavia has no troops in that republic. Akashi also informed Kontic that the Security Council sanctions committee had simplified the procedure for obtaining authorisations for food and medicine imports and that this procedure now took only a few days instead of weeks or months. The Japanese diplomat also said that NATO had asked UNPROFOR to prepare a feasibility study on carrying out air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the beginning of this week, NATO had threatened the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes in order to stop the bombing of Sarajevo, secure the opening of Tuzla airport and the relief of the UN Canadian contingent in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in east Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, it is the Moslems who are responsible for the clashes in Sarajevo. According to the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina General Francis Briquemont, they launched unprovoked attacks on Serb suburbs in Sarajevo on Tuesday. The Bosnian Serbs think that the opening of the Tuzla airport is not possible before the Moslem side signs a peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina because they fear that the Moslems would use the Tuzla airport, just like they did the Sarajevo airport, for the contraband of arms for their army. Bosnian Serb leaders also said that their forces were not besieging the UNPROFOR Canadian battalion in Srebrenica and that their request to be freed is unfounded. Akashi said that UNPROFOR had still not completed the feasibility study on the air strikes, adding that he was leaving for Geneva on Sunday to meet the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Akashi said that he was responsible for the territory of the former Yugoslav republics and that he would help the negotiators as much as he could because they would rely on on-ground information. He expressed hope that this information would help and contribute to reaching positive results.
