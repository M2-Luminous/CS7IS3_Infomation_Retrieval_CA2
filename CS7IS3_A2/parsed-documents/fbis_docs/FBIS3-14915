From today, Ostankino broadcasts are being removed here after the newscast at 2100 local time. Almaty and Tashkent programs, previously carried on another channel alongside Turkish broadcasts, are replacing them. Now, Ankara broadcasts solidly between 0900 and 0200 the next morning in a language that is completely unintelligible to the overwhelming majority of the Kyrgyz population. It is, however, intelligible to local television and communication officials. Ostankino is in arrears for some reason, whereas the Turks pay up and have even handed over written-off video cameras as gifts. It is typical that the squeezing out of Russian programs - and Mayak has also been subject to this policy - has occurred during the absence of Askar Akayev, who is now on vacation in Barvikha outside Moscow following his successful talks with Boris Yeltsin on the receipt of 75 billion rubles for a program to prevent the migration of Russians in Kyrgyzstan and to preserve the use of the Russian language. As a result of this new assault on Ostankino, the republic's viewers will this week lose their evening news bulletins on Thursday and Saturday and also the "Voskresenye" program.
