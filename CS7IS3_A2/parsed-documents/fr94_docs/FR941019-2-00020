FR941019-2-00020 FR941019-2-00019 Richland Operations Office; Notice AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, announces that pursuant to Paragraph C of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it intends to issue a noncompetitive grant award to the State of Washington Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development. The award is planned for an initial three (3) year project cycle, consisting of three (3) separately funded one (1) year budget periods. The initial budget is estimated at $1,100,000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melanie P. Fletcher, U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, P.O. Box 550, Richland, Washington 99352, Telephone: (509) 376&hyph;4828. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Award Number: DE&hyph;FG06&hyph;94RL12995. Scope of Project: The proposed financial assistance award is a grant Washington State to fund an Environmental Technology Partnership Initiative. The partnership will establish a cooperative approach to: (1) Private sector participation in cleanup activities at Hanford and other sites, and (2) contributing to local sustainable economic development. The partnership between DOE and the State of Washington will be designed to accomplish these goals through the application of advanced technology. The State and DOE will create or designate a non-profit entity to act as a facilitator between governmental agencies and private partners. This entity will establish connections to academic institutions, industry, and other research institutions to encourage the development, exchange, and commercialization of environmental technologies. DOE has determined that award on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate because the recipient is a unit of government and the activities to be supported are related to the performance of governmental functions within the jurisdiction of that unit, thereby precluding DOE provision of support of another entity. It has been determined that a grant instrument is appropriate since the Department of Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program. Dated: September 26, 1994. P.E. Rasmussen, Acting Director, Procurement Division, Richland Operations Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25900 Filed 10&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
