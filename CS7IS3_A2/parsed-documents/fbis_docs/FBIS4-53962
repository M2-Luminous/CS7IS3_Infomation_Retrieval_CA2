The talks are now at "a delicate stage," the top Japanese Government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, said in Tokyo Monday. A top official at the Japanese Foreign Ministry also suggested that the talks in Washington have moved into a critical stage, saying the two sides will see whether they can "make it or not" after Monday's session. Japanese negotiators -- headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu -- headed for the apparent showdown on Monday after a top-level government strategy session in Tokyo. Japanese officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata met with senior government officials on Monday morning on the trade negotiations. "We are vigorously trying to break an impasse in the negotiations," Kumagai told reporters in Tokyo following the Hata meeting. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United States, depending on the outcome of Monday's talks, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said. Monday's session came after the two sides met for one hour Saturday in what officials said was focused on "clarifications" on a Japanese position for resuming the trade negotiations under the framework agreement concluded last July. The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese imports. Among the industry sectors covered under the framework accord are Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, trade in autos and auto parts and the Japanese insurance market. Japanese officials said Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior Finance Ministry official in charge of insurance negotiations, headed to Washington to help with the talks. No high-ranking officials from the Finance Ministry have attended the talks so far.
