FR940919-2-00036 FR940919-2-00031 Order Approving Extension of Power Rates on an Interim Basis August 29, 1994. Pursuant to Sections 302(a) and 301(b) of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95&hyph;91, the functions of the Secretary of the Interior and the Federal Power Commission under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, for the Southwestern Power Administration were transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Energy. By Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective December 14, 1983, 48 FR 55664, the Secretary of Energy delegated to the Deputy Secretary of Energy on a non-exclusive basis the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and transmission rates, and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on an exclusive basis the authority to confirm, approve and place in effect on a final basis, or to disapprove power and transmission rates. Amendment No. 1 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective May 30, 1986, 51 FR 19744, revised the delegation of authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and transmission rates by delegating such authority to the Under Secretary of Energy rather than the Deputy Secretary of Energy. This delegation was reassigned to the Deputy Secretary of Energy by Department of Energy (DOE) Notice 1110.29, dated October 27, 1988, and clarified by Secretary of Energy Notice SEN&hyph;10&hyph;89, dated August 3, 1989, and subsequent revisions. By Amendment No. 2 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective August 23, 1991, 56 FR 41835, the Secretary of the Department of Energy revised Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108 to delegate to the Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable Energy, the authority which was previously delegated to the Deputy Secretary in that Delegation Order. By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, effective November 10, 1993, the Secretary of Energy redelegated to the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and transmission rates of the Power Marketing Administrations. This rate order is issued by the Deputy Secretary pursuant to said Amendment to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108. This is an interim rate extension. It is made pursuant to the authorities as implemented in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a). Background Southwestern Power Administration (Southwestern) currently has marketing responsibility for 2.2 million kilowatts of power from 24 multiple-purpose reservoir projects, with power facilities constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, generally in all or portions of the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. The Integrated System, composed of 22 of the projects, is interconnected through a transmission system presently consisting of 138- and 161-kV high-voltage transmission lines, 69-kV transmission lines, and numerous bulk power substations and switching stations. In addition, contractual transmission arrangements provide for integration of other projects into the system. The remaining two projects, Sam Rayburn Dam and Robert Douglas Willis, are isolated hydraulically and electrically from the Southwestern transmission system, and their power is marketed under separate contracts through which the customer purchases the entire power output of the project at the dam. A separate Power Repayment Study (PRS) is prepared for each isolated project, and each has a special rate which is not a part of this study. The existing rate schedules for the Integrated System were confirmed and approved on a final basis by the FERC on September 18, 1991 for the period October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1994. The FY 1994 Integrated System PRSs indicate the need for a minor rate adjustment of $726,051 annually, or 0.8 percent. Pursuant to implementing authority in 10 CFR 903(h) and 903.23(a), the Deputy Secretary of Energy may extend a FERC-approved rate on an interim basis. The Administrator, Southwestern, published notice in the Federal Register on June 14, 1994, 59 FR 30583, announcing a 15-day period for public review and comment concerning the proposed interim rate extension. In addition, informal meetings were held with customer representatives on January 12, 1994; April 4, 1994; and May 6, 1994. Written comments were accepted through June 29, 1994. No comments on the proposed interim extension were received. Discussion The existing Integrated System rates are based on the FY 1990 PRS. PRSs have been completed on the Integrated System each year since approval of the existing rates. Rate changes indicated by the PRSs during that period indicated the need for a minor rate increase or decrease. Since the revenue changes reflected by the PRSs were within the plus-or-minus two percent Rate Adjustment Threshold established by Southwestern's Administrator on June 23, 1987, these rate adjustments were deferred in the best interest of the government and provided for the next year's PRS to determine the appropriate level of revenues needed for the next rate period. The FY 1994 PRS indicates the need for a minor rate increase of 0.8 percent. As has been the case since the existing rates were approved, the FY 1994 rate adjustment needed falls within Southwestern's plus-or-minus two percent Rate Adjustment Threshold and would normally be deferred. However, the existing rates expire on September 30, 1994. Consequently, Southwestern proposes to extend the existing rates for a one-year period ending September 30, 1995, on an interim basis under the implementation authorities noted in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a). Southwestern continues to make significant progress toward repayment of the Federal investment in the Integrated System. Through FY 1993, status of repayment for the Integrated System was $288,259,891, which represents approximately 30 percent of the $971,634,103 Federal investment for the Integrated System. The status has increased almost 47 percent since the existing rates were placed in effect. Information regarding this rate extension, including studies and other supporting material, is available for public review and comment in the offices of Southwestern Power Administration, One West Third Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101. Order In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Secretary of Energy, I hereby extend on an interim basis, for the period of one year, effective October 1, 1994, the current FERC-approved Integrated System Rates for the sale of power and energy. Issued at Washington, DC, August 29, 1994. William H. White, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23124 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
