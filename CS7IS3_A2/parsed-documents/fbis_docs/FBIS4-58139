What did Israel equip him with in anticipation of his meetings in Damascus tomorrow? [Peres] He was given significant equipment in terms of ideas regarding the two issues on the agenda: the method of negotiations and their content. It is clear to me that it is impossible to reach agreement on the content before we determine the manner in which the negotiations will be held. In other words, no agreement can be reached without holding meetings at the level of the decisionmaking leadership on one hand and exchanging ideas at a discreet level on the other. In order to conduct proper negotiations, we need a quiet place in which ideas can be exchanged and a public place where the people can see that both sides seriously intend to attain peace. [Ganor] And so far, Syria has not understood this message? [Peres] No. So far, Damascus has been stubborn in its own way. We are not telling Damascus that it should align itself with the Israeli way of negotiating. We are telling Syria that Damascus, like Jerusalem, should conduct negotiations according to acceptable international norms. [Ganor] Is Israel insisting that the nature of peace be defined before it determines the depth of withdrawal on the Golan? [Peres] It is very possible that negotiations on both these issues should be held in parallel. If I tell you that one should come before the other, then one party would ask why it should be the first, and so on. We are saying to Damascus: At this time, let us determine a method that will enable us to discuss ideas and a method that will enable us to demonstrate to the people that we are heading toward peace. [Ganor] In the meantime, there is a feeling in the Golan settlements that an Israeli-Syrian arrangement will begin with Majdal Shams first. [Peres] There is no basis to this story. We have entered no territorial or detailed negotiations. At this stage, we are negotiating only about the manner in which we should begin real and serious negotiations. [Ganor] Did the United States show understanding regarding the package of guarantees Israel is seeking? [Peres] There is no doubt the Americans showed an interest in the package. I would not want to commit them to more than that. I believe Mr. Christopher's jet was given enough fuel to travel to Damascus. [Ganor] What are the chances of resuming the Washington negotiations now that the Palestinian issue has been settled, at least in part? [Peres] I believe there is more chance of this now because Israel has once again proven that it is seriously and honestly interested in reaching an understanding and an arrangement with the Arabs. After all, no one pressured us in the negotiations with the Palestinians; there were no thundering guns or pressure from the superpowers. The decision to reach an arrangement came from within. Incidentally, this is happening around the world. South Africa solved its problems from the inside. Communism was eliminated from within. There is no one out there to apply pressure. Each nation should decide for itself where it wants to go, the price it is willing to pay for this, and the stages it wants to go through in order to solve its problems. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what reality will prevail in Gaza and in Israel starting 4 May? [Peres] It will be different from anything we have known over the past 46 years. We left Gaza once, but we were replaced by the Egyptians. This is the first time we will leave most of the Gaza Strip and be replaced by Gaza residents exercising self-rule, self-management, and their own responsibility. Look, the Palestinian nation has never known the taste of being a nation. It has never had a territorial address. This is the first time the Palestinians will have a piece of reality with a territorial address and the authority of an interim government, of self-rule. This is a great thing for them.
