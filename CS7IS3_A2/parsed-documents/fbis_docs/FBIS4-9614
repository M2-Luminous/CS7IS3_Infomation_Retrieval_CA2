Professor Kolodko was already a candidate for finance minister during the creation of Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet last fall. He relinquished participation in the government at that time because the economic program he presented was not accepted by the whole coalition. [Unidentified Correspondent] Prof. Kolodko, who already took part today in a meeting of the Council of Ministers' Economic and Social Committees, said that he identified with the government's position on the strikes and the neopopiwek [wage-control law]. [Begin Kolodko recording] I never was an advocate of the neopopiwek, but I always was and remain an advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy. The government will shortly be proposing solutions that will, after acceptance by the trade unions, serve to protect real wages, which the prime minister spoke about, and here the issue of the popiwek, the neopopiwek, should be seen in the proper perspective.
