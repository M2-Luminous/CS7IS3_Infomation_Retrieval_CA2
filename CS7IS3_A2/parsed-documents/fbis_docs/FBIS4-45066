The report, prepared by the National Planning Institute and the UN Development Program, ranks the governorate of Port Said first and the governorate of Sawhaj last regarding human development. It states that all Egyptian governorates suffer from a housing shortage, close to 42 percent of Egypt's urban population lives in Cairo and Alexandria, and Cairo is the most densely populated governorate. The ceremony [on the occasion of the publication of the report] was held under the auspices of Deputy Prime Minister and Planning Minister Kamal al-Janzuri. It was attended by the UN Development Program's resident representative, Kirstant Muwaziyu [name as transliterated], and by professors of the National Planning Institute, officials of the UN program in Egypt, economics professors, and groups of intellectuals and journalists. Regarding per capita income, the report ranks the governorate of Port Said first, the governorates of Damietta and Cairo next, and the governorate of Sawhaj last. The report states that, relative to international human development averages, human development in the governorates of Port Said, Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta, and Suez is average; it is lower than average in the governorates of Lower Egypt, except for Damietta and al-Buhayrah. The report states that the governorates of Upper Egypt, except for al-Jizah, suffer from an extremely low rate of human development. The report indicates a large disparity between the governorates of Egypt regarding the individual's average share of income. It attributes the leading position of Port Said, Damietta, and Cairo to the capital turnover in those governorates. It also stresses that the paucity of the population in Port Said increases the individual's average annual share of income there. The report adds that Asyut and al-Minya lag behind all of the governorates with respect to the individual's share of income. The report advocates restructuring the general state budget to favor human development. It emphasizes the general role played by internal and external security regarding stability, consumer pricing based on economic foundations and a carefully considered procedure, the adoption of measures to reduce the severity of poverty in the framework of production projects, and the harmonizing of businessmen's social responsibility with their profit-oriented goals. The report warns of the effect of unemployment on the development plan. It calls for the selection of suitable production methods to cope with the problem, encouragement of private-sector projects to create new jobs, the provision of social and health services to workers, and the easing of tax burdens. The report also warns of the income distribution disparity. It cautions against redistributing factors of production in the manner of the agriculture reform in the fifties. The report calls for the attainment of a decentralized popular partnership and the development of capabilities and organizational cadres in the area of management. The report reviews Egypt's economic performance and the economic experiments tried in the country. It states that the growing population increase will swallow the majority of income. It warns that economic growth by itself will not help slow population growth. The report states that economic growth in Egypt has usually depended on, and been influenced by, external factors. It adds that economic growth is linked with economic imbalances, e.g., the balance of payments deficit and the budget deficit. The report states that the unemployment problem has been exacerbated by the fact that economic growth, although it has been low, has not been based on a labor-intensive production model. The report calls for the creation of suitable jobs as part of the state's general employment policy. At the same time, the report stresses the need to blend economic growth with the distribution of income to create a society based on fairness and equality. The report states in its general remarks that the population increase has become a burden on the educational system and state budget. It advocates lowering the birth rate to reduce this burden in the future. It calls for establishing an employment insurance fund to remedy problems stemming from the redistribution of the labor force among public, private, and trades projects. The report emphasizes the pervasiveness of education in Egypt; almost one out of four persons in Egypt is either a student or teacher, which is higher than the average ratio. The report commends Egypt's achievements regarding the education of girls, and it states that there is no shortage of teachers in Egypt's educational system. The report also addresses the housing problem, pointing to the shortage of housing units that has accumulated over the past 30 years, which has forced people to occupy dwellings that are in danger of collapsing. The report states that all Egyptian governorates suffer from a housing shortage. Regarding the labor market, the report states that the policy of free education and the compulsory hiring of graduates has had extreme effects on the labor market. The report warns that the taxation burden in connection with the privatization of public enterprises will increase unemployment. It states that coping with this problem will be a challenge facing any future human development strategy for Egypt. However, the report emphasizes that the public-sector's control over investment has enabled the renewal and expansion of the infrastructure base. [passage omitted]
