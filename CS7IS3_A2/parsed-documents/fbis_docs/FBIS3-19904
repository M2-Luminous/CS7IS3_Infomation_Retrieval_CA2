Except for BMW, all German carmakers are closing the year 1993 with red figures. Overall grade for Germany's carmakers: Failed. A new generation of managers is now expected to change the course of the automotive industry. Unlike in any other sector of the German industry, almost all of the veteran executive boards of carmakers were removed. Achim Diekmann, manager in the automotive industry association: "After the crisis the industry has a totally different look." During the coming week at the Geneva Autosalon it will make its debut. The collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and Nicolas Hayek, the inventor of the Swatch car is only one, albeit very striking, example. Mercedes, the Swabian brand of tradition, banks on the collaboration with the automotive newcomer Hayek. Mercedes boss Helmut Werner: "Hayek can always be counted on for innovative and clever ideas." This is but a fraction of the "revolution" that the Mercedes boss had promised one year ago when taking office: Roughly 11,000 jobs have been cut by the Stuttgart people in 1993 alone, another 8,000 will be eliminated in 1994. Mercedes must get out of the red, "however, merely stolidly reducing jobs," Werner recognizes, "is not the solution." Unlike any other manufacturer in Germany, Mercedes is expanding its line of products. In 1995, the new full-size Viano from Basque Vitoria is entering the market, and starting in 1996 the Bremen plant will build the small SLK roadster. The production of the small A-class starts 1997 in Rastatt, practically coinciding with the opening of the first foreign Mercedes plant in the U.S. state of Alabama. An all-terrain recreational vehicle is produced there, whose production figures are already in the black even with half the capacity of 30,000 cars annually. By the end of the decade Werner plans to produce one-tenth of the cars beyond the German borders und thus once and for all replace "Made in Germany" with "Made by Mercedes." In the year 2000, Mercedes intends to produce roughly 900,000 cars worldwide--about 400,000 more than in 1993. "One of the major weak points in the German automotive industry," as the study by the Deutsche Bank Research states, "the lack of globalization" will then have been eliminated. Werner is taking decisive measures. Only recently he reduced the board by two heads, cut two hierarchical levels, and divided the entire corporation into performance centers. A decision was made to build a central development center for roughly DM800 million, and an amount of DM18.7 billion was committed for capital expenditures planned from 1994 to 1998--10 percent less than previously. Werner's trick: Within the next five years Mercedes will invest about 1 billion marks [DM] additionally in products but less in machines. Mercedes reduces the fraction of company-produced assets by 5 percentage points to 40 percent, and, using a new purchasing model called "tandem," the subcontractors are also getting their chance. The basic principle: Mercedes does not demand lower prices unless the suppliers can actually produce at lower cost. Mercedes annually purchases parts worldwide for roughly DM20 billion. However, Manfred Remmel, head of purchasing, plans to save about 6 billion by 1997. Simple solution: Build simpler cars. The technology-crazy Germans have always loved things unnecessarily complicated. "We have to provide more than 3,600 different exhaust manifolds," complains Konrad Ellegast, deputy board chairman of Phoenix AG, the Hamburg automotive supplier. A comparable company in Japan needs 300--but also has fewer subcontractors. In Germany every second one is going to fall by the wayside. During his first year in office Helmut Werner has already decreased expenses by DM4 billion, in round figures. The Swabian carmaker continues to give payroll increases only on scale. Commentary by the French Banque Paribas in a current company analysis: "Mercedes is on the right track." The competition from Munich actually has arrived there some time ago. Even during the down-year of 1993, BMW registered a profit of roughly DM510 million. The Bavarian formula to success: Concentration on the automotive business; new markets, such as power-unit building, only jointly with a strong partner like Rolls-Royce; constantly new model variations--and no squabbling on the management level. The result: "In the German automotive industry BMW has the most advantageous cost structure," according to an analysis of the major Credit Lyonnais bank. Next objective: BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder intends to reduce development time from seven to three years and cut in half the number of 900 direct suppliers within a few years. VW boss Ferdinand Piech intends to match BMW and Mercedes. Piech is already striking a balance of success. And it is so fantastic that some just cannot believe it: Within one year the VW AG's break-even point was brought down from a 107-percent to 85-percent capacity. It is anticipated that as early as the end of 1994 the Volkswagen make will realize profits. After all, in 1993 the VW AG has managed a thin profit of about DM70 million. VW was able to save more than DM6 billion in 1993 alone, train employees for lean production, and escalate productivity in the plants by 25 percent within 12 months. Commentary by the Deutsche Bank Research: "The 1994 VW will be out of the woods." However, Piech lowered capital expenditures in 1993 by almost a half down to DM5 billion. Piech's calculation: All across the board, he plans to build cars after the module principle so that for the entire group only four underbodies are required instead of the present 16. The Czech subsidiary Skoda is presently already operating more cost-efficiently than the Japanese. Even the managers from the group's central headquarters are actively taking part in the savings: Like the rest of the VW workforce, their salary is reduced by one-fifth and consequently they have to work--at least unofficially 20 percent less. With the introduction of the 29-hour week, Volkswagen is able to avoid 30,000 dismissals. Nevertheless, the group must show a loss in the first quarter of 1994 the same as in the previous year. But "it will be substantially lower," states an employee from the executive circle. Red figures remain the current color in Porsche's statement so far. But Wendelin Wiedeking, at the helm at Porsche, is working doggedly for a turnaround: Within five years almost every fifth job has been eliminated. By 1995, Wiedeking plans to reduce production times by one-third, and the number of contractors from 950 to 300 by 1997. Wiedeking has a firm hold on things. Porsche marketing, for years the company's weak point, will from now on work again right next door with the Porsche board in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. The new "Boxster," on which they set their hopes, is slated to be ready for the market in less than four years. Full of pride, the young boss in Zuffenhausen pronounces: "We have left the low point behind us." Even in the first semester of 1994 Porsche will earn money again for the first time in the automotive business. In the United States the new Porsche is being ordered "sight unseen." "We have not seen anything like it in five years," an executive from the sales department rejoices. Walter Gnauert, director of finance: "We have worked off half of our competitive disadvantage to Japan." The Japanese art of the autobus represents a shining example even for General Motors subsidiary Opel. All of the 14 European GM factories are supposed to learn from the new plant in Eisenach. Initial successes are becoming apparent. The cost disadvantage to the English GM plants for the assembly of the Vectra was cut in half to DM450 within two years. The new Corsa requires a quarter fewer individual parts than its predecessor; for the new Omega the number is reduced to 40 percent. In 1992 it took 30 hours to assemble the Omega; the goal is for 20 hours to be sufficient by 1995, a value not even reached internationally by all of the compact carmakers. In addition, Opel boss David Herman banks on a new company agreement which limits future wage increases to 2 percent annually. Also, during the change of shifts the assembly line continues to move, and the workers do not punch the timeclock until they are on the job in their overalls. The Christmas bonus has been eliminated, the number of employees dropped by 9 percent, and even the number of sick persons has decreased by one-tenth to below 7 percent. For Opel this means a savings of roughly DM1 billion in four years. The employees are now to benefit from this as well: For achieving the self-determined savings objectives, Opel plans to distribute a so-called structural bonus in March--almost one-third of a monthly wage after all. At Ford, on the other hand, the employees are being motivated with "Knecht Ruprecht" [Santa Claus' attendant] switches behind the windshield of their own vehicle. One employee from Cologne: "A subtle hint to colleagues who do not come to work in a Ford." There was a time during the eighties when the Cologne Ford plants were considered the best managed enterprise of the German automotive industry. No longer. The new Ford director Albert Caspers: "We are in the midst of a struggle for survival." By 1996 Caspers plans to launch the DM12-billion capital expenditures program at Ford--making it the largest in the company history. The production time of 2.3 hours for the new Zetec engine has already reached Japanese levels in the Cologne engine plant; in the Belgian Genk factory the Mondeo is being built with a profit at a capacity of only 65 percent. But this does not solve Ford's main problem: The make continues to represent the German pedestrian citizen--reliable and respectable, but dull. Nevertheless, Ford boss Caspers is optimistic about achieving his ambitious goals: "We shall be among the winners." But that's what everyone in the industry wants. VW boss Piech, who would like nothing better than to become the headman of the industry, knows exactly why: "Whoever emerges first from the crisis has the best chances."
