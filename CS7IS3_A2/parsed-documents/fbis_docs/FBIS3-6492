Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for diplomatic and security affairs, pointed out today that progress in the North Korean nuclear issue up to now has been very unsatisfactory and the possibility of this issue being turned over to the UN Security Council is highly likely. He noted that the government is being forced to basically reexamine its previous policies, thus expressing serious concern over this situation. However, Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the governments of the ROK and the United States are making last-stage efforts in various ways to make North Korea fulfill the agreement reached between the United States and North Korea, including sincere acceptance of inspection and the exchange of North-South special envoys. He noted that he has not discarded the hope for a peaceful solution to the problem. Senior Secretary Chong Chong-uk revealed that the government will finalize its position after watching the special meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors slated for 21 March and a North-South working-level contact slated for 19 March. He pointed out that in the event that the special Board of Governors meeting concludes that the nuclear inspection ended in failure and that no progress is made in the issue of exchanging special envoys, resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and introduction of Patriot missiles will be inevitable.
