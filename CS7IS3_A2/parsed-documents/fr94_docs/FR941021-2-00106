The parties intended to consummate on or after October 10, 1994. 1 1 Under 49 CFR 1150.32(b), an exemption does not become effective until 7 days after the notice is filed. Here, the notice of exemption was not filed until October 4, 1994, and thus the exemption was not effective until October 11, 1994. Petitioner's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after October 11, 1994. Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: John D. Heffner, Rea, Cross, & Auchincloss, Suite 420, 1920 N Street NW., Washington, DC 20036. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: October 14, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26156 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
