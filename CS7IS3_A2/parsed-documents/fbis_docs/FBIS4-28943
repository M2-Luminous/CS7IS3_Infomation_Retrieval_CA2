This proposal was made by Choe Song-suk, chairperson of the C.C., the UAWPK, in a statement Friday. A consultative meeting of representatives of the DPRK Government, political parties and public organisations which was held on May 25 urged the South Korean authorities to respond to the proposal for the convocation of a national conference and select South side's delegates to the preparatory committee of the conference at an early date, keeping pace with the North. She said the peasant organisations of South Korea should launch brisk activities for an early selection of South side's delegates to the preparatory committee of the national conference and acceleration of the preparations for the conference. "If the peasant organisations in the North and the South are to share the same view and achieve the unity of action in the efforts to convene the national conference, they must sit at one place, first of all, and come to an understanding", she said, adding: "The contact should not be wedded to a form. With the date set for the convocation of the national conference two months off, the sooner the better." She expressed the hope that the peasant organisations of South Korea would show an affirmative response to the North's proposal for a bilateral contact.
