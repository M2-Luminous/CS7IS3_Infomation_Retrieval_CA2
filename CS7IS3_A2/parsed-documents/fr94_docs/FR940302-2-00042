FR940302-2-00042 FR940302-2-00028 [FRL&hyph;4843&hyph;6] State of Florida; Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on Florida application for full program adequacy determination, public hearing and public comment period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. Florida has applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV has reviewed Florida's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program meets the requirements for full program approval and ensures compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). Florida's application for program adequacy determination is available from EPA Region IV and the State for public review and comment. Although, RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State's/Tribe's MSWLF program, Region IV has scheduled a public hearing on this determination. The date, location and time of the hearing is discussed below in the DATES section. Anyone requiring additional information regarding the hearing, may call the person listed in the CONTACTS section below. DATES: All comments on Florida's application for a determination of adequacy must be received at the EPA Region IV Office of Solid Waste by close of business, Monday, April 25, 1994.
