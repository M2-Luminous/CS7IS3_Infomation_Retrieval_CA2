Csurka sees this as a dirty political trick, and said the organization is backed by forces who are interested in presenting the MIEP as an extreme rightist party. As reported on Wednesday [27 April], leaders of the Hungarist Movement, which openly professes extreme rightist ideas, held a press conference in Budapest. Present were the chairmen of the three political groups that set up the movement: the Federation of Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and the World National Popular Rule Party. National Front head, Istvan Gyorkos, announced at yesterday's press conference that the Hungarist program coincides with that of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party at several points.
