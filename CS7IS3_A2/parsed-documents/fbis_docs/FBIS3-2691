The Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] will soon open at the Great Hall of the People. The magnificent meeting hall is all lightened up; all NPC deputies are waiting for the arrival of the solemn moment. In the capacity of the executive chairman of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC Presidium and as executive chairman of today's session, Chairman Qiao Shi will preside over the session's opening ceremony. As soon as he entered the lounge, he cordially shook hands with and extended his regards to Vice President Rong Yiren, and then sat down next to Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. He asked Ann Tse Kai with concern if she could get used to life in Beijing since she just arrived from Hong Kong, and then talked about resuming sovereignty rights over Hong Kong. Qiao Shi said: On the Hong Kong issue, our stand is consistent. The responsibility for the breakdown of the Sino- British talks on the Hong Kong issue is totally on the British side. We are firm and unshakable in resuming sovereignty rights over Hong Kong in 1997. Speaking of the Second Session, Qiao Shi said: "This year's work and objectives have been clearly defined. According to the responsibility entrusted to the NPC by the Constitution, we should quicken the pace of legislation, strengthen supervision, regularize the socialist market economic system, and ensure that the state's major policies are smoothly and thoroughly carried out." At 0850, General Secretary Jiang Zemin entered the lounge and sat down next to CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li Ruihuan. They talked about stepping up building socialist spiritual civilization. While they were chatting, Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and foreign minister, approached Jiang Zemin and said: "The UN Committee on Human Rights has vetoed an anti-China resolution tabled by some countries." Jiang Zemin said: "Trying to make human rights an issue cannot win people's support. We should justly and forcefully refute them." Premier Li Peng, who had just come into the lounge, added: "I plan to make our stand clear on this particular issue in today's government work report." Jiang Zemin said: "Good!" Turning to the Second Session, Jiang Zemin said: "Currently, the general situation is very good and the major principles and policies have been laid down. The key problem now is for people of all nationalities to work together with one heart and in a down-to-earth manner." Premier Li Peng, who was about to step up to the podium to deliver a report on the government's work, smilingly told reporters: "Comrade Xiaoping has always favored short and solid reports. This year's report gives prominence to the theme of reform, development, and stability, and we have tried our best to make the report realistic. Comrades and friends from all sectors have offered many valuable opinions on the draft report; I am very grateful to them. I also hope that, during the Second Session, all NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members will speak freely and offer more opinions on the report." "Reform is the driving force, development is the goal, and maintaining stability is the first priority. The general guidelines and principle for this year's work have been set; so, as long as we can properly handle the relationships between reform, development, and maintaining stability, and as long as we work with one heart and one mind, we will be in an impregnable position," added Li Ruihuan. The atmosphere in the lounge was warm. Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and other comrades also cheerfully chatted with comrades sitting next to them. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun, who also is executive chairman of the Second Session Presidium, arrived at the Great Hall very early to inspect the preparatory work for the opening ceremony. He also inspected the podium's audio system. At the lounge, he asked Zou Jiahua: "At which delegation are you going to hear deputies' opinions?" Zou Jiahua replied: "I am a member of the Sichuan Provincial delegation." "The Sichuan delegation is a big one," Tian Jiyun said. "Sure, Sichuan's population accounts for 10 percent of the country's," Zou Jiahua said. The two leaders then discussed how to take effective measures to further improve large and medium state-owned enterprises. Seeing Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, coming toward him, Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, stepped toward him and told him: "The day before yesterday, we relayed the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission guidelines to lower levels; these guidelines are being further carried out." They said the anticorruption struggle must be carried out continuously and in a penetrating manner in the new year. "You have been doing very well in Shandong!" said Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, to Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee. "It is very kind of you. There is still a lot we need to learn from our fraternal provinces and municipalities," Jiang Chunyun said modestly. Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin, who also is executive chairman of the Second Session Presidium, asked reporters to make sure they file more reports on the NPC's legislative work because it is an important assurance for building and refining the socialist market economic system, for accelerating economic development, and for promoting social progress. The bell is ringing for the opening ceremony. While walking to the meeting hall from the lounge, the leading comrades still enthusiastically chatted with each other. The discussions of those attending the Second Session -- some of them may have or may not have seen each other often, some are and some are not CPC members, some are with the central authorities and some are from various localities, and many are from different posts and fronts -- focused on one [as published] subject: reform, development, stability, and striving for new victories in the new year.
