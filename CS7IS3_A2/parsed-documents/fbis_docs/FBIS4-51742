The editorial of NODONG SINMUN headlined "The Revolutionary Cause of Working Class of the World Will Certainly Emerge Victorious" says the revolutionary cause of the working class for building socialism and communism is an ever-victorious, invincible cause forever for its just and noble idea. We should wage a vigorous struggle to defend the socialist cause of chuche, more deeply cherishing the faith in the invincibility of the cause of socialism, the editorial notes, and goes on: We should thoroughly hold fast to the chuche-based revolutionary lines and policies set forth by the party and the leader with the unshakable conviction that our cause of socialism will certainly win victory as we are guided by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a distinguished thinker and theoretician, statesman and great military strategist. In order to press ahead with socialist construction in our country and defend the cause of socialism as a whole, it is important to strengthen unity and solidarity with the working class of the world, decisively smash the moves of the anti-reunification forces and more vigorously struggle to bring earlier the reunification of the country. Today many revolutionary parties and people fighting in defence of socialism are strengthening international solidarity, taking the Pyongyang declaration as their common fighting programme. Our working class and people will make positive efforts to unite with the people of socialist countries and non-aligned countries on the principle of independence and constantly develop good neighbourly, friendly relations with the peoples of all countries who respect the sovereignty of our country. Brighter prospects have opened up before the people who aspire after independence and socialism. The revolutionary cause of the world working class for realizing the noble desire of progressive mankind will certainly emerge victorious. MINJU CHOSON carries an editorial headlined "Let the World Working Class Firmly Unite and Accelerate the Cause of Independence".
