Paldiski is to be merged with Keila to form a district of the latter, while the surrounding areas will be turned over to the communities. The government also discussed the powers and budgets of the government special representative to Paldiski, Juri Tikk. A closed contest, held by the Economy Ministry, will be declared in order to purchase surveillance equipment for the border guard. The Border Guard Department was allocated the funds for the equipment. Prime Minister Mart Laar told the news conference that comparatively few offers have been made for the land border surveillance and the final decision can be made by April. Although the border guard preferred the Israeli company "Elbit", the government decided to hold a contest. Estonia has coordinated the purchases with Latvia and Lithuania, Laar added. [passage omitted) The government decided to exempt foreign loans, foreign aid, credits with government guarantee and goods purchased for them from the sales tax. The equipment for the defence forces, the police and border guard, as well as presents connected with official visits, will also be exempted from the tax. [passage omitted]
