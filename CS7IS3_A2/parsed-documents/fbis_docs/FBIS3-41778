Sobolev] [Text] Cholera has been carried to us in Tajikistan from neighboring Afghanistan, where an epidemic of this dangerous disease has been raging for more than 2 months. As of today, 14 cases of an acute form of cholera and 2 carriers of the vibrio have been recorded in the Pyandzh rayon near the border. As was reported in the main sanitary-epidemiological administration of the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry of Health, all possible measures to localize the trouble are being taken. A medical team consisting of specialists -- specialists in communicable diseases, epidemiologists, and bacteriologists -- was immediately created and began working, and three special laboratories were set up. The Pyandzh rayon was announced closed: The shipment of agricultural products in and out of the rayon was banned, and it was recommended that water from open sources not be used even though they were disinfected. Measures were taken to transport pure drinking water from wells to the population. Physicians are taking a full system of antiepidemic measures. Persons suffering from or suspected of suffering from cholera are actively being sought and hospitalized. The entire population of the rayon is being examined. But there is an acute shortage of medicines and medical equipment. Tajikistan's grave socioeconomic condition is now becoming increasingly more complicated. In view of this fact, the republic's Ministry of Health has turned to international organizations -- the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Physicians Without Borders -- with a request for emergency aid. Walter van Empelen, coordinator of the group Physicians Without Borders, has already responded that the necessary antibiotics and other means of fighting cholera will be sent to Tajikistan from Brussels on Sunday 24 July. In the specialists' opinion, there is still a threat that cholera will be carried from Afghanistan into other southern rayons of the Republic of Tajikistan, whose borders are constantly being violated by mojahedin and members of the Tajik opposition, in whose camps different infections are widespread. In addition, these days the return of more than 6,000 Tajik refugees through Termez and about 4,000 in the Nizhniy Pyandzh rayon is anticipated. There is no guarantee that these people who are to return to several southern rayons of their native republic are not carriers of infection. Beyond this stands the menacing threat of a cholera outbreak in other regions at any distance.
