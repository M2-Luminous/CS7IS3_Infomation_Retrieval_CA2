FBIS4-50961 "drchi100_k_94018" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 21 May 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Enterprises Support `Hope Project' Enterprises Support `Hope Project' OW2105154894 Beijing XINHUA in English 1335 GMT 21 May 94 OW2105154894 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- The China World Trade Center, a widely-known Sino-foreign joint venture in China, presented 380,000 yuan (about 43,700 U.S. dollars) to the "Hope Project" here today. The donation will be used to build a primary school in Qidong county of central China's Hunan Province and help Hunan's 600 school drop-outs to return to school. The Hope Project, sponsored by the China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF) in 1989, is aimed to help school drop-outs in China's poverty-stricken areas to return to school. It has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from home and abroad during the past five years and helped over 540,000 drop- outs to get back in the classroom. In addition, it has helped to set up more than 200 "hope primary schools" all over the country. According to an official from the CYDF, this year many domestic industrial and commercial enterprises have contributed money to the hope project. A number of hotels and some enterprises from service trades in Beijing have organized donations. "This shows the industrial and commercial enterprises' concern for the school drop-outs and the development of the country's primary education," said the official. However, donations from domestic industrial and commercial enterprises are still less than two percent of the total donations the hope project has received, said the official. He called for more support to be given to the project by domestic enterprises.
