In presenting their view of the future of the Union they challenged what they saw was the British policy orientated towards a free-trade area. They would emphasise the "French vision" of the future of European cooperation while working closely with Germany which is to hold the presidency during the second half of this year. The French strategy was outlined at a press conference by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure. France, like Germany, had an ambition to see a "greater Europe," Juppe said. The Union was "honour bound" with respect to countries which had emerged from communism in East Europe. But he warned that once Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria had joined the Union as planned at the beginning of next year, there should be no further enlargement without appropriate reform of EU institutions. France wanted to avoid a situation in which the arrival of new members gave substance to the British view that the European Union should be reduced to a free-trade area without political ambitions. A review of EU institutions has been planned for 1996. Hungary and Poland have applied to join the Union. The Czech republic is thought likely also to apply. Germany supports their applications. Juppe said he hoped that countries likely to draw closer to the Union, or to join it, should establish relations of "good neighbourliness" among themselves. He noted that on May 26 and 27 Paris would host a conference to launch the so-called stability pact which is intended to help settle problems concerning minorities and frontiers in Central and East Europe. Regarding peace, Juppe stressed the need for coordination between the separate functions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), which is the only wholly European body with competence for defence. He recalled that France and Germany had offered countries in East Europe the status of associate membership of the WEU. Juppe also said that the revision of European institutions from 1996 should be an opportunity formally to include Strasbourg in the European treaties as the home of the European parliament to put an end to a dispute with those who favour Brussels. On unemployment, Juppe said that a white paper by the EU commission on employment, which had been adopted by the 12 EU countries last year, should be taken into consideration. The white paper argued the case for an increase in flexibility within the labour market and for a reduction of social levies so as to reduce the cost of labour. He also stressed the importance of a programme planned by the Union for major public works in the sectors of transportation and communication networks in order to give concrete meanin to efforts to boost the economy. Juppe was cautious about the nomination of Silvio Berlusconi as Prime Minister of Italy. Leading figures of the French left-wing opposition have called for a boycott of neo-Facsict ministers in the new Italian government. Juppe aaid that he wanted to be able to continue "working in confidence" with the government in Rome, holding that a judgement of its policies would not be possible for several weeks or months. He was also reticent with regard to who might succeed Frenchman Jacques Delors as President of the EU Commission. A decision is to be taken in Corfu in June and Juppe said merely that he had "clear ideas" on the matter. French diplomatic circles frequently mention the name of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat. Britain favours current Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan who has made a name as a proponent of free trade under EU competition laws, analysts noted.
