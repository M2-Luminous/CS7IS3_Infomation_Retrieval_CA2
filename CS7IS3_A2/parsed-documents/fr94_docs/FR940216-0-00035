Seasonal Allowances of Pollock TAC Under §675.20(a)(2)(ii), the ITAC of pollock for each subarea or district of the BSAI area is divided, after subtraction of reserves (§675.20(a)(3)), into two allowances. The first allowance will be available for directed fishing from January 1 to April 15 (roe season). The second allowance will be available from August 15 through the end of the fishing year (non-roe season). The Council recommended that the 1994 seasonal allowances of pollock be set at the same relative levels as in 1993 with 45 percent of the pollock ITAC specified for each management subarea or district during the roe season and 55 percent during the non-roe season (Table 2). Although the Council is authorized under §675.20(a)(7)(ii) to recommend seasonal allowances of the 1994 CDQ pollock reserve, it did not take such action at its December 1993 meeting. Therefore NMFS is limiting the 1994 fishery to 45 percent of the CDQ reserve during the roe season, consistent with the seasonal split recommended by the Council for the inshore/offshore pollock fisheries. When specifying seasonal allowances of the pollock TAC, the Council and the Secretary consider the following nine factors as specified in section 14.4.10 of the FMP: 1. Estimated monthly pollock catch and effort in prior years; 2. Expected changes in harvesting and processing capacity and associated pollock catch; 3. Current estimates of, and expected changes in, pollock biomass and stock conditions; conditions of marine mammal stocks; and biomass and stock conditions of species taken as bycatch in directed pollock fisheries;
