And no matter what, all the economic packages will affect ordinary folk in the end. China's plan to establish a socialist market economy is no exception. This year, the State will speed up its efforts to transform its role in economic management. This means China will establish a modern corporate system, a nationwide open market, a more reasonable distribution of income and a multi-layered social security system. However, these efforts cannot succeed without complementary personnel reforms. China is already moving in this direction, said Personnel Minister Song Defu recently in Outlook magazine. Administrative organizations under the State Council and provincial governments are to develop a civil service this year, he said. And the few that don't should be encouraged to pursue open and fair competition in personnel management. The enrollment of low-rank civil servants should be done through examinations. Song revealed the State is now drafting regulations governing the exams and the employment and rating of civil servants. Wage He warned not to confuse government institutions and administrations in the civil service as the two will have different wage systems. Song said relatively independent institutions should make their own decisions on personnel affairs, using various methods including public bidding to select their staff. All government institutions should try to support themselves and stop receiving State aid, Song said. As for institutions that rely on full State subsidies, such as those engaged in basic research and education, a subsidy quota should be set regardless of the number of employees. This is designed to improve efficiency. Song said managerial and technical personnel should sign contracts with enterprises to clarify their rights and responsibilities. The salary packages should suit the actual conditions of enterprises, institutions and administrative organizations. State enterprises may decide employees' wages for themselves according to the supply of labour and demand for jobs, provided that the growth rate of their payroll is slower than growth of their economic returns. Social Security He went on to discuss the multilayer social security system which he said would cover unemployment benefits and pensions. This system should be gradually established, first in government departments and institutions. The State, institutions and individuals should all pay for the system, instead of the State paying alone. Song said that various types of social security system should be tested in different regions. Talent Market On the establishment of a talent market, Song suggested it should play a bigger role in the transfer of personnel. But the market must be regulated by laws governing personnel flow, Song said. These will be enacted later this year to ensure the smooth operation in the market and protect the rights of both individuals and enterprises. The State should encourage talented people to work for key State projects.
