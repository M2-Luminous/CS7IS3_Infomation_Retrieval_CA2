These talks, as Radovan Karadzic and Ejup Ganic agreed, should start tomorrow at 1000 in the Palace of Nations in Geneva, the sources of the Serb republic say. The only precondition attached to this is a confirmation that "armed Serb elements" have withdrawn from the security zone, i.e. 3 km around Gorazde. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is expected to arrive in Geneva tonight. Akashi is believed to have invited the UN secretary general to help him in saving the conference and the reputation of the UN which is mediating in the peace talks. The Muslim delegation has for four days been finding reasons to delay the opening of the conference. In all his contacts with the press Radovan Karadzic, head of the delegation of the Srpska republic, has been constantly saying: "We have come here to sign a peace and we do not set any conditions." According to statements by Akashi's press officer, the conference has on several occasions been on the verge of being canceled.
