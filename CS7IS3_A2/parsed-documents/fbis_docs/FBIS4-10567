FBIS4-10567 "drlat072_h_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Honduras Chief of Staff Denies Plot Chief of Staff Denies Plot PA1304210194 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 12 PA1304210194 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA Spanish BFN [Report by Orlando Sierra] [Text] Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of Presidential Staff, yesterday testified before Lower Court Judge Jesus Martinez Suazo that the much-publicized plot to assassinate President Carlos Roberto Reina never existed. This information was learned in the capital's courts. Given this, the judge will have to release Luis Rodolfo Hernandez Sosa due to lack of evidence. Hernandez Sosa, 33 years old and a native of Danli, El Paraiso, turned himself in on Thursday [14 April] after realizing he was the Police's and Army's most wanted man because he was presumably the man who masterminded the plot. "I will reveal absolutely nothing because that would be a violation of the law," Martinez Suazo said as he left Romero Salgado's office in the Presidential House. He said the decision on whether Hernandez Sosa would be imprisoned or released would be made today. He added that he would only take into consideration what is on the record. "I would never take part in any foul play," he said. He was accompanied during his statement by Special Judge Roy Medina and Prosecutors Eidelman Mejia and Omar Borjas. He explained that conspiracy in Honduras is punishable by two to four years in prison. However, he stressed he has yet to identify the crime that the alleged plot leader may have perpetrated. "The investigation will determine whether a crime was committed," he added, noting that there are legal limits on the time allowed for such an investigation. He noted that reports published by different media prompted the court to order the necessary investigation. Regarding Hernandez Sosa's situation, the judge added: "We will either issue an arrest warrant or release him, based on the evidence uncovered during the process." Martinez Suazo did not rule out the possibility of questioning President Reina and Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir. As Martinez Suazo heard Romero Salgado's declaration, Hernandez Sosa underwent a blood test in the Legal Medical Department. He claimed that he had requested the test. "This is all a farce. If the Nicaraguans have already testified, there is no need for me to do so," said the visibly angry prisoner. He said he is confident he will win his freedom, and, although he promised to "reveal all" to the media, he did not -- claiming the media had denigrated him. "It was you, rather than the authorities, who reported something you should not have. The people I thought were with me were really against me," he said. Because of this, he said he does not want to say anything else about his problem. "You have hurt me very much, and newspaper reporters have treated me the worst. People behave like Judases, and you intimidate me simply to make a good impression on your bosses," he said defiantly. He said he was surprised that newspapermen had published so many things against him because he did not deserve those commentaries. Referring to the president, he said that Reina can do nothing against him because he has told the whole truth. "I am involved in nothing, and I chose to turn myself in because I feel free," he stressed. He said that as a man he does not lend himself to anything. Therefore, he has nothing to hide. "I am not into drugs and that is why I requested this test," he said. He said Abdala Gianini, owner of El Millon department store, is a Judas. "I knew him as all employees know their own boss," he said, when stating it never crossed his mind to burn down a paint factory.
