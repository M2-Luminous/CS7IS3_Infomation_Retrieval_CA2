FR940503-1-00079 FR940503-1-00012 The Agency believes that the individual foreign refinery baseline requirements being proposed today are unlikely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The businesses affected will be either a relatively small number of major domestic oil companies who would compete with imported gasoline that is produced at foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established, or importers who would import gasoline that is produced by foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established. EPA expects the number of foreign refineries for which individual baselines will be established will be small, with the result that the number of affected domestic refiners and importers also will be small. However, EPA invites comment on the question of significant impacts on small entities. EPA also requests all relevant data which justify any conclusions submitted. C. The Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposal have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1591.04) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW.

This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. VI.
