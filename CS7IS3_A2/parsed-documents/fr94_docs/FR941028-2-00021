FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Tina Wright, (601) 634&hyph;4317. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This patent concerns a revetment unit for protecting shoreline or waterway embankments from erosion caused by waves or currents. The object of the invention is to provide a revetment unit which has simplified design and enhanced interlocking capabilities when arranged with other identical units into a protective matrix covering. The unit is generally L-shaped, has a low center of gravity for stability, and maximizes area covered per unit weight. The units form a matrix which has sufficient porosity to allow drainage and prevent excessive water pressure under the units. A model revetment formed from the units has been tested in a laboratory wave flume at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station. The units have demonstrated a high stability coefficient when subjected to the action of water waves. Under the authority of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;502) and section 207 of title 35, U.S. Code, the Department of the Army as represented by the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station wishes to license the above-mentioned technology in an exclusive, or partially exclusive manner to any party interested in manufacturing and selling revetment units covered by the above mentioned patent. Each interested party is requested to submit a proposal for an exclusive or a partially exclusive license within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The proposals for manufacturing and selling the revetment units covered by the above mentioned patent will be evaluated using the following criteria: 1. Demonstrated ability to manufacture and market revetment units. 2. Presentation of applicant's plan to manufacture and market revetment units employing the patented technology. 3. Capability of manufacturing and installing revetment units. 4. Time required to bring item to market and production rate. 5. License Fee and Royalty. 6. Technical capability. 7. Small Business.
