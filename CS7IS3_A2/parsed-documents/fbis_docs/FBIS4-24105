These proposals have been formulated against the background of a sound fiscal performance in the previous year. The deficit was virtually as budgeted, and in the knowledge that a continuation of the general structure of taxation set in place last year puts progressive reduction of the budget deficit in the future within our reach. [sentence as heard] For this to come to pass, however, continued control of the level of expenditure is vital. Consequently the government has taken particular care in deciding on the treatment of two issues, which are germane in this respect -- namely, funding to spearhead the Reconstruction and Development Program, and the treatment of the costs of our transition to democracy. The president's first words to his cabinet emphasized the overriding importance of reconstruction and development in the work and life of this government, and in his opening address in this house he reinforced this. All members of the cabinet responded to this message and its challenge. This challenge as we now conceive it is much more comprehensive than any particular suite of projects and consists of nothing less than focussing the nation's efforts on properly meeting the needs and aspirations of all its people. Some of these needs are simple -- shelter and the basic elements of hygiene. Some are more complex -- an education that will allow its subjects to contribute for a lifetime in this modern technological world. Many are more complex still -- arranging our society in a way that offers everyone the greatest freedom of choice and the enjoyment of personal liberty. Every part of our society, every citizen, has a role to play in this transformation. Every activity needs to be judged by its relevance to this process and adjusted accordingly. Government is no exception to this. The activities of every department need to be rethought and ennobled. This process has started. Government must also play a pathfinding role for the community, provide the spearhead in the form of specific concentrated initiatives, and it is for this aspect that funding provision musts be made. As indicated in the president's speech, this year will see the allocation of 2.5 billion rand to the Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP] Fund, a special instrument being created by legislation which will shortly be before the house. These funds have been found from decreases within the budgeted level of departmental expenditure -- in other words, without increasing the planned level of total spending. A list of the amounts contributed appears in the budget review. In this process the social service departments have naturally been largely spared. This diversion of funds represents slightly less than 3 percent of the current level of consumption spending by general government, and it is our judgment that an additional figure of this order can be similarly and additionally diverted in each of the next four years without thereby increasing the overall level of expenditure in real terms. In the planning budgets for those years we have therefore pencilled in the figures of 5 billion, 7.5 billion, 10 billion, and 12.5 billion for transmission to the RDP Fund, and the appropriations for all other departments will be required to adjust downward to accommodate this. The steady build-up of these amounts over this extended period allows both for the existing government machine to plan the adjustments needed, and for the new spending directions to be organized effectively and to develop their own momentum. Applying even the initial 2.5 billion rand effectively before 31 March 1995 already represents a real challenge which the new government structure is planning to meet in a methodical and carefully managed way. As the responsible minister has explained, these fiscal injections represent only a part, though a very important part, of the program in its entirety. They will be supplemented by contributions from other governments and from the private sector, while the departments themselves have many programs of their own that can qualify as part of the larger program. We are therefore justified, we believe, in regarding the process set in train, as providing ample ammunition for this long-term campaign. There is no further need to pursue calculations regarding the ultimate cost of its completion. Instead, we have a process in which we can have confidence and which will develop as we progress. This process is made possible by a vision of where we are heading and how we want to get there. It will allow for programs that stretch over several fiscal years. Before we pass on from this topic, however, we should note that it will be vulnerable to two failures which we must guard against. If we allow the overall level of expenditure to climb in real terms, we will imperil the allocations which can be made. Equally important, if we do not produce a sound, effective, and attractive program, nobody will be able to motivate the department sufficiently to bring about the future diversions of spending which we plan. Now let us turn to the question of the transition costs. In order to smooth the path of transition it was necessary -- who could deny it -- for us to have a period in which a Transitional Executive Council was active at the heart of government, and to create and give free rein to an Independent Electoral Commission to manage a free and fair election. BotP?&?6?es delivered what was required of them, but both were operating in unchartered territory under extreme pressure from time to time, and most of the time, and neither of them, subject to the need to find the income needed to cover any items of expenditure they considered necessary. [sentence as heard] Through the grace of God we have had a wonderful transition, but we incurred costs of 4 billion rand. A list of these will be found in the budget revue. From the point of view of fiscal discipline this is regrettable. If left without response, such a minus could wipe out all the pluses that this government deserves for its commitment to the responsible economic governance of the country. Worse still, it could inhibit us from taking the dynamic growth-inducing steps that are called for now that the elections have freed us from so many other constraints. We think the citizens of this country look to us to act boldly and to free ourselves as soon as possible from the consequences of past actions. We also think that every income earner in this country can be profoundly grateful that our transition has gone so very well. We think, therefore, that we should join together in meeting the greater part of this bill, put it behind us, and go on unhindered to exploit the exciting potential now available to us. In plain language that means that the government is proposing to levy individual and company taxpayers an amount equal to 5 percent of their taxable income. There are some important ameliorations to this. Firstly, all taxpayers will have the benefit of an abatement of 50,000 rand. Consequently, taxpayers earning less than this, which includes paying the Standard Income Tax on Employees or SITE only, will pay nothing, while the effective levy on a taxpayer with a taxable income of 70,000 rand will only be 1,000 rand. Secondly, the adjustment to the Pay As You Earn tables for individuals will be such as to recover the appropriate amount over the period up to 31 August 1995, rather than over the 7 months to the end of February 1995. Finally, the abatement for married women will be set at a higher level, which will take into account their disadvantage in tax rates when compared to other taxpayers. The total yield of this levy is expected to be of the order of 3.4 billion rand, of which some 2.6 billion rand will fall in this fiscal year with the balance being collected in the first half of the next fiscal year. Well, I feel that the great majority of my fellow taxpayers will agree with this step as a way of putting the past behind us. There will no doubt be commentators aplenty to warn that such one-time levies are inclined to continue or to recur. This will not happen in this case, since at least half the expenditure was nonrecurring, and since it is our intention in any event to call a streamlined tax commission into existence to carry out a swift review of the tax mechanism with a view to assessing what improvements are required. It will be chaired by Professor Michael Katz, the chairman of the Tax Advisory Committee, and fans of Future Imperfect will be pleased to learn that Professor Dennis Davis will be a member. [laughter] The sessions will be lively. Insofar as it wishes to make recommendations for the 1995-96 financial year, it will have to report by the end of November 1994. That report will be published, comment will be invited, and government will then decide the issues during February 1995, in the run-up to the next budget in March. A notice announcing the remaining members and the terms of reference has been published today. Having dealt with these major issues, we can now turn our attention to the discussion of developments leading up to today's budget, including the upturn of the 1993-94 financial year, the economic and policy environment of the budget, and the government's fiscal strategy. The 1993-94 financial year was characterized by a commitment to structurally sound policies and to the effective implementation thereof. This was achieved mainly as a result of proactive tax measures and effective expenditure controls. In this latter respect, I wish to pay tribute to former minister of state expenditure Mr. Amie Venter and to his department. In very difficult times, they established and maintained the disciplinary framework which the government of national unity has happily inherited. The 1993-94 financial year not only represented the closing of a chapter of history, but also the start of meaningful progress toward cooperation and reconciliation on economic affairs. Many examples manifested themselves in this regard. The most prominent ones were undoubtedly the negotiation for the final foreign debt arrangement, the successful application for an International Monetary Fund financial facility, and the formulation of South Africa's trade liberalization proposals made to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The very important role of the National Economic Forum in the GATT initiative, as well as in helping to resolve various possible issues of conflict in the management of the economy, deserves recognition. These achievements show that the golden triangle of government, business, and unions can succeed, and that it has indeed laid a foundation for future cooperation and consultation. The economic environment and economic policy framework: Today's budget is presented against the backdrop of a much-improved economic climate. Whereas previous budgets were constrained by negative rates of growth and double-digit inflation, both these indicators are now moving in the right direction. We anticipate positive real growth of some 3 percent for the fiscal year, and an inflation rate in the present range, figures which are significantly better than those which the country has experienced for many years. The economic outlook for both the international and domestic economy is encouraging. With economic growth gradually picking up in our major trading partner countries, commodity prices show some sign of rising. Coupled with a higher gold price, a continuation of the solid export performance is foreseen, although the livelier domestic economy could result in a smaller current account surplus on the balance of payments than in 1993. The peaceful conditions after the elections augur well for the continuation of the economic recovery. Increased fixed investment expenditure, an expected rise in inventories, and a further recovery in real private consumption expenditure, together with a continuation of the good export performance, a significantly less burdensome foreign debt position, improved access to foreign markets, greater financial stability, improving business confidence, and the present favorable agricultural conditions are just some of the reasons for the more positive growth prospects for the economy. These factors are also being reflected in improved local and international business and consumer confidence with each day that passes. In its investor dimension, using this confidence requires that South Africa should obtain an international, sovereign credit rating -- that is, a formal measure of risk associated with the borrower's willingness and ability to fulfill the loan obligations. Most institutional investors require such a rating as part of their investment criteria, and many investors set great store by them. Ratings therefore broaden the investor base for debt instruments, thereby maximizing investor demand and reducing the cost of funds. South Africa has taken the first steps in acquiring such a rating in the U.S. financial markets. The process is under way and will be completed this year. Success in this challenging international environment will require the liberalization of our international financial flows as soon as the preconditions previously stated by the governor of the Reserve Bank have been met. The replenishment of our foreign reserves: These have been rising since the inauguration, and we expect the trend to continue. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring developments and will make the necessary preparations to enable us to take action at the appropriate time. Two important caveats should be mentioned as far as our international financial relations are concerned. First, we must guard against extravagant expectations regarding immediate capital flows into South Africa. Such flows will be slow to develop, and the country therefore still faces a balance of payments constraint. The need for continued adherence to the present responsible monetary policy is thus beyond any doubt. A second caveat is that our endeavors to facilitate and broaden access to international financial markets should not be seen as attempts to find additional sources to finance a larger budget deficit, but rather as a substitute for domestic finance. This will not only result in a better balance between local and foreign debt, but will also ease pressures on the domestic financial market to the advantage of private sector borrowers. At this point I should like to express the country's thanks to the former director general of finance, Mr. Gerhardt Croeser, who made a signal contribution to good financial governance for many years, and who now represents us in Zurich as we establish closer links with the international financial community. In forging these and other close links with the international community, we are guided by a clear vision of the kind of country we want to become: an open society trading freely with all other nations, investing liberally to increase our productive capacity, thus creating more and more jobs which in turn leads to an ever more attractive growing domestic market, and encouraging participation in the benefits of this development by our people, by our neighbors in southern Africa, and by kindred spirits all over the world. Against this background, we can now move onto the fiscal strategy for the 1994-95 financial year and how we plan to realize it. The fiscal strategy for 1994-95: This budget is the first of a number of budgets of this government that will have to meet with three considerations -- first, laying the base for public finance to be one of the principal instruments for the reconstruction and development of our country; second, contributing through fiscal discipline to macroeconomic stabilization as a crucial element in economic growth; and third, embodying institutional change in the process of transition from the old to the new constitutional order. This strategy obviously necessitates new policy measures and structures to underpin, or where necessary even replace, those already in place. Any discussion of the expenditure and revenue proposals must take these considerations into account. The format of the budget: Two major changes in the budget presentation must be explained. The first is the result of constitutional change and involves the incorporation into the budget of the national government of erstwhile revenue diversions to, and budgetary shortfalls from, former regional authorities. The second is the more comprehensive inclusion of the informal sector in the calculation of the Gross Domestic Product, GDP, which resulted in an upward adjustment of 5.6 percent in the GDP. Care should thus be taken in analyzing the budget figures to ensure comparability and avoid misinterpretations. A detailed discussion of the changed budget format and various other important matters, which -- due to time constraints -- I can touch on only briefly or not at all, appear in the budget review. Expenditures: The total estimate of expenditure from the national revenue account for the 1994-95 financial year is a 135.1 billion rands, which now covers all expenditures at the national and regional level, except those financed from the former regional administrations' own revenues. If we do not include the latter expenditure, current noninterests expenditure -- in other words, consumption expenditure and current transfers -- grow by only 6.5 percent. This figure will not materially be affected once allocations from the RDP funds begin to flow and we succeed in ridding ourselves from the cost incurred during the transition. The increase is substantially below the inflation rate, and bears testimony to our commitment to continue fiscal discipline. In view of the many and varied demands on the exchequer and the relatively small increase in estimated expenditures, continued rigorous financial control will be called for. The restructured Treasury Committee -- comprising the two deputy presidents, the minister of finance, and the minister without portfolio, who is also responsible for coordinating the reconstruction and development initiative -- will have an important role in this regard. The committee's main function is to assist the cabinet in meeting the government's budgetary commitments. To that end, reordering of expenditure priorities during the course of the financial year, which will also involve RDP-related budgetary shifts and allocations, is a major element of this committee's activities. I should now like to highlight some specific expenditures from this year's budget, details of which are printed in the budget review. Civil and military pensions: Even in the much lower inflationary environment now prevailing, it is desirable to adjust pensions on an annual basis. This year's increases in civil and military pensions reflect the appreciably lower rate of inflation; and they are as follows. Civil pensions will rise by 5 percent with effect from 1 April 1994 for pensioners who retired on or before 1 July 1993. Those who retired later but before the 1 April 1994 will have their pensions raised by 0.56 percent for each completed month since retirement. Pensions which have increased since retirement by a percentage which, after taking into account the increase just announced, does not yet equal 70 percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index since retirement, will be further increased to that level. Military pensions will rise by 5.6 percent with effect from 1 April 1994. Next, social pensions: An amount of 418 million rands is being made available for a general increase in the various social pensions and the elimination of the existing backlog of potential beneficiaries. Further details will be made available by the minister for welfare and population development. Next, employment creation: An amount of 292 million rands -- this is quite separate from the RDP fund -- will be available for job creation. The improved cooperation and participation of communities under the government of national unity will enhance the impact of this expenditure. Financial and Fiscal Commission: The 1993 constitution makes provision for the establishment of a Financial and Fiscal Commission. The aims and functions of the commission are to apprise itself of all financial and fiscal information relevant to national, provincial, and local government administration, and to render advise and make recommendations regarding the finances of, and financial relations between, the three tiers of government. It is clear that the commission will play a crucial role in respect of financial and fiscal matters at all levels of government. In this, it will face a daunting task that must be tackled with the utmost urgency. I hope to make an announcement regarding the appointments to the commission in the near future. Revenues: The present level of taxation relative to the state of the economy can be regarded as adequate. This encouraging situation is to a large extent the result of the structurally sound tax changes introduced last year. Based on existing tax rates, the total consolidated estimate of revenue for the National Revenue Account is 104.3 billion rands, 11.2 percent above the comparable figure for 1993-94. This figure includes all revenue at national and regional level, except the own revenue collections of the former regional administrations. Excise Duties: Maintaining our sound tax structure requires that we should revise excise taxes upwards, in line with the general level of price increases on a regular basis. After consultations with the affected industries, the following increases are proposed: beer, 6 cents per liter, or about 2 cents per 340-ml can or so-called dumpy; spirits -- example whiskey, brandy, and gin -- about 53 cents per 750-ml bottle; cigarettes, about 7 cents per 10 cigarettes; cigarette tobacco, about 9 cents per 50 grams; pipe tobacco and cigars, 65 cents per kilogram; unfortified wine, 4.5 cents per 750-ml bottle; fortified wine, about 5 cents per 750-ml bottle; sparkling wine, about 6 cents per 750-ml bottle; other fermented drinks such as cider, about 2 cents per 340-ml can; sorghum beer, 1 cent per liter. Sorghum beer powder, 5 cents per kilogram; and cold drinks and mineral water, about 1 cent per liter. The increases are roughly in line with the rate of inflation, but where rates have been significantly out of line with similar products, the increases attempt to eliminate at least part of the discrepancy. The increase in the excise duty on tobacco products is a special case. Based on health considerations, arguments have been put forward for an increase in the excise duty to 50 percent of the retail price, which is the order of impost in many other countries. After consultations with all interested groups, and taking into account industry's specific limitations and market conditions, government has opted for a phased approach, which is reflected in the announced increase. Future budgets will have to deal with the remainder of this issue. The announced excise increases should yield some 525 million rands in a full year, and some 350 million rands for the remainder of this financial year. These adjustments take effect immediately. In accordance with Section 58 (1) of the Customs and Excise Act 1965, I now lay the formal tax proposals for excise duties on the table for consideration by Parliament. Transition levy: As argued earlier, a levy to defray the greater part of the transition costs is called for, and the transition levy will be on individuals and companies with taxable income in excess of 50,000 rands. Individuals: The levy will be 5 percent, of which 3.33 percent based on 1995 taxable income is to be collected by 28 February 1995, and the balance of 1.67 percent based on 1996 taxable income by the end of August 1995. In view of the existing disparity between married men and women, the levy will only be imposed on income exceeding 175,000 rands in the case of married women. Revised tax tables will be issued in due course. Taxpayers of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] states will also be liable for the levy on the equivalent of taxable income as defined in the applicable legislation. It is expected that this levy will yield an estimated 1.46 billion rands for the current financial year, and a further 800 million rands up to August 1995. Companies: A rate of 5 percent will apply on taxable income of companies in excess of 50,000 rands, in respect of years of assessment ending during the period of 12 months up to 31 March 1995. Assessed losses brought forward from previous years will not be set off in determining such taxable income. Companies registered in the former TBVC states will also be liable for the levy in the equivalent of taxable income before the deduction of assessed losses incurred during previous years, as defined in the legislation applicable to those countries. This levy on companies is expected to yield some 1.116 billion rands during this financial year. The General Export Incentive Scheme, GEIS: The GEIS scheme is currently under review within the National Economic Forum, and proposals for amendment are expected shortly. Payments under the present scheme are exempt from taxation, which is unsound in principle and of small effect in increasing the incentive value of the payments to the recipients. Notice is therefore given that we intend withdrawing the tax exemption in respect of assistance under GEIS with effect from 1 March 1995. Based on the matters which I have dealt with up to this point, the projected budget deficit, which was 6.9 percent last year on the updated estimate of GDP, will be 6.3 percent for the new year. This is a meritorious decrease in the deficit, which becomes more so when we remember that a further almost 0.2 percent of GDP will be collected in the next fiscal year, as we complete our collections of the transitional levy from PAYE [Pay As You Earn] taxpayers. Viewing these figures, the government has decided to lose no time in taking two initiatives aimed directly at the stimulation of investment, growth, and, consequently, jobs. Import surcharge: The first concerns the immediate removal of the import surcharge on all capital and intermediate goods, that is, all goods carrying the 5 percent surcharge. The cost to the fiscus for a full year is some 1.2 billion rands, and for the remainder of the financial year some 800 million rands, or slightly less than 0.2 percent of GDP. The removal of the remaining surcharges will not be considered now, as it may be more appropriate to deal with them in the light of recommendations made by the tax commission. Income tax, companies: The second initiative is to complete the process of structural reform of corporate tax which we began last year. This involves lowering the corporate rate from 40 percent to 35 percent as from 1 April 1994, while partly compensating for this by raising the secondary tax on companies from 15 percent to 25 percent with immediate effect. The net sacrifice involved this year is some 0.14 percent of GDP or 600 million rands. This will be covered in future years by the taxation of GEIS payments so that the corporate sector as such will be paying the same tax but in a framework which is far more favorable for new small and medium companies, and for those most capable of generating greater growth through heavy reinvestment of profits. The outcome of the tax proposals is an estimated net increase on the printed estimate of 1.5 billion rands, a reduction of 450 million rands for Customs and Excise, and an increase of 1.9 billion for Inland Revenue. Total revenue for the national government is therefore estimated to increase by 11.2 percent to 105.8 billion rands in 1994-95. Before dealing with the financing of the deficit, a few other tax issues require brief mention. Firstly, the harmonization of the tax systems of South Africa and the former TBVC states will be undertaken in phases starting this year. Secondly, the Tax Advisory Committee is investigating the taxation of gains and losses arising from financial instruments, and plans to issue a consultative document in this regard. Thirdly, consideration is being given by Inland Revenue to the introduction of revised provisions to facilitate unbundling and rationalization schemes. Details on these issues are contained in the budget review, and more information where applicable will be announced at the appropriate times. The budget deficit and public debt: After the tax proposals take effect, the final consolidated budget deficit will be 6.6 percent of GDP by March 1995, or equivalent to 66.4 percent if the full collection of the levy is taken into account. This compares with 6.9 percent last year on the same basis, and confirms that the downward trend as regards budgetary deficits is alive and well. Total expenditure, including the supplementary proposals, for '94-95 is estimated at 135.1 billion rands. The estimated revenue, including the tax proposals, is 105.8 billion rands, and leaves a budget deficit of 29.3 billion rands. Taking into account loan redemptions and the balance brought forward from the previous year, the financing requirement is 36.5 billion rands. This amount will again be financed primarily from the sale of domestic stock, although provision is also made for some foreign loans. Financing of this magnitude, inclusive of regional finances, should not influence the financial markets unduly, or put upward pressure on interest rates. As an interim measure, the minister of finance was on the 27th of April 1994 authorized to take over the debt of some 15 billion rands of the former TBVC states and self-governing territories as debt of the national government. The allocation of the asset-related part of this debt to the provinces, as determined by the Constitution, will be finalized at a later date. It should be emphasized that this is not new debt, and that previous budgets provided for its servicing cost. In contrast to the practice last year of funding the deficit in as short a period as possible, deficits are currently being funded as and when they arise. This approach not only prevents the accumulation of large exchequer balances lying idle, but also facilitates the development of a more active market for government stock. The authorities have also implemented a system of treasury, tax and loan accounts since 1st February 1994, whereby tax and loan receipts are deposited in tax and loan accounts of clearing banks and held in the respective accounts until the money is required by government. The flow of funds between the private sector and the Reserve Bank, which at times in the past has considerably disrupted the money market, has now been eliminated, thus simplifying money market management and contributing to better cash flow management within the government sector, which in turn reduces the net cost of financing. I would now like to express my thanks. Budget planning and preparation, presentation, and eventual execution involves the dedication, cooperation, and plain hard work of many people. I pay tribute to the directors general and the staff in the departments of finance and of state expenditure, who have made this very complex transition budget happen. The cooperation of government departments, the various regional authorities, and other institutions, especially the South African Reserve Bank, was indispensable, and I also thank them. The departments of finance and state expenditure will remain separate departments, but their present directors general, Dr. Estian Calitz and Mr. Hannes Smit, who remain in their positions, now both report to me. We welcome on board Mr. Alec Irwin as deputy minister, and at the same time pay tribute to his predecessor, Dr. Theo Alant, who was a valued member of our team. Another relative newcomer is Mr. Trevor van Heerden, the commissioner of Inland Revenue. Mr. van Heerden succeeded Mr. Johannes Hattingh, who retired after a distinguished career in Inland Revenue. We look forward to working with these newcomers, and have confidence that with the continued support of the rest of management and the valued advise of Dr. Japie Jakobs, my special economic adviser, we hope to be able to serve the needs of the people of our country. The success we have achieved and need to achieve with budgetary control depends, ultimately, on the support given by the head of the government. I am very fortunate to have had unstinting support since assuming this position, from my first appointment in May 1992, right up to the present day, and wish to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to the leaders concerned for this vital factor. The budget in perspective: Building on the sound fiscal performance of the past year, today's budget confronts the challenges head-on. The reconstruction and development imperative is addressed through the first of several allocations from existing resources to the RDP fund. The program itself will also be bolstered by the existing and substantial socioeconomic expenditures which are directly or indirectly related to reconstruction and development. Concomitantly, fiscal discipline is being maintained through the further reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP. Within that constraint, it was nonetheless possible to improve the corporate tax structure, and to take a major step reducing the cost of imported capital and intermediate goods. The once-off levy in income tax effectively closes the financial book on the transition without jeopardizing the fiscal progress made thus far. In planning our future strategies, we shall be able to draw on the insights of the tax and the financial and fiscal commissions. This government has the legitimacy, the capacity, and the resolve to succeed. It is determined to pursue both social justice and aggressive growth, the best of both those worlds, and the budget seeks to embody this aim. The members of the government, the members of this house, and our millions of fellow citizens have spent the past several years demonstrating our ability to set the highest goals, and to achieve them. This is one more. Let's do it again. Thank you.
