To quote Bagratyan, Armenia counted on international financial organizations' aid in putting the nuclear power plant back into operation. Shatman said that the IMF's executive council did not object to helping Armenia and that this position had been confirmed during the executive committee's Washington conference involving 15 donor-states. He said those countries welcomed Armenia's policy of economic reforms. He pointed out, however, that aid to Armenia largely depended on the situation in the region. "The donor-states are expecting meaningful progress in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, he said. IF Note: Local experts note that until recently the IMF abstained from extending credits to Armenia fearing lest it might be used for military purposes.
