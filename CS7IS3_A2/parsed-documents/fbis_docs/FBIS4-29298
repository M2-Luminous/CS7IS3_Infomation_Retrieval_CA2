"He's fine. Good condition. Stable. Next Monday or Tuesday, he could leave the hospital," Indonesia's Melbourne Vice Consul Bambang Tarsanto told REUTERS. Alatas, 61, was admitted to the private Epworth Hospital in Melbourne on Sunday and underwent a three-hour quadruple bypass operation on Monday after suffering a heart attack last month. Bambang said the foreign minister's departure from hospital and return to Indonesia would depend on advice from his surgeon, Professor Brian Buxton, the hospital's head of cardiac surgery. But he said he had no idea when Alatas would return to work. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating visited Alatas on Wednesday. Alatas is a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement and in preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
