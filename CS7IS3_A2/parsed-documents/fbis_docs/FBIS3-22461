Total spending on health care amounted to 44.6 billion markkas, which was 200 million less than what was spent in 1991. Based on GNP, health care spending was 9.4 percent more than the OECD average. The share for health care had grown because GNP dropped in 1992 by 4 percent, and since GNP continued dropping last year, the share for health care expenditures apparently grew again in 1993. In 1991, the average for OECD countries was 8 percent; the figure has not yet been calculated for 1992. Hospital care was cut most. The reason for this was increased outpatient care and reductions in capacity. There was also a drop in the number of health care workers. Seventy percent of inpatient costs go for personnel items. Forty-four percent of health care costs, or 19.5 billion markkas, went for inpatient care, and 15.6 billion on outpatient care. A total of 4.8 billion was spent on medicines, and 2.14 billion was paid out through the health insurance scheme as medicine reimbursements. Investments in health care dropped by 20 percent. The state paid 35 percent of health care costs, municipalities 33 percent, and 11 percent by the National Pension System. Households, or services users, paid only 17 percent.
