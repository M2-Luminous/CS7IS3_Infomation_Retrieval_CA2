At the same time, it also outlines Japan's foreign policy for those both at home and abroad. In this respect, it is our impression that the 1993 bluebook is rare for the character of its message. Of course, several of the bluebook's descriptions of current affairs do take on the tone of a message, and the following is an example. "An economic power second only to the United States, Japan has now come into being as a nation with considerable influence not only in the economic realm but also regarding fundamental problems in all fields of international society, including political aspects and problems of a global scale." This was probably meant to ask people to focus on the way Japan is viewed by other nations. Of late, much use has been made of the expression "a small but shining nation" to describe Japan but, in the eyes of the world, Japan is not a small country at all. "It is necessary for Japan to pursue a positive and an abundantly creative diplomacy to provide direction for a new international framework and to participate in its construction," according to the report. This could be an indication of Japan's diplomatic position in dealing with an international situation that "continues to be fluid and opaque." However, the problem is that the annual report is abstract and does not set forth Japan's position on individual issues in concrete terms. A representative example is the section on Japan's seeking permanent membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC]. It is well known that for some time the MOFA has strongly hoped Japan would attain a permanent seat on the UNSC. However, the bluebook remains unnaturally vague on this score, making no direct reference to the question. It just quotes indirect references to reform of the United Nations from a speech former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa delivered at the UN General Assembly last September. When the bluebook was written, the Hosokawa administration was still in power and, with the governing coalition parties having different basic policies, this may have affected the way the report was compiled. In putting the latest bluebook together, a new procedure unknown during the era of Liberal Democratic Party rule was introduced. The report was submitted to teams from the ruling parties dealing with various ministries and agencies and to policy executive boards for discussion before being presented to a cabinet meeting for approval. Therefore, abstractions and indirect expressions were no doubt unavoidable in light of conflicting views within the coalition. That was the background then and it is hardly surprising, therefore, that a gap became apparent between the bluebook's tone and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's highly enthusiastic approach to the issue of a permanent UNSC seat after taking over from Hosokawa. The aforementioned factors were no doubt reasons why the bluebook failed to concretely spell out how Japan should cope with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms and Japan-U.S. trade friction. The bluebook said that "national consciousness has not necessarily caught up with the international community's increased expectations for Japan." This section can be taken to mean that the MOFA was exasperated by the political situation at home. We believe that the recent political disarray, which affected even the bluebook's content, must be brought to an end as soon as possible.
