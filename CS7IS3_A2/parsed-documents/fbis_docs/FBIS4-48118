They were sentenced in the Rand Supreme Court on four counts of murder each, and to an effective 18 years' imprisonment on charges including attempted murder, assault and possession of unlicensed firearms, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported. Passing judgment, Mr Justice Marais said the sentences should act as a deterrent to those intent on taking the law into their own hands. Those sentenced to death are Petrus Matthews, Marthinus van der Schyff, Frederik Badenhorst, Marius Visser, Karel Meiring and Andre Visser. A seventh accused, Gerhardus Diederichs, was sentenced to seven years in prison for each of the four murder charges, to run concurrently, and an effective additional ten years imprisonment on a range of other charges.
