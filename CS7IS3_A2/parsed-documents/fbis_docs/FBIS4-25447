The official in charge said: The "procedures" were formulated in April 1991 by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations Committee. To accommodate the changes resulting from the state's financial and taxation system reform and from the adjustments in import duties, and to better implement the state's industrial policy, the State Council's Tariffs Regulations Committee, based on State Council Decrees 134 and 135, made revisions to the "procedures." The major revisions are: First, the term "import duties," as it is referred to in the "procedures," has been redefined. The definition of "import duties" in the original "procedures" included customs duties and industrial and commercial tax. Due to the turnover tax system's reform, the term industrial and commercial tax has been canceled and replaced with value-added tax and consumption tax. To accommodate the change, relevant articles and provisions of the "procedures" have been revised accordingly. Second, automobiles and motorcycles have been removed from the list of taxable luggage and postal articles, and import duties have been levied on these items as ordinary import goods according to the "Import and Export Duty Regulations of the Customs of the PRC," to better manage imported automobiles and motorcycles and to better carry out the state's industrial policy. Third, the term "grain, grain powders" in the No. 1 "Table of Duty Rates" has been changed to "food." Fourth, customs duties, value-added tax, and consumption tax have been combined into one duty rate to simplify tax levy procedures. The official said: The aforementioned revisions do not affect the regulations governing the amounts of taxable and tax-exempted luggage articles of incoming travelers and incoming personal postal articles. It has been learned that the State Council's Tariffs Regulations Committee's office is under the State Economic and Trade Commission, and is responsible for carrying out work delegated to it by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations Committee.
