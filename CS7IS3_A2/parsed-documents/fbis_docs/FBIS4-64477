The treaty has not produced a monolithic construction and particularist interests continue to be represented. As for the granting of special rights, Denmark and Great Britain occupy first place. The FRG alone has accepted all the disadvantages that this "work" entails. With the Treaty of Rome -- which founded the EEC (25 March 1957) -- the participating countries only expressed their determination to proceed with integration in a way that would secure economic and social peace. Since 1973, the community has expanded its membership from six to 12 in three stages. As the number of countries increased, problems of coexistence began to develop, something which was overlooked in what amounted to integration euphoria.. Other countries are also seeking admission; East Europe also harbors expectations. At the moment there is even talk of a two-speed Europe. There is nothing that illustrates the difference between desire and reality better. In the end, the number of timetables [for admission] will be the same as the number of members. Sickness in the Head and in the Limbs If we view the pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, that is, the Treaty of Rome with its expansion to include economic and monetary union as well as social policy and environmental protection, a future European foreign and security policy, as well as cooperation in the field of domestic and legal policy, then the only verdict is: With the definitive participation of Kohl's government, a treaty has come into being that has finally transformed our republic from being a sick state into an infirm one. The requirements for a common economic and monetary policy -- in the form of high-level price and monetary stability, a public finance situation that is tolerable in the long term, the favorable development of markets, balance of payments positions and labor unit costs -- cannot be realized in the long term too. The imbalances between the economies are too great, and that is reflected in frequent exchange rate adjustments, that is, devaluations, since the fall of 1992. In addition, Italy and Great Britain have left the exchange rate mechanism. This then constitutes the path leading to a common currency. The Structural Engineering Is Wrong A further example of harmonization that exists only on paper is that of developing common social standards. This is another area in which Great Britain has accorded itself a special status. This means the sanctioning of substantial differences in social systems; Great Britain has obtained competitive advantages for itself that further endanger Germany's position as a center for industry. Companies are already transferring production facilities to Scotland or England. The conditions for cooperation in domestic policy and legal policy as well as the explanations in the final act are a farce from the German viewpoint. The FRG, which is subject to enormous immigration pressures, has been left to cope by itself. Of course, this changes nothing about the domestic political failure of the established parties on this crucial issue. The chancellor wants to be celebrated as Europe's architect. It is poor master builder who erects a building without making sure that the structural engineering is in order.
