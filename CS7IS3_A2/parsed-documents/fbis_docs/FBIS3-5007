"It will take one or two months to tap a few foreign partners for the second cellular telephone company," said Kwon Hyok-cho, president of Sinsegi Mobile Telecomm. "We will soon have contacts with the FKI and the Communications Ministry to fix the timetable for our new service." Sinsegi was awarded a 15 percent stake in the international consortium for the project at the end of two months of intensive screening by the FKI that ended Monday. Its rival, Kolon group, will have a 14 percent interest. The two large shareholders, which will share management, have to present a detailed business plan to the ministry by June 30. Under an agreement signed by the FKI leadership and the chairmen of Pohang Iron and Steel and Kolon, three to four foreign companies will be given a combined share of 20.2 percent in the "grand consortium" rearranged by the FKI and composed of over 160 partners. Kwon strongly suggested that Qualcom and Tactel, both American companies, with which Sinsegi set up partnerships for the 1992 and 1994 tenders would be assured of privileges as "they have high levels of technologies" though their contracts were nullified by the accord. His remarks are likely to invite arguments from former partners of other consortia which failed in the bidding. The accord just stated, "Foreign enterprises that promise to offer the most excellent technologies at the cheapest cost and in more favorable terms will be selected as partners." A total of 11 foreign companies in the three consortia, each led by Pohang Iron and Steel, Kolon and Kumho, vied for access to the business Foreign partners will be excluded from management. They will only have the right to recommend one member of the board of directors who will be in charge of technological service. The projected company will begin operation in 1996.
