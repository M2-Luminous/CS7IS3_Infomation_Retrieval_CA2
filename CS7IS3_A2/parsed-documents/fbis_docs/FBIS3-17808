At least as regards the DPRK's nuclear program, nothing came of the Sino-South Korean talks. All Kim Yong-sam's attempts to persuade PRC President Jiang Zemin and the other Chinese leaders to exert pressure on Pyongyang came to nothing. In response President Jiang reiterated the previous Chinese formula, which states that there is no point in transferring the issue of inspections of all North Korean nuclear installations to the UN Security Council, much less in taking sanctions against Pyongyang. Moreover, referring to the U.S. intention to site Patriot missiles in the southern part of the peninsula and to resume the "Team Spirit" military maneuvers, the PRC leader said that such measures could only exacerbate tension still further. Jiang took the same tone on this issue as the DPRK Foreign Ministry, which has described the reinforcement of U.S. and South Korean forces as a step toward war. While they found no common ground on the key subject of finding a way to resolve the present crisis, Beijing and Seoul were unanimous in ignoring Russia's proposal to convene an international conference on removing nuclear weapons from the peninsula. Neither side even mentioned the suggestion in their exchange of opinions. The PRC president considered it necessary to stress that the nuclear problem should be resolved not at a conference but within the framework of quadrilateral talks between North and South Korea, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
