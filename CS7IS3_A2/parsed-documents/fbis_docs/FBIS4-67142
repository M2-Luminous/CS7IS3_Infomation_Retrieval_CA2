According to coca grower leaders, 80 percent of their demands will be honored with the signature of the agreements at dawn today. It is hoped, however, that these agreements will indeed be put into practice. The negotiations with the government have resulted in one decree and two ministry resolutions. The decree establishes the equal participation of coca growers in the National Development Fund, Fonaral. One of the resolutions provides for the compulsory eradication only of new plantations; the second resolution, to be implemented immediately, provides for the open marketing and industrialization of coca leaf. The peasants, in exchange, have agreed to lift the road blockades. [recorded passage indistinct] This morning the coca grower leaders travelled to El Chapare and the coca production areas to announce the agreement reached with the government and to suspend the pressure tactics, such as road blockades, adopted by the peasants.
