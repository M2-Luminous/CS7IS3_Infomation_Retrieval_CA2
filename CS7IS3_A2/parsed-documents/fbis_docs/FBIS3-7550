Japan will present this plan to the other G-7 countries at a preparatory meeting of private representatives of G-7 leaders (sherpas), and will start coordination to this end. This was disclosed by newlyappointed sherpa Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs. Hayashi said: "Regarding talks on economic issues, it is premature to invite Russia as a regular member nation and to hold G-8 talks. However, concerning talks on political issues, it is possible to hold G-8 meetings in addition to the regular G-7 talks."
