"China values its cooperation and good relations with Russia, which were reached at a dear price, and desires that the peoples of the two countries live in harmony from generation to generation", announced Chairman of the Chinese People's Republic Jiang Zemin at his meeting with Kozyrev. The Chinese leader mentioned the high value of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992, and expressed his satisfaction with the stable development of Russian-Chinese relations, saying they were based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. "The maintenance and expansion of such relations is one of China's permanent policies", Jiang said. Concerning the trade and economic aspect of Russian-Chinese relations, Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Peng remarked on the great potential for business cooperation between the two countries. The volume of trade between Russia and China reached 7.6 million U.S. dollars in 1993. This, however, is only four per cent of China's overall import-export turnover. In connection with this, Li called for "joint searches for new ways of cooperating", adding that the Russian and Chinese economies are in many way mutually complementary. The two sides called for their bilateral relations to be raised to a new, qualitatively higher level. Kozyrev said that, as far as economics goes, relations of constructive cooperation imply a transition to implementing long-range joint projects and other "higher and more stable forms of cooperation". The Russian foreign minister gave Jiang Zemin a personal letter from Boris Yeltsin with an invitation to pay an official visit to Russia. The earlier-communicated invitation to Li Peng was confirmed and, in his turn, Li invited head of the Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Beijing. Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China, along with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's expected visit to Moscow, will set the stage for the second Russian-Chinese summit meeting, scheduled to be held in Moscow in the third quarter of this year. Kozyrev held a press conferrence in Zhingnznhai after his meetings, at which he emphasized the two sides' efforts to develop a cooperative relationship which is of a "strategic, long-range nature, not subject to vacillations". Answering journalists' repeated questions about Russian-Chinese military cooperation, Kozyrev said he has never hidden the help which the two sides have given each other, this was at least demonstrated by the presence of Russian Deputy Defence Minister General Gromov. "This cooperation is being developed within the framework of friendly relations and overall partnership", he declared. Later on Friday, Kozyrev, accompanied by Russian regional, district and business leaders, arrived in the "special" free economic zone of Shenzhen in the south of China. The goal of his trip was to become acquainted with this "Chinese laboratory of modern managment", the foreign minister said. Thanks to economic reforms and its ability to attract foreign investments, Shenzhen has turned into one of the country's largest industrial centres. This experiment is of interest not only for the far eastern regions of Russia, but for the north-west as well. At the same time, Kozyrev stressed, "Russia is not going to copy the experience of any one country. We are only going to take it into account when conducting our own economic reforms". Tomorrow is the last day of Kozyrev's visit to China, when he will stop over in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian. Afterwards he will return to Russia.
