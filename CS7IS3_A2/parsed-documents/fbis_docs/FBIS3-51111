He asks U.S. President Bill Clinton to provide for the deployment of a UN mission to Haiti. In an open letter dated 7 January to the U.S. President, the Fermathe parish priest reiterates his request for a total, complete blockade, including a rigorous watch on the Haitian-Dominican border, as the means of resolving the Haitian crisis. The international community must act effectively and quickly so the suffering of the deprived masses can end, says Father Massac, who enjoins Mr. Clinton to put pressure on the military authorities to restore the president-in-exile within three months. [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The people ask you not to encourage any reconciliation conference in the midst of a concert of gunshots. The fact is that the coupists do not want reconciliation. They want power through blood so they can plunder. Order and safety must be restored before any national conference can be held in Haiti. Secondly, the Haitian people are weighed down by an embargo on human rights. That is why they ask you to make the UN embargo and blockade total and complete, and to block the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic so we can be done quickly with the sufferings of the coup. Third, concerning the assistance of other countries in resolving the crisis, do not let the United States do anything by itself in Haiti, especially regarding Army reforms and military intervention. [end recording] That was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.
