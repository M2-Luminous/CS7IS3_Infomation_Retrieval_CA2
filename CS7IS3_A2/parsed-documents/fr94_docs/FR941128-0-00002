ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by adding certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee to the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because of pink bollworm. The interim rule imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those regulated areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN, and was necessary to prevent the interstate movement of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Coanne E. O'Hern, Assistant Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 645, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;6365. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In an interim rule effective and published in the Federal Register on August 30, 1994 (59 FR 44607&hyph;44608, Docket No. 94&hyph;082&hyph;1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations in 7 CFR 301.52 through 301.52&hyph;10 by adding certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee to the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because of pink bollworm. That action imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those regulated areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN, in order to prevent the interstate movement of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before October 31, 1994. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.
