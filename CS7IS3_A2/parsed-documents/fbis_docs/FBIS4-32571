This could be interpreted as underestimating Bulgaria, a country with which the Czech Republic has very close relations. [Havel] President Zhelev has already visited here, and I visited Sofia in the days of Czechoslovakia. We were not able to accomplish everything we had hoped to, despite the fact that President Zhelev and I have known each other since our days as dissidents. My brief visit is not meant to underestimate Bulgaria--precisely the opposite. Because I will be visiting Romania, a country where I have never been, I said to myself that I cannot be so close to Sofia and not stop over for a while to meet with President Zhelev again. In addition, there is a relatively substantial Czech community in Bulgaria, and a very strong Czech-Slovak club has been active there for many years. I am really very sorry because I always say that I am going to find time for my compatriots in your country, and I never could until now. [Bekhar] Is this the only thing bringing you to Bulgaria? [Havel] We are two countries that, willingly or unwillingly, have many common concerns. We did away with communism at about the same time, and now we are struggling with its consequences. You and we alike want to construct a real democracy and join the European structures. Both you and we have no guarantees that one day we will not make any mistakes. Therefore, the more frequently we exchange experiences and talk to each other, the greater our chances will be to eliminate the shadow of communism as soon as possible. [Bekhar] Experience also used to be exchanged in the past.... [Havel] Oh my God, you know I mean something else. In the past, we had a strange, imposed friendship, in which everything was clear and precise. Afterwards, when CEMA and the Warsaw Pact collapsed like a house of cards and it became clear that this entire market was an artificial creation, it appeared that we would have to construct something new. [Bekhar] And what is that? [Havel] I can tell you in one word: democracy. [Bekhar] This is clear, but you know that the love for democracy passes through the stomach. Therefore, don't you think we could help each other a lot more if there were a free and custom-free market between Bulgaria and the Czech Republic? There are traditions in this sphere.... [Havel] The Czech Republic, in principle, adheres to the maximal liberalizing of trade. I plan to discuss this subject in Romania, and, obviously, we will talk about this in Bulgaria, but everything requires time. A group of experts is studying whether it is possible to intensify trade between our countries. By the way, the same applies to Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. [Bekhar] All this could be a lot simpler if Bulgaria were a member of the Visegrad Four. Will you support Bulgaria's admission into this group? [Havel] It is not that simple. [passage omitted] [Bekhar] Then you think that no state has the chance of joining this alliance, regardless of its goals and structure? [Havel] I think that expanding the group now is pointless. Personally, I support small regional communities. This is the case of the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, and now the Visegrad Four. However, this does not mean that we consider ourselves superior to the Balkan states. It is just that you are in the south and we are in Central Europe. This hardly gives us any advantage, but it nevertheless remains a historical and geographical fact. The small communities can always react rapidly and practically. In addition, they have common interests and could protect them more successfully. [Bekhar] Do you think we should create a Balkan federation? [Havel] God forbid! I do not want to give any advice. At least I have not been authorized to do so. Actually, why should you not create such an entity? A new organization would emerge, and, as was the case was with the Visegrad Four, everyone will want to join. This is, to a certain degree, characteristic of our time. We are all nervous and are watching each other to see that no one gains an advantage over the rest by integrating with someone else. Everyone wants to join every possible organization, which is impossible. You have so many common interests with Greece and Romania. It makes no difference whether it is a postcommunist state or not. Greece is a member of both NATO and the European Union. It could be very useful as a member of a Balkan community or alliance; it makes no difference what it is going to be called. If one day the nightmare in Yugoslavia is over, perhaps some of its former republics will also join. Albania also is doing whatever it can in order to become a democratic state. You and Turkey belong to the Black Sea Cooperation Zone. The Czech Republic is not a member of this organization. It has no business there.... [passage omitted] [Bekhar] The former communists in Eastern Europe began to return in a rather triumphant manner. This time they are armed with rightist economic programs. Are you not afraid that the same could happen in the Czech Republic? [Havel] For several reasons, I think it would be impossible. First, Prague used to have the most conservative communists among the Warsaw Pact countries. That regime was so rotten and compromised that I do not envy its heirs. This is why they quarrel so much among themselves. In addition, there is no serious leftist force in the Czech Republic that proposes anything serious. The leftist forces that exist in Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary simply do not exist in the Czech Republic. There is a rather hard-core communist party, whose members are those who do not want to part with the illusions of their life. In addition, there are two smaller communist parties, with which it is possible to conduct a discussion of sorts, but they do not represent any electoral force or threat to anyone. Finally, there is another factor: The most capable and smart communists in the Czech Republic long ago became capitalists and vote for the most rightist parties simply because, for them, capitalism is better than communism.
