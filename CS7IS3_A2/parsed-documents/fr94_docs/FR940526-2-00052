FR940526-2-00052 FR940526-2-00035 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1698; FR&hyph;3555&hyph;N&hyph;01] Government National Mortgage Association; Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit AGENCY: Government National Mortgage Association, HUD. ACTION: Notice of GNMA REMIC Program Implementation. SUMMARY: The Government National Mortgage Association (``Ginnie Mae'') is implementing a new program under which Ginnie Mae will guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed securities issued by trusts, each of which will elect to be treated as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (``REMIC''). The program is intended to: (1) Benefit borrowers using federally insured or guaranteed mortgages by increasing investment demand for the single class Ginnie Mae guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') that are backed by these mortgages, and which will be the assets of the REMIC trusts, thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and (2) raise revenues through the receipt of guarantee fees by Ginnie Mae. The Ginnie Mae REMIC program will be implemented in two stages: An initial stage, which will have a limited number of participants and REMIC transactions, and a full participation stage. The statute authorizing the Ginnie Mae REMIC program provides for implementation of the program by publication of a notice in the Federal Register . This Notice is being published prior to implementation of the initial stage, and provides opportunity to submit comments. A supplemental notice will be published prior to implementation of the full participation stage, and will provide another opportunity to submit comments, after which a final rule will be issued. DATES: Effective date: May 26, 1994. Comments due date: July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this Notice to the Office of General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.
