SADF troops poured into the homeland on March 24 in a massive show of force and seized key installations following Ciskei military leader Brig Oupa Gqozo's decision to relinquish power. At the time fears were expressed that elements within the Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] did not fully support the Transitional Execitive Council's decision to install an interim administration and wanted to return Brig Gqozo to office. Brig Slabbert said on Tuesday that while the situation in Ciskei had calmed down, it was not yet "sufficiently stabilised" for him to consider withdrawing troops. "Most probably we are still going to be here until the election." He said his first responsibility was to ensure all CDF weapons were accounted for and that the troops were brought under control. An "audit" to establish what, if any, weapons were missing from CDF company armouries was almost complete, he said. Brig Slabbert said joint patrols had been instituted last Thursday, with SADF troops and members of 1 Ciskei Battalion each taking an area of responsibility. However, South African troops were still in control of government installations. The mechanised units from Bloemfontein and the Army Battle School at Lohatla in the Northern Cape, which spearheaded the SADF advance into Ciskei, were withdrawn on Sunday and replaced by an armoured force from Eastern Province Command, he said.
