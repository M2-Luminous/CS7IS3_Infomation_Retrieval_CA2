The government has allowed in its economic forecast for a 1.5 percent rise in domestic prices stemming from the hikes provided for in the fiscal 1994 budget, Fujii told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. The cabinet meeting reconfirmed the need to have related public utilities firms streamline their operations to avoid unnecessary rate hikes but did not decide to stop or squeeze the planned hikes. Considering rate hikes proposed aside from the budget, Fujii said related ministries and agencies will decide on these based on the policy reconfirmed at the cabinet meeting. "There won't be much," he said.
