FBIS4-27229 "dreas104_i_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 Cambodia Radio Accuses U.S. of Declaring War Radio Accuses U.S. of Declaring War BK2905141594 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia in Cambodian 2330 GMT 28 May 94 BK2905141594 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia Cambodian BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] In cooperation with the communist Vietnamese, the United States began its second war against the Cambodian nation and people right after the elections held in Cambodia by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. The military campaigns launched last July and August to seize the Stoung and Phnum Chhat areas were financed by the United States. Meanwhile, France was charged with the air transportation of arms, ammunition, artilleries, and the wounded and UNTAC and Australia were in charge of radio communications. The recent operations to seize Anlung Veng and Pailin in Battambang Province were also launched with financial aid and weapons from the United States, the allies, and the communist Vietnamese. These military campaigns launched by the United States were just the covert, undeclared war. After suffering serious defeats on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields, they started the open war in Cambodia. Over the past weeks, the Clinton administration hurriedly sent officials from the State and Defense Departments one after another to Phnom Penh to arrange the supply of weapons and ammunition to join with the communist Vietnamese in waging war in Cambodia. Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, announced time and again that war had to be waged in Cambodia. A U.S. diplomat also said that the United States should think about waging war in Cambodia. This is tantamount to declaring a second U.S. war against the Cambodian nation and people. In what situation is the United States declaring war in Cambodia? Which forces are being used as a springboard for waging this war in Cambodia? I. The United States is declaring this war in a situation when all Cambodian people both inside and outside the country are jointly opposing the elements rekindling the Vietnamese war of aggression against Cambodia, and demanding national reconciliation so as to restore peace and security in Cambodia. This movement is surging thunderously. No force can stop it. In such a situation, how can the United States rekindle the war in Cambodia? II. In the 1970-75 war, the United States used the Lon Nol forces as the springboard for waging its aggressive war against Cambodia. In comparison, the Lon Nol forces are better than the present U.S. puppets -- border bandits -- and Vietnamese puppets in Phnom Penh. The Lon Nol forces had enough to eat, quite proper clothing, and some political bases in Cambodia. In this second war, the United States uses its puppets -- border bandits -- and communist Vietnamese puppets as the springboard. A. It is no need to explain much about the border bandits because the Cambodian people know well that they are the lifelong slaves and henchmen of the United States and its allies. B. As for the communist Vietnamese puppets: 1. They are elements installed at gunpoint by over 250,000 aggressor troops of the communist Vietnamese. They have served the communist Vietnamese in killing countless Cambodians over the past 15 years. The Cambodian people know them as traitors to the nation and people and the out-and-out lackeys of the Vietnamese communists. The Cambodian people hate them and have jointly attacked them for the past 15 years. 2. The communist Vietnamese puppets are thoroughly corrupt. They have competed against one another in selling out everything, state land, buildings, tables, chairs, and so forth. In that case, what will happen to the money and supplies that the United States is giving them for waging war in Cambodia? This shows that the springboard that the United States is using in waging war in Cambodia is rotten like [words indistinct]. Thus, the United States will never be able to fortify this springboard. For this reason, in this second war, the United States will certainly face the same fate as it did on 17 April 1975. The Cambodian people are shouting: United States, do not wage a second war in Cambodia!
