[Shehu] Yesterday President Berisha held a meeting with members of the European Parliament's Foreign Policy Commission. After the opening speech by the chairman of this commission, Baron Crespau, President Berisha took the floor. He said that 20 months ago the chairman of this parliament received him at this building as a newly elected president. At that time, Albania had elected a democratic government after 65 years. However, the challenge it had to face was enormous. Mr. Klepsch assured me that the solidarity and support of the European Parliament and Community will not be absent, even for Europe's forgotten country, that is, our country. Today, this may seem a bit superfluous to anyone here, but I can assure you that my country has had a history of pure success during this period. For this, the main merit certainly belongs to Albanians who, though under more difficult conditions than others, committed themselves with extraordinary courage to the most painful course of the reforms. Within two years, they managed, with great efforts and sacrifices, to lay the foundations of a society based on the rule-of-law state and free initiative. However, I would stress that the assistance granted by the European Community has been vital for the victories and development of democracy in Albania. That is why I would like to whole-heartedly thank you for the assistance that you have granted and continue to grant to our country. President Berisha later briefed the participants on the current situation in Albania and the course of the reform in all fields: economic, institutional, and legislative. Berisha briefly mentioned some figures and statistics. Regarding the economic field, he stressed that inflation has been brought under complete control. It has reduced from 40 percent, which was the monthly increase at the beginning of the reform, to 33 percent in 1993. In a free exchange rate course, our currency is stable and has even gained a lot. The budget deficit has decreased from 60 percent to 10 percent. Prices have been completely liberalized. We have managed the complete privatization of agricultural land and housing units. During one year, more than 100,000 people have been employed in the private sector. Meanwhile, the privatization of medium and small enterprises is proceeding rapidly. Urban transportation has been privatized and we are trying for a large scale privatization of large enterprises, railways, ports, hydroelectric power stations, etc. Albania ended 1993 with the highest economic growth rate in Europe, an increase that can amount to 10 percent. There are some promising beginnings regarding foreign investments. As for the institutional field, President Berisha stressed that the heritage of the communist regime could not serve as a basis for building a democratic society. The government that emerged from the elections was courageously engaged in a deep institutional reform. Thus, besides the real revival of the government administration on the basis of advanced legislation, we set up an independent judicial power and the Constitutional Court. The infamous secret police were completely dissolved and this service was rebuilt from the very beginning. In coorporation with NATO and its members, we are carrying out a reform of the army. In the same way, the Albanian police force was subject to a deep reform and its staff was reduced by half. Of 18,000 policemen, it now numbers 8,500. The diplomatic sector also had to undergo reform. In general, the institutional reform has been deep and, of course, painful. However, we can say that its first fruits are positive. Regarding the legislative field, President Berisha said that we think that greater importance should be attached to the fact that today basic human rights and freedoms have become a permanent reality. Thus, freedom of assembly and association has been implemented in the creation of dozens of political parties, associations, and independent organizations. No one in Albania is convicted for their beliefs today. Albania has the greatest number the independent and private newspapers and journals per capita in Europe. Albania is not only a country of religious pluralism, but also of religious tolerance. Albania has adopted the most liberal system of free movement of the people. The freedom of private property is completely guaranteed. The rights and freedoms of an individual are guaranteed in Albania for all citizens, be they of Albanian origin or of minorities. Considering the treatment of minorities, Albania constitutes an example that I think can be followed by other countries as well. Closing his speech, President Berisha thanked those present and expressed his gratitude for the encouragement the council and the commission gave in their 9 February resolution to bring to the European Parliament the proposals on Albania's associate membership of the European Union as soon as possible. He continued to say that he considered the commission's support for the aspirations of integrating Albania into Europe to be not only very important for Albania, but also a valuable contribution to establishing peace in the Balkans, to encouraging the Europeanization of this turbulent region between West and East, and to achieving stability on our continent. Berisha later had a long conversation with the members of this commission and answered the participants' many questions. At 1945 yesterday Berisha had a meeting with European Parliament President Egon Klepsch. To honor President Berisha, Klepsch hosted a dinner after the meeting, attended by the members of the Albanian delegation and many members of the European Parliament. This morning, President Berisha was invited to a meeting with CNN television. Berisha answered the varied and numerous questions posed to him.
