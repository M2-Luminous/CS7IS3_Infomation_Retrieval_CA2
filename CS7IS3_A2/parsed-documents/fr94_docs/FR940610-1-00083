FR940610-1-00083 FR940610-1-00008 The three scenarios estimate impacts using current market prices for foods available and in use by schools. To the extent that products are reformulated to provide additional lower-fat products or lower-fat products become more widely available and affordable, the market impacts would change. The scenarios do not assume any product innovations. Similarly, food preparation techniques will play an important role in how the proposal would be implemented. Using lower fat preparation techniques would enable schools to continue to use foods at current levels because fat added during preparation would be reduced. No single set of assumptions can adequately describe impacts under the proposed regulation. Schools have tremendous flexibility under nutrient standard menu planning to meet the dietary guidelines using the methods most appropriate to their circumstances. Schools can alter the mix of foods served within and among commodity groups. Changes in food preparation techniques could produce significant improvements in the nutritional profile of meals without any changes in the types of foods served. The model and the three scenarios examined show that changes in food preparation techniques for one commodity group can alter the results for other commodity groups. This occurs because the nutrient and cost targets are fixed. Nutritional improvement for one commodity group, such as a reduction in fat, both leaves more flexibility for other commodity groups to provide that food component within the established target, and, in the case of reduction of fat, required additional calories from some source to meet the calorie target. The first scenario, ``Minimum change in current offerings'', established the amounts of foods from each of 52 groups required to meet the dietary, cost, and milk requirements with as little deviation as possible from the current eating choices of the children. It also required the consumption of low-fat, medium-fat and whole milk to stay at the same levels as current consumption. The 52 groups include separate groups for high and low fat versions of food items and dishes. This scenario allows for substitutions among these and other groups. The second scenario, using poultry as the example, shows how the results change if lower fat preparation techniques were used in one food category while holding food preparation techniques in other categories constant. High-fat poultry preparation techniques (such as chicken nuggets) were entirely replaced with lower fat techniques (such as baked or broiled chicken parts). As noted previously, other commodities might show similar changes if substitutions were made between high and low fat alternatives. For the third scenario, the analysis model was modified to present a ``No change in commodity markets'' scenario where food commodity groups were restricted to their current level of use in the NSLP (with the exception of butter). The consumption of the various foods served were allowed to fluctuate within the commodity groups. For example, beef could be consumed alone or in a mixture such as lasagna, but the total level of beef served was required to be the same as is currently being served. In general, this adaptation required that low-fat foods be chosen within food groups. Notable exceptions included serving high-fat chicken and potatoes, probably due to the need to obtain sufficient calories. Also, the cost became more of a constraining factor in this scenario. Many of the higher fat or costly foods were eliminated from the solution. Some of the changes included: •Serving milk containing less than 17 percent of kilocalories from fat (skim and one-percent); •Serving beef in mixtures such as chili rather than as roasts, steaks, or hamburger patties; •Serving low-fat pork products such as ham instead of ribs or bacon; •Serving more meal mixtures such as chili and fewer grain mixtures such as pizza; and •Serving more fruits and less fruit juices.
