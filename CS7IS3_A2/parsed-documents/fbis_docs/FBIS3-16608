Levits noted that the publication contradicts with the international regulations which do not provide for publication of agreements not yet signed. The above mentioned announcement was made responding to Latvian National Independence Movement's (LNIM) claim that the Saeima must acquaint the deputies within 24 hours with all agreements parafied [as received] during interstate talks with Russia. Latvian Way faction leader Andrejs Pantelejevs said at the plenary meeting he was surprised that Fatherland and Freedom, and LNIM factions have asked people to picket without even knowing the contents of the agreements. After returning from the round of talks in Moscow, Latvian delegation head, Martins Virsis, said Tuesday at a press briefing that the agreements will be made accessible only after they will be discussed by the Latvian Government.
