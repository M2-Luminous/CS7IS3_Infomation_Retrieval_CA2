It is now "more than mere hope" that housing construction and exports will contribute to a recovery of the economy. A decline of the inflation rate below 3 percent in the course of the year is also "within reach." Rexrodt demanded that the "path of moderate wage settlements and of the consolidation of the budget should be continued." This would make possible further interest rate reductions.
