The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander for Bosnia, British General Michael Rose, on Tuesday said that the Gorazde Moslems are continuing unprovoked attacks on the Bosnian Serb army. U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been demilitarized. Instead, this Moslem enclave served as the startingpoint for a 10,000-strong Moslem offensive on Serb territories in late March. At the same time, in northern Bosnia seven civilians were on Wednesday wounded seriously and four only slightly in a Moslem mortar attack on the city of Doboj, the Bosnian Serb military sources said. The Moslems mounted artillery and mortar attacks on the Bosnian Serb army in the region of Mount Ozren, close to Gradiska, Orasje and Novigrad (northern Bosnia), Srbobran and Olovo (central Bosnia), Bihac (western Bosnia) and in the region of Mt. Majevica (northeast Bosnia). In the Sarajevo area, the Bosnian Serb army repelled a strong Moslem infantry attack, while infantry fire was opened from the Moslem-controlled part of Sarajevo on the Serb parts of the city, it is said. All these attacks are a part of a Moslem offensive on almost all parts of RS with the aim of seizing as much as possible territories before a final political solution is reached.
