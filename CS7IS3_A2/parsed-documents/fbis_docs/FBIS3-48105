The article headlined "Guarantee for Moving Up Bright Future of Mankind" reads in part: The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address said if the progressive people of the world promote historical development by strengthening their unity and solidarity under the banner of independence against imperialism, they shall soon be able to shape a bright future for humanity. The imperialists are now intensifying political, economic and military pressure to stifle the countries going forward under the banner of socialism and are intensifying their maneuverings to dominate and interfere in the affairs of the developing countries aspiring after socialism. To strengthen unity and solidarity is a firm guarantee for the world progressive people to smash the imperialists' moves. It stands out with greater urgency because the imperialist reactionaries are becoming undisguised in their attempt to beat one by one the progressive countries advancing toward independence, sovereignty and socialism. Unity and solidarity are a most powerful weapon for the cause of independence, the cause of socialism, and a decisive guarantee for victory. To strengthen it, it is essential to adhere to the principle of independence, equality and mutual respect. It is necessary to strengthen the unity and solidarity of the revolutionary parties struggling for the victory of the cause of independence, the cause of socialism, of the popular masses. The Pyongyang declaration serves as a banner under which international unity and solidarity can be strengthened in the struggle for socialism. Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea of the foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people value their unity and solidarity with all the progressive people of the world aspiring after independence, sovereignty and socialism and will, in the future, too, give strong impetus to the trend of history by strengthening unity and solidarity with them.
