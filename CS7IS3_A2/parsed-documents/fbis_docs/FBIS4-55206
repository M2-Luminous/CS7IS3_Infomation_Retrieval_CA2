Miklos Duray pointed out that "whether we like it or not, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is the successor party of Kadar's Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]." Miklos Duray thinks that the reason behind the big success of the MSZP is that some of the voters find the change in the regime too difficult. In his view, "the MSZP slogans on professional governing are not convincing, because the MSZP cannot make wonders either if it wants to continue the market economy, the change in the regime, and catching up with the West." Regarding the relations between the ethnic Hungarians beyond our borders and Budapest, Duray draws a line between the MSZP and the other five parties that have made it into Parliament. He reminds the readers that it was the MSZP alone that categorically criticized the late prime minister Jozsef Antall's declaration at the time, namely that he felt like the prime minister of 15 million Hungarians in spirit, and it was only the MSZP that categorically placed the issue of signing a basic treaty with our neighbors on the agenda as a first point, leaving the issue of settling the situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad as a second point. Well before the elections, Duray told us that the relations between the ethnic Hungarians living abroad and Budapest will cool down if the MSZP gets into power. He repeated this opinion in his telephone interview on 9 May: "If the MSZP continues to follow this position, the relations will definitely become cooler, similarly to the Kadar period" -- said Duray. However, Duray did not think that the MSZP would form a government alone and so, "the coalition partner can also have a say in this matter." The Slovak partner of the MSZP, the Party of the Democratic Left, has not yet taken upon itself to evaluate the elections. However, party chairman Peter Weiss does not find the presence of trade union leaders in Parliament a dangerous phenomenon. In its position, the Hungarian Civic Party points out the following: It became clear that the people want basic changes; they are more interested in the future, rather than the constant threat of past sins. The victory of the MSZP does not mean a radical change in Hungary's domestic and foreign policy; perhaps, this policy will only be more transparent, professional, and confident. A calm and balanced social-liberal government can also create the conditions for settling Hungary's relations with its neighbors; consequently, Hungary could also deal with the problem of ethnic Hungarians living abroad from the position of tangible results -- the position states. Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, the head of the parliamentary group Coexistence, told MAGYAR HIRLAP that the contacts of his movement with the new government will obviously not be so good as with the MDF government, because their relations with the MDF were "more than just official contacts." The principled position of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] is that it refrains from judging the Hungarian parties from an ideological viewpoint and it sticks to its goal of building good contacts with the prevailing Hungarian government -- Janos Vekas, deputy chairman of the VMDK told MAGYAR HIRLAP. Vekas told us that they have had correct relations with the MSZP so far and the fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn was the first to support the VMDK after the crisis that developed in the wake of the general meeting in Zenta meant a lot to the VMDK. "We participated in several conferences organized by the socialists, conferences dealing with the issue of national minority autonomy. We think the MSZP has been a correct partner so far" -- Vekas said. "The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian] and the ethnic Hungarians living in Romania are following the Hungarian elections with great interest; it is in our interest to have a politically stable Hungary with a strong economy to support us, a country that can and wants to support the ideas of the Hungarians living abroad and the concepts of their legitimate organizations" -- RMDSZ chairman Bela Marko told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He stressed, however, that he does not want to make predictions or evaluations between the two rounds of elections. In Marko's view, we must start from the premise that every major political party in Hungary accepted the need to settle the situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad as a basic principle. This is a nationwide interest, one considered by any future government, and one that the Hungarian foreign policy will always have to represent. "We know the programs of various parties and, based on this knowledge, we can say that care for the ethnic Hungarians living beyond Hungary's borders appears in every program. Naturally, there can be tactical differences. In our view, in the case of ethnic Hungarians living abroad, and especially in the case of Hungarians in Transylvania, we must start from the premise that it is first of all the task of the elected organization of these minorities to decide what solutions they find positive. Seeking, supporting, and implementing these solutions could basically contribute to an adequate settling of the problems prevailing between our countries" -- Bela Marko said.
