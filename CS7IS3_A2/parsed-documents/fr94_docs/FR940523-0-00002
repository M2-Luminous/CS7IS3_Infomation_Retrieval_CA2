FR940523-0-00002 FR940523-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 532 RIN 3206&hyph;AF62 Prevailing Rate Systems; Definition of Travis and Burnet Counties, TX, to Other NAF Wage Areas AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Travis, Texas, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Federal Wage System wage area. The Travis NAF wage area is composed of Travis County, Texas (survey area), and Burnet County, Texas (area of application). This regulation redefines Travis County, Texas, to the Bexer, Texas, NAF wage area as an area of application and Burnet County, Texas, to the Bell, Texas, NAF wage area as an area of application. Because of downsizing associated with a scheduled base closure, the Travis NAF wage area did not have the required minimum of 26 NAF wage employees within the survey area, and no local activity within the Travis NAF wage area had the capability to conduct a wage survey. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brenda Roberts, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 30, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 45413) to abolish the Travis, Texas, NAF wage area and define it to other NAF wage areas for pay-setting purposes. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is being adopted as a final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.

Accordingly, under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5343, the interim rule amending 5 CFR part 532 published on August 30, 1993 (58 FR 45413) is adopted as final without any changes.
