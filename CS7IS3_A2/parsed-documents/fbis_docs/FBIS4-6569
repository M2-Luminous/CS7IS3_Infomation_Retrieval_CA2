FBIS4-6569 "dreas078_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Patriot Deployment Condemned as `Grave Threat' Patriot Deployment Condemned as `Grave Threat' SK2204111894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1100 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204111894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["U.S. Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists Thursday [21 April] began to deploy new-type Patriot missiles in the central sector of the front after shipping them into South Korea despite the resolute protest and denunciation from the Korean people and broad world public, according to Seoul-based radio No. 1. This is an open challenge to the DPRK. It is aimed at posing military threat to the DPRK and mounting a preemptive strike on it. The United States began to deploy the Patriot in the central sector of the front, while crying over "threat of attack" from the North. This is a dangerous, deliberate military action to make the situation on the Korean peninsula more unstable and, further, ignite a new war. The deployment of Patriot missiles in broad daylight shows that the U.S. authorities remain indifferent to the armistice agreement and the armistice body and readily reverse any commitment in order to attain their aggressive design. The U.S. imperialists must act with discretion, clearly mindful what grave consequences would arise from the deployment of the Patriot in South Korea which poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far East.
