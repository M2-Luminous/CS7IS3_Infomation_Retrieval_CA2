The resolution said serious apprehensions have been roused worldwide as the United States, Japan, South Korea and some other quarters created a grave situation on the Korean peninsula on the pretext of the "North' nuclear problem". It expressed support to the DPRK' position on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and dialogue, saying they affirm their solidarity for the DPRK's policy of peaceful reunification. The National Executive Committee of the Mariateguista United Party of Peru adopted a resolution on the Korean question on March 1. The resolution said the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" is a significant, highly important guideline for the reunification of the country. Noting that it is the aspiration of the international community and the world people to eliminate all the nuclear weapons and realize the denuclearization of the whole world including the Korean peninsula, it called upon the United States to promote DPRK-USA talks for a fair solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
