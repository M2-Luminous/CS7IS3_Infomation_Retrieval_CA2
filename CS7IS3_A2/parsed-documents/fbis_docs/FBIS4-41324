It will permit the two sides to cooperate more quickly and effectively," he said. "Russia now occupies a most-important place in world events," Mayor continued. "And our cooperation with it has developed wonderfully in the past several years. We have a bunch of joint initiatives, among which it would be worthwhile to note those projects concerning the Russian state library, the Bolshoy theatre, and the Hermitage," the director-general said. "Our organisation's mission is first of all to preserve peace," Mayor declared. "Despite the fact that the Cold War is a thing of the past, our main goal on the eve of the XXI century is to abolish poverty and forever put an end to wars."
