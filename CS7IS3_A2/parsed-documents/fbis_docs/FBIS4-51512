Have you ever been advised by former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe? [Kakizawa] He has encouraged me. He also has advised me to work as hard as possible. He has warmly encouraged me. Even now, Mr. Watanabe and I share the same aspirations. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks were broken off. How are you going to deal with them? [Kakizawa] It is important for Japan to work out a macroeconomic policy and relax bureaucratic regulations to open up its markets. It is also important for Japan to flesh out the term "objective criteria," the establishment of which the United States has demanded. But Japan should not relent on its principle of opposing any numerical targets. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons? [Kakizawa] The coalition partners have agreed on a policy to deal with the issue, but in a sense, the policy is ambiguous. It can be said that with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] breaking away from the coalition, its ambiguity can be removed. Since our cabinet is a minority government, I intend to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons while seeking the understanding of other political parties. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about legislation to prepare Japan for emergencies? [Kakizawa] If Japan is ahead of other nations in taking domestic legislative initiatives, it would have an adverse impact on Japan's relations with other nations. I intend to deal with the issue while carefully examining what Japan should do to resolve the issue. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to handle Japan's bid for a permanent membership on the UN Security Council? [Kakizawa] I will work more aggressively than ever to get other nations to understand that Japan's affiliation with the UN Security Council as a permanent member will serve to reform and strengthen the United Nations instead of waging a campaign like election campaign to win support from other nations. Interview With Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has broken away from the coalition, will it not be difficult for the Hata government to draw a conclusion on the issue of reforming the current tax system by the end of June? [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have set up the Tax System Reform Council and the council has continued to study ways to reform the current tax system. Many of the SDPJ members share our view. The LDP has studied ways to raise the consumption tax and the value added tax since 1968. The coalition partners are examining the possibility of discussing the issue with the SDPJ and the LDP. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The enactment of a budget bill for the fiscal 1994 is being delayed. What is your opinion? [Fujii] The delay in the enactment of the budget bill should not adversely affect the people's lives. The only thing we can do is to ask the Diet to begin deliberations of the budget bill. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain stalled. What measures are you contemplating to resume the talks? [Fujii] The Finance Ministry has announced that it would voluntarily relax regulations in the insurance and monetary sectors. I intend to work for their relaxation. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa government was criticized for being led by the bureaucracy. [Fujii] I cannot understand why the Hosokawa government was criticized that way. I have continued to speak of the inevitability to reform the current tax system. My conviction is to reform the system. I believe that Finance Ministry officials will act in tune with my conviction. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and the issue of remittance by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea? [Fujii] Japan's foreign policy honors decisions made by the United Nations. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the current level of interest rates? [Fujii] Long-term interest rates have risen temporarily, but they remain at a low level. The coordination of interest rates is not the only policy to stimulate the economy. At the present stage, we have to calmly watch how the economy is moving.
