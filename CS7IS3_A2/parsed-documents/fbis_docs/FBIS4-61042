In recent days relations with Ukraine have reached the danger mark. Do you intend to undertake any efforts to avert schism in the family of Slavic peoples? [Aleksiy] Schism is always a tragedy, always a sorrow. And in church life schism is pernicious when people tear themselves apart and differ mainly over political, not church issues. We have felt keenly, and still feel keenly, what has happened in Ukraine. But we are glad that, nevertheless, 5,000 parishes have remained true to the church headed by Metropolitan Vladimir, and only 400 have broken away. Moreover, many of these are actually returning today, and a process of returning to the fold is under way in various places. We have granted the Orthodox Church in Ukraine and Belorussia autonomy in affairs of internal administration, allowing for the fact that the Orthodox Church exists in conditions of sovereign states and under the laws adopted in these states; but the preservation of organic unity is essential. As for expansion, the Catholic expansion occurred several years ago in the western oblasts of Ukraine; Polish Catholic priests are very active in Belorussia. And were it not for the process of the integration of Moscow and Minsk, the ideology of the Western world would reach Smolensk. We are not calling for crusades, but we must consolidate Orthodox eparchies and revive the parishes which were destroyed. Unfortunately, there were many parishes destroyed in Belorussia. It was supposed to be the first atheist republic. And this plan was systematically implemented. Therefore, the loss which Belorussia suffered on the church plane is huge. And to restore everything which was destroyed is not so easy. This is our task -- to return people to their Orthodox roots. And then it will be easier to counter the expansion which is going on. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] You have been talking with alarm for many years about the wave of foreign missionaries and preachers that has swamped Russia and the perniciousness of the spread of sects, but the situation seems to be becoming increasingly forlorn. It is obvious that the Russian Orthodox Church has proved to be unprepared for such strong propaganda pressure from all sides. [Aleksiy] Unfortunately, we are not on equal terms with all the foreign missionaries and priests who have flooded into Russia today. I have received many letters appealing to me: Surely you have someone you can send on to television; why do we have to watch Korean, Japanese, and American priests on three television channels on a Sunday? We have people to send, and we have frequently raised the question of being granted airtime. This question is moving forward, but it is difficult; meanwhile foreign missionaries and priests have paid for airtime up to the end of the year. The archbishop of Vladivostok recently told me that Vladivostok has been inundated with protestants from China, Japan, and South Korea -- souls are being bought. The highest price is a tanned fur coat; the usual is a humanitarian aid package. Once again we are not in an equal position. For instance, in the Cathedral Church of the Epiphany in Moscow the only thing that we are able to do for our fellow citizens for Easter is to bake and hand out around 3,000 Easter cakes to the needy.
