We have repeatedly and publicly said that if civilized, principled, and constructive dialogue between the political forces and within the democratic institutions of the state governed by law does not exist, then differences turn into disputes, while disputes are transferred to the street to be solved with the help of violent means characteristic of the street. Within such a context, the PD -- by itself or together with other parties of the current opposition -- has repeatedly invited you to discuss our country's real problems and to jointly contribute to their solution. This is the spirit in which in October 1992 we participated in negotiations preceding the formation of the Vacaroiu government, in which we adopted the PD Declaration of 14 September 1993, edited the PD letter of 3 January 1994 regarding the possibility of concluding a National Pact, and signed the joint declaration of the PD and the parliamentary parties of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] of 14 January 1994, which was addressed to the president of the republic. Numerous other communiques and public statements by the PD always reaffirmed its readiness for dialogue in general and for dialogue with the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] as the political formation that is currently holding the relative majority of parliamentary mandates in particular. Thus, it was with hope that we welcomed your letter of 4 February 1994, whereby you informed us about the offer of beginning official discussions between the PD and the PDSR. Unfortunately, your party's readiness is flagrantly at variance with all the concrete actions taken by this party, which are often full of hostility toward the PD and disloyalty toward the principles of a genuine democratic life. Despite this contradiction, consistent with our own proposals for dialogue, we are ready to begin the discussions you mention in your letter and to rid our minds of all suspicion. On the other hand, we believe that our country's situation is much too serious and decisive to conduct discussions in general terms as your suggest. What we need today are not generalities, but specific solutions as a result of our courageous and responsible exchange of ideas, an exchange without any grudge, falseness, and preconceived ideas. Consequently, we propose -- as, in fact, you do -- that the agenda include the following points: 1. Identifying concrete ways and means to immediately begin tripartite PDSR-CDR-PD negotiations to conclude a National Pact like the one proposed by the PD in the open letter addressed to President Ion Iliescu on 3 January 1994 and to form a new government; 2. Deciding on actions aimed at restructuring the current parliamentary majority and setting up, on this basis, a new government that is able to take our economy out of the crisis, put an end to the daily needs and suffering of our citizens, and reestablish our country's credibility abroad, and that enjoys strong political support in the process of implementing its reform program by a credible, stable, and solid majority made up of the PDSR (34 percent of parliamentary mandates), the CDR (33 percent of the parliamentary mandates), and the PD (14 percent of the parliamentary mandates); 3. The phenomenon of extremism in Romania's political arena; measures to isolate extremist pressure groups and preventing their access to the levers of power; 4. Guaranteeing genuine autonomy for local administration and working out tangible measures to stop any kind of political, government pressure on the administrative authorities emerged from the last local elections. Given the importance of the subjects proposed and the extremely urgent need to solve them, we believe that the delegations that are going to represent our parties have to be made up of people with political experience and decisionmaking ability; they have to be invested with full powers to be able to make prompt decisions. In this sense, the PD has empowered the political department to set up the following delegation: Adrian Severin, PD vice president; Victor Babiuc, PD secretary; Eugen Dijmarescu, PD secretary; Bogdan Niculescu-Duvaz, PD secretary; Cristian Radulescu, PD secretary; and Ilie Stefan, PD deputy. We propose that the first meeting take place on 18 February 1994, at 1000 [0800 GMT] at PD Headquarters in Aleea Modrogan No. 1, Bucharest. Looking forward to this desired dialogue, please accept the expression of our most distinguished sentiments. President Petre Roman 14 February 1994
