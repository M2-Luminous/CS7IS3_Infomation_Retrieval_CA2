UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said his agency's repeated requests to the Serbs to allow humanitarian convoys into the north Bosnian town have so far fallen on deaf ears. No relief convoys have managed to get into the enclave, which shelters about 100,000 people, since October 26, when two UNHCR Danish drivers were killed. Since then the UN has carried out food air-drops over the region, some of which have missed their target, Kessler said. Radio Sarajevo reported Monday that Serb troops had fired upon a group of people trying to retrieve some of the food but the UN, which helicoptered 10 British liaison officers into the enclave Sunday, was unable to confirm the report. The radio also reported that the Serbs had shelled the town on Tuesday. Meanwhile a UNHCR aid convoy was waiting in the central town of Zenica for the Serbs to give it the green light to head to Maglaj, some 80 kilometers north (50 miles). The convoy of about 10 trucks is being escorted by British peacekeeping troops. Kessler said although Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has given his approval for the passage of the convoy, local Serb authorities say they have received no word from their superiors. The Maglaj region has become one of the hottest spots in Bosnia in recent weeks as the Serbs intensified their stranglehold on the enclave, formerly linked to territory held by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Croat troops. Bosnian military leader Hasim Sedic said the situation in the region escalated last June when the Bosnian army and Croat defense forces (HVO) -- allies until then -- began fighting. The Croats subsequently formed an alliance with the Serbs in order to isolate the Moslems. Sadic added that since the March 1 Moslem-Croat accord to form a federation, the HVO has adopted a "passive" attitude concerning the fighting in the Maglaj region. He said the Serbs have some 80,000 troops deployed around the enclave and have helicopters and heavy artillery at their disposal. This could not be independently confirmed.
