[Ichikawa] If we look back over the past seven months, we must admit there have been many conflicts among the ruling parties and between the government and the ruling parties. These have involved such issues as the partial opening of the rice market, political reform, tax cuts, and making financial arrangements to cover the losses arising from such tax cuts. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, for instance, has said one thing while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has said another, and both were expressing views on matters about which the government and the ruling parties were only about to start discussion. It has been like having two prime ministers in the same office. However, the government can be said to have cleared a big hurdle now that some major issues have been resolved, and Prime Minister Hosokawa thinks it is about time he did something to improve unity in the cabinet. [Correspondent] When do you think the reshuffle will come, and how extensive will it be? [Ichikawa] I think the reshuffle will probably come after the revised political reform bills are passed. This reshuffle should be considered the coalition government's finishing touch. The size of the reshuffle will depend on what the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] wants. If it decides none of its current six ministers should be changed, it will be a minor reshuffle. As far as Komeito is concerned, we have no plans to change our existing cabinet members. However, if other parties in the coalition decide to change their people, we might think about realigning the Komeito party lineup as well. [Correspondent] Some coalition members have complained about your alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa -- the so-called "Ichi-Ichi" duo -- which they see as leading the coalition. What do you have to say to them? [Ichikawa] We had hoped that the SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party alliance, from which the prime minister and chief cabinet secretary were chosen, would become the axis of the coalition. But they have failed to fulfill that leading role over the past seven months. As a result, Shinseito and Komeito have had to play major roles in leading the coalition. Ruling parties simply cannot put off taking action on pending issues and then pretend these issues have been resolved. So, Mr. Ozawa and I have had to make decisions. Of course, we have also tried to take care not to hurt the SDPJ too much. [Correspondent] Within the coalition, people are talking about a tripolar political power structure, which means drawing a clear line between Shinseito and Komeito on the one hand and the rest of the parties on the other. What do you think of that? [Ichikawa] I think the idea suggests that Mr. Murayama, the SDPJ chairman, and Mr. Takemura want the SDPJ and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party] to take the lead in running the coalition and the process of political realignment. If Sakigake and the SDPJ are willing to use their leadership and not to run away from issues, we will be happy to follow them. But, in order to exercise leadership, they must first undergo internal reform so that they can agree on and adopt policies appropriate for members of the coalition. I think the SDPJ should first reform itself if it wants to bear the responsibilities of a ruling party, rather than talk about a tripolar political system or a realignment of political parties. [Correspondent] When will full-scale political realignment start? [Ichikawa] It depends on the following three factors: A strategy on how to organize political forces to fight the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; the selection of candidates to run in the 300 single-seat electoral districts; and the date of the general election. If the ruling parties fail to agree on a future strategy to deal with the LDP, political realignment will be delayed. If realignment proceeds without agreement within the coalition parties, the coalition will collapse. We are now in a dilemma. But by spring, when the new election law is enacted and the zoning of electoral districts is settled, negotiations to select candidates will start and at that time we may be able to reach a cooperative agreement. [Correspondent] What will be the main basis for the cooperation? [Ichikawa] It will be neither a choice between conservatives or liberals, nor a preference for small government rather than large. Instead, it will be the maintenance of the reform policy line. Now that we have a new electoral system, we have the job of giving life to the system and of seeing if it produces representatives suited to government. However, there is more reform work to be done, such as breaking collusion among politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, and changing the way the Diet functions. [Text] [Correspondent] How will the ruling parties deal with the simultaneous elections next year for local assemblies and the House of Councillors? [Ichikawa] As a matter of principle, the parties should compete independently. In local elections, the voices of local electors should be respected. In the House of Councillors election, electoral cooperation will be possible only if the parties can agree on a future strategy. In addition, the parties should at least share the same position on basic policies, such as defense and diplomacy, so as to be able to jointly support the administration. If the SDPJ wants to start talking about cooperation in the House of Councillors' election, we will ask it to clarify, by July or August, whether or not it still wants a tripolar system. [Correspondent] The government was criticized for its concept of a national welfare tax. How will reform of the tax system be promoted in the future? [Ichikawa] For one thing, discussion should be held openly. We failed to do that this time, with the failure largely the result of actions by a certain party. We will be criticized once again for being abrupt if we do not hold open discussion of this issue next time. As there is now, at the request of the SDPJ, an agreement to set up a consultative body to discuss the matter and reach a conclusion this year, the rest is up to the SDPJ. If it opposes a new tax system or an increase in the consumption tax, there will be no tax cuts.
