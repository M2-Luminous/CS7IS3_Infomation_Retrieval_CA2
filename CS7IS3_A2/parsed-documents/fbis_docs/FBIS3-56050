Ivanov (according to footnote, "The author of these remarks is a colonel with the General Staff. For obvious reasons, we have decided to change his name") under the "Letters from Garrisons and Staffs" rubric: "In the Corridors of Military Power: General Vanity" -- from issue No. 1 of "People's Army" section, described as "special issue for Russia's soldiers"] [Text] Arbat Square. A high white-marble building with oak doors, a large contingent of armed guards. Few people have an opportunity to take a look here. And even fewer have the slightest general idea of what is actually happening here, what processes are under way, and where they might lead. Meanwhile our fellow citizens -- the taxpayers, in the West's parlance -- are entitled to know all this. Right from the first few weeks of the Russian defense department's existence, the incumbent minister took a fancy to repeating that its apparatus would be significantly cut back. But what do we actually have today? The following figures were published not so long ago: Whereas in Yazov's time the Union Ministry of Defense had about 6,000 staffers, under Grachev their number has increased by a factor of 1.5 to almost 9,000. But even these "official" data are hardly credible. Because the numerical strength not just of the Ministry of Defense, but also of the Army as a whole is so secret that, in all likelihood, neither the minister, not his deputies, nor the president's advisers have any precise information. Some six or eight weeks ago, presidential adviser D. Volkogonov said in an interview with ARGUMENTY I FAKTY that the Russian Army's numerical strength was 1.8 million men. In the last few days of last year, Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, claimed in the newspaper SEGODNYA that our Army numbers 2.1 million men. At a press conference held literally the next day, General P. Grachev cited what he described as absolutely accurate figures -- 2.341 million men.... You must agree that this difference of 241,000 is quite a serious matter. It appears that the minister of defense has "found" 24 divisions somewhere, while the chief of General Staff has "lost" them.... You must agree: When there are such blatant discrepancies in the data used by the Army's top men, where is the certainty that they have accurately counted their apparatus? Thus, instead of 9,000, there might be 10,000 or even 12,000.... How was the concept of the current Ministry of Defense conceived and implemented? It was planned that, in organizational terms, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense would comprise the General Staff and command and control organs subordinate either to deputy ministers of defense or directly to the minister. It ought to be specifically mentioned at this point that the process of forming the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense was left almost entirely at the military department's discretion. This gave a completely free hand to the top generals (who resurfaced in the wake of the August 1991 events), enabling them not only to retain as many subdivisions as possible but also to create new ones. Even when the expediency of doing so was doubted by individual functionaries of the presidential or government apparatus or the Security Council. Incidentally, the control they exercised over the creation and reformation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense proved to be formal and ineffective. Grachev launched "cutbacks" in the Ministry of Defense by increasing the number of his deputies. Never before in the Russian Army's entire history has the military minister had as many direct deputies as Pavel Sergeyevich has today -- seven, to be precise! Each one of them, of course, has his own apparatus. Back in the past, Andrey Kokoshin's appearance in the ministry with the rank of first deputy minister of defense prompted sharp debates among the professional military. According to logic, this appointment should have symbolized a "weakening of the militarist spirit" and the stepping up of the military department's openness to civilian society. Kokoshin was assigned responsibility for implementing a new military-technical policy, organizing research and development, and ordering arms and military equipment. Since time immemorial, these matters have been decided by the General Staff in its capacity as the Armed Forces' "think tank," which actually determined the nature of the Army and the way it ought to be armed. The separation of these two functions was absurd from its very inception. Many top generals in the military department admit that, during the 18 months of its existence, the influence exercised by Kokoshin's lot on military-technical policy in the Armed Forces has been identical to "the influence of a fly on the speed of a train rushing downhill." The reason is that virtually all projects of military-technical policy concerning the planning and coordination of research and development, the planning of series-production orders and long-term research in the sphere of new technologies, and mainly the actual implementation of plans, have been swept aside like houses of cards by the gigantic avalanche of financial shortages and the downfall of the defense industry and its scientific and technical potential (to almost 50 percent of its former level!). Judge for yourselves: How can we talk of work efficiency in view of the facts that not a single ship's hull was laid last year, that only one of the almost 40 latest combat helicopters that the troops need so badly has been delivered, that the Russian Federation Air Force has not been allocated even 20 percent of the combat craft it needs, and that the manufacture of aircraft for the Military Transport Aviation has come to a virtual halt? The ministry does not even have the money to pay for the reconditioning of old equipment. Everything that Kokoshin showed to journalists during his publicity trips to test sites and design bureaus had been conceived and implemented long before he arrived at the Ministry of Defense. Unfortunately, during the 18 months of its existence, the work efficiency of this newly formed apparatus has not undergone a single in-depth audit, and it has been mainly bogged down in the preparation of many hundreds of papers, instructions, and directives, most of which have remained unimplemented due to the agonizing state of the military-industrial complex. The duplication of functional duties is typical of the organization of many of the present ministry's structures. Hence the excessive inflation of their staffs. The authors of the Ministry of Defense table of organization applied a flawed principle: They first created the directorate and only afterwards defined its tasks. Moreover, they lost sight of the logic of building up all the department's "stories." The General Staff, for example, has a specialized directorate that is in charge of nuclear policy problems. It also has the Center for Military-Strategic Studies, whose attention is also focused on "nuclear" questions. But the Ministry of Defense structure also incorporates the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. The absurdity of such parallelism is obvious. It is also very expensive for the state, since all the aforementioned subdivisions employ a total of about 300 staffers -- several dozens of whom are generals. And yet, according to the opinion of competent specialists from the General Staff, the tasks of these structures could be tackled with equal efficiency by just one directorate with a total staff of some 60-70 officers. There are quite a few examples of parallelism between Ministry of Defense and General Staff structures. We have already said that the General Staff includes the Center for Military-Strategic Studies. Its very name indicates that the subdivision in question -- by dint of the fact that it is part of the Armed Forces' "think tank" and by the nature of its activity -- cannot disregard questions of military organizational development or, consequently, questions of military reform. This is because reform is a strategic question of military organizational development at the present stage. But a Directorate of Military Organizational Development and Reform, directly subordinate to the minister, was also created on the initiative of the minister himself. Incidentally, it is as secret as the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU] when it comes to monitoring by structures of state power. It is no accident that it is also dubbed a ministry within the ministry. Many people in the military department today have realized with absolute clarity that this directorate is nothing but a decorative superstructure. The General Staff's scientific potential is sufficiently high to enable it to resolve with much greater efficiency the selfsame tasks that the minister has seen fit to assign to an "alien" structure. Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy minister of defense, is in charge of the Directorate for Implementation of Military Cooperation Programs with CIS member states. Another deputy minister of defense is, in parallel, in charge of the Directorate for International Military Cooperation which, in its turn, comprises an impressive number of directorate staffers. The selfsame deputy minister is also in charge of the International Treaty Directorate. A total of, once again, several hundred highly paid staffers who very frequently resolve identical tasks.... All these numerous directorates, duplicating one another, justify their existence by means of constant frenetic activity, which boils down to useless shuffling of cadres, offices, and subdivisions. Ask any staffer of the Ministry of Defense or the General Staff what he has found most tiring in the recent past. You will get a unanimous answer: The endless organizational and cadre reshuffles. One main directorate chief admitted that people are already fed up with moving from one office to another and compiling sundry statutes, job descriptions, and instructions. Over the last 18 months, some Ministry of Defense directorates have undergone three or even four changes of their structure, name, job descriptions, subordination, and numerical strength. The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Directorate for Work with Personnel is in the throes of its umpteenth fundamental reformation. This time, evidently, due to the fact that quite a few Army votes were cast for Zhirinovskiy. But this is not the sole reason for the perceived need to disband or reduce this directorate. There is also the following reason: "Soldiers cannot be educated from Moscow." By extension of this logic, it can also be claimed that troops cannot be commanded from Moscow. Here is another interesting question, often asked by taxpayers: Why is it that, despite the constant claims by military authorities that the Army and the Ministry of Defense are being cut back, the number of generals in the Armed Forces and the military department itself is steadily growing? There have been reports that Russia's 2 million-strong Army today has 500 generals more than the 4 million-strong Soviet Army. Do you recall how, literally a few days before the April referendum, the president signed an edict awarding general's rank to almost 150 officers.... Not a single army in the world today has so few soldiers per general as the Russian Army. Today it can be boldly asserted that the absence of real reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense, the mindless piling of some structures' functions onto others, and the unjustified inflation of staff strengths and the number of generals are the direct consequence of the lack of monitoring of the Ministry of Defense leadership's actions. The Ministry of Defense has remained, just as it has always been, "a law unto itself," a mysterious and inaccessible fortress in the heart of Moscow and Russia. It remains in the grips of cadre and management overstaffing, with generals manning the telephones of top chiefs, reading official mail, and being in charge of desk allocation, carpets, and light bulbs. This can be seen in the apparatus of Pavel Grachev himself, where the chief of secretariat (his office, in common parlance) wears a general's stars. And yet his work could be successfully tackled by an ensign or even a civilian employee. Or the office of secretary of the Ministry of Defense Collegium. Do you actually need a general to telephone all Collegium members and notify them of the time of the next session and then compile an account of its proceedings? So far there has not been even a hint, as the saying goes, of proper reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense. This is what has happened so far: The military department's table of organization has been redrawn on several occasions, the names of various structures have been changed, unsuitable men have been displaced and "their own" have replaced them. Incidentally, it ought to be especially emphasized that a primitive purge of unsuitable men from the apparatus is taking place under the guise of the ministry's reformation. Dozens of most experienced professionals -- colonels and generals -- have been taken off the ministry's strength in 1993 and subsequently dismissed. A similar purge is also expected now, in view of the fact that the Army and many honest officers -- cadre military men -- demonstrated their scorn for the incumbent reformers at the elections.
