FR940418-1-00017 FR940418-1-00004 ยง135.13 Determination of PC/UMS net tonnage. PC/UMS Net Tonnage will be determined as follows: (a) For all vessels with tolls fixed in accordance with ยง133.1 (a) or (b) of this chapter, unless eligible for the transitional relief measures established in ยง135.31 of this chapter, the formula for determining PC/UMS Net Tonnage is: PC/UMS Net Tonnage = K 4 (V) + K 5 (V) in which formula: (1) ``K 4 '' = [0.25 + { 0.01 x Log 10 (V) } ] x 0.830 (2) ``K 5 '' = [Log 10 (DA&hyph;19)]/ { [Log 10 (DA&hyph;16)] x 17 } . If the number of passengers (N 1 + N 2 ) is greater than 100 or DA is equal to or less than 20.0 meters then K 5 is equal to zero. (3) ``V'' = Total volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship in cubic meters and is identical to V as specified in the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. (4) ``DA'' (Average depth) = The result of the division of the Total Volume by the product of the length in meters multiplied by the molded breadth in meters. DA = V/(L x MB). (5) ``L'' (Length) is defined as 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel, the waterline on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline. (6) Moulded breadth is defined in ยง135.12(c). (7) N 1 = number of passengers in cabins with not more than 8 berths.
