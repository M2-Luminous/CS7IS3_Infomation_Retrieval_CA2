Levente Sukosd reports from Ferenc Kulin's press briefing. [Begin recording] [Kulin] We consider and have to consider this endeavor on the part of the vice president as being totally obvious, since we in the Cultural Committee in 1991 were the ones who very resolutely requested and demanded from the then presidents of radio and television the implementation of a radical cut in staff. [Sukosd] The list of names published today was a surprise for Kulin, he did not know the content of it until today, he said. He considers that this was not a politically motivated decision. [passage omitted] Kulin said that he believes [radio vice president] Laszlo Csucs could if necessary also convince public opinion that he has only dismissed editors who violated the radio's ethical code. Parliament is unable to deal with the matter properly until the media bill is adopted, however the parties' consensus would be needed for this. [passage omitted] The government and the government party are not responsible for the situation, said Kulin. The dismissal of the vice president, according to the law on appointments adopted in 1990, can only be initiated by the employer, that is the prime minister. According to Ferenc Kulin's information, Prime Minister Peter Boross does not intend to take this measure. [passage omitted] Because of the dismissals at the radio, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has appealed to Prime Minister Peter Boross to initiate the release of Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik, vice presidents of radio and television respectively. Ivan Peto, party chairman, gave an interview in Nyiregyhaza to Miklos Nagy. [Begin recording] [Peto] The manner of the dismissals, that is that they are released from work with immediate effect and that they are not allowed to work during the period of notice, makes it perfectly unequivocal that these are not austerity measures. The government wants to silence the still existing multi-colored voice of radio. The fact is that the Government wants to make a propaganda institution out of the radio, as has already been done to television. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] According to the deputy chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the radio dismissals threaten the functioning of the institution. Edit Schranz reports. [Schranz] Fidesz Deputy Chairman Tamas Deutsch does not believe that one can sincerely talk of rationalization in connection with the dismissals at Hungarian radio. At a news briefing, Deutsch said the following: Laszlo Csucs has been in office, vested with full presidental power, for a year. If he believes that radio staff have to be made redundant for economic reasons, just when the government submits the new version of the Media Bill, which is to regulate the operation of radio, then something is not right; either that the vice president is competent in what he is doing, or that there is no political cleansing behind the dismissals. You can hear Tamas Deutsch: [Begin Deutsch recording] The political intent behind the decisions is unacceptable for me. I am very sad because Hungarian radio's capability of functioning may be endangered, and just in a special period, in the midst of the election campaign. This measure has a particularly unfavorable and negative effect on the election campaign. But it also has a direct effect: Since it is a step which becomes a political scandal and a political stumbling block, it will obviously divert the election campaign, possibly for weeks, from the path -- which is normal to my mind -- of parties talking about their programs. The whole affair which is taking place at television and radio -- now especially at radio -- does influence the elections. However, politicians of the governing parties: do not entertain hopes! The past four years will not be forgotten. This in itself will not significantly increase the chances of the government parties. [end recording] [Announcer] The Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] considers the dismissal of leading radio staff, en masse and for an outright political reason, to be an open attack against democracy and press freedom. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the HSP's stance. [Nagy] The leadership of the HSP is calling on Laszlo Csucs to revoke his decision. Party Chairman Gyula Horn today rang the radio vice chairman to get information on the backdrop to the dismissals. In Horn's view, the individuals in question have always served independent broadcasting. According to the HSP, the vice president's measure unfavorably influences the elections. They are afraid that radio, similarly with television, will become a mouthpiece of the Government. In the HSP's opinion, the Government is also responsible for the situation which has emerged, since everything happened with the support of the Cabinet. Yesterday they even provided money for the dismissals. What will the HSP do in this situation? Gyula Horn said the following: [Begin Horn recording] If this decision is not revoked, and the HSP enters Government as a result of the elections, the HSP will immediately take steps to reinstate these generally esteemed experts in their position. [end recording] [Announcer] The Presidium of the National Association of Hungarian Journalists [MUOSZ] has received the news about the radio dismissals with indignation. MUOSZ agrees with there being a review of the radio's financial situation and with the absolutely necessary redundancies. However, the MUOSZ cannot accept the radio leadership sacking people for an outright political reason; by doing so it makes the provision of multifaceted and objective information impossible. These dismissals, which are unprecedented in the profession and which are happening just before the elections, threaten democracy to an extent which cannot be indifferent to anybody, the MUOSZ statement says.
