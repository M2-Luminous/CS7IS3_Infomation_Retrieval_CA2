The ministers called on the conflicting sides to conclude a comprehensive agreement on termination of hostilities and pull efforts for the achievement of political settlement without any preliminary conditions. They offered the Bosnian sides to begin negotiations under the aegis of the contact group within two weeks. The group includes representatives of Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. In the opinion of the ministers, the agreement on termination of combat operations should entail separation of forces, withdrawal of heavy armaments and interposition of U.N. forces. The agreement should be concluded for four months with a possibility of its prolongation. The ministers think that the U.N. force in the conflict zone should be reinforced. The fulfilment of the peace settlement agreement, including the troops pullback and separation, may result in a gradual lift of sanctions introduced by the United Nations.
