Russian journalists accredited in Seoul interviewed the South Korean head of state on the eve of his trip. [Kudasov] What is Russia's place in the ROK's "new diplomacy" now and in the long term? [Kim] Korea and Russia have become important partners in cooperating in various spheres, including the economy, security, and culture. That is why I believe that my present visit to Moscow will make it possible to strengthen still further the relations of friendship between the two countries that have developed. If you look at our bilateral relations from the historical viewpoint and with consideration for the geographical location of the two countries one can say that their role and significance will be enhanced in the future. I therefore think that they will develop rapidly despite the past associated with the Cold War years. I have long wanted to visit Russia without combining this visit with trips to other countries since I regard it as extremely important. [Kudasov] In your view, what could be the main result of the coming summit-level meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the political sphere and the sphere of bilateral trade and economic relations? [Kim] I have already met with B. Yeltsin. I therefore think that during our meeting in Moscow we will be able to have an open exchange of opinions on various issues. Our summit meeting with the Russian president will primarily confirm the fact that constructive partnership, mutually complementary relations already exist between our two countries. Thanks to talks at summit level the sad past in our relations will remain just that and a new era of friendship and cooperation will open up instead. President Yeltsin and I will discuss the international situation and the situation in the region, along with ways of promoting the development of Korean-Russian relations. Thanks to the current talks our countries will strengthen their cooperation not only as regards stabilizing the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, but also as regards their activity in the United Nations and in the international arena. From the economic viewpoint the Korean-Russian talks will serve to strengthen and develop real mutually complementary relations geared to the future. [Kudasov] How do you see the situation developing in relations between South and North Korea in the near future and can you predict with certainty any substantial progress in this area, including the possibility of a summit-level meeting with DPRK President Kim Il-song? [Kim] As our government has repeatedly stated, given the uncertainty over North Korea's nuclear plans no progress can be expected in North-South relations. In order to make this progress North Korea must first provide the international community with clear proof that it is suspending nuclear development work. If Kim Il-song does indeed want peace on the Korean Peninsula he should abandon nuclear development. If he is sincerely committed to peace North Korea should enter into direct dialogue with the South and should not strive to resolve Korean problems via the United States. The cessation of North Korean nuclear research is the only way of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula. Russia has hitherto actively supported our stance on the nuclear problem of North Korea and I am counting on that support in the future. [Kudasov] Do you not have plans to change your system of military cooperation with the United States given your closer rapprochement in this sphere with Russia and, in particular, do you not have plans to buy arms from the latter? [Kim] Our government's main position is that, in order to ease tension on the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary to strengthen relations not only with the United States but also with any neighboring country. Korean-Russian relations have grown even stronger as a result of visits to Russia by the chief of the General Staff of our Armed Forces and the defense minister and also the Russian defense minister's visit to Korea and Russian Navy ships' friendly visits to our ports. In principle I think that the sphere of defense procurements can be expanded. However, this question must be given careful study on the principle that this output must conform with our existing arms systems and their tactical use.
