FBIS4-62431 "drsov094_e_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Officials Interviewed on Black Sea Fleet Officials Interviewed on Black Sea Fleet LD1305111194 LD1305111194 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to Tajikistan at 1600 GMT on 12 May, in its "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense Ministry, broadcasts a 12-minute segment on naval affairs devoted to the Black Sea Fleet. An unidentified reporter begins his report by saying that he has just returned from Sevastopol, where he saw no sign of "interethnic enmity" either among the inhabitants of the Crimea or between the sailors of the Ukrainian navy and the Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet issue has become a media football, he says, adding: "The politicians have decided that the Black Sea Fleet is a joint one." But the sailors cannot understand this, he goes on. "The Fleet's traditions," the reporter notes, "like the pro-Russian leanings in the Crimea, seem to be stronger than political decisions. For the men of the Black Sea Fleet, and not only for them, it is clear today that the division of the Fleet will lead to its destruction. It is clear that the Ukraine cannot maintain the Fleet." There have been no new ships for years, he notes, and the youngest vessels are 17-18 years old. "The Black Sea Fleet is supplied by the Russian Ministry of Defence," the reporter concludes. The next item in the Black Sea Fleet program concerns the patriotic uplift given to the sailors by such measures as the adoption of individual vessels by Russian cities and the consequent provision of apartments in those cities for the sailors. An unidentified reporter notes that both Russia and Ukraine have their own views on the Black Sea Fleet's future, but that the opinion of a third party, the Crimean Government, cannot be ignored. The reporter says that he met with Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Crimean Republic. "Our conversation followed a somewhat unexpected course," the reporter notes. "It seems that Yevgeniy Saburov regards the Black Sea Fleet as a factor in the Crimea's economic stability. Judge for yourselves." The reporter then plays a recording of Saburov saying: "I was very happy about the decision that Russia has its own legal base for the Black Sea Fleet in accordance with all the agreements. That is a very good decision. It looks as though it really will be implemented. We have already become used to promises being given, treaties being signed, and then nothing being carried out. Let us hope that this time the decision will be implemented. "Apart from that, I must say that a very big part here is played, in my opinion, not by the military aspect, but by the economic aspect. Who will be selling any written-off ships? Who will the rent be paid to? And the reluctance of the Ukrainian side to allow the Crimea into the talks on the subject really does suggest a mercenary interest in making use of the benefits of the Russian proposal. It is only the Ukrainian leadership that is not allowing the Crimea in. "In fact, I can see a very large commercial interest here. It looks extremely unsavory, it must be said, and in a sense incomprehensible. The point is this: For example, if the Crimea received the rent, what would it do? It would be a completely legal matter, since Sevastopol's sewers, water supply and food supply...[Saburov pauses] This money would not go into anyone's pocket. It would benefit Sevastopol. It would remain on the spot. The decisions must be made to be economically justified and serve to benefit Sevastopol, the Fleet, and the families of the sailors who live there. Otherwise it will be spent on incomprehensible purposes and God knows where." Speaking about the Black Sea Fleet becoming a joint possession of the Ukraine and Russia, Saburov says: "A joint fleet is out of the question. Of course, we dreamed of coming together and of integration. We thought that there would be close cooperation between the Slav states. But it isn't happening. As for a Ukrainian fleet, without looking at all the other aspects of the matter, I just think it is impossible for the Ukraine to maintain it. There's only one solution here: It must be a Russian fleet." The reporter then asks Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov, deputy commander of the Ukraine's Naval Forces, to explain his government's actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. Kostrov says: "We must not take a narrow view of the problem; it needs a broader view. Either there are independent states or there aren't. If there aren't, then there is no problem. If they do actually exist, then one can talk about the subject of the Black Sea Fleet. If the Black Sea Fleet exists, then today it is legally and politically subordinate to two presidents." The reporter says: Rear-Admiral Nikolay Kostrov also talked about the establishment of the Ukraine's naval forces and the problems of their structural organization." Kostrov goes on to say: "Our naval forces don't come under any agreement at all, incidentally. The Defense Ministry passed nothing on about structures for the forces which have been formed in a vacuum. There were no structures. There were no ships. We accepted the ships that came, newly built, from the shipyards. We took on personnel that came from the Ukrainian state, and we slowly...[pauses] Russia, unfortunately, is not helping us and is trying to put pressure on us and to stop us from emerging, since we seem to be out of favor. There are many self-seeking things here which transcend the bounds of military concepts. There are many far-fetched political attributes that have been imposed on the Black Sea Fleet. It is a problem. It is all done artificially. Even at the latest meetings of the defense ministers -- you know their outcome, a very sad outcome, unfortunately. But one cannot act in this way. We must respect one another as Slavs. If we have separated, then let us observe the sovereignty of Russia and the sovereignty of the Ukraine, and respect the armed forces of Russia and the armed forces of the Ukraine." Kostrov continues: "I am Russian by nationality, although I ws born in the Ukraine. It is my home. I have no other home. Why must we now quarrel over nationality? We must draw closer together now. Since we have a real existence within the borders of sovereign states, we must respect those sovereignties. We must help one another rather than increase the front of confrontation." The program concludes with a recapitulation of April's events in Odessa and hope is expressed that the differences between the two states will, in the future, be resolved peacefully.
