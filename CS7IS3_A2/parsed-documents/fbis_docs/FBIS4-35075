Carlos Sanabria Marrero, our newsman in eastern Cuba, has details on this. Carlitos, we are contacting you again for an exclusive scoop. [Sanabria] Yes, Mejia. I am at the Santiago Hotel. Caribbean businessmen who participated in the second meeting have just heard interesting statements by Cuban experts concerning Cuba's trade policy in the Caribbean and their experiences, as well as the reality and outlook in the tourism sector, and the possibilities and alternatives for air and maritime transportation. Comrade Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the ANPP [National Assembly of the People's Government] economic commission, and director of the World Economy Research Center, is here with me in front of Radio Rebelde's microphones. We will hear his opinion about developments at the second businessmen's meeting. [Martinez] I believe that, without resorting to rhetoric, I can assert that this event is undoubtedly a success. The event is being held practically on the eve of the Association of Caribbean States' [ACS] creation, which marks a new and higher event in the area's integration efforts. [Sanabria] According to some businessmen -- even according to what former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said in his speech at the event's opening -- it is predicted that the association will be created with Cuba's participation. [Martinez] Yes, that is true. In other words, I think that one of the things we have to value about the creation of ACS and the efforts toward Caribbean integration is that it is occuring based on the Caribbean governments' statements that no Caribbean integration is possible without Cuba. This is really important. [Sanabria] Osvaldo, there is an equally important matter: This event will be followed by the inauguration of the third Caribbean fair -- Expocaribe 94. [Martinez] Yes, that is extremely important. The fair is practically a continuation of the businessmen's meeting. Bilateral meetings and negotiations should begin tomorrow between businessmen and Cuban enterprises and agencies. The fair will also begin. [Sanabria] This means that many of the things discussed here concerning the possibility of trade with the eastern provinces will be determined by the businessmen at the fair. [Martinez] Yes, I believe it is the complement. We are in the theoretical phase right now, which is obviously necessary. The fair will be the practical side of many of the things discussed here.
