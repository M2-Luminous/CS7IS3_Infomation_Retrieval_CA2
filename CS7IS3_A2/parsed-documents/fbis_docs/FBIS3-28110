Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting that if the rate is lowered to 6 percent, the amount of tax cuts must also be reduced. "Bond redemptions become impossible with a 6 percent rate, an 8 percent rate generates more than enough revenue," he said. Saito also said his ministry is "not thinking of raising the rate (on the new tax) in the future." Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided early Thursday on a new tax plan, calling for the tax cuts, including 5.3 trillion yen in income tax cut and adoption of a new "national welfare" tax in three years to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax. But the decision, which was made without the approval of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest in the ruling coalition, appears to be set for revision due to that party's strong opposition. Saito brushed aside reports that the ministry led the government to decide on the plan, saying the naming, timing and scope of the new tax were decided by leaders of the coalition parties. The ministry just answered their "technical questions," he said. With the political row delaying announcement of the government's economic stimulus package, which is due Thursday evening, Saito said he hopes the package will be implemented "as early as possible." Admitting for the first time that past fiscal measures led by additional public works projects failed to lift the economy, Saito said, "the economy remained weak" after only implementing public works projects and "we pin hopes on the income tax cut (as a means of strengthening the economy)."
