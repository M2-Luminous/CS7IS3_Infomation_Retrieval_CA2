Speaking at a seminar on international trade of agricultural commodities, Cargill president Fritz Corrigan said China and the United States have close economic and trade relations. He expressed hope that Sino-U.S. economic relations would be maintained and strengthened. He told XINHUA that during his meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington last February, he strongly advocated the renewal of China's MFN status. Kantor was generally in favor of the extension of MFN status, Corrigan said. He said that withdrawing China's MFN status would be unhelpful to Sino-U.S. cooperation and would definitely harm the economic and trade relations between the two countries. According to John Crawshaw, president of Cargill Fertilizer's Southeast Asian branch, the U.S. fertilizer giant shipped the first batch of American wheat to China in 1972 when the then U.S. President Richard Nixon made his first China visit. Cargill Fertilizer's business volume in China has topped 25 million tons over the last two decades, including the purchasing and selling of over 20 varieties of agro-products. Crawshaw said that Cargill has determined to invest more in China and would seek more partners. He anticipated that his company could complete the necessary procedures to be registered in China by the end of this year. Cargill Fertilizer, with more than 70,000 employees worldwide, specializes in agro-business. The company's fertilizer sales volume worldwide exceeded seven million tons in 1993. Today's seminar was sponsored by China's Ministry of Agriculture, Cargill Fertilizer and the Potash and Phosphate Institute of Canada.
