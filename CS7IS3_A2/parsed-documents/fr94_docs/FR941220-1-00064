FR941220-1-00064 FR941220-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Part 24 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1563; FR&hyph;3065&hyph;P&hyph;01] RIN 2501&hyph;AB24 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emmett N. Roden, Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Proceedings, Office of General Counsel, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, S.W., Room 10251, Washington, D.C. 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2350. The telephone number for the hearing impaired (TDD) is (202) 708&hyph;9300. These are not toll-free numbers. ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with Executive Order 12549, the Department, along with other Federal agencies, promulgated governmentwide non-procurement debarment and suspension regulations. The common rule, which is identical to the Office of Management and Budget's final guidelines, and the various agency-specific supplements to the common rule were published at the same time on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19161). The provisions of the common rule that provide nonprocurement participants with the opportunity to contest suspensions and proposed debarments and the procedures by which suspending and debarring officials make final agency determinations are substantially similar to the procedures applicable to procurement contractors under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR, 48 CFR, especially subpart 9.4 thereof). Although the Department adopted verbatim significant portions of the common rule, it did not include the provisions concerning suspension and debarment hearing procedures or the reconsideration or appeal of post-hearing determinations. In 1989, Executive Order 12689 required that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement activity under the FAR, or in a nonprocurement activity under an agency's debarment regulations, shall have the governmentwide effect of excluding the participant from both procurement and nonprocurement activities. Under current HUD rules, a debarment of a nonprocurement participant does not affect such person's participation in procurement activities with other agencies. In addition, the proposed revisions would conform the Department's hearing procedures to those of the common rule. The Department's departure from the generally applicable governmentwide provisions has adversely affected the Department's ability to process suspensions and debarments in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The amount of time and expense currently involved in the Department's suspension and debarment proceedings benefit neither the Department nor the persons who are subject to such sanctions. The Department considers these changes necessary to comply with the President's directive to streamline agency operations throughout the Executive Branch. The proposed revisions are also an element in the Government reinvention process at the Department. Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. No hearing will be conducted with respect to this proposed rule.
