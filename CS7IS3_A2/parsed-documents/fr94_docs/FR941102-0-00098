FR941102-0-00098 FR941102-0-00026 An outright ban at this time, moreover, would represent a radical change to the industry where the payment of cash or its monetary equivalent has become widespread. 44 In addition, banning payment for order flow has associated workability problems. 45 If the practice of cash payment for order flow were banned, because it is only one of many forms of inducement for order flow, the Commission has every reason to believe that an attendant increase in related ``soft'' inducements for order flow or internalization of order flow would follow. 46 Moreover, it would be impractical to attempt to ban solely soft practices (everything except monetary payment for order flow); such practices are difficult to monitor and industry participants would find alternative avenues for accomplishing the same result. The Commission will continue to monitor developments and will consider additional regulatory steps if necessary to ensure the protection of investors. 44 Some commenters favor a complete ban on payment for order flow; others favor a ban on cash payments only. 45 Opponents of a ban argue that payment for order flow is not illegal or unethical and that banning payment for order flow would pose serious workability problems regarding banning some, but not all, practices. 46 The Commission recognizes that in urging a complete ban, some commenters are looking to address a potential conflict of interest that they believe affects a dealer's ability to meet its fiduciary duties to customers and provide a level playing field for exchange and OTC markets in exchange listed stocks. B. Decimal Pricing The Commission also solicited comment on adopting a decimal-based system for the pricing and reporting of all securities for which transactions are reported. Some commenters believe that payment for order flow is, in effect, a reduction in the spread that a market maker charges for executing a pre-determined package of order flow. Under this view, if the NBBO is 20 bid and 201/4 offered, these commenters view the payment of two cents a share for order flow as little more than an indication that, in effect, a market maker is willing to buy at 20.02 and willing to sell at 20.23. Accordingly, these commenters believe that if a decimal pricing system were adopted, market makers could more easily compete by narrowing their displayed quotes, resulting in reduced incentive to pay for order flow. Others question whether the availability of decimals would, in fact eliminate payment for order flow because market makers still only may want to pay for certain types of orders ( e.g., a diverse group of small market orders) and, as a result, may not lower their published quotes. The Commission believes that decimal pricing is the logical next step for the markets to pursue to improve the transparency of the markets and provide opportunities for narrower spreads. 47 Indeed, as an interim measure, the Commission's staff called for the markets to move to pricing in 1/16ths in the near future. 48 In this regard, the Commission understands the markets have undertaken a study of the costs and benefits of changing the current display mechanisms. 49 The Commission looks forward to the prompt completion of the SRO study and the ultimate implementation of revised pricing procedures. While it is currently unclear how decimalization would affect payment for order flow practices, the Commission will monitor the progress of such endeavors and is prepared to reconsider the Rules adopted today, and even to rescind them if decimal pricing or other reforms render payment for order flow obsolete. 47 See Market 2000 , supra note 3, Study IV at 8&hyph;9. 48 In January 1994, the Division recommended the adoption of a 1/16th of a dollar increment as a transitional step leading to decimal pricing. See id. at 9. 49 On June 22, 1994, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing regarding decimal-based pricing and unlisted trading privileges. Panelists included: Richard Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Office, NASD; Edward Kwalwasser, Executive Vice President for Regulation, NYSE, Nicholas Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer, Phlx; and Brandon Becker, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC. Congressman Markey and the panelists discussed decimal pricing and moving to sixteenths as an interim measure. Congressman Markey asked the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to undertake a joint study, to be completed by January 1995, of the implications of moving to sixteenths (as well as decimal pricing) and the costs and benefits associated with the move. All of the SRO panelists agreed to participate in the study.
