Under the draft law, among other things, the printing facilities of the mass media are exempt from the payment of customs duties for the import of paper, printing equipment, and spare parts which are not produced in Russia. Publishing houses are also exempt from customs duties for the products they export. The mass media will receive a 50 percent discount on postal, telegraph, and telephone communication charges. If the draft law proposed by the Committee for the Press is passed by the State Duma, it will cost the state exchequer R1 billion. Unlike Chernomyrdin and the Ministry of the Economy, which have supported it, the Finance Ministry is against. This is understandable: It fears that other sectors will also argue their exceptional status and demand similar concessions.
