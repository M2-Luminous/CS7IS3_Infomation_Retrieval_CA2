You know the background. The information has been reported by the media. Today we will discuss this. [Recio] It is, first of all, one more confirmation that the U.S. policy toward Cuba on this much-haggled issue of human rights is based above all on a fallacy. It is founded, above all, on a fictional script that they wish to impose on Cuba to continue a policy of maintaining the blockade and doing everything possible to prevent the Cuban people from fulfilling its dream of sovereignty and independence. This case seems to come straight from the movies. It smells of the movies. Friendly hands have given Cuba a document which proves that SINA [USINT] has sent a letter to the State Department, the CIA -- listen closely now -- the CIA [repeats], and the Immigration and Naturalization Service clearly acknowledging that in Cuba there is really no evidence of human rights violations and that those who request U.S. refugee program protection must invent stories to prove that they are objects of persecution by Cuban authorities or have been victims of human rights violations. [Rodriguez] I also believe it is good to point out something I was reading in a news agency dispatch that confirms the ties between these groups, these minuscule groups as we Cubans call them, and the CIA, and how -- through USINT in Havana -- these groups are encouraged, financed, and promoted. Recently, thanks to my journalistic work, I had an opportunity to meet with several members of one of these small groups. I pointed out to them in my conversation that they are puppets of Yankee diplomacy because they had also told me they have free access to USINT. Every member of these groups, or at least their leaders, have free access to USINT. What they are truly seeking is the establishment of a biographical record in order to eventually emigrate to the United States. [Roque] The document itself is entitled: Actual Situation of the Cuban Refugee Program. The document states that the visa request process keeps encountering dubious cases mostly provoked by economics. I believe we must comment on this because that is the way it is. [Rodriguez] That is very interesting because the international campaign the United States wages against Cuba is precisely that the emigration of a significant number of Cubans to the United Stated is rooted in politics. However, Cuba has always maintained that those leaving do so above all for economic reasons. There is a difference between emigres and refugees. It seems completely normal for Cubans here to admit that they emigrate for economic reasons. However, the United States maintains that they are not emigrants, but refugees, or dissidents, or persecuted, etc. This document proves... [changes thought] They acknowledge: We cannot find a way to prove that there are cases of human rights violations. What we actually find is that people ask to leave Cuba for economic reasons. This is very important. [Recio] I believe this proves once again that those Cubans who wish to move to the United States are held hostage to that policy. I believe this has been a habit of U.S. policy since the beginning of the Revolution. [Roque] You spoke earlier of fallacies. In this case, I believe that the entire U.S. policy toward Cuba is full of fallacies, from beginning to end. Today we are talking about new evidence of the fallacy of U.S. policy toward Cuba based on the document which USINT sent to the U.S. State Department, the CIA, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As mentioned earlier, friendly hands delivered this USINT document to Cuban authorities. [Rodriguez] I would like to reevaluate this. We describe that policy as fallacious. However, I consider that adjective very mild because we are speaking of infamy. We are speaking of complete infamy because Cuba is accused, and has always been accused, of violating human rights. They want to place Cuba, in comparative terms, in a category with those places in the world where great human rights violations occur. It is truly offensive to be placed in this position, for them to accuse a country which, like any other, has made mistakes; but something that has never occurred in this country is continuous, massive violations of human rights, as a policy. Rather, the contrary is true. We can say this because the people know this better than anyone. They are witnesses that in Cuba no one is persecuted, tortured, or missing; no one in Cuba is a victim of police repression. Everyday, you can turn on the television and see how police organizations around the world massively violate human rights. You do not see this in Cuba. Nevertheless, the United States not only uses this argument against Cuba, they fabricate circumstances. Be aware that these groups, or so-called human rights activists, had been receiving privileges from, were living off, the USINT. They even had what we call here in Cuba that purpose [esa busca]. But not anymore. According to this document, they are even selling fraudulent claims. Through these sales, they are providing individuals with fraudulent human rights claims so they can present themselves for visas. [Roque] Renato, I believe we could even quote that paragraph of the USINT document addressed to the U.S. State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service that reads: Over the past months, accusations of fraudulent requests by activists and [words indistinct] testimonials by human rights leaders have been persistent. Due to the lack of documented and verifiable proof, as a rule, USINT officials and members of the Immigration and Naturalization Service consider cases on human rights most liable to fraud. [Recio] Juan Carlos, I believe it is important to reiterate this about the CIA: Remember that just a few months ago, the CIA disclosed or acknowledged for the first time ever that it had conducted several attempts against Cuban leaders, especially against the commander in chief. In other words, they publicly admitted that they have been behind the policy of trying to do away with the Cuban Revolution and making it disappear. Once again, the CIA appears here as an element that unites these groups that we could call Cuban opposition -- as they call it abroad, or as they present themselves abroad. Once again, the CIA uses various methods, but these so-called stupid children [hijitos bobos] have not been what they expected, have not been everything they thought they could be. I noticed that in the document, they made reference to 225 cases analyzed by U.S. officials. Of course, I am talking about the original document. The secret document that we were talking about was disseminated by the international press agencies. Of these 225 cases, they say that 47 claim to have carried out human rights activities. Nevertheless, only 19 of them were finally approved by the USINT. By this you can see that there is a generalized fraud behind this. They were taught to commit fraud. The CIA, which is unquestionably behind all these activities, was showing them ways to commit fraud. [Roque] I believe we have left out one important factor: the special rapporteur. [Recio] Juan Carlos, that is precisely why Cuba viewed the report presented by this so-called UN special rapporteur at the UN Human Rights Commission as interference because as all of you, and all the listeners may remember, Cuba never admitted the physical presence of that individual into our country. This man has been able to fabricate a report that adheres to the U.S. policy toward Cuba that has to do with the brutal efforts and brutal pressure the United States exercises to make the UN condemn Cuba. This document we have spoken about, its discovery -- in quotation marks -- or its appearance undoubtedly weakens the U.S. intention to harm Cuba. This demonstrates, once again, that Cuba does not even remotely violate human rights and that the United States is the main violator of human rights in Cuba; above all, by its persistence and the feats or brutality with which it imposes an economic blockade on the Cuban people. That is a form of harassment. As a matter of fact, this rapporteur includes recommendations in his report that to prevent the violation of human rights in Cuba, the blockade be lifted. Of course, it is a politicized way of seeing the problem. [Rodriguez] Renato, I have no doubt that the speech presented by the Swedish rapporteur was drafted and written and given to him to be read in Geneva by the CIA in the United States. He is working with a set standard that is being sponsored by the U.S. policy, and which has its actors.
