The document, which the former German economics minister drafted jointly with four other FDP political leaders, contains the FDP's independent position on government modernization, the economy, and society as a whole. In support of the new ideas, Moellemann proposes to conduct a "propaganda campaign unhampered by coalition concerns and commitments to political alliances." The campaign is to be buttressed by "independent candidates for high government offices." He and his co-workers are calling for a "lean government" based on large-scale privatization of government programs, "vigorous reform" of fiscal policies, and cuts in taxes and social insurance deductions. The social insurance system is to be based on individual responsibility. Speaking in Duesseldorf, Moellemann maintained that the Bonn government coalition has reached a low point in popularity. The polls, conducted during the past six months, indicate that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) would obtain "somewhat less than 30 percent" of the vote if the Bundestag election were held at this time--with the FDP obtaining about 6 percent. This situation calls for decisive action, he said. Legislation to shore up the national and laender budgets must be passed this spring. If nothing is done, this, too, would "send a message," Moellemann said, stressing the position of his party's leadership that a decision on coalition plans should not be made until after the summer recess. He said he believes that a decision on this matter might be reached, but this would have to wait on developments during the next few months. At the moment, Moellemann said, the political party landscape is undergoing a sea change which is why it makes sense for the FDP to concentrate on what it has to offer to the voters on its own. Moellemann reiterated his intention to vote for Social Democratic Party (SPD) presidential candidate Johannes Rau, if it comes to a third ballot in the federal assembly. He disputed the contention of chairman Solms of the FDP Bundestag caucus that he and chairman Rohde of the FDP caucus in the Duesseldorf land assembly are the only ones to have decided to do so. Moellemann's "proposal for a new liberal strategy" was co-authored by Rhode, North Rhine-Westphalian politician Tschoeltsch, and Bundestag deputies Friedhoff and Schuessler. The 39-page document was distributed to all FDP land organizations today. According to Moellemann, it is to invigorate the party's strategy debate as it prepares for its convention in Rostock next June. The priority goal, according to the proposal, is the creation of an "efficiency government" whose programs are to be restricted to what is necessary. This calls for the large-scale privatization of numerous public institutions such as hospitals, old-age and nursing homes, theaters, museums, and libraries. "Management" is to take the place of "administration" as part of "downsizing the bureaucracy." Moellemann and his comrades-in-arms are calling for a reform of civil service regulations and for the assignment of civil servants solely to governmental functions. The political leadership should set an example by reducing the size of the Federal Government and the legislatures. The reformers also call for the consolidation of laender and for letting the individual laender create their own budgets. The FDP politicians would like to introduce a "replacement principle" for future legislation, i.e. existing regulations would be repealed every time a new law is passed. New markets, e.g. information and health services, would require new types of legislation. All laws applicable to such services which hamper economic development should be repealed by the end of next year unless reapproved by parliament. Among other things, subsidies should be cut in order to "rescue the budget." As far as hard coal is concerned, the Moellemann document suggests retention of a "rudimentary mining capability" which could be expanded on an ad hoc basis to meet an energy crisis. The paper further proposes a simplification of tax laws through the creation of just five types of taxes, i.e. income, corporate, value-added, inheritance, and resource taxes. All other taxes, church taxes among them, are to be repealed. On social insurance the document favors "retention of basic benefits" but calls on individuals to make provisions for their old age on their own. The employment exchanges are to be transformed into regional "employment exchange limiteds" which offer unemployed workers as "workers for rent on the market," the idea being that "premiums for the labor exchanges and such workers are good for competition."
