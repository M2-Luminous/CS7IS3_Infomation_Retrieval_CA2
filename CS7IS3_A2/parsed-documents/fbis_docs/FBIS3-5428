MCA President Datuk Seri Ling Liong Sik said the decision was made after talks about the subject were held among MCA federal and state leaders and a detailed study was made of the party's chances. Nevertheless, he said, the MCA, which is one component party of the BN, will not be idle but will use its election machinery to help BN candidates, particularly in districts where the majority of voters are of Chinese descent. "All MCA leaders and supporters will work hard to give unified support to ensure that BN candidates win in this election. I believe the decision we have made will increase support for all BN candidates by people of the state," he told reporters upon his arrival here at noon today. When asked about the possibility that the MCA will give support to the Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), a new party formed in the state, he said, "Our commitment to the BN is clear. If they (the SAPP) join the BN, we will certainly give undivided support to their candidates." As for the possibility that its decision will hurt the morale of Sabah MCA members and their support for BN candidates, Dr. Ling said the matter has been accepted with true BN spirit. He said he has received pledges and undivided support from them so that all BN candidates running in this election will gain absolute victory. "MCA members agree that they still need time before taking part in an election, although support for the party is on the increase in the state. For them, a BN victory in this state election is quite important for ensuring that economic growth and development in Sabah moves smoothly," he said. The MCA expanded its influence to Sabah last year, two years after UMNO [United Malays National Organization] formed a branch in the state. Meanwhile, Sabah MCA Chairman Datuk Dr. Fong Chan Onn, said that all party members in the state agree with the decision that was made and have reiterated their support for the BN. MCA was the second BN component party to announce it would not put any candidate in the state election on 18 and 19 February. Yesterday, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced that it would not participate in this election in order to make way for SAPP candidates if the SAPP joins the BN before the state election. LDP President Chong Kah Kiat said his party will support the leadership of SAPP, which is headed by former Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee. It was reported yesterday that Yong said the SAPP will apply to join the BN before the general elections in the middle of this month. Meanwhile, Sabah UMNO Information President Karim Ghani welcomed the decisions of the MCA and the LDP as a willingness to sacrifice for the sake of the BN.
