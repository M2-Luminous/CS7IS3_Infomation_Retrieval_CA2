The CPC top leaders strongly and continuously criticized the television broadcasting of footage of Deng Xiaoping's sickly appearance on 8 February. In society, when people saw another face of the paramount leader, who used to glow with vigor, they could not help but sigh: Deng Xiaoping's days are numbered! A great question then arose in their minds: What will happen after Deng's death??? The CPC Central Secretariat has now given out the following message: Deng Xiaoping has made a five-point verbal "injunction," and the most important point was that he directed that: "After I pass away, you should consult Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Li Desheng, Yang Dezhi, Gu Mu, and Jiwei when dealing with important affairs." It was noteworthy that Wan Li ranked first among the six, causing people to recall a popular saying from the late 1970's: "Go and see Wan Li if you want to have something to eat." In those days, Wan Li was a provincial leader of Anhui and the province took the lead throughout the country in adopting the farmland contract system and breaking the people's-commune structure. This was a very popular move and Wan Li also won Deng Xiaoping's trust. It has yet to be verified whether Deng now actually entrusts Wan Li with holding the reins as Mao Zedong entrusted Hua Guofeng before his death by saying: "With you in charge, I can set my mind at rest." We can believe this is true for the time being. What is mentioned above was the first point of Deng's injunction. Before the remark "after I pass away," there was another remark: "In recent years, the Central Political Bureau and the State Council have been doing well-organized work and I am glad to see this and also feel relieved." An interesting fact is that on 7 March, when Jiang Zemin and Ding Guangen relayed Deng Xiaoping's "five-point hopes" to the Political Bureau, the Secretariat, and the State Council leading body through Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping's office), the first point was as mentioned above; however, on the same day, when Hu Jintao relayed this at a Central Secretariat meeting attended by leaders of the provincial and municipal party committees, some deletions were made. There was no remark about "after I pass away" and only two of the six people were named: Wan Li and Bo Yibo. The first point relayed by Hu Jintao read: "Henceforth, you may consult such comrades as Wan Li and Yibo whenever you find this is necessary." By comparing the two versions relayed by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, one can easily see that first, the CPC leading body did not want to make people think that Deng was going to "pass away"; second, they tried to prevent people from taking Deng's "instruction" as his "death-bed injunction"; and third, the Political Bureau holds a consensus of opinion on Wan Li and Bo Yibo, two of Deng's "bosom friends." Anyway, CPC leaders at all levels are well aware that after Deng's death, while Jiang Zemin and Li Peng are in charge of the government, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will oversee them and play the part that Deng Xiaoping is now playing. In the not too distant future, if there are no changes like those in East Europe and the former Soviet Union and no major changes with "Chinese characteristics" in mainland China, after Deng Xiaoping departs the human world, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will take over Deng Xiaoping's political status. Wan Li may not have the same authority as Deng Xiaoping has now but his hands are not stained with the blood of the victims in the 4 June incident and he is also more popular with intellectuals and ordinary people than Deng in terms of being open-minded. Many people have regarded Wan Li as a firm reform-minded leader for a long time. Therefore, if Jiang Zemin and Li Peng actually follow Deng's "injunction," the CPC will probably fare better than it does now. Maybe, this is the reason why Deng Xiaoping selected Wan Li and Bo Yibo as his "successors." Of course, the only way out for the Communist Party is to terminate the rule-of-man and one-party dictatorship and take the path of peaceful changes. Apart from the abovementioned point, which was also the most important point, Jiang Zemin and other leaders also relayed four other points: Exchange opinions and unify thinking inside the leading body, when handling major affairs and encountering major problems, and make decisions and take actions resolutely and firmly. Continue to consolidate and develop the system of democratic centralism inside the party and take this as a major principle; do not allow the existence of small "coteries" inside the leading body. Leading bodies at the central level and at the ministerial and provincial level should consistently inspect things in society and, thus, personally collect first-hand information. They must not be divorced from the masses while handling a multitude of affairs. Continue to maintain the independent and peace-oriented foreign policy as in the past, at present, and in the future; resolutely oppose and resist hegemonism and power politics; develop friendly relations with countries which are friendly toward us and respect our sovereignty and internal affairs on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and give priority to establishing and developing friendly, mutually trusting, cooperative, and understanding relations with neighboring countries. This should be our country's long-term strategy. Apart from the five points, Deng Xiaoping also mentioned the issue of national reunification in his "injunction" about what should be done after he "passes away." According to what was relayed, Deng said: China will not be really prosperous and powerful as long as the nation is still not reunified and Taiwan's peaceful return is still unrealized. Every one of our party members and cadres with the aspiration must not be arrogant and must not relax their efforts as long as this important mission is unfulfilled. What is noteworthy in the remarks is the term "peaceful return." Deng did not mention "peaceful liberation" or "liberation through armed force." It was sensible of him not to mention "liberation" but "return" because the people in Taiwan are living in better conditions than ordinary people in the mainland (both in their material and cultural lives) and they do not need the Communist Party's "liberation." It is sensible and realistic to mention "peaceful return" rather than "armed liberation" because, once force is used, the Communist Party will certainly become the accused in the court of morals. People who are keen to launch a war and to kill their own countrymen will certainly be punished by the 1.2 billion Chinese people and the people all over the world. The four characters of "peaceful return" [he ping hui gui 0735 1627 0932 2981] were rather noticeable, because this showed that Deng Xiaoping remained sober-headed, perhaps more sober-headed than before. This is an extremely important message for the Taiwan authorities and the people of Taiwan. In order to strengthen the Deng Xiaoping Office and to keep close ties between Deng and the Political Bureau, according to a proposal by Wang Ruilin, director of the Deng Xiaoping office, the Political Bureau appointed Deng Rong as deputy director of the Deng Xiaoping Office, because Wang Ruilin had participated in the actual leading body of the Central Military Commission since January this year and was responsible for the political and ideological work in the armed forces and the organization of the leading bodies at units at and above the division level. However, on learning that Deng Rong had been appointed deputy director of his office, Deng Xiaoping deleted the relevant words in the proposal and told Wang Ruilin: I object to this. This is improper. Comrade Ruilin is able to properly handle many things. Deng Rong often accompanies me, so she can be a part-time assistant in the office but no official title should be given to her. Please consider my opinion. Deng Rong's official title caused people to recall that Mao Zedong made his nephew Mao Yuanxin play the role of a liaison officer between him and the Political Bureau in his later years. Deng Rong is not equal to Mao Yuanxin but the traditional working mode of the Political Bureau obviously remains the same. On this point, Deng Xiaoping also has to follow Mao Zedong's example. Undoubtedly, Deng Xiaoping has entered the last stage of his life and is not far from the end. The CPC top leaders are aware of this but they still try to extend Deng's life. The following episode occurred in recent months: In mid-February, 12 senior retired leaders, including Song Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, and Chen Zuolin, jointly wrote a letter to the CPC Central Political Bureau and Jiang Zemin, requiring that the Political Bureau properly take care of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health and take this as an important matter entrusted by the whole party, the whole Army, and the entire people of the whole country. The letter said: On 8 February, Comrade Xiaoping met with Shanghai CPC and Government leaders when he was rather tired and the unfavorable impression left with the whole nation, the whole party, and overseas communities should not be underestimated. The central leading body was wrong in making such an arrangement. They proposed that the Central Political Bureau hold a meeting to discuss arrangements to ensure Comrade Xiaoping's rest and recuperation and to see that he was not bothered about any ordinary and routine affairs which were not urgent nor critically important. His rest must not be affected and disrupted. Reportedly, after listening to opinions from Wan Li, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Yang Shangkun, and Wang Ruilin, Jiang Zemin made the following reply: First, the Political Bureau will do its utmost to properly take care of Comrade Xiaoping's health and ensure his longevity and will bear the greatest responsibility to the whole party, the whole Army, and the entire people throughout the country; second, there is no need to change the resolutions adopted by the First and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central Committee. At a party meeting in late February, Wan Li said: Comrade Xiaoping's devotion to the party's cause and his strong will power determine that he will not stay idle and will not just rest without doing anything. Old comrades inside the party should be well aware of this, so their criticism about that was not serious. Outside the Political Bureau, the CPC leadership continued to stress three points: First, Deng remains in good health; second, he may sometimes have some minor illnesses; third, there will be no trouble after he passes away. During the "two sessions," Wan Li also answered questions about Deng's health when receiving National People's Congress deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members. He said: Comrade Xiaoping remains in good health. We play bridge twice a week. Comrade Xiaoping's reaction is no worse than some people in their 50's or 60's. However, he sometimes takes his time in playing. He has no serious or fatal disease. As an old man, he may be ill from time to time, and he has always been receiving medical care. The central leadership has made careful and concrete arrangements. After Comrade Xiaoping passes away, there will be absolutely no change in our country's economy, principles, and policies. It is obvious that the CPC authorities are trying hard to stabilize the situation and reduce the shocks once Deng passes away. This is a strange phenomenon when a country is under the rule of one person. Such "antishock therapy" is unimaginable in the democratic world and such a thing is unprecedented and unrepeatable there.
