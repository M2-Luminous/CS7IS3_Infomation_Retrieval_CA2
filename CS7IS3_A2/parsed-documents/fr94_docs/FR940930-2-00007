We have now completed this review and determine the total net subsidy to be zero for all companies for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sylvia Chadwick or Rick Herring, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202)482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 17, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 25611) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Argentina (48 FR 11480; March 18, 1983). We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments. Therefore, there have been no changes in the analysis of programs between the preliminary results and these final results. We have now completed this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Argentine leather coats, jackets and other apparel including leather vests, pants and shorts for men, boys, women, girls and infants. Also included are outer shells and parts and pieces of leather wearing apparel. This merchandise is classifiable under item number 4203.10.40 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review period is January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. This review involves one company, Comercio Internacional S.A.C.I.F.I.A. (Comercio), which accounts for virtually all exports to the United States, and nine government programs. Final Results of Review As a result of our review, we determine the total net subsidy to be zero during the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service not to assess countervailing duties on shipments of the subject merchandise from all companies, exported on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before December 31, 1991. Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will instruct Customs that the cash deposit rate on shipments of this merchandise from all companies, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice is zero. This deposit instruction shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This administrative review and notice are being published in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22(c)(8). Dated: September 17, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24273 Filed 9&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS-P
