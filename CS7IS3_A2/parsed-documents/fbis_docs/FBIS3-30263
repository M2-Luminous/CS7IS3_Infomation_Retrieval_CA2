This was reported by a diplomatic source who does not wish to be identified in order to avoid difficulties in office. However, Skodaexport Director General Jan Ricica rejects the espionage charge. "Espionage activity is completely unrealistic," he said. He emphasized that, following the intervention of the Czech ambassador to Tehran, Tyl was released with the explanation that the suspicions had not been confirmed. Tyl was arrested shortly after the departure of the Skoda Plzen delegation that had visited Tehran to establish business contacts and also discussed the possibility of supplying Iran with modernized T-72 tanks. While some sources place Tyl's arrest precisely in the context of Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek's business negotiations, Ricica said that such a connection seem unlikely to him. Nevertheless, Tyl participated in all Soudek's meetings in Tehran. The Skodaexport director general also said that he could not think of any reason for detaining Tyl. "Because there was no indication of any links to the Skodaexport business activities in the course of the incident, we are certain it must have been a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity," he declared. The Skoda Plzen business mission to Iran created suspicion among some intelligence services that Skoda is trying to acquire a share not only in supplies of conventional arms, but also of technology for the Iranian nuclear program. Tyl was detained by Iranian security on 7 December of last year and released five days later. He had worked in Iran for almost four years. Following the incident, however, he returned home. The arrest cut his planned stay in Iran by approximately 14 days. In response to our question, the Iranian Foreign Ministry, through its Prague embassy, refused to comment on the circumstances of Tyl's arrest. According to experts on this area, it cannot be ruled out that the Iranian security service was attempting to find out whether Tyl had any information about the Iranian nuclear program. Ricica considers Tyl's arrest a thing of the past. He says he does not expect it to have an impact on future business cooperation.
