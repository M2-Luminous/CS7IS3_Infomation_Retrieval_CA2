On this occasion, the entire people warmly congratulate the valiant officers and men of the People's Army who are firmly defending the cause of socialism. The KPA is invincible revolutionary Armed Forces which have made immortal contributions to achieving the independence and sovereignty of the country and defending the gains of socialism over the past 60 years. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said: "The proud feats performed by the People's Army and the mass heroism displayed by the officers and men of the People's Army in the course of our revolution will shine forever together with the revolutionary history of our party." The KPA (Korean People's Revolutionary Army in the period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle) is a proud Army of the people that played a decisive role in accomplishing the historical cause of the liberation of the country. The first revolutionary Armed Forces of the Korean people were founded on April 25, 1932, in the darkest period of the Japanese imperialist rule (1905-1945). The great leader President Kim Il- song who embarked upon the road of revolution, shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation, made a deep analysis of the state of the early communist movement and the independence movement and concluded that a struggle by standing revolutionary Armed Forces is the only way of liberating the country. He set before the young communists and patriotic young people the slogan "Arms is our life and soul! Arms to arms!" It was early in the 1930s. In response to his call, a bloody struggle was waged to obtain weapons inside Korea and in broad areas of North and South Manchuria. On the basis of these preparations, he proclaimed the birth of the first revolutionary Armed Forces. The Korean People's Revolutionary Army grew to be steel-like ranks, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces in the flames of the protracted anti-Japanese armed struggle and, at last, defeated Japanese imperialism and accomplished the cause of liberation of the country in August 1945. After the liberation it was strengthened into the regular Korean People's Army with all services and arms. The invincible might of the KPA was fully displayed in the three-year fatherland liberation war against the invasion of the U.S. imperialists and their allied forces. The U.S. imperialists mobilized huge Armed Forces two million strong and all the uptodate combat and technical equipment in the Korean war. But the valiant KPA fighters took the initiative in the whole period of the war by overpowering the numerical and technical superiority of the U.S. Forces with political and ideological, strategic and tactical superiority. The Japanese book Land Battle Dictionary Vol. 4 says: "The North Korean Army was a tough opponent which applied confrontal attack, surprising and other diverse tactics which the U.S. Forces had not experienced." The Korean people and People's Army killed, wounded and captured more than 1.567 million enemy effectives including above 405,000 U.S. troops in the war. And it captured, downed, sank or destroyed a fabulous amount of combat and technical equipment including over 12,200 warplanes, above 3,250 tanks and armoured vehicles and more than 560 warships, defending the country with honor. The war ended in a great victory of the Korean people. The KPA has reliably defended the security of the country and the people in the period of socialist construction, too. Each time the U.S. imperialists committed provocations such as the intrusion of the armed spy ship "Pueblo" (January 1967) and the case of the large spy plane "EC-121" (April 1969), the KPA dealt a decisive counterblow at them and smashed their new war provocation manoeuvres. The Korean People's Army has entered a new period of an epochal turn in the long history of its development by acclaiming Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genius of military affairs, as its supreme commander. Today the KPA is united rock-firm around Comrade Kim Chong-il on the basis of loyalty to the party and the leader and revolutionary comradeship. It has earned itself fame as powerful revolutionary Armed Forces.
