The MITI senior official expressed an eagerness for a resumption of the stalled framework talks, saying: "During the consultations, Japan and the United States will discuss not only such macroeconomic measures as continued tax cuts and an increase in public investment, but also the adoption of objective criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market and individual sectors. Japan seeks to reach a set of agreements with the United States in the framework talks prior to the industrialized nations' summit (the Naples summit) scheduled for July." The senior MITI official indicated that vice-ministerial officials from the two countries will hold the informal consultations, adding that "the two countries need to hold several rounds of informal consultations before the summit talks are held." The MITI official went on to say: "In order for the stalled framework talks to be resumed an early date and for the two countries to reach a set of agreements, the macroeconomic measures are important, but Japan should not defer the discussion of individual sectors at the framework talks. The two countries need to reach a set of agreements on both macroeconomic and microeconomic measures prior to the summit talks."
