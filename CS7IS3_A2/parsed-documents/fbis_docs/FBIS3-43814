Self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed welcomed the agreement signed Sunday by traditional leaders of his Abgal subclan and the Habr Gedir of his enemy, factional leader Mohamed Farah Aidid. "It is the first step in a broad peacemaking process," he told reporters. But he added: "We have a long way to go," and described the treaty as "fragile and delicate." Issa Mohamed Siad, foreign affairs secretary of General Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, declined to talk to reporters. Appearing to reject the treaty, he sent word through an aide that the SNA would not comment on it "because it was not a political issue, only an agreement reached at a traditional clan gathering." SNA supporter Abdi Abshir Kahiye said the clans could settle "small, local issues like punishing criminals," but their authority did not extend to "big political questions." The treaty, hammered out by 176 clan elders and religious leaders in three days of talks, calls for the clans to live in peace, end the division of Mogadishu and return property looted during the civil war. But the two warlords themselves neither signed the agreement nor attended the talks, reserved for clan elders and closed to politicians. A vicious power struggle still divides the two men whose fighters gutted Mogadishu in four months of carnage before the first US Marines landed in December 1992 to help end a famine that cost 300,000 lives. Aidid wants UN troops to quit Somalia. But Ali Mahdi says they must stay to prevent renewed civil war after US forces withdraw in March, a decision prompted by the killings of 25 Americans in clashes with Aidid's militiamen. Ali Mahdi said he would comply with the treaty and remove his militiamen from the Green Line dividing his north Mogadishu enclave from Aidid's south Mogadishu stronghold. "I hope Aidid will listen to the message of peace," Ali Mahdi said, adding that he was encouraged by the presence at the talks of influential clansmen of Aidid, currently in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. But in a sign that peace may still be a distant prospect, Ali Mahdi denied SNA officials' claims that Aidid himself held peace talks in Nairobi with representatives of the Group of 12 factions led by Ali Mahdi. He stressed, however, that faction leaders were coming under mounting pressure from the rank-and-file to make peace. "We are a clan society," Ali Mahdi said. "If the clan of a given political figure or leader opts for peace and chooses the road of reconciliation and pacification, I believe that leader has to comply with the wishes of his people." Ali Mahdi said the UN's earlier attempts to mediate between the clan-based factions had failed. But he stressed that Sunday's treaty was "completely different" because it marked "the first time that the community leaders have stepped in with all their weight" since factional fighting erupted after the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Ali Mahdi said buses had already started moving freely across the Green Line only a day after the treaty was signed. Somali residents said they saw little change. Some even reported more gunmen than usual in Mogadishu's shell-blitzed streets. Ali Mahdi called for an all-clan "national community leaders' conference" to be held in Mogadishu after talks to win the agreement of other, smaller clans that did not sign the treaty.
