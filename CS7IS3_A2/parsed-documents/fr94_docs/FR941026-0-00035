FR941026-0-00035 FR941026-0-00010 Both the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Inc. studies imply that there is some level or concentration at which animal fats and vegetable oils are hazardous to wildlife when ingested. Are there additional further studies, scientific papers, or other data that bear on the issue? Are there data showing at what concentrations animal fat, vegetable oil, and other non-toxic oils have adverse effects on animals that ingest such oils? How critical is the matter of an oil's toxicity in determining what kind of equipment resources and strategies responders should use in containment and recovery? The Agency also requests comment on whether there are data to demonstrate that the response approach set out in the rule for non-petroleum oils is either unnecessary or harmful. Does spill size or location affect whether a response can be more harmful than leaving the oil in the environment? If so, how and to what degree? Are there circumstances where response techniques like containing and removing a discharge of animal fats and vegetable oils are more harmful than dispersing these oils through use of chemical or mechanical dispersants? Are there effective, available, and authorized chemical dispersants that responders can use for discharged animal fats and vegetable oils? Are there data on emulsification and evaporation factors for non-petroleum oils that EPA can use to determine whether to revise the facility response plan rule for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils, including animal fats and vegetable oils? Is there research in-progress or planned research on the issues raised in this notice? V. Further Action After review and evaluation of the public comments on this notice, EPA will decide whether data support creating a new facility response plan regulatory regime for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils which Petitioners assert are non-toxic. EPA's determination may take the form of no further action, guidance, or some other regulatory action. VI.
