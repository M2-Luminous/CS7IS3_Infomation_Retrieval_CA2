The ministry said the acceptable daily intake of CNP set in 1977 should be scrapped. In response to the ministry's decision, the Environment Agency decided not to register CNP as an agricultural chemical until a new acceptable daily intake has been agreed and urged the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry to halt its use, officials said. The Health Ministry made the recommendations on the basis of a report from a committee advising it on the safety of residual agricultural chemicals. The Farm Ministry also said it will order local governments to stop using CNP and replace it with substitutes in time for the April-June planting season. Ministry officials said 12,000 tons of CNP were used last year. The manufacturer of the chemical, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc., will also voluntarily cease producing and marketing it, a company executive said Monday. Managing Director Takeshi Nakai said the company is confident of the safety of CNP, but decided to voluntarily stop producing and selling it, and "abide by the government's announcement." "Only a few farmers have purchased CNP at this point, so there should be little confusion if we ask them to return it," Nakai said. Mitsui Toatsu produces 8,000 tons of CNP annually. It has already manufactured 4,000 tons this year. CNP sales amount to 1.4 to 1.5 billion yen each year, company officials said. Weed killers containing CNP are normally distributed to farmers via local agricultural associations. The possible danger from CNP came to light after clinical tests by Prof. Masaharu Yamamoto of Niigata University medical faculty showed that the rate for gall bladder cancer among residents in the Niigata Plain, one of the country's main rice producing areas, was unusually high. Civic organizations in the Niigata area have demanded that the government ban the chemical. The Health and Welfare Ministry's advisory body concluded that there was a regional correlation between CNP and gall bladder cancer, but also said it was difficult to establish a causal relationship. Yamamoto said there is sufficient statistical correlation between the use of CNP and gall bladder cancer, but any proof of a causal relationship will have to wait until there are signs of a drop in the death rate from the cancer after the ban on CNP takes effect.
