This betrays his sinister intention to further intensify the maneuvers to do harm to and slay fellow countrymen in the new year under the pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear development". As already reported, both the DPRK and the United States, at a recent contact, removed a series of hurdles in the way of the DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a progress in the talks by showing mutual understanding and spirit of cooperation. The outcry obtrusively let out by the traitor Kim Yong-sam at this time cannot but be condemned as an unpardonable, despicable anti-national act. He got an "assurance" from the United States to keep the "international cooperation system" in reward for a total opening of the rice market of South Korea during his trip to the United States in November last year. But afraid that it may burst like soap bubbles, he is vociferating about the "nuclear suspicion" of the North from the first day of the new year. This shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is not interested in the DPRK-U.S. talks at all but is working with bloodshot eyes to torpedo the talks and inflict "sanctions" and put pressure on the North. No matter how desperately he is working he cannot block the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks whose prospects are in sight for fundamentally settling the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. It is obtrusive of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who has neither a real power nor say and has been totally forsaken by the people, to say this or that over the problem to be resolved between the DPRK and the United States. The people will never pardon such an out and out flunkeyist sycophant as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is leading the South Korean peasants to death by opening the rice market and is working hard to do harm to fellow countrymen through the "international cooperative system". The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better stop acting rashly, clearly mindful that the road of treacheries chosen by him leads to destruction.
