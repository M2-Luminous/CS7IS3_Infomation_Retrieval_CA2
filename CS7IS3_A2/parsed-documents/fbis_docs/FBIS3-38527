This military school, which is renowned throughout the world for its marine mine warfare training, can now use a computer to simulate the maneuvers of a whole fleet. [passage omitted] Belgian and Dutch naval officials proudly explained on Thursday: "With all its possibilities and its exceptional performance, this simulator is the only one of its kind in NATO, and indeed in the world. The ships and different types of sensors and weapons systems can all be simulated by the computer database, and the consoles are of a universal type. It will even be able to accurately simulate future NATO systems in a very realistic environment." Officers from both countries participated in the design of this new tool, developed by the American company CAE Link which specializes in simulation. The construction of the simulator launched on Thursday was financed by NATO, in return for which the allied navies can hire the system to train their own crews. [passage omitted] The simulator can also display on screen the image, in fact the "virtual reality," sent back by the camera on a minisubmarine sent out to hunt for mines on the sea bed. [passage omitted] This system also makes it possible for crews to discover potential new operations areas. [passage omitted]
