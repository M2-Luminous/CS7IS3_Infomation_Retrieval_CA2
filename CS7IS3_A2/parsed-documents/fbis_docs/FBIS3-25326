The government has already submitted the list of its 2,500 men to the British training team.

This morning's session of the Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces discussed issues relating to the creation of the new Mozambican army -- namely, the type of organization, budget and logistics, and compliance with the dates set for the training of troops. The training of the 5,000 infantry soldiers will be given by instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe. British specialists will play an advisory role. [passage omitted]
