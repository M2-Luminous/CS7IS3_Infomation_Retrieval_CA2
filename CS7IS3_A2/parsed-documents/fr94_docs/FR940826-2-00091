TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Summary of Argument Argument I. THE BELLSOUTH AND SOUTHWESTERN BELL MOTIONS, SEEKING TO REMOVE THE DECREE'S EQUAL ACCESS OBLIGATIONS AS APPLIED TO CELLULAR EXCHANGE SERVICES, SHOULD BE DENIED A. To Remove Equal Access, Movants Must Show at a Minimum that the Removal of Equal Access from their Cellular Exchanges Would Not Reduce Competition in Long Distance Services from those Exchanges. B. As this Court Has Held Repeatedly, Cellular Exchange Service Is ``Exchange Service'' Subject To the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. C. Allowing a BOC to Provide Interexchange Service from Cellular Exchanges, Without Equal Access, Would Reduce Competition for Cellular Interexchange Service. 1. Cellular Exchange Service Markets are Not Competitive Today. 2. Given the BOCs' Market Power in Cellular Service, Eliminating Equal Access Will Reduce Competition in Cellular Long Distance. D. The Movants Have Not Demonstrated any Significant Changed Circumstances Warranting Relief. II. THE BOCS' RESALE OF SWITCHED INTEREXCHANGE SERVICES TO THEIR CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS, SUBJECT TO SUFFICIENT EQUAL ACCESS SAFEGUARDS, SHOULD NOT RESULT IN AN ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES FOR INTEREXCHANGE SERVICE. A. BOC Entry as an Additional Choice, Subject to Equal Access, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices. B. Appropriate Safeguards are Required To Protect Against Discrimination in Access or Presubscription by the Cellular Exchange Operator. 1. The Department's Proposed Order Will Substantially Prevent Discrimination in the Provision of Access a. Basic Injunction. b. Services from Which Interchange Service May Be Provided. c. Entities Bound by the Waiver. d. Equal Access Plans. 2. The Resale Restriction Will Eliminate Most Risks of Discriminatory Interconnection. 3.

Appropriate Safeguards Are Also Required To Prevent Abuse of the Landline Exchange. D. Provisions for Incidental Relief from the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. III. THE COURT SHOULD DEFER CONSIDERATION OF THE BOCS' REQUEST FOR GENERIC MODIFICATION OF CELLULAR EXCHANGE AREAS. Conclusion
