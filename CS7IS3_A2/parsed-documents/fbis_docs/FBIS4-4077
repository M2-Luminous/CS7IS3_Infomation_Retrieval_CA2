The 20 joint disciplinary teams, each composed of 80 men, have been organized jointly by the Guangzhou Military Region, Guangdong Military District, and Guangdong Public Security Department, will leave Guangzhou tomorrow for the Guangzhou-Conghua, Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Shantou, and Guangzhou-Nanhai highways to check the violation of regulations by military and police vehicles and crack down on the illegal use of bogus military and police vehicles. This is the third unified action following the ones in 1991 and 1993 against vehicles with special plates. The current action will be the largest in scale and will last a long time--until the conclusion of the struggle against the theft of motorcycles and vehicles. The headquarters--which will have Chen Shaoji, director of the Public Security Department, as its head and an official in charge of the Guangzhou Military Region as deputy head--will continue to exist and exercise management over special vehicle plates. This reporter also learned from the Guangdong Public Security Department that since moves were taken to counter the theft of motorcycles and vehicles on 1 April, the number of stolen vehicles has dropped by two-thirds and that of motorcycles has dropped by 50 percent. Figures provided by the Public Security Department indicated that, by 20 April, the province arrested a total of 1,781 persons involved in stealing motorcycles and vehicles, cracked 2,086 theft cases (12 of which involved murder), uncovered 396 rings (which had 1,600 members) involved in stealing and selling stolen vehicles, recovered 1,560 stolen vehicles and motorcycles (267 vehicles and 1,293 motorcycles), smashed 120 dens which sold the stolen goods, and demolished 4 underground factories which produced counterfeit license plates. Moreover, a total of 351 shops were ordered to close down for selling remodeled and stolen cars, and the licenses of 29 other shops were revoked. An official from the Guangdong Public Security Department said that, thanks to the precautions and stern measures taken against the criminal activities, the sharp rise in the theft of motorcycles and vehicles in Guangdong has been brought under control. In the first quarter of this year, the province lost an average of 16 vehicles and 72 motorcycles every day. Since April, the figure has dropped to 5.4 vehicles and 42 motorcycles a day, representing a drop of two-thirds and 50 percent respectively. Except for Zhuhai, where the crime rate remained the same, the crime rate in 19 cities throughout the province dropped by varying degrees. Since launching the special struggle, public security organs have transferred large number of policemen to react promptly to ongoing criminal cases and investigate and crack these cases as quickly as possible. They have acted to intercept and examine vehicles, and conduct patrols, ambushes, and general check-ups. The taxi looting incident that took place on 3 April in Foshan, and the car theft and murder that took place on 10 April in Maomin were both cracked within the short period of 3 and 12 hours respectively. The primary objective of the move was to uncover crime rings. The Zengcheng Public Security Bureau spotted a very large ring in early April, which had stolen 29 vehicles and motorcycles worth 9 million yuan. The bureau has recovered 12 vehicles, 3 motorcycles, and over 200,000 yuan of ill-gotten money. The work of returning recovered stolen vehicles and motorcycles to their owners also started recently. Shenzhen took the lead and returned 200 motorcycles and 78 vehicles to their owners on 23 April. Over the next three days, Guangzhou will also follow suit and set up centers at various districts to return stolen goods to their owners.
