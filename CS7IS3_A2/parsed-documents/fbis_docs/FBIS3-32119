Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government advisers for not following through on a single strategy to defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern jungle of Peru for several years. "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking power," he stressed. Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time when the American Government was willing to engage in joint operations." The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in Argentina since last January, having left his country on the heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army, General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted] General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru. The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and nine students. Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and 21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking. He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him. However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru. Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School of Government's catalogue. Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of their social base." "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to destabilize the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the peasant population," Arciniega recalls. He admits leading his troops into many battles against the terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants rather than drug-trafficking criminals." The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding political and social defeat. "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) between April and December of 1989," he recalls. He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman finally lost his will to have another army and immediately changed tactics." He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had, but did not find him...." Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April 1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed extraconstitutional powers. The former military official maintains that the drug traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world. When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come out in a book." The general also leveled criticisms at the presidential adviser for intelligence matters, former Captain Vladimiro Montesinos, to whom he attributes great influence over the Peruvian chief of state's decisions. "The worst thing that could have happened to the Armed Forces is the presence of that gentleman, Vladimiro Montesinos, who has exercised some kind of strange power over the president, whom he originally considered as the right person for the times we are living in Peru and given the fact that the political parties have deteriorated," Arciniega says. He accuses Fujimori's advisers and Montesinos of carrying out a series of political actions "that have done Peru great damage because they followed the wrong strategies." For example, he cites the problem of terrorism, charging that the government and its advisers "have done precisely what Abimael wanted: to launch a campaign to put an end to institutions that took many years to create, namely, the political parties." "I agree that the political parties were not doing their job, but when those parties are given their place, they serve to guide public opinion, educating it politically," he explained. He labeled the government's statement that the capture of Abimael Guzman in September of last year was the result of the 5 April coup "a lie." "That assertion is false because Military Intelligence had Guzman and his entire clique on a list drawn up from the time that terrorism started and they were all the targets of an intense search," he said. Arciniega laments the fact that a shadow has been cast over the figure of Police Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal, who executed the plan leading to the capture of Guzman and most of his command. "I am not surprised about what is happening to Ketin because they also passed me over and froze my status when I returned from Huallaga. They apparently look for weaklings to occupy key posts so they will be servile to a regime. Otherwise they go to prison," he observed. For example, he criticized the current minister of defense, General Victor Malca, who he said was "a little bully who only fights from his desk, but who has never had a chance to get his spats dirty in a combat zone." General Malca signed the Cabinet resolution in January that ordered Arciniega's trial by a special military court for violating military regulations. It should be recalled that as a military judge, Arciniega tenaciously opposed the fact that a group of 30 Army officers, including several generals, should be made to serve prison sentences in a jail for common criminals for conspiring against Fujimori's government in November of last year. Arciniega repeated his accusation against presidential adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, noting that his "recommendations" to President Fujimori have caused him "to destroy an entire institutional structure in the Armed Forces that took years to create." He emphatically blamed Montesinos for "hatching" an entire scheme to get "many representative and highly qualified officers" out of the military. He warned that a "pruning" of the different levels of the Army and Armed Forces as a whole occurred and continues to occur, a pruning that "poses a threat to the very existence of the Armed Forces as one of our nation's guiding institutions." He lamented the fact that an attempt is being made to force Army personnel, who were trained at the cost of great sacrifice, "to start acting as a Pretorian guard, going on to claim that the officers are not thinking about viable, appropriate solutions for our people." "President Fujimori and his advisers are governing Peru by seeking weekly solutions to every national problem the country has," Arciniega said, warning that the government does not get at the root causes of the problems, but rather, encourages a strategy consisting of making the people dependent on the government. "It is an erroneous strategy. I wonder: How long can such a strategy be maintained? How long will all of this continue when the president ignores the causes of our social problems?" he asked, turning his focus to the secular problems that have plagued Peru in recent decades. He also wondered about the role of the Armed Forces given the state of politics in Peru: "How long will they go on adopting a political role not suited to them?" "It is destroying the military institution," Arciniega said in answer to his own question. "What we are seeing now, with the arbitrary replacements and retirements, breaks down morale and military discipline." "Fabrications are used against many officers to get them out of the career path rapidly, without giving them any chance to defend themselves," he said. He recalled the experience of the military during the 12 years of the dictatorial Armed Forces regime (1968-80). "It was an experience that taught us to respect democracy. We had been trained to respect the democratic system, to think about strengthening it." "None of us in the military truly favored what is now happening, i.e., a dictatorship," he said. He recalled that the Armed Forces respected the governments of Fernando Belaunde Terry and Alan Garcia Perez even though, in his opinion, the latter had a poor government that was poorly handled. He said the military also respected Fujimori's election. "We made sure Fujimori would take office as president," he added. Arciniega bitterly observed that, far from following a democratic path, Fujimori had yielded to advice from Montesinos, whom he labeled as a "little Pinochet who probably thinks that democracy is not a solution for these times." Analyzing Fujimori's ascent to power in the midst of a grave economic crisis and the Peruvian people's great disillusionment with their political leaders, the former military official said the victory had even surprised Fujimori. "I am sure he must also have been surprised at becoming president," Arciniega said. Concerning the constitutional referendum called by Fujimori's government following the coup, Arciniega warned that the people "are beginning to realize, are reflecting upon Fujimori's authoritarian plans. It all teaches us a lesson." He insisted on blaming Montesinos for the political direction and institutional crisis that has occurred in Peru recently, particularly, he noted, when a president comes to power "without any political platform or party." "That is why Fujimori is surrounded by a bunch of rascals who say `This is ours,' and who assume Machiavellian power over the regime," he concluded. "Montesinos is Machiavellian. He is not stupid. Since he knows military structure--he was lucky enough to be an aide to a foreign minister like General Edgardo Mercado Jarrin--he is learning how to destabilize institutions," Arciniega observed. Arciniega said that unlike under the military government of the late General Juan Velasco Alvarado, when "there was agreement" on committing the Armed Forces as an institution to back a government, "the situation is different now because only a small group supports the regime." "Today we have precisely the opposite situation because, little by little, they are removing the best officers who have democratic convictions." "What one foresees for the Armed Forces is not only very serious, but dreadful," Arciniega warned, maintaining that Army officers are quite bewildered because "future prospects for any career military man are disappearing." Echoing his comrade in exile, General Robles, Arciniega said there is no need for a coup d'etat to change the current political, economic, and social situation in Peru. "I think the people are wise. The people will have to marshal their own courage because sooner or later they will realize that this political platform is barbaric," he said. He said that President Fujimori's "luck is running out" and that international pressure after the 5 April "self-coup" forced him to redraft his plan and offer a new constitution. Arciniega said the new constitution is an "aberration," adding that the argument that the coup was necessary in order to change the constitution "is a lie because the 1979 Constitution even had its own procedures for modification. The only thing needed was a consensus and not an outrage like the coup." In the exiled general's opinion, "it is easy to foresee that the new constitution will not last because sooner or later the people will reflect and realize that it is a plan to keep one group in power." "I do not think that Fujimori and Montesinos ever read the history of Peru or took the time to read the important things thoroughly, (....) and now they are playing with Peru's fate," he emphasized. He said the people will reflect and see "that this is all a failure, that this man has been a liar, and they will not vote for Fujimori. The next person elected will have to institute a proper political trial of him and all of his advisers who have tried to destroy Peru." Concerning General Jaime Salinas Sedo, now in prison for conspiring against Fujimori, Arciniega claimed that he would have advised him "not to attempt the coup" because "it was outrageous only two weeks away from the CCD elections. He played right into Fujimori's hands." With respect to his political future, Arciniega admits that his military career is over, but says another phase is now beginning for which "I have to prepare myself, take a course in politics, and be ready to face challenges." He said that Peru's future political leaders should be transparent, authentic, and not deceitful or mediocre. Arciniega did not conceal his sympathy for a possible presidential candidacy of former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, believing that "he is a man who has demonstrated his ability at the highest level of international politics." However, he said, the Peruvian people might not understand him. At the close of this lengthy interview, Arciniega asked to listen to a tape of a band playing the national anthem and the Army hymn, "to help me recall the most intense times of my life in the military," he said. However, he confessed that he occasionally hums the words of a well-known tango: "Remember, my brother, the days when...."
