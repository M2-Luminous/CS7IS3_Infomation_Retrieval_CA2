FR941025-2-00012 FR941025-2-00009 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1995 Panel Dress Rehearsal for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Redesign. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 15,230 hours. Number of Respondents: 15,230. Avg Hours Per Response: 30 minutes. Needs and Uses: The proposed 1995 Dress Rehearsal is part of a program of evaluation and development emerging from a comprehensive reassessment of SIPP. The SIPP redesign is an evolving process that has multiple developmental and testing stages. The initial stage involved developing an automated survey instrument that incorporated numerous content and forms design changes. The next stage involved small&hyph;scale pretests to make sure the components of the automated instrument and case management system interact as planned. These pretests were approved under OMB number 0607&hyph;0779. The third stage involved content tests to evaluate changes made to the pretest instrument based largely on cognitive research and reactions to the pretest instrument. These content tests were approved under OMB number 0607&hyph;0783. The fourth stage, the subject of this request, is a national sample dress rehearsal scheduled for February 1995, during which the SIPP will be managed in a fully automated production environment. Full implementation is scheduled for February 1996. These developmental stages are interspersed by an ongoing series of smaller, specifically&hyph;focused content, instrument, and systems tests. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: Twice in 1995. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 10201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: October 20, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
