Ahmad Muhammad al-Ahdam were martyred, after having put up an heroic resistance and having hit a number of the assailants, the Interior Ministry officials chased the attackers, who fled to the home of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif, who, in turn, handed over five persons to the ministry as the perpetrators. However, upon questioning these five, it emerged that the real assailants were still at Shaykh al-Shayif's, who, it turned out was harboring them. Accordingly, the Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant for Shaykh al-Shayif as the suspected instigator of the crime and for harboring its perpetrators. Other arrest warrants were issued against the perpetrators. Eight suspects are now in custody. The investigation revealed that the shaykh is also harboring other suspects. Instead of heeding the orders issued by the Interior Ministry and turning himself in as mandated by law, he barricaded himself in his home, along with a large number of his friends. At dawn on Monday, he managed to sneak out of the capital, along with a number of the suspects. The Interior Ministry condemns this reckless behavior, and holds Shaykh al-Shayif responsible for incitement to commit this hideous crime and for harboring its perpetrators. They have to present themselves to the law enforcement authorities so justice can take its course. The ministry will take all the security and legal measures required to bring the accused to justice.
