The election has had the effect of bonding our people together and healing the wounds of the past, and making sure that South Africans emerge out of an apartheid past into a democratic future with a great deal of confidence. The election itself has been a dynamo and an impetus with regard to the task of nation building and reconciliation. We believe that we have achieved a great deal out of this election. A new mood is beginning to spread throughout our country. Our people as a whole are beginning to feel postive after the election. The levels of violence have been reduced very drastically, there is a new confidence in the business community in our country, and we also believe that a new confidence has been infused into the future of our country and all our people are looking forward to the installation of a new government with a great deal of confidence. The political tension between and among political parties has been reduced quite a lot, in spite of the fact that we are going to be challenging each other regarding the election campaign. The election itself has brought about a very positive and constructive approach with regard to resolving the problems which beset our country. Despite all the problems that were experienced during the election campaign, we believe that the election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we would like to applaud the Independent Electoral Commission which was charged with a mission impossible when it was appointed. It was just impossible for any structure in our country to be able to run the election in a very outstanding and successful way. But we believe that what the IEC has achieved is outstanding and we believe they should be applauded. We also want to voice pour appreciation to the media in the way they have approached the whole election process, in the way they have analyzed the difficulties and interpreted them. They have actually also infused a lot of confidence amongst our people, to encourage our people to believe and to know that the election has been successful. There are problems that are being experienced in this point in time with regard to counting. Only a few counting stations have actually begun the counting process, but we believe that the IEC is going to execute its tasks properly in the end. And we call upon all our people to be patient with the IEC, to be patient with the counters as they are resolving their problem. And I would like to call on all of us to encourage them in the difficult task that now lies ahead. The counting process is an important task, an important aspect of the election process on the whole, and they now have a very difficult task, and we need to exercise patience, we need to have understanding, and we also need to know that they were charged with a virtually impossible task. But we have confidence that they are going to finalize the task that they were given despite all the problems that they are going through. Some results, we are made to believe have already come through, particularly in the [Orange] Free State, and they already indicate that the ANC is poised to achieve an overwhelming victory. We want to wait for the total results to come out before the ANC finally pronounces its attitude on these results. We have confidence that results will start coming through throughout the country later this afternoon, and we call on everybody to have the understanding that is required in this difficult situation, even if there is a delay, later into the night or even tomorrow. Yesterday we had a discussion with the IEC, and they appraised us of some of the difficulties that they were bound to experience, and we had a great deal of understanding and appreciation, and we encourage them to move with some urgency to resolve some of the difficulties that they have, but we have no doubt whatsoever that they are the type who will at the end execute those functions to deliver a result which will finally confirm that indeed the elections were free and fair, and we call upon all our people to look forward to the final result being announced so that all of us, as South Africans, can welcome and usher in a new dispensation which will be free of oppression, free of apartheid, free of racial hatred.
