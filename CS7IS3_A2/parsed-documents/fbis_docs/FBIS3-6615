However, Benachenhou pointed out that the Algerian economy will be faced with difficulties in the future due to sluggish sales of crude oil, and stressed again: "I would like to ask for understanding from Japan, to which our country owes the second largest amount of debts, next to France." He pointed out that prospects are not optimistic for the debt issue. He said that Algeria's debt service ratio (ratio of foreign debt repayment to exports) reached 86 percent in fiscal 1993, and predicted that "in 1994, the debt service ratio will be 90 percent or more." With regard to the reasons for this, he said: "The oil market, (in which oil producing countries are hesitating to cooperate with each other in cutting oil production), is now falling into disorder. We cannot take an optimistic view either on the short-term or the long-term situation." Benachenhou further stated: "I would like to invite European and Japanese companies to take part in the development of abundant deposits of LNG (liquefied natural gas) in Algeria."
