Nearly 15,000 Chapare coca growers staged a demonstration on 25 February, rejecting the compulsory eradication of their plantations. This demonstration, which in the opinion of COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas was entirely legal, brought to the region Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents who occupied the site. A clash was the result early on the morning of 26 February. [Begin Salas recording] Blood was shed during the violent repression, and 18 fellow coca growers were injured. [end recording] While the COB asserts that 18 people were injured, some with buckshot, the government reports that only three people were injured: two of them coca growers and the third an Umopar officer. The COB also asserts that 78 people had been arrested, although they have now been released. The government, however, asserts that only 60 people were arrested. Despite the reigning tense calm, an agreement has been reached with the government by which the coca growers ask not to be confused with drug traffickers. [Begin Salas recording] Their repressed fury was against the coca growers instead of against drug traffickers. The other point is that there must be an equivalence, that coca must be replaced by other products. [end recording] Salas categorically pointed out that no one can force growers to eradicate their coca plantations because the alternative development programs are not being implemented. If the government forces this measure, it would be removing their livelihood. It must also be said that the coca growers are unaware of the contents of the few alternative development programs, which still remain on paper.
