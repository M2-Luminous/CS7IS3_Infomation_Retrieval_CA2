FBIS4-13539 "drnes077_c_94011" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Egypt Report on Prison Conditions Released Report on Prison Conditions Released NC1804160894 Cairo AL-'ARABI in Arabic 11 Apr 94 p 5 NC1804160894 Cairo AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Report by Rida Hammad] [Text] The Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] last Wednesday issued its second report this year. The report revealed numerous violations of the rights of prisoners and detainees in Egyptian jails and noted an alarming increase in these violations compared to previous periods. The report, which monitored the situation in the prisons on the basis of testimonies by inmates and detainees, reports by the organization's representatives about their visits to the prisons, and complaints by the families of prisoners and the testimonies of lawyers, said that these violations clearly contravene legislation governing the treatment of prisoners. The report said that the security forces do not abide by prison laws, particularly those that provide guarantees to the inmates. The most significant of these violations is the constant presence of State Security Investigations officers, who deal with everything that concerns political inmates and monitor all visits to them. This is contrary to Article 140 of the Criminal Procedures Law, which prohibits the prison commissioner from allowing policemen to contact prisoners except with written permission from the Public Prosecution Office specifying the length of and reason for the visit. Article 79 of Law 396 of 1956 states: "This ban aims at providing protection to the prisoners against an attempt by the police to influence them." The report also referred to the violations of legislative provisions by the Public Prosecution Office. The law stipulates that officials of the Public Prosecution Office should pay periodic visits to the prisons to make sure that they do not violate legislative provisions. However, the report notes that a large number of detainees who spent various terms in prison have testified that they have not been visited even once by Public Prosecution officials. This is regarded as extreme negligence on the part of the office. As for collective punishment, the EHRO has ascertained that the security forces have repeatedly imposed collective punishment on inmates on the pretext of safeguarding security and hygiene, particularly inside the prisons where detainees or convicts from the political Islam groups are held. During these campaigns, the security forces used tear gas, batons, and whips, which is considered a flagrant violation of prison laws and regulations. Collective punishment campaigns were carried out frequently in the prisons of Abu Za'bal, al-'Aqrab, al-Marj, and al-Hadrah in Alexandria. The most violent of these campaigns took place in Abu Za'bal and al-Marj prisons. It began in Abu Za'bal on 28 August 1993 with a ban on recreation and visits by families or lawyers, the prevention of medical treatment, and the confiscation of the personal effects of the inmates. The second raid was carried out the following month in which large number of soldiers and special forces were used. Violent and various forms of punishment were meted out to the prisoners. The forces entered Wings A and B and brought out prisoners from their cells and started beating them. Police dogs were also unleashed on them and, as a result, six prisoners were injured and evacuated to the al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital. The prisoners immediately went on a 14-day hunger strike during which they were punished one by one. This was followed by two similar disciplinary raids during which 15 prisoners were injured and four others were killed. The second flagrant example of collective punishment took place in the al-Marj prison when the security forces' raids injured 10 prisoners after they were beaten and dragged around. The second violation that prisoners are being subjected to is bad health care. The report confirms the grave deterioration in the prisoners' health as a result of the small number of doctors and the shortage of medicine. The EHRO stressed that this represents a form of punishment by prison authorities. Contagious diseases, such as scabies, have spread in the Abu Za'bal prison, in addition to individual cases of serious illnesses resulting from inadequate medical care. The order banning visits began with the escalation of what they termed "the rioting" in the Abu Za'bal prison last August during which three prisoners were killed and 76 others were injured. The ban was then extended to many other prisons. The EHRO report also monitored the deteriorating living conditions inside the prisons, including the inedible food given to them. The report stressed that around 88 percent of the prisoners do not rely on prison food but discard it. The report also monitored the shortages of beds and covers, in addition to the small spaces where prisoners are crammed. At the end of the report, the EHRO made several recommendations addressed to the president of the republic, the legislative authorities, and the Interior Ministry. The recommendations underlined the need to respect the laws and rules that govern the prison authority. It also called on the public attorney to initiate an immediate investigation into the complaints made by groups and individuals about attacks made on detainees. It demanded the repeal of some laws that justify these measures and the repeal of the president of the republic's authority to establish prisons and his sole prerogative to define the groups that will be housed in them. The EHRO's first report of 4 August 1991 also detailed the bad living conditions in prisons.
