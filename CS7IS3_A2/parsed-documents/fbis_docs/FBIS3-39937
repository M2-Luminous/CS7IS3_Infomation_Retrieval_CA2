The authors of the white paper on defense commissioned last May by Edouard Balladur have ambitious objectives for the French armed forces by the year 2010. The document was presented yesterday by the prime minister and Defense Minister Francois Leotard to the deputies and senators of the Defense Commissions of the two houses. This is the first exercise of this kind since Michel Debre's white paper in 1972. The latter orchestrated the strategy and missions of the French armed forces following the acquisition of the strike force in the context of the Cold War. The 1994 version of the white paper takes a defense posture in an international context which has become particularly fluid since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In addition there are heavy budgetary constraints set by Edouard Balladur in his five-year law to control public spending. This white paper, drawn up by around 100 experts, members of the military, and senior civil servants, under the chairmanship of Marceau Long, first vice president of the State Council, will serve as an "explanation of the themes" of the forthcoming 1995-2000 military programming law which should be debated in Parliament in June. It has received the implicit approval of Francois Mitterrand who approved its terms during two defense council meetings in January and February. Uncertainty and Diversification of Threats The uncertainty applies to the stability of the countries of the former Warsaw Pact and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The new threats lie in the probable multiplication of regional conflicts, ethnic or religious extremism, terrorism, and drug trafficking. In this context, the white paper takes up the two classical aims of French defense policy. First, to defend the country's vital interests, "alone if necessary, against any threat whatever its origin." This is the role of the nuclear deterrent. Second, to watch over France's "strategic interests" which "correspond to its international responsibilities and its rank in the world." Six crisis scenarios of varying scales (see below) stem from this, ranging from the potentially nuclear conflict to the defense of the DOM-TOM [French Overseas Departments and Territories]. Most of these commitments will take place in the framework of coalitions, under the auspices of international organizations (United Nations, NATO, Western European Union, CSCE). The white paper thus defines the role which France intends to play in these organizations. It reflects the recent rapprochement with NATO, while formally rejecting a return to the organization's integrated military structures which France left in 1966. Nuclear Doctrine Unchanged French strategy, it reaffirms, "is a strategy of deterrence, rejecting any confusion between deterrence and use." The white paper thus takes up the 1972 definition conferring on the nuclear deterrent the virtue of "rendering recourse to all-out war unacceptable as an active political method." Added to this, and included in French doctrine for years, is the "final warning," characterized by a limited strike against military targets. The text says remarkably little about the question of nuclear tests, which Francois Mitterrand decided to halt in 1992 -- a halt now opposed by the government. No mention is made of the international moratorium on tests. The authors of the report view "favorably the drafting of a treaty for a total ban on tests," provided it does not "hamper the maintenance of our deterrent's credibility." Similarly, although the white paper stresses the need to safeguard "the capability for technological development" of the military use of nuclear power by strengthening "the test simulation program," it refrains from choosing the component (naval, airborne, or land-based) responsible for delivering the "final warning." More Autonomous Conventional Forces The same vagueness surrounds the numbers of men in the conventional forces which, according to the details provided in the crisis scenarios, should remain stable after the reductions started in recent years. Indeed, it is their capability for intervening in overseas crises which will be strengthened. The recent crises (Iraq, Somalia, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia) have shown how very difficult it is for the French armed forces to simultaneously deploy sizeable forces on several theaters of operations. "There must gradually be a real conversion in the role of conventional means. It is henceforth their use outside a nuclear context which predominates," and hence "their aptitude for the prevention, limitation, or settlement by force of regional crises or conflicts which do not present the risk of escalation to the extremes," the white paper notes. The philosophy being to "prevent" the eruption and development of these crises, the white paper thinks it is necessary for the French armed forces "to simultaneously conduct several actions: A very intense regional conflict in the framework of a coalition; one or several interventions to help an overseas departement or territory or to implement defense agreements; a limited peacekeeping or international law enforcement operation." This presupposes the strengthening of the complementarity of forces within the armed forces. The aim is to have a "reservoir of rapidly mobile forces of 120,000 to 130,000 men" in the army. No Professional Army Although it is in favor of a greater professionalization of the armed forces, the white paper rejects the move to a professional army, regarded as "unrealistic" especially because of "excessive budget costs." National service, "the best guarantee of the importance which the nation and the citizens attach to their defense," should be both "condensed" in its military aspect, whose 10-month duration is not questioned, and diversified in its civilian forms. Budgetary Constraints The armaments sector, which currently represents 300,000 jobs of which 100,000 are indirect, will have to be "radically restructured" for mainly financial reasons: "It will no longer be possible for it to be present in every niche" as was the case until 1985. Outside the nuclear sphere, France is called upon to develop European cooperation, but also to resort to buying armaments abroad. Similarly, it is explicitly stated that the state "will no longer be able to support its arms industry in all spheres, as it has in the past." The restructuring of the arms industries started a few years ago will be continued by "opening up the capital of some public enterprises" and "improvements in productivity." It is by this tightening up and by European cooperation that the authors think that the cost of arms spending can be reduced (around Fr100 billion per year excluding export revenues). In the present context, the document admits, the challenge of "maintaining the defense effort" presupposes "3 percent annual growth in volume to fund all the current programs." The white paper therefore envisages "arbitration concerning all the current programs" to avoid jeopardizing the new programs deemed to have "priority." Some of the existing major programs will either have to be abandoned or scaled down. The Six Crisis Scenarios No country is named, but everybody is free to identify them on the basis of the recent crises or crises which are foreseeable in the next 15 years. The six crisis scenarios foreseen by the white paper are designated S1 to S6 and place a major nuclear conflict last. S1 -- Regional conflict not endangering our vital interests: This is the Iraqi case, envisaged in the Middle East, but also in Europe and the Mediterranean and its "degree of probability is high in the short and medium term." Bringing into conflict countries with modern conventional weapons, it involves "high intensity engagements." In this case, France would intervene in the framework of an international mandate with a coalition. S2 -- Regional conflict which could threaten our vital interests: Regarded as "plausible at the turn of the century" in Europe, the Mediterranean, the Near or Middle East, it involves a nuclear power and "by a knock-on effect" is likely to threaten our vital interests. Action in an international framework could be of a deterrent nature if necessary. S3 -- Attack on the integrity of national territory outside the mainland: This scenario, the likelihood of which is "low at present" but could "increase with time," concerns the DOM-TOM. France "must be able to control and settle this kind of conflict in complete independence and disregarding possible international pressures." S4 -- Implementation of defense agreements: These are French interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Very high probability. S5 -- Peacekeeping and international law enforcement operations: These are foreseeable on all continents and result in very high probabilities of French participation in a multinational framework. The white paper advocates fixing the duration and scale of the resources committed by France from the start. S6 -- Resurgence of a threat to West Europe: This is the nuclear threat stemming "from a state or coalition of states with large nuclear and conventional forces." "Very difficult to imagine and unlikely in the period considered," this risk "cannot be ruled out because it is a lethal danger." The deterrent must play its role. In view of the fact that the reemergence of this threat should "take long enough," it should be possible to carry out "a gradual adaptation and a change of format in the defense tool." This clearly means reconstituting the forces formerly directed toward the Warsaw Pact.
