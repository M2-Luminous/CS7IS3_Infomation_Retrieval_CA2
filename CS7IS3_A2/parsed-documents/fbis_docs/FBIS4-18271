German security authorities have been informed of Palestinian groups planning terror attacks on the embassy. There is "very serious evidence" of possible bomb attacks "by the Hezbollah" on Israeli targets in Germany, a police spokesman said in Bonn yesterday. He did, however, not indicate whether the threats came from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah operating from South Lebanon or from another group. A terror commando is said to have already entered Germany. The Israeli Embassy itself has not received any threats. Yet, the security authorities are speaking of "a danger that has to be taken very seriously." The Interior Ministry did not want to release any details on the security measures taken. "The security authorities are taking appropriate measures," a spokesman said. In Frankfurt/Main, where there are many Israeli institutions, a police spokesman only said that these buildings are permanently being observed. He did not say whether security has been stepped up following the bomb threats.
