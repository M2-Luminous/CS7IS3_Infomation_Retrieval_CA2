FR940228-1-00046 FR940228-1-00007 Under the PRO sanction process, no practitioner or other person is recommended for exclusion or the imposition of a monetary penalty until the PRO provides the opportunity for extensive discussion with the practitioner or other person, and the opportunity to provide additional information. After receipt of a recommendation from a PRO, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) excludes, or imposes a monetary penalty, only after a careful review of all the documentation submitted and a separate determination that the practitioner or other person has violated the statutory obligations to render only medically necessary and appropriate care that meets professionally recognized standards or has failed to provide evidence of medical necessity and quality, and is unwilling or unable to comply with those obligations. A practitioner or other person who is excluded from Medicare and any State health care programs as defined in section 1128(h) of the Act, or assessed a monetary penalty, on the basis of a PRO finding is entitled to administrative and judicial review after the exclusion is imposed or the monetary penalty is assessed. Recent Statutory Changes A. Public Law 100&hyph;93 Prior to the enactment of Public Law 100&hyph;93 (the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987), section 1156 of the Act set forth obligations of practitioners and other persons providing care to Medicare patients to provide care that was medically necessary and appropriate that meets professionally recognized standards of quality, and appropriately documented. It also provided for the exclusion from Medicare of practitioners and other persons who, upon the review and recommendation of a PRO, were found to have violated those obligations. Section 6 of Public Law 100&hyph;93 extended those obligations to encompass all health care services for which payment may be made under the Act, and not just Medicare. Further, the exclusion authority was extended to encompass violations occurring in, and exclusions from, Medicaid, the title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and the title XX Social Services Block Grant programs. B. Public Law 100&hyph;203 Section 4095 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, amended section 1156 of the Act to provide that an exclusion of a health care practitioner or other person who practices in a country of less than 70,000 people or in a rural health professional shortage area (HPSA) cannot be effectuated until an opportunity is provided for a preliminary administrative hearing. The purpose of this preliminary hearing is to determine whether the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation, through the conclusion of the administrative proceedings on the merits of the exclusion, would place beneficiaries at serious risk. In accordance with section 1156(b)(5) of the Act, unless the administrative law judge (ALJ) at the preliminary hearing determines that the practitioner or other person will pose a serious risk to Medicare beneficiaries if permitted to continue furnishing such services, the exclusion of a rural practitioner or other person may not be effectuated until they are given an opportunity for an administrative hearing on the merits of the exclusion itself. C. Public Law 101&hyph;508 Section 4205 of Public Law 101&hyph;508, OBRA 1990, set forth new statutory requirements with respect to PRO sanction activities. Specifically, the statutory amendments require PROs, if appropriate, to offer a corrective action plan to practitioners and other persons prior to making a finding under section 1156 of the Act; and require the Secretary to consider, in determining whether a practitioner or other person is willing and able to comply with his, her or its obligations, whether the practitioner or other person entered into and successfully completed a corrective action plan prior to the PRO's submission of its recommendation and report to the Secretary. II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule A. Inclusion of the OBRA 1990 Provisions Relating to PROs On January 29, 1992, the OIG published a final rule (57 FR 3298) setting forth amendments to the OIG's exclusion and civil money penalty (CMP) authorities resulting from Public Law 100&hyph;93. Specifically, that final rule revised ยง1004.130 of the regulations and deleted ยง1004.100(g) in its entirety to be consistent with the establishment of a new part 1005_Appeals of exclusions, civil money penalties and assessments_which now governs ALJ hearings and subsequent appeals to the Secretary for all CMP and other OIG sanction cases.
