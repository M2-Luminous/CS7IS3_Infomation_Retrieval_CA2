A study which was published yesterday shows that more than 1 billion tonnes of radioactively contaminated waste would have to be safely disposed. The wastes, which contain radium, constantly release radon. This leads to about six deaths from radiation per year just in the east Thuringian area of Ronneburg, radiation biologist Gerhard Schmidt from Darmstadt says. He called on the Federal Government to quickly fulfill its legal duty to dispose of the waste, because otherwise there would be unjustifiable long-term effects. According to the institute, there have been 5,000 job-related deaths at the Wismut corporation since the beginning of uranium mining in 1945. Over 40 years the Soviet Union gained about 220,000 tonnes of uranium from the ore in the south of the former GDR as basic material for its military and civilian nuclear program. According to estimates by the Darmstadt institute, the defusing of the environmental bomb will cost far more than the so far assumed 15 billion marks.
