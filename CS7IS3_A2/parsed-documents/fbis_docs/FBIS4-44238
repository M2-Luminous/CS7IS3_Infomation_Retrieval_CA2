The opposition parties' criticism of the Greek presidency and the results of the EU summit, Venizelos said, is a reflection of party cowardice, ignorance, party demagoguery, as well as international developments. The public has seen and can judge for itself, Venizelos said. He added that being in opposition does not mean criticizing the government to win points. The opposition, he concluded, is not a simple contract which is carried out, but a democratic function.
