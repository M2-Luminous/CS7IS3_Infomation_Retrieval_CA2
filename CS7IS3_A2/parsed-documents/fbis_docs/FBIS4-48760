Mr Sexwale last week said 150,000 low-cost houses would be built in the next 12 months. National Party caucus leader and MEC [member Executice Committee] for public transport Olaus van Zyl said the plan meant building 600 houses every working day. His Democratic Party counterpart Ian Davidson translated it to building 51 houses an hour. But Mr van Zyl said: "Let's get it started and see what can be done." Mr Jan Landman of the Freedom Front said those occupying the houses should be allowed to own them. Not allowing this in the past had been a mistake by the NP [National Party]. He warned against a social welfare system whereby the state was milked of resources. Ms Gertrude Mzizi of the Inkatha Freedom Party congratulated Mr Sexwale for allowing hostel dwellers to choose between living in single-sex dormitories or family units. The Pan Africanist Congress' sole representative, Mr Benny Alexander, said Mr Sexwale's housing goal was achievable and suggested the masses be trained to build the houses. Mr Davidson referred to reports that at most 70,000 low-cost houses could be built in 1995. "Contrary to (Mr Sexwale's) undertaking...informed comment seems to indicate that we have neither the financial nor institutional capacity to deliver... "Let me not be misunderstood. Let us recommit ourselves to our challenges but let us also be conscious of the reality of institutional capacity and the reality imposed by our commitment also to maintain macro-economic balance." Mr Davidson further warned the PWV needed to compete with what he called two other major economic areas, the Western Cape and KwaZulu/Natal. Each province was controlled by a different political party with its own economic philosophy and each would compete for local and foreign investment. "We therefore have to allow our province to compete unshackled by political or ideological dogma." Mr Davidson said enterprise could not flourish under special taxes or reconstruction levies. "A compromise must be reached between the necessary ambitious plan of the reconstruction and development programme and the private sector's vital role in this regard on the one hand, and the necessary commitment to economic balance which will be a prerequisite to private-sector involvement on the other." Mr Thamsanqa Bam of the African Christian Democratic Party welcomed the housing plan. Mr Sexwale will respond at the end of the debate on Tuesday.
