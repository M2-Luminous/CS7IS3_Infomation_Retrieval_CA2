FR940224-0-00050 FR940224-0-00006 Note Y: For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FP multiply, but that performs FP divide: E:GraphicsER24FE94.028 If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal, but not FP add, FP multiply or FP divide, then: E:GraphicsER24FE94.029 If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective floating point (FP) rate is 0. Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of given lengths. In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more results from two or more operands.
