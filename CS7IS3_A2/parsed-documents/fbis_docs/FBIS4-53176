FBIS4-53176 "dreas096__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-096-A Daily Report 17 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Hata Urged To Disband Kaishin for SDPJ Help Hata Urged To Disband Kaishin for SDPJ Help OW1805074194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1805074194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Japan New Party [JNP] agreed on 16 May that in order to solicit the cooperation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in Diet affairs, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata should suggest during his meeting with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on the afternoon of 17 May the disbanding of the "Kaishin" group in the House of Representatives, the formation of which triggered the SDPJ's secession from the coalition government. DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa informed the prime minister of this decision by phone. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which forms "Kaishin" together with the DSP and JNP, is against the disbanding of the group. Depending on Hata's decision on this matter, discord among the ruling parties on the issue of whether or not to retain "Kaishin" may be aggravated. Since the SDPJ left the coalition, there has been an increasing number of DSP and JNP members who support the opinion that "the Kaishin issue should be reconsidered with a clean slate to search for ways to bring the SDPJ back to the coalition." In view of such a mood in their parties, Yonezawa and JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka met at the Diet building on 16 May. They agreed to ask the prime minister to state that "he is willing to consider disbanding Kaishin" at his talks with Murayama on 17 May. While the "Kaishin" group has been formally organized, it has not been functioning at all. Even if the prime minister expresses his willingness to dissolve "Kaishin," it is nearly impossible for the SDPJ to return to the coalition immediately. It is believed that in return for disbanding "Kaishin," the ruling parties would like to solicit the SDPJ's cooperation in the deliberation on the fiscal 1994 budget, the handling of the proposed resolution to dismiss the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Rules and Administration, the issue of summoning former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP head) and his former secretary to testify in Diet, and other matters of steering Diet affairs. It has also been reported that during a telephone conversation with Matsuoka [on the Kaishin issue], Hosokawa told Matsuoka to "listen carefully to what the parties concerned think."
