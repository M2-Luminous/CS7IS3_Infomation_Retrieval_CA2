The Belarussian leader's resignation was quite unexpected for Russia's foreign ministry, he said. Nevertheless Russia had no reason to fear that relations between the two countries would cool, since "all the branches of power and major political forces (except the Popular Front, which has about 10% of the vote in Belarus's parliament -- IF) stand for strengthening cooperation with Russia." According to Interfax's interviewee, no one in Belarus needs negative changes in bilateral relations, since Belarus gets from Russia about 90% of its fuel, and Russia accounts for up to 72% of Belarussian turnover. As the diplomat said, Shushkevich's departure may even stimulate closer cooperation between the two countries in the framework of the CIS and on a bilateral basis. For instance, the former parliament chairman procrastinated on a decision on his country's joining the treaty on collective security, and notified the Russian leadership of a positive decision on this issue only on December 31, 1993. With reference to the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, which caused a controversial response in Moscow, Interfax's interviewee said that "the political dividends Moscow will gain as a result of the proposed agreement will outweigh the financial expenditure, and in the future this will bring Russia considerable profit." Head of Belarussian diplomacy Piotr Kravchenko maintains that changes in the country's leadership will not affect relations with Russia. The Minister-Counsellor of the Russian Embassy in Minsk, Vyacheslav Kovalenko, told Interfax that at Thursday's meeting with Russian Ambassador Igor Saprykin he stressed that the Belarussian leadership would continue its policy of rapprochement with Russia.
