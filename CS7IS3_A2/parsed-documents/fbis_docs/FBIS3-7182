In its "action plan for international cooperation," the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association on Thursday [24 March] also proposed inviting smaller parts makers in the U.S. to regular business negotiations between Japanese carmakers and major U.S. parts makers. The action program was published to coincide with the government's planned market-opening measures to be announced shortly. It is apparently designed to help break the ice in the framework trade negotiations, which broke down in February. The private-sector talks were held twice in 1992 but no bilateral discussions have taken place since. Following the program, Japan's five biggest carmakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. will separately announce individual schemes for purchases of U.S parts.
