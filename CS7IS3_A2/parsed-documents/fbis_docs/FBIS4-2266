Nicholas C. Hope, the new director of the bank's China and Mongolia Office, said he was very satisfied that projects financed by loans from the bank had been going so well. On his first day in his new post, the director visited the expressway connecting Jinan, the provincial capital, and the port city of Qingdao, and an irrigation project in Qufu, the home of Confucius, both backed by World Bank loans. He was accompanied by Pieter P. Bottelier, the bank's chief of mission to China, and officials from the Chinese Ministry of Finance. Mr. Hope said he was deeply impressed by the province's strict management and efficient organization in project operations, and that the province had never delayed repayment of loans. From 1982 to the end of last year, the World Bank had provided loans worth 824 million U.S. dollars on 26 projects in agriculture, traffic, health and education, and 16 of them have been completed. Mr. Hope said that Shandong has great development potential and provides many profitable investment opportunities. He expressed the wish that the bank would continue and expand its good cooperative relations with Shandong. At the end of his visit, Mr. Hope received six applications from the provincial government for loans for six projects in coastal environmental protection, traffic, power supply and rural housing development. The proposed loans total 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. Mr. Hope said he would take the applications to the bank's Washington headquarters, and that he would personally actively support them.
