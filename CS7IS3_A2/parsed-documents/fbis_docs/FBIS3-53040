Not a single Army unit or base has been evacuated. The date will be set in accordance with the agreement reached by Israel and the Palestinians. Nonetheless, the IDF Logistics Branch has begun employing outside contractors and IDF teams at dozens of locations in the Gaza Strip and Jericho to prepare the sites for the evacuated IDF units on the date to be determined. It is believed, however, that the work will go on for several months after the evacuation decision is made. The cost of the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho is estimated at some 500 million shekels. So far, an expenditure of approximately 230 million shekels has been approved, of which dozens of millions of shekels have already been spent, and this sum does not include the cost of works on roads, travel axes, and measures to protect the settlements. The Army has began infrastructure work at the alternative site set aside for the IDF units that will be evacuated from Jericho. It has been learned that the site is being constructed southeast of Jericho, near the settlement of Mul Nevo. The IDF is scheduled to complete the construction of the electronic fence that will surround the Gaza Strip by April 1995. The barrier will include intrusion-tracking dirt roads, a paved road, an obstacle fence, and the electronic fence itself. The barrier will be 50 meters in width, 65 km in length, and will cost 100 million shekels. It has been decided that several contractors will work simultaneously in order to finish building the fence that will protect the settlements inside the Green Line on time. The other fence that is designed to surround the Qatif Bloc will be 17 km in length. It will also be an alarm fence, although this is not yet final. [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 11 January carries a related report by Sharon Sade on page A3, adding that recent estimates drawn up by the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment indicate that if the evacuated troops were "to take over uninhabited buildings in the Gaza Strip settlements of Pe'at Sade and Nisanit, the IDF could save approximately 25 million shekels." The report adds that "the defense establishment is finding it hard to obtain the consent of the representatives of the religious settlements." According to defense establishment estimates, the settlement of Netzarim's refusal to allow the IDF to set up a post in the settlement "will result in an expenditure of approximately 5 million shekels on the construction of a separate outpost."]
