Since 1990 Hungary has received substantial assistance (to the tune of ECU417 million) from the European Union to support its transition to a market economy and to promote civic society goals. The indicative programme (IP) has been drawn up against the background of important developments, notably the signing of the Europe Agreement in December 1991, and its entering into force on 1 February 1994, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] guidelines for 1993-97 approved by the EU member states in November 1992, and the conclusions of the European Council of June 1993 in Copenhagen. For Hungary, the PHARE 93-97 guidelines and the conclusions of the EU council of Copenhagen, have had a number of implications which were already incorporated in the 1993-1994 indicative programme, including: (a) a continuing strong emphasis on institutional development, and concentration of efforts on a limited number of core areas of activity; and (b) adapting the assistance framework to promote directly growth-oriented objectives by drawing on the range of PHARE instruments available, as well as through close donor coordination and (where appropriate) co-financing with external and domestic sources of finance. In light of the government's priorities and taking into account the principles guiding the PHARE assistance, the following three main areas of assistance have been agreed by the government of Hungary and the European Commission: (i) private sector development including financial sector reform, enterprise restructuring, investment and trade promotion, agricultural reform, sme development and regional development. (ii) infrastructure development including development of transport infrastructure, improvements of border crossing, environment and energy. (iii) human resources development including support to the TEMPUS programme and public administration reform. In addition support will be provided for the implementation of the Europe Agreement.
