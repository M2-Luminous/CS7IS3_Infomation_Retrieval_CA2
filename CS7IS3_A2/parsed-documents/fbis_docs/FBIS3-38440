Some 47 percent of employed Spaniards over the age of 15 supported the strike called by the Workers Commissions and the General Workers Union. The population are divided in assessing whether the strike did or did not represent a success for the trade unions, but in any event they believe it is the government which was damaged most: 65 percent of the public believe the strike has damaged the image of Felipe Gonzalez' government. This is the overall conclusion of a snap opinion poll conducted by Demoscopia for EL PAIS on Thursday [27 January]. The percentage of interviewees who believe that the protest was beneficial for the trade unions' image is twice that of those who believe it has harmed them -- 45 percent, as against 22 percent. On the other hand, those who believe that the strike has damaged the government's image total 65 percent. Only 2 percent of those polled believe the government's image has benefited, while 17 percent believe it has not been affected. The government is thus perceived by the Spanish people as the main loser in a strike which was not observed by an absolute majority of the working population. With respect to the observance of the protest, 47 percent of Spanish workers over the age of 15 went on strike, as against 50 percent who did not do so. The remaining 3 percent did not answer the question. These figures represent a sharp contrast with those for the 14 December 1988 general strike. At that time, according to the Demoscopia poll figures, the percentage of the working population who supported the strike was put at 75 percent; thus the participation on this occasion was almost 30 percent lower than at that time. In the current poll, the estimate of the level of observance of the strike was made, on the one hand, by asking the interviewees who said that they were working (and who represent 40 percent of the sample) whether or not they went on strike, and, on the other, asking all the interviewees whether those over the age of 15 and in employment living in their homes observed the strike. Thus, on the basis of the 800 interviews conducted (40 percent with people working, 11 percent with people unemployed or seeking their first job, and 49 percent with nonworking people), it was possible to gather information on the employment status and the attitudes toward the strike of a total of 919 people, which represents a sound basis for estimating the true extent of the strike. Success or Failure Some 76 percent of the workers voting for United Left supported the strike, as against 58 percent of the workers voting for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], and 24 percent of those voting for the People's Party. Although a majority (specifically, 45 percent of those polled) believe the strike will serve no purpose, the majority reaction now, as happened after 14 December [1988], is that the government should negotiate new labor market reform with the trade unions. Such is the opinion of 58 percent of the Spanish people, a percentage which rises to 66 percent among United Left voters and 65 percent among PSOE voters. Public opinion is divided over the trade unions' success with their protest: 37 percent of those interviewed believe that they had "a great deal" or "a fair amount," as against 34 percent, who believe "little" or "none." Only among workers who voted for United Left are those who believe in the trade unions' success an absolute majority (68 percent). The main reasons why the interviewees believe citizens went on strike are, in the first place, in order to protest against the way in which government is being conducted (44 percent say so), and, next, fear of the pickets and public disorder (mentioned by 35 percent). Only 27 percent believe that those who did not go to work Thursday did so because they agree with what the trade unions say. The dominant perception in society thus seems to be that this was more a strike against the government than in support of the main trade unions. Even among those who supported the strike, the reason cited most often to explain their stance is opposition to the way in which government is being conducted. This confirms the predominantly antigovernment protest character which this strike seems to have had for everybody.
