This means that the practical implementation of the measures provided for in the trilateral declaration of the Presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States on this issue has begun. Experts estimate that the amount of fuel delivered to the Zaporizhzhya AES is sufficient to operate one of the five reactors for a year. This will provide our country with 5.5-6 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electric power.
