FR940919-2-00124 FR940919-2-00051 Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center. AGENCY: National Park Service ACTION: Notice. Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in the possession of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center, Rapid City South Dakota. The detailed inventory and assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects has been made by the State Archaeological Research Center (SARC) curatorial staff, contracted specialists in physical anthropology and archaeology, and representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The remains of an adult and a child were recovered in 1953 from the Cottonwood Site (39HU43), in Hughes County, South Dakota. Excavation data suggests the site was occupied by Dakota Sioux between A.D. 1867&hyph;1900. The Cottonwood Site is located adjacent to the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. The remains of two individuals were recovered in 1961 from Sitting Crow Mounds (39BF225), a Woodland and Historic site in Buffalo County, South Dakota. Objects associated with the adult female and child_including rings, fragments of fabric and metal, shoes, buttons, a toy revolver, and the remnants of coffins_help date the two burials to the Historic Period (post 1750). Craniometric measurements are consistent with those of Sioux populations. Sitting Crow Mounds are located adjacent to the Crow Creek (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe. The remains of two individuals were recovered between 1966&hyph;1968 at Fort Manuel (39CO5), in Corson County, South Dakota. The site is multicomponent, representing Extended Coalescent, historic trading post, and historic Sioux occupations. The remains of an adult male appear to have been buried in a pit in the cellar following the 1813 abandonment of the fort. The weathered condition of these remains is indicative of a scaffold burial with secondary interment, a practice common among the Sioux. Osteological information indicates the child is associated with the Extended Coalescent component of the site. However, wood fragments associated with these remains may represent remnants of a historic period coffin. Fort Manuel is located adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The remains of one individual were recovered in 1979 from the Three Horse Site (39DW35) in Dewey County, South Dakota. The site is multicomponent, representing Archaic and historic period occupations. The remains of the adult male were recovered from a disturbed area along a cutbank. Evaluation of the cranial morphology by K. Richard McWilliams suggests an Archaic or earlier temporal association for the human remains. Physical anthropologists from the University of Tennessee suggest the human remains are from a Sioux population. The Three Horse Site is located within the exterior boundary of the Cheyenne River (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. On May 20, 1994, the above mentioned human remains and associated funerary objects were repatriated to Mr. Sebastian LeBeau on behalf of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Questions or concerns related to the repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects listed in this notice can be directed to Sebastian (Bronco) LeBeau, Cultural Preservation Officer, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, P.O.
