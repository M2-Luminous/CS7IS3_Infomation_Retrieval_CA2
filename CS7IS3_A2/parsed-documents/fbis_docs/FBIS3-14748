ITAR-TASS was told by the press service of the plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of Abkhazia in Moscow that the talks dealt with peace guarantees in the region, return of refugees, and Abkhazia's political status. The Abkhazian side put the failure to sign a final document down to the Georgian delegation's "uncompromising position" over a political status for Abkhazia. According to the press service, this status amounts in essence to the relationship of imperial center and colony, a lack of desire to accept current realities. This toughening of the Georgian government's stance is attributed by Abkhazia to "the signing of a treaty with Russia and hopes that Russian troops will police Abkhazia, and also an attempt by certain circles in the West to preserve the Shevardnadze regime". Despite the difficult nature of the talks, it was decided to continue the search for a political solution to the Abkhazia-Georgia conflict.
