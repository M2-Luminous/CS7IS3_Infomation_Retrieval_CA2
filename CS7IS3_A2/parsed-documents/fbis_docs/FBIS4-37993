Each time it claims that it is accepting the decision of the UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, it simultaneously prepares for a new offensive. The Sanaa regime has continued to launch successive attacks on our defensive lines around Aden, and the intensity and ferocity of these attacks have increased since 17 June. There have been 14 attacks so far, and for each attack they have brought in more reinforcements. Our brave forces and the sons of our people have repulsed these attacks, which aim at the occupation and humiliation of the land and the people's honor. In every attack the Sanaa regime launches missiles and artillery against innocent citizens and vital installations. Since 17 June the number of casualties, dead, and wounded has totaled 800 people, most of whom are women, children, and the elderly. The Sanaa regime early this morning began an attack on the battle lines, but is being resisted with heroism and bravery. At the same time it has been shelling residential areas in the quarters of al-Shaykh Uthman, al-Mansurah and Dar Sa'd since this morning. Innocent citizens are being killed and wounded. The Sanaa regime is also shelling vital installations such as the desalination plant, the power station, the fire station, and the refinery. The Sanaa regime is wrong in believing that its killing of citizens and destruction of homes and vital installations will weaken the morale of the sons of our people and force them to prostrate themselves before occupation and humiliation. The sons of our people prefer to die bravely in defense of their homeland and the protection of their women's honor, than to prostrate and humble themselves before a regime which does not believe in ideals and does not respect people. It is a regime which is not interested in law or legitimacy, whether religious, Arab, or international. In the name of the Democratic Republic of Yemen we announce to the fraternal Arab countries and the international community that the Sanaa regime will not uphold any pledge or commitment it makes to them. It aims to occupy, destroy, loot, pillage, and dishonor. Diplomatic advice is achieving nothing, except to give more time to the Sanaa regime to continue with its attempts at the malicious destruction of our people, and Aden in particular. For this reason we wish to stress what we said in our previous appeal, and the need to take deterrent measures to compel the Sanaa regime to heed the resolutions of the international community and respect human rights. As for our people, they will not submit, and will resist the aggressors with all the strength available to them. God is with us, and those who do wrong should know what kind of end they will suffer.
