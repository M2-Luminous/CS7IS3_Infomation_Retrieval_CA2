Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission Chen Yaobang says future development will pay more attention to sustainable development of the resources and the environment. He says China's National Agenda 21 aims at bringing industrial pollution under control by the year 2000. The National Agenda 21 covers the economic development, natural resources, environmental protection, agriculture, population, and education. The plan is China's response to the World Agenda 21 endorsed by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. All participating countries agreed to do their best to protect the environment. Premier Li Peng attended the Earth Summit and promised to implement the resolution on behalf of the Chinese Government. Vice minister Chen Yaobang says China's National Agenda 21 was approved by the State Council in March this year. Chen Yaobang says China's National Agenda 21 considers the country's actual conditions and the relationship between the population, environment, and development in the next century. Chen Yaobang says the plan is the guiding principle for the nation's long and medium term social and economic plans. The formulation of the National Agenda 21 has involved over 300 Chinese experts and has drawn the attention of the United Nation's Development Program [UNDP]. The UNDP has worked with the Chinese Government for making Agenda 21. Chen Yaobang says Agenda 21 will be implemented in three phases. Sixty three projects are included in the first phase of the plan. The projects are aimed at obtaining international cooperation. Chen Yaobang says the preferential project will give a boost to China's sustainable development. He believes the implementation can have some influence over global development. However, he says the implementation is a huge amount of investment. Chen Yaobang says the first stage of implementation needs $3.7 billion. The Chinese Government will cover 60 percent of the cost. The other 40 percent will be obtained through international donations. China is to hold an international donor conference in July to gain financial and technical assistance.
