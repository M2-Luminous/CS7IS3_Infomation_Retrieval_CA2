This was contained in an economic forecast report that the business newspaper FORUM FOR EKONOMI OCH TEKNIK presented in its most recent issue. This positive view applies both to the Finnish economy overall and to their own firms. On the other hand, the number of CEO's stating that their personnel staffs are going to be reduced is larger than the number of business leaders planning new hirings. The report, which was prepared by Oy Interpersona Ab, is based on a questionnaire sent to 230 managing directors around the end of March and beginning of April. Almost three-fourths of business leaders assume that the Finnish economic situation is going to improve over the next six months, while 25 percent believe the situation will remain unchanged from the present level. Only 3 percent expect a worsening. Regarding their own firms, six of 10 think that activity will pick up in the coming half-year. One-third believe that the activity level will remain unchanged, while 6 percent expect declining figures. The business leaders, however, do not expect to see any improvement regarding jobs. Only 12 percent say they are going to increase their work force during then coming six months. Every third CEO is counting on a reduction of personnel, while 55 percent foresee retaining their current work force size. The CEO's, in addition, were asked to describe their firms' current general policies.
