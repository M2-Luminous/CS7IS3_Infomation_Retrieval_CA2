This was his first interview with a Russian paper in his capacity as Czech president. "We feel we belong through historical tradition to Europe which is called Western. Russia is standing with one foot in Europe, but is in Asia with the other, which is a different world. I think we must live in friendship, based on a rich structure of relationships. I cannot imagine the world without this. At the same time, there is no reason to deny the difference which exists between us," Havel said, pointing to the "evident difference between Russia's spiritual, historical, cultural and political world, and that, let us say, our, Central European." "I believe that we must respect the specific Russian space, but Russia, too, must bear in mind that is up to us to decide on where we want to stand," Havel told the paper. "Russia must be a fundamental partner for that Europe which is called Western, while Central Europe is striving to be considered its part," Havel said. "Of course, local peoples do not think that Russia is trying to interfere with our affairs more than with those of other states, or that we belong in some sphere of interests or influence. This is an unequal position. No one can dominate. The relations can be improved only on the basis of the principle of total equality. To tell the truth, this part of Europe is somewhat disturbed at some voices from Russia which seem to suggest that Russia considers us its zone of interest, and that it would like to endorse our right to enter these or those organisations," Havel stated. On the recent achievements of the left in some Central and East European countries, Havel noted that "it does not seem that the political pendulum would swing to this side in the Czech Republic in the foreseeable future." There are many, also historic, causes of this, because "unlike Poland and Hungary, there was most conservative communist regime in the Czech Republic," Havel said. Havel said he did not consider the shift of power to the left a signal of the return to communism. "This is simply a symptom of a period of democratic development. In some democratic countries more left-orientated parties are at power, while elsewhere there are more right-orientated parties. I would not draw any far-reaching conclusions from this," he added. Regarding the communists' position in the Czech Republic, Havel said that at present three parties have succeeded the former communists, while "two of them are reform-minded (SDL, the Democratic Left Party, and LB, the Left Bloc) and I can imagine their normal participation in a democratic system." "The third is more conservative, uniting the older, more orthodox communists who are not able to relinquish the ideology. However, I do not think they could jeopardise democracy," Havel said.
