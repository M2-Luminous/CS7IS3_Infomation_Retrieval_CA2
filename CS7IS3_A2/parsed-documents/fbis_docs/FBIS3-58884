Two subjects were at the center of talks: The implementation and possibly improvement of the 15 December agreement on the Uruguay Round; preparing the post-Uruguay Round. The Commission repeated the importance it attached to this last aspect, both for creating the new Multilateral Trade Organization and the negotiations to envisage later on "trade and competition" and "trade and the environment." As for implementing the 15 December agreements, the EC considers that improvements should still be made to the offers of certain third countries over market access, be it for textiles (Asian countries) or financial services (Japan), etc. In the field of agriculture, it is rather the Community which is under pressure: Certain third countries are calling for improvements in its offers. Thus, in the Sutherland-Steichen talks, there was special mention of: (a) Chile's request to enlarge its export quota for apples to take account of the quantities it traditionally exports to the Community (114,000 tons instead of 98,000 tons), otherwise Chile may take the case before a GATT panel; (b) Australia's request for an increase in its sheep meat quota, this country claiming to be badly treated compared to New Zealand; (c) a problem for Canada regarding the timetable set for the presentation of improved offers (to 15 February); (d) the rejection, notably by Guatemala, of the Community offer for an amicable settlement of the dispute on the EEC's new rules in the banana sector. The problem of the audiovisual sector was not explicitly discussed during Mr. Sutherland's talks in Brussels, however, it continues to be the source of controversy between the EC and the United States. Mr. Kantor's view is that the lack of a specific arrangement in the Uruguay Round means that current GATT rules apply, and the United States plans to attack EC policy (in particular limits on the broadcast of non-European programs under the TV without frontiers directive). The United States could respond to these restrictions, which it considers unlawful, with retaliation measures. In contrast, for Mr. Delors, the matter has been settled in that the parties can apply their own rules and the matter will not be reexamined. Sources close to Sir Leon Brittan limit their observations to saying that it would not be easy for the United States to prove injury as a result of the European policy before the GATT, since American audiovisual works account for 70-80 percent of the Community market.
