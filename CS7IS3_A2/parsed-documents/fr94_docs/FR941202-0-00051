FR941202-0-00051 FR941202-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;02&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9074; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited (Formerly British Aerospace, Regional Aircraft Limited) HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, which currently require the following on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes: repetitively inspecting the universal joints and universal rivets, replacing any damaged part, and limiting the in-service life of the torque tube shaft assembly. JAL has introduced an improved flap torque tube shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are not life limited. The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive short-interval inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. This action requires installing this improved flap torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the flap torque assembly, which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Effective December 1, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft Limited, Manager Product Support, Prestwick Airport, Ayrshire, KA9 2RW Scotland; telephone (44&hyph;292) 79888; facsimile (44&hyph;292) 79703; or Jetstream Aircraft Inc., Librarian, P.O.

This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Raymond A. Stoer, Program Officer, Brussels Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Europe, Africa, and Middle East Office, c/o American Embassy, B&hyph;1000 Brussels, Belgium; telephone (322) 513.3830; facsimile (322) 230.6899; or Mr. John P. Dow, Sr., Project Officer, Small Airplane Directorate, Airplane Certification Service, FAA, 1201 Walnut, suite 900, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone (816) 426&hyph;6932; facsimile (816) 426&hyph;2169. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain JAL HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 12, 1994 (59 FR 35490). The action proposed to supersede both AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02 with a new AD that would require installing this improved flap torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Service Bulletin No. 27&hyph;JA 920340. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. This action is based on the FAA's aging commuter-class aircraft policy. This policy simply states that airplane owners/operators should incorporate a known design change when it could eliminate, or, in certain instances, reduce the number of critical repetitive inspections. This final rule action has an effective date of approximately 12 months after publication in the Federal Register and a compliance time of 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date. This will allow operators time to schedule the flap torque shaft assembly replacement. The requirements of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02 will still apply until the effective date of this AD or until the installation or modification required by this AD is accomplished, whichever occurs first.
