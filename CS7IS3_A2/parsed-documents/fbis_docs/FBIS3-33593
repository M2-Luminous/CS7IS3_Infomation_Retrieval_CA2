Santos was elected CSTUCB leader during a convention held in Cochabamba. The new leader stated that the problem of land will be one of his overriding concerns as CSTUCB leader. According to data provided by this trade union, there are approximately 36 million hectares of arable land in Bolivia, of which only 4 million are owned by true peasants; the remaining 32 million hectares have been given away to the big landowners or large estate owners, especially in the departments of Pando, Beni, and Santa Cruz. With regard to this issue, Santos explained that "there are, however, 3 million of us peasants who are affiliated with the CSTUCB, and who are demanding that we be given lands so as to be able to eke out a living. We are not asking for a present, but rather to be given back what has always belonged to us." While a few big landowners have control of most of the land in Bolivia, more than a million Bolivian peasants are tilling others' lands in Argentina and Chile. "Need has led them to grovel for a job in other nations, which they enrich because they have no future in the land of their forefathers." According to Santos, an average of 45 Bolivians emigrate to Argentina every day from Potosi Department alone. Even though most of them are illiterate peasants, they are skillful agricultural workers. Argentine ranchers are thus exploiting this situation to their own advantage. Santos stated that in order to put an end to this situation, the CSTUCB will further a policy of dialogue with the government so as to effect a land reform that will enable thousands of peasants to settle in lands located in eastern Bolivia, where there are projects under way providing technical, agricultural, health, and education support. "If they do not pay heed to our demands, we will then be forced to invade the land given out to big landowners, who moreover do not cultivate it," he asserted. According to Santos, Law 1008 is an enemy to coca growers but not to drug traffickers. "Peasants are maltreated, persecuted, killed, their homes are burned down, their organizations are intervened with, while drug traffickers themselves go unscathed," he says. He contends that the jails are packed with peasants who have been driven by hunger to engage in processing drugs, whereas wealthy drug kingpins who bribe authorities never have to go through difficult moments if they are ever caught. Santos is of the opinion that "coca ought to be processed and exported, whether as pharmaceutical products or for other legally accepted uses, and for these drugs Bolivia should get export earnings that favor peasants through legal channels." This is the first time in 17 years that CSUTCB has entrusted its leadership to a Quechua Indian. The CSUTCB was established on 26 June 1979, and has been headed by Aymara leaders from La Paz Department for 14 years. Only once was it headed by an Aymara from Oruro City (Juan de la Cruz Villca). Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indians have never had a seat in the union's executive board. Santos advocates that his new management strategy will seek to "be the bulwark of a multicultural Bolivian state, which we will seek to establish through the integration and strengthening of Aymara, Guarani, Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indian cultures." He told LA RAZON that the "military-peasant pact" made with the help of civilians during the past military regimes was a red herring to carve up the land, "but the time has come for us to struggle to have our grievances met once and for all." The multicultural state that he proposes will consist of achieving the full representation for all nationalities existing in Bolivian territory, through the establishment of "Assemblies of Nationalities" first, and then of a great peasant organization. Santos stated that "there are qualified people among us peasants. We have become aware of the reality that involves 500 years of exploitation and pillage of our natural resources, our lands, and we have decided that we have had enough of so much humiliation."
