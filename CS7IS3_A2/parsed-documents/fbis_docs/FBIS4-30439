The Khmer Rouge has demanded the establishment of a new government that also comprises their representatives," says a statement made public on Wednesday by this party. "The CPP, the statement continues, considers the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia a precious acquisition of the entire Cambodian nation and also the international community, who has provided considerable and sincere assistance. "This precious acquisition has also been obtained through His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, very revered leader," stresses the statement. "If we make concessions to those responsible for the genocide and those who torpedoed the Paris agreement, boycotted and sabotaged the elections, and who are now destroying the country, this would be serious contempt of the Cambodian people and a big blow to the results of the UN operations in Cambodia." The CPP also (?says) that it will stick to its position now and in the future. Future generations of Cambodians also have the duty to value this achievement. The CPP demands that the settlement of all Cambodia's current problems be in accordance with the country's constitution. The CPP eagerly supports the idea advanced by the United States, the other governments, and the public the world over. This concerns the establishment of an office to carry out research on the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodian people and foreign nationals for the preparation of files so that court proceedings could be instituted.
