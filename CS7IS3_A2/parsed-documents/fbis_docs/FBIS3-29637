"It is appropriate (to reshuffle the cabinet) after the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget or after the current regular Diet session ends," the SDP chief told a news conference. The budget is expected to get parliamentary approval around April. The Diet, which convened its regular session on January 31, is to wrap up its 150-day session on June 29. The SDP is the biggest force in the seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Its objection to the cabinet revamping proposed by Hosokawa has been deemed the biggest obstacle to realization of the proposal. "The cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction of the prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to do so," Murayama said. Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, the right-hand man of Murayama, said on a Sunday television program that he cannot help dropping his earlier dissent if Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary to eliminate policy differences within the cabinet. SDP Secretary General Kubo, however, balked at a growing move to merge coalition parties into a new party to make it easier to field joint candidates in the newly created 300 single-seat constituencies for an upcoming general election. "It is difficult for coalition partners to form a unified party in view of (the differences in) their perceptions of the nation and political ideologies," he said. However, he called for coalition parties to make efforts to field joint candidates in the new House of Representatives constituencies to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party and other opposition parties.
