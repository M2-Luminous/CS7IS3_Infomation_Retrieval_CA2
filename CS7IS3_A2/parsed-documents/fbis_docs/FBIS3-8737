More from Pavol Sveton: [Begin recording] [Sveton] [passage omitted] We have learned from the press secretary, in the course of the HZDS National Presidium discussions, that Vladimir Meciar has offered his resignation from the position of chairman of the HZDS, this being based on yesterday's developments in the parliament. However, members of the presidium have expressed their full confidence in him. At the following press debate, Vladimir Meciar, among other things, said: [Meciar] The movement has confirmed that it is entering into opposition and will not enter into any government coalition that is now being formed. The movement is dissatisfied with the president's activities, with the method he has of carrying out his duties, and with the way he has damaged the interests of the state and the good name of the Slovak Government. At the same time, the movement expresses its concern about the internal situation, among the citizens and elsewhere in that the stage is becoming more fragmented rather than consolidated. Can you imagine the big fight that is about to start, for example, in connection with who will propose the prime minister? Peter Weiss [chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL)] thinks it will be him and forgot to notice that, behind his back, a coalition was formed of Milan Knazko [chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic], Ludovit Cernak [former chairman of the Slovak National Party], and Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement], which has gotten more votes than Weiss. Problems are arising in the personnel situation. In any case, the movement recommends and the government wants to apply this recommendation that, after my resignation on 14 March, the whole government will resign. We do not recommend that members of the government accept the president's request to continue exercising their duties. The president grossly offended members of this government by accusing them of corruption. This has spread throughout the world today. He cannot ask that these people who were so grossly accused and offended accept such appointments. He alone must bear the responsibility and consequences. [passage omitted]. Concerning negotiations with other political parties, the HZDS is of the opinion that the leadership of the SDL, particularly Weiss and Milan Ftacnik [deputy chairman of the SDL], is untrustworthy. It broke all agreements that were prepared for this action. It will take a very long time for the trust of our parties and movements to return for a resumption of mutual negotiations, and there is a big question mark over its ever becoming possible. I will return to the parliament together with Olga Keltosova, minister of labor, social affairs, and the family, and Justice Minister Katarina Tothova. We shall use all of our capabilities to become a strong opposition party. [end recording]
