He said in a communique that he regretted that "a technical issue, the size of the blocking minority, destroys our joy at seeing Norway join the other countries (Austria, Finland and Sweden) that have signed agreements on procedures for their admission to the EU." Britain, with some backing from Spain, demands that the entry of those four countries should not dilute the ability of bigger EU members to block decisions they do not like. Currently, 23 out of 76 votes divided up among the present 12 members are enough to block majority-approved decisions. Most members want to maintain this 30 percent level, but Britain and Spain think this would go against their interests, since those two countries could no longer combine with one smaller member to constitute a blocking minority. Other members favor a shift to 27 out of 90 votes. The Danish prime minister said that Denmark could not agree with the British stand "because a successful conclusion to enlargement (of the community) is an absolute condition for letting the European Union meet the next and decisive challenge: integration of the new democracies in Central and East Europe. "The future of Europe is at stake here, neither more nor less. We expect the British Government to recognize the fact that the next meeting of (EU) foreign ministers, in Brussels on March 22, is really becoming a last-chance meeting." Earlier in the day, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen called the British stand "untenable," adding that "I don't like to use the word `crisis,' which has been overused in the past, but this time the EU really finds itself in a deep crisis" because of the British demand. Opposition leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign minister, joined the criticism, saying that "It is incomprehensible that Great Britain has chosen to isolate itself in a corner by adopting an indefensible attitude that weakens the power of decision of a Europe enlarged by several members. ``The British cannot at the same time be firm advocates of enlargement and make the EU's decision-making process even more difficult.''
