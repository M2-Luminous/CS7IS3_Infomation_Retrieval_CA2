FR940106-0-00030 FR940106-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration 21 CFR Part 1308 Schedules of Controlled Substances Temporary Placement of 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine Into Schedule I AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA. This action is based on the finding by the Acting Administrator of the DEA that the placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this rule, the criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I substances under the CSA will be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;473) amended section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 811) to give the Attorney General the authority to temporarily place a substance into Schedule I of the CSA if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. A substance may be temporarily scheduled under the emergency provision of the CSA if that substance is not listed in any other schedule under Section 202 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812) of if there is no approval or exemption in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the substance. The Attorney General has delegated his authority under 21 U.S.C. 811 to the Administrator of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100). A notice of intent to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 1993, (58 FR 58819). The Administrator transmitted notice of his intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In response to this notification, the Food and Drug Administration has advised DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine and HHS has no objection to DEA's intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA. No other comments were received regarding this matter. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3), the Acting Administrator has considered the following factors regarding 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine: (1) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (2) scope, duration and significance of abuse; and (3) what, if any, risk there is to the public health. 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens, 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (STP or DOM) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DOB). Like DOM and DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable of substituting for either DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing an intoxication with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have been reported to produce intense and frightening hallucinations.
