FR941025-2-00086 FR941025-2-00055 Bureau of Reclamation Clark County Wetlands Park Master Plan, East Las Vegas, NV Agency: Bureau of Reclamation, Interior. Action: Notice of intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement and notice of scoping meeting for Clark County Wetlands Park Master Plan. SUMMARY: Clark County Departments of Comprehensive Planning and Parks and Recreation propose to develop a desert wetlands park in Las Vegas Wash, between the Sam Boyd Stadium and Lake Las Vegas, east of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada. A portion of the park would be on Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) land. Reclamation proposes to prepare a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) to address the impacts associated with construction and operation of the park. A scoping meeting is planned to provide information and receive oral comments from interested parties. DATE AND ADDRESS: Scoping meeting, November 9, 1994, 7 p.m., Las Vegas Natural History Museum, 900 Las Vegas Boulevard North, Las Vegas, Nevada. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Comments and questions should be addressed to Del Kidd, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006&hyph;1470, telephone: (702) 293&hyph;8698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Since 1970, 470 acres of wetlands in Las Vegas Wash have been lost to erosion, and hundreds of thousands of tons of eroded material deposited downstream in Lake Mead. Las Vegas Wash is a unique desert wetland with important recreation and conservation potential. Four alternative plans have been developed in a Wetlands Park Master Plan being prepared by the Clark County Departments of Comprehensive Planning and Parks and Recreation. These alternatives, plus a no action alternative, will be evaluated in the EIS. All action alternatives include approximately 15 erosion control structures in Las Vegas Wash, as well as extensive wetlands enhancement. Each alternative focuses on a concept of intensity and type of park use: conservation, recreation, full development, and a balance of the three. The draft EIS is expected to be available for public review and comment by the middle of 1995. Public workshops with agency representatives and interested parties have been held on the Master Plan to ensure that the park components are appropriate to the community and the environment. Future public meetings will include an EIS scoping meeting and a public hearing to ensure that a full range of all issues related to the proposed action are identified and addressed. Dated: October 19, 1994. Lawrence F. Hancock, Regional Director, Lower Colorado Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26367 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;94&hyph;P
