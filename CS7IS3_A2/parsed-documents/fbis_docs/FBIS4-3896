FBIS4-3896 "drchi080_l_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Science & Technology Authorities Confirm Explosion at Xichang Satellite Base Authorities Confirm Explosion at Xichang Satellite Base HK2604024794 Hong Kong MING PAO in Chinese 26 Apr 94 p a10 HK2604024794 Hong Kong MING PAO Chinese BFN ["Special dispatch": "Authorities Confirm Explosion in Xichang Satellite Base in Early April"] [Text] The Chinese authorities confirmed that an explosion occurred on 2 April at the Xichang Satellite Launching Base. One person was killed in the accident and over 20 people were injured. A laboratory and an advanced meteorological satellite were destroyed. Western space experts believe that the accident was a serious setback for China's aerospace industry. A spokesman for China's Aerospace Industry Corporation confirmed the accident to foreign mass media after the U.S. magazine NEWSWEEK published a report about the explosion in Xichang. However, the spokesman said that only one person was killed and this was different from the NEWSWEEK report claiming two deaths. It is said that the satellite destroyed in the accident cost $75 million. MING PAO took the lead in reporting about the Xichang explosion on 9 April. The spokesman for the Aerospace Industry Corporation stressed that the accident would not affect China's plan to launch other satellites throughout the rest of this year. Last month, GONGREN RIBAO reported that China planned to launch five satellites this year. The spokesman also said that the authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion and would make public the findings once they reached a conclusion. NEWSWEEK, in the latest issue published yesterday, quoted a diplomat as saying that the explosion was caused by a leak in the fuel supply system. The NEWSWEEK report said that this was a serious setback for China's aerospace development plan. China attaches great importance to its satellite launching plans. On 8 April, the Chinese official mass media said only that the satellite launch was postponed due to unexpected factors. According to the original plan, a Fengyun-2 meteorological satellite was to be carried into space orbit by a Changzheng-3 rocket. In fact, China has strong competitive power in the field of satellite launching. Although a live televised satellite launch failed in 1992, people in this industry believe that the Chinese rockets were basically reliable and were extremely "economical." China only charged $45 million for launching a customer's satellite and this was much cheaper than the American and European services. The American companies normally charge $100 million and Europe's Ariane Company charges $85 million.
