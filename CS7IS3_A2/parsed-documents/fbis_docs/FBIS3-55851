It would be possible to welcome Russia's contribution to ensuring Kuwait's security. But there is the troubling fact that Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation has begun before the normalization of relations between Kuwait and Iraq and so inevitably acquires an anti-Iraqi complexion. The door to cooperation with Iraq -- a rich and influential state with which we used to be linked by very close ties -- has thereby essentially been slammed shut. In such a situation it is hardly rational, as our new friends, the Americans, say, to put all our eggs in one basket.
