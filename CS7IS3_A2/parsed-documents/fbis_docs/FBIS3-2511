As the Sino-Indian trade was already 670 million U.S. dollars last year, it can grow to the level of 1 billion U.S. dollars, cheng said at a function here Tuesday [8 March]. At present China imports about 4 million tons of iron ore from India. "The import bill could be much higher as our steel sector is growing by leaps and bounds. We will also need substantial quantities of coal in the near future," the Chinese ambassador said. The main impediments in the way of a high growth rate in bilateral trade are the dearth of national shipping lines and banking clearance.
