FR941110-2-00046 FR941110-2-00014 [C&hyph;351&hyph;406] Certain Agricultural Tillage Tools From Brazil; Termination of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Termination of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On November 27, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of the countervailing duty administrative review of certain agricultural tillage tools from Brazil. The Department has now decided to terminate this review. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dawn Carroll or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. Background On October 9, 1992, the Department received a request for an administrative review of this countervailing duty order from Marchesan Implementos Agricolas, S.A., an importer of the subject merchandise, for the period January 1, 1991, through December 31, 1991. No other interested party requested a review. On November 27, 1992, the Department published in the Federal Register (57 FR 56318) a notice of ``Initiation of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' initiating the administrative review for that period. On August 19, 1994, Marchesan Implementos Agricolas, S.A., submitted a withdrawal of its request for review. Section ยง355.22(a)(3) of the Department's regulations stipulates that the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the requested review. This regulation also provides that the Secretary may extend the time limit for withdrawal of a request if it is reasonable to do so. Because no significant work has been completed on this review, the aforementioned importer's request does not unduly burden the Department. Moreover, we have received no objections to terminating this review from other interested parties. Therefore, under the circumstances presented in this review, we are waiving the 90-day requirement in 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Accordingly, we are terminating this review. This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Dated: November 1, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
