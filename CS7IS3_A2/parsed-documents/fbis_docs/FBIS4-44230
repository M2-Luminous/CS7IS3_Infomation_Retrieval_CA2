Osman Ertug, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' New York envoy, described the development as an unfortunate decision and said that it will not help the negotiation process on the island. In his statement to Anatolia Agency, Ertug pointed out that the decision will deepen the rift in Cyprus and added: With this decision, the EU leaves us no alternatives but to merge with Turkey. If south Cyprus merges with the EU, then we have no options but to integrate with Turkey.
