OW0306130594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1132 GMT 3 Jun 94 OW0306130594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States resumed telecommunications trade talks Friday [3 June] by taking stock of their positions since talks collapsed in February, a Japanese official said. Negotiators had a "wide-ranging discussion" on government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, the last of three priority sector talks to resume in bilateral trade "framework" talks, said the Foreign Ministry official. He described the meeting after a hiatus of three and a half months as a get-reaquainted session, saying "a decision would be impossible" in a day. Talks between the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and Japan's Finance, Trade and Telecommunications Ministries will continue with a full-day session Saturday, he said. But no deadline has been set, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition his name not be used. He would not comment on whether the negotiators discussed "objective criteria" or the treatment of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) -- two key issues in the sectoral talks. U.S. Officials were not available for comment. How to assess market-opening progress is the biggest remaining issue in the field, on which the two sides are "nine-tenths of the way toward agreement," a ministry official said earlier. Also at issue is whether to include NTT in the talks, with Japan insisting it is a private company but the U.S. stressing the Japanese Government's two-thirds ownership. Talks on insurance began Wednesday in Tokyo and on autos and auto parts Thursday in Washington.
