"It is almost certain that the state revenues will fall short of the initial estimate, while spending for routine activities will be higher than originally projected," Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said here yesterday. The state budget for the 1993-1994 fiscal year, to end next month, should, by law, balance at Rp [Rupiah] 62.32 trillion (US$29.6 billion). Receipts from the oil and gas sectors are expected to account for 28.7 percent of the total revenue projection. Mar'ie told reporters following a hearing with the Budgetary Commission of the House of Representatives (DPR) yesterday that the fall in oil prices will significantly reduce the government's income from oil and gas taxes, which are projected to reach Rp 15.12 trillion ($7.2 billion) in the current fiscal year. The estimate of the state receipts from oil and gas taxes is based on an average oil price of $18 per barrel, far higher than the realized average price of $16.50 in the first 10 months of this fiscal year. Oil prices on the world market are now hovering at around $13 per barrel. Mar'ie said the higher-than-expected increase in routine spending, especially for the salaries of civil servants and armed forces members, will widen the deficit. The minister refused to explain the amount of the deficit in the 1993-1994 fiscal year but said that the fall in the state revenues will not cause a major blow to the government's coffers. "The government will partly use its development fund reserves to cover the expected deficit," he said. The government has allocated around Rp 3.5 trillion ($1.6 billion) as reserves to finance the shortfall in the state revenues. The minister pledged during yesterday's hearing, which deliberated the state budget for 1994-1995, that the government will not introduce any drastic measures to manage the country's economy next fiscal year despite the continued fall in oil prices. Yesterday's session was the third day of deliberation which will end today, on the 1994-1995 state budget. The budget plan will be further deliberated in the House's plenary session on Saturday before being passed into law. The state revenues and expenditures for the 1994-1995 fiscal year are estimated to balance at Rp 69.74 trillion ($33.2 billion). The receipts from oil and gas sectors, which are projected to reach Rp 12.85 trillion ($6.11 billion), are based on the oil price reference of $16 per barrel. The minister acknowledged that the cut in oil price reference to $16 per barrel from the current $18 per barrel reflects the government's concern over the falling oil prices. However, House members said the $16 price reference is still too high as oil prices on the international markets have now declined to below $13 a barrel. The receipt projection from the oil and gas sectors will account for 21.5 percent of the total state revenues in the next fiscal year. The 1994-1995 state budget will come into effect in April.
