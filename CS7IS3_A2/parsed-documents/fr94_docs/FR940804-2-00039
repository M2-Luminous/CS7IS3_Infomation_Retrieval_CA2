ACTION: Notice of work session. SUMMARY: The Institute for Telecommunications Sciences (ITS) at NTIA and the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announce a work session targeted at defining a National Wireless Performance Benchmarking Program to identify common approaches for measuring the performance of wireless communications systems or components. This work session is directed at technical decisionmakers involved in wireless systems. Its purpose is to gather information on industry needs that will enable NTIA, NIST, independent laboratories, and the wireless industry to develop and provide performance measures to promote the development and consumption of wireless products and services. This information will be used to plan the joint National Wireless Performance Benchmarking Program. DATES: The work session is scheduled as follows: 1. August 16, 1994, 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. 2. August 17, 1994, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ADDRESSES: 1. Gaithersburg Hilton Hotel, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 2. Gaithersburg Hilton Hotel, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Space is limited and early registration is encouraged. Participants are expected to provide, one day in advance, a one-page technical position statement on requirements for a national wireless performance benchmarking program. Statements will be used by NTIA and NIST to identify common areas for discussion at the work session. Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information.
