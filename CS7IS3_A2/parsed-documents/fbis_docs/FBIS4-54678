Would you ever think of emigrating? [Walesa] No, I never took such a possibility into account. There is always a chance things can be improved. [Wasiuta] But in the past you were pressed to leave the country, right? [Walesa] And that is why nobody ever succeeded in doing that and never will [as heard]. [Wasiuta] Recently, more and more young and educated people have left Poland. They emigrate. They are leaving for reasons different from those common during communism, but this makes Poland a poorer country. What do you think about it? [Walesa] Well, here one can see the difference between generations. My own generation was to some extent educated by teachers who had themselves lived during the Second Republic, where the homeland was more important than anything else, regardless of the costs of living here. Now we talk about being Europeans. We say that this country opens up, that efforts to stress differences do not make much sense. This induces young people brought up this way to look for places where life is better, where they can get more. [Wasiuta] What is wrong with that? [Walesa] Well, it is happening at a bad time because the country needs to catch up with Europe as quickly as possible. It needs solutions because it is behind a little. If more valuable people leave, this is a loss for the country. Of course, later, after a hundred or so years, this loss will be compensated for, but it means that our chances to catch up with the world are reduced. [Wasiuta] A hundred years is a long time. Mr. President, today we are celebrating the 3 May Constitution. This is a celebration for those who never accepted Poland's loss of sovereignty, national dignity, and independence. Do you think those people have won the battle? [Walesa] Yes and no. Again one should ask how one can win, how one can build up patriotism or take care of the nation, of the state, when this state is Europe or, rather, the fact that we are striving for Europe. That is why certain things will have to be reevaluated. I think that certainly in 200 years Poland and other countries will differ from one another only in their folklore and past history, but we will really be one Europe. Whether this will be better or worse, who knows? But that is what we are striving for. [Wasiuta] Mr. President, after the signing of the treaty in Vilnius, the Polonia, or the Polish minorities in Lithuania and other neighboring countries, have had their rights guaranteed, but there are countries where the Polish minorities do not have such guaranteed rights, and these people look longingly at Warsaw and at you, Mr. President. What can be done in this regard for Kazakhstan, for instance? [Walesa] Of course, we must make every effort to make sure that people of Polish origin, wherever they live, can enjoy similar solutions, but this depends not only on their mother country, but also on the countries they live in. When we reach European living standards, this will not constitute a great problem, but now there are still big differences, both economic and political, and, as regards security, so the problem lies in the differences in levels, and efforts will have to be made to keep a careful watch on places where the principles worked out by Europe are not observed. And, of course, in extreme cases, we will help people return, although, as I say, in an open pluralistic Europe, the same goal may be reached from different points, and there is no need for massive translocations when borders are open. They are necessary, and people aim for that, but only when differences in living standards are very big, in fact [sentence as heard]. [Wasiuta] Mr. President, as I have already said, the Polonia throughout the world looks at Warsaw with expectation and at you, Mr. President, also with hope. They expect to get moral support. They look at what is happening in Poland from a specific point of view. What can Poland, a country still on its way to prosperity, offer the Polonia today? [Walesa] As you have said yourself, the Polonia is different in every country. There is a Polonia that would like to do business because it has the money, and there is a Polonia that would like to make money out of the mother country because it has no money. So, they are terribly different. One should divide them logically into three groups, and, depending on the groups, on the different levels, they ought to be dealt with accordingly. The rich Polonia should be dealt with in a different way, they should be given a chance to do good business here, while the other Polonia, the older one, should be dealt with in a different manner, rather like tourists: They ought to be shown things. And the rich Polonia that would like to make money doing business with Poland should be treated differently. At present, we do not do enough in this respect, we do not show enough interest in these matters, but I want to say, too, that, while we are setting our country in order economically, politically, and socially, we will have more and more time to deal with other matters. That is bad because it could be the other way around: First set the country in order, and then it would be easier to do the reforms. Yes, but we have approached the problem from another direction, and that is why we do not have good contacts and do not take proper care of the Polonia. But, if the Polonia--for the ball can be returned a different way--if the Polonia organized itself better and forced certain solutions on its mother country, that would suit us much better. But the question again is, which Polonia? The one that expects something or the one that can do something? [Wasiuta] And from which we also expect support. Thank you very much for the conversation, Mr. President. [Walesa] Thank you very much.
