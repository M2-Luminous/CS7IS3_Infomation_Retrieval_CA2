It was reported that the French Foreign Ministry recently favored a decisive measure against the DPRK and manifested its official stand to support a UN resolution on sanctions. "Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the 'nuclear issue' which has become an international focal point from being solved through DPRK-U.S. talks... goading Northeast Asian countries onto a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled waters," the paper quoted a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry as saying. "The situation in our country now has become extremely tense," he said, adding that "our people are making full prepartions to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country." "We have already declared more than once that in case any 'sanctions' should be imposed on us, not only the parties taking the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be held responsible," the spokesman noted. "The French authorities must know that our warning is not an empty word," he warned. The spokesman pointed out that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France "should help toward a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation."
