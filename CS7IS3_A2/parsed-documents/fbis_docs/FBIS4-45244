Five men--two of them Dutch--were arrested in raids in Ilford, Chingford and Woodford, Essex, when £1 million worth of counterfeit Spanish pesetas was also recovered. A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Regional Crime Squad said the weekend raids were not connected with the seizure of £15 million of forged notes and printing equipment at a printing works in Islington, north London, on Sunday. Four men will appear at Redbridge magistrates court, east London, today in connection with that discovery. Lithographic plate maker Paul Matthew Carter, 36, of Sussex; printers Robert David Brown, 44, of Loughton, Essex, and Steven Victor Ross, 20, of Romford, Essex, and company director Robert Barry Kalmanson, 46, of Stanmore, Middlesex, are charged with conspiracy to contravene the Forgery and Counterfeit Act. Officers also found bundles of forged Irish, American, Spanish, Nigerian and Romanian currency in the Islington raid. Details of the notes will be passed to banks in each of the countries involved. In the past year, the squad has found £13 million in forged notes.
