The drill involved all civil defense corps members, whose job is to organize evacuations and provide first aid for air-raid victims. South Korea has conducted monthly civil-defense drills in the past. But in view of "the tensions" over the nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), this month's training was expanded nationwide and included more personnel and equipment. Today's exercise took place at a time when South Korea, the United States and Japan are stepping up their effort to seek U.N. sanctions against the DPRK since Pyongyang reportedly banned inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel in its reactors to determine whether the fuel has been diverted to making atomic weapons. Pyongyang insisted that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.
