That same scheme also seeks to exhaust the efforts and patience of the Arab parties one after the other, force them into positions different from their current ones, and push them into signing separate deals that are not based on the UN Security Council resolutions governing the region's peace process. With the absence of the Security Council resolutions, everything can be subject to interpretation and different readings, like the Oslo agreement. Everything can also be subject to extortion and procrastination. What is agreed upon now can be violated tomorrow. In such agreements, the rights of the weak will be lost and the powerful evil can gain supremacy. We say this because the Washington talks on the level of heads of delegations ended without any progress. Israel expected, and even wanted to see, such a result even before they started. The World was expecting positive results, especially after the great momentum given to the peace process by the Geneva summit. Nothing was preventing the achievement of decisive progress on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks. Syria explained its concept of peace and its position was supported by the United States and the world. Israel was supposed to pledge complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the occupied territories in implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace. But, as usual, Israel maneuvered, procrastinated, and once again raised the issue of its security concerns. In this regard, we recall a statement by Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir in which he stated publicly that he was planning for talks lasting several years so that the world will forget the Middle East question. It appears that what Shamir said is being implemented now in letter and spirit. The Washington talks have entered their third year with no signs of an impending agreement. The positions remain the same. Israel is avoiding the requirement of the complete withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, insists on subjugating the Palestinian people, confiscates their land to give to settlers, and treats the Palestinian people in a manner that runs contrary to all charters and principles of the United Nations and human rights. It murders, destroys, sets fires, and erects further detention centers in violation of all international laws. At the same time, it continues its aggressions against southern Lebanon. Today is so similar to yesterday and the day before because nothing has changed in Israel's behavior and conduct. Everything is being done as if the Madrid Conference had not been convened and as if the Washington talks were a mere opportunity to kill time. With its course of maneuvering, procrastinating, and emptying the peace talks of any substance, Israel seeks to frustrate the Arab parties first, and then the world so the world will reach the point of despair concerning the Middle East question and the stage will be set for Israel to exercise its arrogance, extortion, and aggression. Israel is trying to surpass the results of Geneva summit, which revived the world's hope in the possibility of reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and torpedo its dynamism by dragging out the talks in Washington, by reviving procedural matters, by raising the security excuses, and by avoiding as much as possible the substance of the talks; namely, the exchange of land for peace. Israel is avoiding the future of the territory and gives priority to security before peace as if peace were not the ideal guarantee for the security of states in the region. However, Israel's old-new game is not hidden from the world, particularly the sponsoring party of the peace process. In Geneva, the United States committed itself before the world to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace based on the UN Security Council resolutions. The United States must intervene at the right time to put things in order because the collapse of the peace process will only bring great harm to world stability and U.S. interests.
