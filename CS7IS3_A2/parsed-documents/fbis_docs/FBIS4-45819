But in a few places, pollution and other kinds of environmental deterioration have worsened, according to a national report on last year's environmental status released by the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) yesterday. On a positive note, less waste water was discharged last year. Total waste water discharges amounted to 35.5 billion tons, or 3 percent less than the year before. Industrial discharges accounted for 21.9 billion tons of the total, a 6.2 percent drop over last year. The volume of solid industrial wastes stabilized at 20 million tons last year. Meanwhile, more trees were planted, leading to a new total of 133 million hectares of forested land. But some environmental problems became worse last year. Emissions of certain air pollutants grew. Soot emissions rose by 7.1 percent, and sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain, went up by 6.5 percent. All waste gases last year totalled 11 trillion cubic metres. The worse places for air pollution due to coal burning were found in the bigger cities of north China during the winter and spring. The extent of acid rain did not expand much but it was found more frequently in the southern cities, including Jiangxi Province's Ganzhou, Changsha of Hunan, Chongqing of Sichuan, and Hangzhou of Zhejiang. Atmospheric pollution has become one of the major causes of respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchial pneumonia and lung cancer. The mortality rate of lung cancer in cities was 34 per 100,000 people, a rise of 18.5 percent over 1988. Among farmers, respiratory ailments have become the number-one killer, with a death rate of 165 per 100,000. The report also said that the urban stretches of big rivers and some lakes were seriously polluted. Noise pollution has also worsened, mainly due to crowded urban conditions, traffic, and industry. Last year, over 2,700 industrial pollution cases were reported throughout the country, an increase of 94 cases over the previous year, causing an economic loss of over 220 million yuan ($25 million). More than 10 million hectares of farm land were polluted, reducing grain harvests by 12 billion kilograms. There were 107 large-scale geological disasters such as land collapses, land-slides, and mud flows, claiming 432 lives. The report noted progress in some areas, however. The disposal rates of waste gases, water, and solids have been raised. And more people have the benefit of central heating and piped gas. By the end of last year, 766 natural reserves had been set up, taking up 6.8 percent of the country's total area. Preservation centres for endangered animals were established in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over 300 wild animals have been put under State protection. Xie Zhenhua, NEPA administrator, said that the country's challenges for the future are to improve its energy efficiency, control greenhouse-gas emissions and industrial and urban pollution, and develop new technology to protect the environment.
