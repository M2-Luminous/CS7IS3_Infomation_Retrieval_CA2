State employees have gone back to work. Pubilc and private transportation is functioning normally. Markets and shops are open. The demonstrations, which had paralyzed all activities in Kigali, led to a loss of lives and damage to property. Hospital sources say that Kigali Hospital registered 15 dead and 43 injured, 14 of whom are still hospitalized. Among the injured is a small girl aged six, who lost her arm. The toll forwarded by the Belgian Red Cross is much heavier: About 20 are reported to have died and the number of injured is estimated at 100. According to the police (?brigade) operating in Kigali, peace has returned in almost all areas of the town. However, last night in Gikondo, a man and a woman were killed at (Gatenga). Families who fled their homes in the Gikondo area have not yet returned. This information was reported by our correspondent in Kigali, Jean-Pierre Nshimirumuremyi.
