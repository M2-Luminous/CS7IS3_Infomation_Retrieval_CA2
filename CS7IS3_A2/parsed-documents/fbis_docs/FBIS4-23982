On the issue of two separate currencies in the same Liberia, Mr. Taylor said if the State Council cannot resolve the issue now, he will make a decision after he is elected president of Liberia on 7 September. He argued the question of the formation of a national army is a constitutional issue, on which Liberians will have no choice but to accept: [Begin Taylor recording] We made it very clear that the issue of the national army was not an issue that any individual or body in this country could object to, because it was a matter of the Constitution. No one can violate the constitution. The Constitution calls for the Presidency of this country to raise an Army. We have no alternative. They don't have a choice. On the currency issue, they explained that in the interest of peace, they accepted the issue of the dual currency, in order that no matter where you are in this country, it will be accepted. Well, I view that as having to pass the buck, but if they do not solve this issue, after I am elected president of this country I will solve it. I can see that we are ready for leadership in this country. Others may not be, and we are not going to let these issues [word indistinct] them. After I become president, I will make the decisions as president of this nation on what will happen. [end recording] President Taylor also expresed regret over pronouncements of the Tanzanian and Ghanaian Governments to withdraw their troops from the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force in Liberia. He said he would personally interact with the United Nations and the two governments to ensure their continued participation in the Liberian peace process. President Taylor, however, said the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG must be withdrawn from Liberia in order to move the peace process forward, but stressed that we need the Tanzanians and the Ghanaians here to assist us: [Begin Taylor recording] We regret the statement on the part of the Tanzanian defense minister. Also, we regret the statement on the part of the Ghanaian foreign minister, Dr. Asamoah, on the possibilities of [words indistinct]. The Tanzanians are a very fine military group. They are here, we meet them. If there is anything that we've said, we've said that the Nigerian contingent must go. They have to go. We will not work with them. They will go. But for those units like Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, we will urge the international community to assist those troops, because they are here for peace. It is unfortunate. I will question them and will, as a leader of a major unit in this country, write both the Ghanaian and the Tanzanian presidents, and also a letter to the secretary general of the United Nations, urging them to do everything possible to keep those units here. But let the Nigerians go. [end recording] President Taylor outlined details of the visit of the State Council and TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] delegations to Gbarnga. The NPFL leader said the State Council must seek to have an effective chairman, saying we only seem to be making progress in the absence of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor. Chairman Kpomakpor has been attending the OAU meeting in Tunisia, while other members of the council took advantage of his absence to visit Gbarnga to move the peace process forward. Chairman Kpomakpor, while earlier attending the inauguration ceremony of South African President Nelson Mandela, other council members also sought the opportunity to formally induct Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper as foreign minister, only to come back home later to accept the decision. [sentence as heard] Chairman Kpomakpor is said to be ineffective when it comes to making decisions of grave national concern, and there are calls for his replacement if he cannot (?do) the job.
