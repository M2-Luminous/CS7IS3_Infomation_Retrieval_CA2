FR940810-2-00034 FR940810-2-00022 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Morgantown Energy Technology Center Grant; Financial Assistance Award to University of Oklahoma AGENCY: Morgantown Energy Technology Center, Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of acceptance of an unsolicited financial assistance application for Grant award. SUMMARY: Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology Center gives notice of its plans to award a 36 month Grant to the University of Oklahoma with an associated budget of approximately $1,206,445 of which the University of Oklahoma will cost share approximately 13 percent. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Laura E. Brandt, I&hyph;07, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, West Virginia 26507&hyph;0880, Telephone: (304) 291&hyph;4079, Procurement Request No. 21&hyph;94MC31170.000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The pending award is based on an unsolicited application for the project entitled ``Enhancement of Methane Conversion Using Electric Fields''. The overall objective of this project is to develop a novel, economical process for the conversion of natural gas to more valuable products such as methanol, ethylene, and other organic oxygenates or higher hydrocarbons. Specifically, the University of Oklahoma will investigate and develop electric field conversion and electric field-enhanced catalytic conversion of methane, resulting in an economical process or processes for the direct conversion of natural gas to more valuable products. The most promising process configurations and the most promising operating conditions will be identified and the economic viability of the processes evaluated. The overall scientific or technical merits of the new technology from these research efforts in methane conversion are primarily in the areas of transportation and chemical feedstocks. Much of the natural gas occurs in remote areas in Alaska, and offshore reservoirs. Because of this remoteness, the cost of transporting this gas to markets may eventually prohibit the utilization of these resources. Therefore, considerable interest is being shown in developing a relatively simple, cost effective, process suitable for installation at the well-head for conversion of methane to transportable liquid. Technically this would provide new market areas for natural gas and would provide the means for transporting costly natural gas to market at acceptable costs. If these techniques were developed it could be used to offset imported oil to this country and would provide new transportation fuels, energy fuels and chemical feedstocks to the marketplace.
