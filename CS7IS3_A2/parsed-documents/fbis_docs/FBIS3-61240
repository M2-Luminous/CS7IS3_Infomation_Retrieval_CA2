A special committee on precious stones and metals was established in it, headed by Leonid Guryevich, the democratic television personality from Murmansk who somehow considered himself a great expert in this area, a sphere that is already rather greatly specialized. For his outstanding services in the field of destabilization of the diamond market following dissolution of the parliament, Mr. Guryevich was appointed deputy chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals. While the Ministry of Finance attempted long and unsuccessfully to remove the chairman of this committee, Yevgeniy Bychkov, from his position, accusing him with justification of numerous financial transgressions in which that very same Mr. Guryevich participated as a partner. Following the lead of the directors of the Russian Committee on Precious Metals (the former USSR State Valuables Depository), the parliamentary committee began to wage a campaign in the finest populist traditions regarding the seemingly extortionate agreement with the international De Beers corporation, a monopoly that sells all unprocessed Russian jewelry diamonds on the world market. Some commentary on the particular features of the diamond market is necessary here. Expenditures of producers on the extraction and sale of unprocessed diamonds are not only great, they also involve a tremendous time lag between initial investment and sale. The entirety of diamond production in the world is maintained solely through sales of jewelry diamonds--the production of industrial-use diamonds in itself is unprofitable. The final stage of the diamond market--the sale of jewelry items containing cut diamonds--depends strictly on the economic situation that exists in the main consumer countries (United States, West Europe, Japan). That very "evil De Beers" spends more than $300 million on diamond advertisements, though not trading in diamonds at all, with the aim of boosting final demand. Stability of the economic state of the diamond production industry (or more simply--its survivability) is directly related to support for the stability of the world diamond market, which is provided by the De Beers monopoly and its central marketing organization (CMO). De Beers purchases raw diamonds from producers at fixed prices within the framework of a quota stipulated by agreements and bears a tremendous financial load, paying for stocks of raw diamonds during periods of poor market conditions. Indeed, De Beers controls the "free" diamond market exchange, buying up diamond contraband unloaded by diverse international variants of the demagogue Guryevich to circumvent existing agreements. Incidentally, one year ago De Beers was forced to spend 6-8 million pounds sterling per day to buy up contraband Angolan diamonds on the market which found their way to Antwerp as a result of the chaos caused by the civil war in Angola. For the time being we do not have any civil war in Russia. Things are going excellently, however, with respect to chaos. Mr. Bychkov, a contender for the record in political survivability, and his colleague, Mr. Guryevich, have long been obsessed with the idea of increasing the percentage of jewelry diamonds sold freely and independently on the world market to 20 percent. In this regard, these gentlemen are not disturbed by the fact that Russia lacks the assets for financing diamond stocks and all the commotion on the establishment of Russia's own "De Beers" died down after it became clear that the company Diamonds of Russia, established for this experiment, was unable to find hard currency to purchase the first consignment of diamonds from production enterprises. The zealots of diamond patriotism are not troubled by the fact that professionals engaged in the extraction and trade of raw diamonds are the most skeptical in assessing their labors. It must be noted that rumors spread by certain figures with respect to some kind of supposedly fantastic CMO margin are related to a lack of understanding of the fact that De Beers is the largest producer in the world of raw diamonds (Republic of South Africa, Botswana) and is vitally concerned with stability of the market and market prices. In other words--in supporting the interests of the producers, just as Russia is. Let other people concern themselves about the diamond consumers--Mr. Bychkov and Mr. Guryevich, for example. Until today, against the background of demagoguery and dealing in petty contraband through joint enterprises related to the Committee on Precious Metals, the fact that the contract with De Beers is effective until 1995 has been a restraining factor. However, a loophole has been discovered here, entirely unexpectedly it seems. First of all, the political state of affairs: the government has stated it will support a portion of the budget deficit through sales of diamond stocks of the Committee on Precious Metals on the domestic market. On the other hand, the fairly broad spectrum of low-carat raw diamonds previously considered industrial-use has become available for processing thanks to the selfless labor of Indian jewelers. It is these stones that the Committee on Precious Metals has decided to quietly unload on the Antwerp and Tel-Aviv markets. In this regard, all the experts of the Committee on Precious Metals and its subsidiary organizations, on the one hand, deny getting rid of raw diamonds, and on the other, revile the existing agreement with De Beers. Stating that "we have never unloaded diamonds in Antwerp," Boris Pozdnyakov, deputy chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals, strongly undermines the value of his guarantees. The USSR State Valuables Depository and its partners were once caught engaging in such business. Pavel Kovylin, representing Almazyuvelireksport, a branch of the company Diamonds of Russia-Sakha, acknowledges "the existence of a problem" on the intellectual level. He has not decided to express himself more definitively, however. As a result, De Beers is spending money to buy up not Angolan but Russian diamonds (totaling close to $80 million in value), the understanding between Russia and its strategic partner for 30 years is placed in doubt, and the market--in no way the least important from the point of view of Russia's long-term national interests--finds itself threatened, while Mr. Bychkov and Mr. Guryevich acquire capital based on this, political capital at the least. In principle, the logic displayed by the Committee on Precious Metals team coincides entirely with Zhirinovskiy's patriotic escapades, each of which will inflict real material damage to Russia in the form of falling prices for delivered raw material, insofar as the stability of shipments and potential capacity for reaching agreements with Russian partners are placed in doubt. Thus, the political and economic situation today has become for some people the long-awaited murky current where, as we know, one goes fishing.
