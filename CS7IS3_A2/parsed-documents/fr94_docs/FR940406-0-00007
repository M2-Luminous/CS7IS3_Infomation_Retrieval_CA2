FR940406-0-00007 FR940406-0-00001 The second provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 requires that the Department, in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provide guidance to those State agencies requesting assistance in the development of brief, simply-written application forms, including forms that allow for simultaneous application to participate in the Food Stamp, AFDC, and Medicaid Programs. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b) to advise State agencies of their option to request assistance from FNS when developing their applications. A commenter suggested that the Department reevaluate the FNS application form and work with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to design a simpler, shorter form to be used for all assistance programs. The Department has completed drafting a revised version of the FNS Food Stamp Application Form (FNS Form 385), which is available to State agencies. The Department believes, however, that since many public assistance programs are administered by State agencies and funded by a combination of Federal and State monies, State agencies are better able to design a short, multi-program application form that will enhance the administration of their public assistance programs while lessening barriers to participation for food stamp applicants. Another commenter objected that there is no clear procedure to request assistance from FNS in developing a new application form. The Department disagrees. In the preamble to the June 7, 1989 interim rule (54 FR 24521), the Department describes the procedure necessary to request assistance. The procedure, which has not changed, is for State agencies to request assistance through the Deputy Administrator for the Food Stamp Program. The Deputy administrator, or the Deputy Administrator's designee, would be responsible for overseeing the review of an application form by FNS officials at the Regional level and would coordinate the review of the application with HHS. Regional officials will be responsible for coordinating between the State agency and the National office. Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 also requires that all applications for food stamp benefits contain certain statements on the front cover which advise the household of important information about the application process. These required statements include: (1) A place on the front cover where applicants can write their names, addresses, and signatures; (2) instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application without finishing all parts; (3) a statement describing the expedited service procedures; and (4) a statement that informs the household that benefits are provided only from the date of application. Accordingly, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b) to require that the food stamp application form contain the above information. Subsequent to publication of the interim rule, section 1736 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act, Title XVII, Public Law 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3359, enacted November 28, 1990 (hereafter referred to as the Leland Act) amended section 11(e) of the Food Stamp Act to require that certain information previously mandated to be displayed on the front cover of the application form must now be placed ``on or near'' the front page of the application form. There must continue to appear on the front page of the application a place where applicants can write their names, addresses, and signatures. However, the instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application without finishing all parts, the statement describing the expedited service procedures, and the statement that informs the household that benefits are provided only from the date of application must now appear ``on or near'' the front page. The Department implemented this provision in a final regulation implementing categorical eligibility and application provisions of the Leland Act, published at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, which amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(v), (b)(1)(vi), and (b)(1)(vii). The changes mandated by the Leland Act and implemented in the final rule published on December 4, 1991 have superseded the provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435 pertaining to mandatory information appearing on the front page of the application form. For this reason, the Department is not addressing any comments which discuss this provision of Public Law 100&hyph;435. Individuals with any questions about this provision should refer to the December 4, 1991 final rule. Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule mandate that households be informed on the application of their right to file for food stamp benefits with only their name, address and signature. This is reflected in 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(iv) of the interim rule. A commenter felt this requirement did not consider the impact on on-line application systems which satisfy the intent of this provision in a more sophisticated manner. Usually, an on-line application system does not require applicants to complete any handwritten information on an application form. The eligibility worker completes the on-line application at the certification interview. When an applicant is unable to complete the on-line application process, usually some sort of ``Intent to Apply'' application form is submitted to protect the filing date. The applicant then returns to complete the on-line application process at a later date.
