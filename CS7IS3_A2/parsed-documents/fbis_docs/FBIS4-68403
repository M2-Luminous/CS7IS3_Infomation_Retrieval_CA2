The Korean nuclear crisis could be terminated in two instances: if Kim Il-song departs this life or if the United States conceives a desire to come to terms with Pyongyang. What Is Driving the Great Leader? Being a dictator is good for the health. The great leader Kim Il-song was 82 on 15 April, and he is sound in body and mind. He has kept politicians guessing for almost a year: Does Kim have a nuclear bomb or not? Meanwhile, the armies of both Koreas have been put on alert. A battalion of American Patriot air defense missiles, which from the experience of the war with Iraq in the Persian Gulf are considered the most dependable means of combating Scud ballistic missiles, is being transferred to the south of the peninsula. A Patriot battalion means approximately 200 missiles and 850 service personnel. The missiles will be deployed so as to ensure cover for military airfields and ports, at which American ships with reinforcements would call, in the event of an attack from the North. The appearance of the Patriot missiles is being perceived in Pyongyang as preparation for aggression. North Korea has declared that if it is threatened, war will begin. The West is captive to false alternatives and is deciding what is more dangerous: permitting North Korea to create its own nuclear weapons or organizing a second Korean war. Everyone is asking: What is driving Kim Il-song? To what end is Pyongyang making the whole world, virtually, its enemy? What does Pyongyang need an atomic bomb for? Do the North Korean leaders believe that it is possible, finally, with the aid of a bomb to complete the great cause of the country's unification? Or are the Pyongyang leaders driven by fear? And they need the bomb as a guarantor for their own survival in a world in which there are virtually no islets of real socialism left? Blackmail Meanwhile, Kim Il-song's aim is obvious. He is blackmailing South Korea and in actual fact appealing to the United States. He needs full diplomatic recognition and, possibly, some material assistance. He wants to leave his son and heir, Kim Chong-il, a stable country in more or less favorable international surroundings. But Kim Il-song is not in a position to say plainly what he wants. He retains the hope that Washington will succumb to blackmail, and for this reason everything moves in a closed circle. The DPRK declared that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, then stayed put, all the same, and is now once again threatening to pull out. IAEA inspectors were asked to leave the DPRK, then they were admitted, kicked out once again, and again invited back. The United States agreed to negotiations with the DPRK, then refused, agreed once again, and once again refused. The United States, by all accounts, does not wish to soil its hands and conclude some agreements with Kim Il-song. North Korea is of no key significance for world or even regional policy, and Washington has decided, it has to be assumed, that it can perfectly well wait for the great leader to depart this world and for some changes in the country to begin. The United States is setting prior conditions for Pyongyang: an exchange of envoys between North and South and agreement to the inspection of the nuclear facilities. When Pyongyang declined an exchange of envoys, the anticipated Geneva negotiations between representatives of the United States and the DPRK were canceled. Is There a Bomb? All this notwithstanding, Kim Il-song is undoubtedly dreaming of his own nuclear bomb. In what way is he worse than Stalin or Mao, who saw the possession of nuclear weapons as the basis of their power and influence? American specialists maintain that the DPRK already has one or two nuclear weapons. But there is no proof of this claim. China's composed attitude toward the situation on the Korean Peninsula is explained, possibly, by the fact that Beijing's leaders, who are better informed as to Pyongyang affairs than anyone, know that Kim Il-song has no bomb. Pyongyang is refusing to admit experts of the IAEA to the radiochemical laboratory that, it is believed, is engaged in the enrichment of plutonium. This is giving rise to suspicions, but this is only indirect evidence. We know of the mania for secrecy characteristic of all socialist regimes. In addition, if it is ascertained that there is no bomb, Kim Il-song would be left looking like a fool. He would like to avoid this unpleasant affirmation. It is hard to imagine that North Korea, where intellectual potential has been destroyed for decades, is capable of providing itself with nuclear weapons. Had a nuclear explosive device been created, Kim Il-song would be in a hurry to test it to convince himself of the success. And all nuclear tests are easily recorded. Jealousy South Korea, which is jealously keeping an eye on the Pyongyang-Washington contacts, is not behaving all that prudently. Seoul does not want the North Koreans to come to an agreement with the Americans behind South Korea's back. Amazingly, even the South Koreans harbor some illusions in respect to the Kim Il-song regime. Seoul completely misunderstands the mentality of socialist leaders. For example, Seoul is talking about an internal power struggle in Pyongyang and seriously expects that on 15 April, Kim Il-song's birthday, the DPRK will announce the start of economic reforms per the Chinese model. Seoul is sincerely calling on Pyongyang to open up to the world in accordance with China's example. This, the southerners are urging on the northerners, could help them obtain the recognition of the United States and Japan and attract foreign capital investments.... Some Americans believe that the DPRK needs to be threatened a little and that it needs to be shown that the United States is not afraid of war and will not succumb to blackmail. Any other behavior will merely encourage Pyongyang, creating among Kim Il-song and his entourage a false sense of success in the struggle against world imperialism. The Americans like to recall that in 1950 the young Kim Il-song made up his mind to strike at the South after Dean Acheson, secretary of state of the United States at that time, had in a speech delivered on 12 January at the National Press Club withdrawn the Korean Peninsula from the territory protected by the United States. It was decided in the North that Washington would not intervene in a Korean war and would not come to the South's assistance. As a result the United States had to fight for three years to restore the lost territory to the South. Seoul in Tank Pincers Memories of that war are still alive in Washington, and the American military is now discussing the possible course of a new war. Two-thirds of the 1 million-strong North Korean Army are concentrated along the 100-km demilitarized zone separating North and South. The North's long-range artillery could shell Seoul. Lt. Gen. James Clapper, chief of the Pentagon's intelligence agency, gave the combat readiness of the Korean People's Army high marks, saying that it would attack the South before the latter was ready to repulse it. The American military believes that Generalissimo Kim Il-song, promising to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire," intends to repeat the 1950 experience--throwing the American-South Korean forces into the sea before reinforcements can arrive in time from the United States. Mobile units of the Korean People's Army, military specialists forecast, would attempt with a swift push to break through the South's defenses and capture Seoul and the ports in order to prevent the approach of reinforcements. The forward units of Kim Il-song's army are composed of an armored strike force of 3,500 tanks, 4,000 infantry fighting vehicles, 8,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and 2,500 missile launchers (Katyusha-type). An attack would be preceded by artillery preparation, the purpose of which would be destruction of the South's defensive infrastructure. Aviation would strike at airfields, munitions dumps, and barracks. Having broken through the fortifications and having made use of the tunnels, which, it is believed, Kim Il-song's people are digging continuously beneath the demilitarized zone, North Korean tanks and motorized infantry would rush deep into the country. Phase two of the operation would be the encirclement of Seoul and the capture of the rest of the peninsula. What Is Pyongyang Thinking? The success of the Korean People's Army could, however, be hampered by the low operational skills of the officers, who devote too much time to study of the ideas of chuche, and a shortage of fuel. But all this is speculation. No one has any real information about the situation in the North Korean Army or knows the extent of its combat capability, mobility, and provision with ammunition and fuel.... And no one is giving any thought to the effect this debate is having on the North Koreans, who believe that they have for half a century been living in a besieged fortress. The prolonged escalation of mutual military preparations could perfectly well lead politicians on both sides of the demilitarized zone, which has separated North and South since the times of the Korean War, to break under the strain and to decide to strike first. The South Koreans are already demonstrating to the world that their patience is exhausted. "We have no intention of debating indefinitely," Song Yong-de, head of the South Korean delegation at the negotiations with the North, declared. "I would not even want to say what will happen if the nuclear question is not properly resolved." Yet it is not hard to guess the feelings with which Pyongyang read the reports to the effect that more than 2,000 radical South Korean students organized a demonstration in the center of Seoul against the deployment of the American Patriot missiles. What dreams are evoked by the antiwar demonstrations in South Korea among Kim Il-song's elderly associates, the majority of whom have never been abroad and who derive all their information from secret reports of the Ministry of Public Security? Does it not seem to members of the Politburo that the long-anticipated uprising in the South, which should be supported by a rapid armored strike, has, finally, begun?
