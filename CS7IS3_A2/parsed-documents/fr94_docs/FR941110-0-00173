FR941110-0-00173 FR941110-0-00016 Response: While the Act, at section 1819(h)(2)(E) requires denial of payment for new admissions or for all Medicare residents, and, at 1919(h)(2)(D) requires that denial of payment for new admissions be imposed after the third consecutive standard survey that shows substandard quality of care, it permits the imposition of this sanction anytime that noncompliance is found. Comment: One commenter said that provisions should be made for the protection of Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients, or both, admitted to a facility while the payment ban on new admissions is in effect. To protect such individuals, the commenter said, providers should be prohibited from seeking payment from residents or third parties for any care furnished during a period in which the providers were denied payment for new admissions. Response: This provision is already in the Act at section 1866(a)(1)(A) for Medicare and at section 1919(c)(5)(A) for Medicaid. Additionally, 42 CFR 447.15 obligates providers to accept Medicaid payments as payment in full. Comment: One commenter said that, in order for this remedy to be effective, the duration must be such that there is some assurance that compliance will be sustained. Response: In the strictest sense, regardless of the nature of the deficiency, and regardless of the remedy imposed, there can be no guarantee that substantial compliance will continue once the survey team leaves. We can only impose reasonable sanctions and make periodic on-site inspections to ensure compliance. However, when HCFA or the State denies payment for instances of repeated substandard quality of care, we do, at paragraph (c) of this section, state that the sanction is not lifted until_ •The facility is in substantial compliance; and •HCFA or the State survey agency believes that it will remain in substantial compliance. Comment: One commenter suggested we amend this section to state that a denial of payment for all new admissions will take effect on the date the facility receives the notice of the remedy. Response: Notification requirements are at §488.402(f). Section 488.402(f)(1) states that, except when the State is taking the action for a non-State operated NF, HCFA gives the provider notice of the reasons for, and the effective date of, the remedy. Paragraph (f)(2) states that, for all remedies specified in §488.406, the notice must be given at least 2 calendar days before the effective date of the remedy in immediate jeopardy situations, and at least 15 calendar days before the effective date in non-immediate jeopardy situations. We believe that this is equitable. Nursing homes are businesses, some of them very large businesses. They have payrolls to meet, suppliers to pay, buildings and equipment to maintain, and similar overhead. An ``effective immediately'' notice would not be reasonable. Comment: One commenter said that §488.417(a)(1)(i) is inconsistent with §488.412(b)(3). Section 488.417 says, at paragraph (a)(1), that HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions, and, at (a)(1)(i), that HCFA will and the State must deny payment for new admissions if any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last day of survey identifying the deficiencies. (Since §488.412(b)(3) bears no direct relationship to §488.417(a)(1)(i) and §488.412(a)(3) does, we believe that the commenter meant to cite the latter, which says that if any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last day of survey, HCFA will and the State must deny payment for new admissions.) Response: While §§488.417(a)(1)(i) and 488.412(a)(3) overlap, they are not inconsistent because a certain amount of overlapping has been purposely written into this final rule for ease of reference on the part of those who will use it. As previously, noted, we have amended the regulations text to reflect a 3 month timeframe to comport with the Act.
