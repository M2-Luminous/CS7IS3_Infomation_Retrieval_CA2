The shooting died down later and only sporadic gunfire was to be heard in the morning. The violence broke out when forces loyal to opposition leader Bernard Kolelas launched an incursion into the Diata area, a sector of the Makele-Kele district, which is controlled by supporters of President Pascal Lissouba, the sources said. The militiamen were driven back by government troops, they said, but there were no details of casualties. Opposition spokesman Laurent Mann gave no reason for the sudden renewal of clashes after more than a week of calm in Makele-Kele and Bacongo, an opposition stronghold. He said that government forces deployed heavy weapons in Diata and aimed shells at Bacongo. "We don't yet know how much damage the firing has caused," he added. Clashes between armed opposition militiamen and government forces have killed 110 people in Brazzaville since the beginning of December, according to hospital staff.
