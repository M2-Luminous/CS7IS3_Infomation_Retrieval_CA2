In a unilateral step, which contravenes the agreement with Israel, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat published a decree in the East Jerusalem press abrogating all Israeli laws in the Palestinian autonomous areas. The decree states that from now on, the only laws in effect are those that existed before 1967. Contrary to the promise 'Arafat made to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the PLO's insignia, with a map of all of Eretz Yisra'el, appears on the decree. Furthermore, in the decree, 'Arafat is referred to the president of the Palestinian National Authority, and this constitutes a violation of the agreement. Good morning to Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a senior PLO official. [Abu-Zayyad] Good morning. [Dan] Why is 'Arafat in such a rush to violate the agreement before he has even begun to keep it? [Abu-Zayyad] In my opinion, there is a problem here with the Israeli opposition, as well as with some of the Israelis who support the peace process. They immediately get into a panic and start looking for ways to prove how unreliable the other side is. Several moments ago, you said that 'Arafat had issued a decree canceling the Israeli laws that were in force in the territories. I have the decree here in front of me, and there is no mention of the things you just reported. I do not know where you got the information for your report. [Dan] 'Arafat says: the laws, regulations, and decrees that prevailed in the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip before 5 June 1967 will remain in effect. [Abu-Zayyad] Okay, what else? [Dan] The civilian, ethnic, and religious courts at the various levels will continue to operate according to the existing laws and regulations, with the reference apparently being to those that have been in force since 1967. I do not want to go on in detail, however.... [Abu-Zayyad, interrupting] No, just wait a minute. As a legal expert, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I do not see anything here that violates the agreement with the Israeli party. [Engel] Before you get into any details, perhaps you could tell us: Since when does 'Arafat have legislative powers? [Abu-Zayyad] I will explain myself in a moment. This decree stipulates that the situation will remain as it is. The decision does not mention the Israeli military decrees or the Israeli military courts. [Dan] But is there not a contradiction, at the very least, here? [Abu-Zayyad] No. There is a chapter in the Oslo agreement that refers to a committee that will review all the military decrees currently in force in the territories. As far as the Palestinians are concerned, there is an even tougher clause in the Cairo agreement, which states that the Palestinians have the authority to legialste in those fields turned over to their control; however, any law they wish to enact must be brought before a joint committee that will decide within 45 days whether or not the law is relevant. In other words, the Cairo agreement gives Israel veto rights even in those fields that were turned over to the Palestinians. [Dan] Mr. Yo'el Singer, who helped formulate the agreements in Oslo, asserts that the decree published by 'Arafat constitutes a very flagrant violation of the Oslo agreement. [Abu-Zayyad] I beg to differ. I disagree with him on this issue. I think that the decree states that some of the laws that have been in force in the West Bank up to this moment also existed prior to 1967. Therefore, they will remain valid. Second, in the same decree, 'Arafat states that the civilian, shar'iyah, and other religious courts will continue to operate according to the existing laws and regulations. This means that, practically speaking, he is not canceling anything. The judges and prosecutors will also keep their jobs. In my opinion, there is nothing new here and certainly no violation of the agreement. I have no intention of whitewashing things or misleading anyone. I think that anyone reading this decree should immediately ask himself what is missing and what is not mentioned here. The fact that something is not mentioned here does not mean that it has been canceled or annulled. The contrary is true. [Engel] Well, there is no point in expanding on this subject, because it appears that beyond the gap in positions, there are also quite large differences with regard to what has already been agreed and both parties' legal interpretation of the agreement. But before we get into details, let me ask you about the principles. Who gave the PLO or 'Arafat legislative powers? The agreement stipulates that such powers will only be awarded to the Palestinian Authority, which has not yet been established, and even when established, the Palestinian Authority must coordinate all legislation with Israel. [Abu-Zayyad] Look, in principle, legislative powers derive from the people. Legislative authority is bestowed by the people. Now, within the specific and unique conditions under which we are operating, there is an agreement, and all parties must uphold the agreements they sign and implement them both in spirit and letter. In my opinion, the question of whether we are violating the agreement will only be proved by developments in the field and by the way we interpret and implement the agreement in practice. [Dan] Even the symbolic step of using the PLO insignia with a map of Palestine that includes all of Eretz Yisra'el also constitutes a violation of the agreement. Above all, it is an ostentatious provocation. [Abu-Zayyad] I have a copy of AL-QUDS with the published decree right here in front of me. There is no such insignia. [Dan] But I see it right here in front of my eyes. [Abu-Zayyad] No. Which newspaper are you looking at? AL-QUDS? [Dan] No, I am looking at MA'ARIV, which copied the decree. [Abu-Zayyad] Look at page 4 of yesterday's copy of AL-QUDS. There is a box. Inside the box you can find the decree. I do not know where MA'ARIV got the insignia from. I must also say that I have seen a great deal of incitement in the Israeli press. It is inciting Israeli public opinion against the agreement. I can discern an intention to undermine trust between the two parties. I would like to make the following suggestion to my colleagues in the Israeli press: We have enough doubts and fears on both sides. There is no need to add additional doubts and fears on top of what we already have. It is totally uncalled for. [Dan] Thank you, Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.
