They also denied press reports that the author of a relevant report in the BKA had been transferred against his will by Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union). The spokesman of the Interior Ministry reported that Kanther and Schelter, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, neither expressed the wish nor gave the instruction to transfer the official. According to the BKA statement, the authors of the report saying that the informer was probably a "leading member" of the RAF had themselves evaluated the paper as unfit to be used by a court. This means that it is unsuited for investigating files of the public prosecutor, but it is an assessment. However, the authors had never been urged by superiors or external authorities to change or withdraw the report. The contents of the report has been taken into account in the current investigations, also regarding Steinmetz, and were sent to the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office on 26 October 1993. The internal transfer of the head of the section for terrorism was carried out in the BKA alone and with the agreement of the official, it was stated. Meanwhile, the BKA has tried to find out who might have passed on the controversial information to the press. Since the beginning of last week, the prosecuting authority is carrying out investigations in the BKA because of the suspicion that official secrets were disclosed.
