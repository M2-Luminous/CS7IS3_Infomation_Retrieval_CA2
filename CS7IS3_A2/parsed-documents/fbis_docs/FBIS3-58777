We, therefore, assessed the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the developments in the Balkans. We assessed what we can do to solve the problems in the Caucasus and the problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We assessed how Armenia can withdraw from Azerbaijani territory and the problem can be solved through peaceful means as soon as possible. We further assessed that this problem should be solved within the framework of the Minsk group.
