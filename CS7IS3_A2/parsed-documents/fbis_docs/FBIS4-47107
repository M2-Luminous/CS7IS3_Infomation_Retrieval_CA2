There was an exchange of views on the political and socioeconomic situation in the states within the territory of the USSR and on further steps to strengthen the unity of the communist movement. Conference speakers remarked that the years since the criminal breakup of the USSR against the will of the people had confirmed the accuracy of the principled assessments of congresses of the communist parties of the states and the conclusions of the 29th CPSU Congress. The race for sovereignty stopped the economic development of all states, and the economic reforms became nothing more than a screen to conceal the efforts of a small segment of the population to appropriate the national property created by generations of Soviet people. The breakup of the union, the plundering of national property, and the disgraceful displays of nationalism separated the Soviet people into ethnic communities and divided them into a handful of rich individuals and millions of poor people. All of this led to an economic disaster and the dramatic exacerbation of inter-ethnic and social conflicts. The Soviet people and our common motherland suffered economic losses five times greater than in all of the years of the war with fascist Germany. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people died in inter-ethnic wars and millions became refugees or lost their jobs and were doomed to suffering and poverty. The remarkable achievements of our domestic culture are being replaced by the Western mass culture, with its cult of money and violence. Free medicine and education are being replaced with paid services and are becoming inaccessible to a growing number of citizens. Millions of housing applicants and homeless people have lost hope of obtaining housing. The only indicators that are rising are the mortality, vice, and crime rates. The death rate is higher than the birth rate in the majority of former union republics. The number of people killed by criminals each year is three or four times as high as the number killed during the 10 years of the Afghan war. Under these conditions, the people of these states are beginning to realize that their ruling regimes are essentially against the people, and they are now pinning their hopes on the removal of these regimes and the establishment of government by the people as a result of vigorous activity by the communist movement and progressive leftist forces. The party organizations of the states learned the necessary lessons from their serious defeat. They purged their ranks of traitors, opportunists, and timeservers. Most of the communist parties of the states are finalizing the establishment of their organizational structures and are waging an aggressive struggle for the interests of workers, the laboring peasantry, and the national intelligentsia. The main goals of the communist parties of the states are the following: --service to the laboring public; --socialism and communism as the historical future of mankind, freedom and social equality, collectivism, social justice, and genuine humanism; --the achievement, defense, and consolidation of political power by the laboring public, represented by the soviets, the development of socialist democracy, and extensive national self-rule; --the opposition of the restoration of capitalism, and the reinstatement of the socialist pattern of development in the republics of the USSR as the best method of satisfying the social needs of the laboring public; --the cessation of inter-ethnic conflicts and the prevention of civil wars within the territory of the USSR; --the reestablishment of the USSR as a voluntary association of sovereign states based on the principles of Soviet patriotism, internationalism, the fraternity of peoples, and respect for national traditions, in accordance with the national referendum of 17 March 1991, when three-fourths of the adult population of the country voted to preserve the USSR; --the gradual reestablishment of the single republic communist parties and their unification in a single Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the process of the reestablishment of the USSR. The parties have defined their political strategy and tactics, using Marxist-Leninist doctrine and dialectical materialism as a guide, in a process of creative development, based on an analysis of the actual historical situation and the achievements of national and world science and culture. The parties will use parliamentary and non-parliamentary forms of political struggle to attain these goals within the confines of existing laws. Conference participants reaffirmed the accurate and timely nature of the decisions of the 19th CPSU Congress on the temporary--until the USSR has been reestablished--reorganization of the CPSU as the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU, and they believe that the communist parties of the states are all part of a single communist movement within the territory of the USSR but have their own autonomous organizations and their own programs and charters. Conference participants noted that some of the provisions of the UCP-CPSU Charter and Program and obsolete and do not correspond fully to the present features of the work of the communist parties of the states. They requested the UCP-CPSU Council to work with authorized representatives of the parties on the elaboration of a common set of program and charter principles and to submit them to the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and other general party forums for consideration. Conference participants view the current coordinating convention of leaders of the communist parties of all states formed within the territory of the USSR as a permanent body. Conference participants advise all communist parties to concentrate on elaborating and substantiating our common goals, coordinating joint actions by the parties for the attainment of these goals, publicizing experience in political work with labor collectives and with youth, and developing, supporting, and distributing communist and opposition socialist news media. Conference participants condemn all attempts to split the communist parties and their regional organizations and to create a communist movement with numerous centers and advise communists to unite in single organizations for stronger influence among the workers, peasants, and intelligentsia. Questions connected with differing interpretations of theoretical aspects of the tactics and strategy of party actions can and must be discussed in intra-party debates in accordance with the standards of party ethics. Conference participants appeal to all communists for an active struggle for the unity of the communist movement within the territory of the Soviet Union, for their resolute defense of the interests of the laboring public, and for stronger organizational and party discipline. Our goals are a Soviet Union, government by soviets of workers' deputies, a single Communist Party, and socialism. The resolution was approved by all conference participants.
