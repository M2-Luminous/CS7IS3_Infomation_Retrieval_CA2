It is also a large- scale policymaking meeting designed to keep the economic growth momentum stable, strive for resumption of China's status as a GATT signatory state, expand cross-strait relations to make innovative advances, and accelerate the construction of the Shanghai, Bohai Bay, and Three-Gorges Projects. Why Did All Party Elder Statesmen Make Public Appearances? The current session will place greater stress on the principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both," upholding social stability and the correct guidance of public opinion and, while taking economic construction as the center, maintaining the position of the CPC as a ruling party, ensuring the steady and orderly progress of political structural reform, and preventing the emergence of unnecessary social disturbances. Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and other CPC elder statesmen made public appearances one after another before and after the Spring Festival. Let me keep comments on what effects their public appearances produced to one side for the time being. The public appearances were intended to clarify rumors about the leaders and stabilize the overall situation. The New Stage of Rapid Growth In recent years, while maintaining a peaceful environment with surrounding countries and the rest of the world, the CPC has done its utmost to maintain the mainland's stability, prevent errors and ups and downs in policymaking, and to gradually improve the operational mechanism of the market economy by deepening economic structural reform to ensure implementation of Deng Xiaoping's line on reform and development and to strive for a relatively long period of sustained and rapid development. It is believed that this policy decision will certainly be accepted by the deputies of the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee. Nevertheless, there are bound to be lively discussions on such issues as reform intensity, development priorities, interest readjustment, anticorruption, and clean government. During the last 10 days of February, Premier Li Peng held a State Council plenary session to solicit opinions on the "Government Work Report." Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council Research Office, took charge of drafting the report. It is believed that after broadly soliciting the opinions of leaders of various party, government, and army departments, democratic parties and organizations, and various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the report will undergo repeated revisions. The gist of the report is the 20-character principle guiding the work for 1994, which was decided by top CPC leaders through repeated discussions, the principle of: "Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, promoting development, and stabilizing the overall situation [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, guoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, wending daju 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 2368 1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 4489 1353 1129 1444]. This principle will be unchangeable. Three Tasks for This Year It has been reported that the CPC authorities have made a plan for this year's economic development: The growth rate of the national economy will be 9 percent; the general level of retail price rises will be kept within 10 percent and the total amounts of currency issued and investment will be kept lower than last year's increased amounts; financial deficits will be minimized; and the previous quantitative type speed will be transformed into a combined speed and efficiency type and the planned economy based on quota management will be transformed into a market economic structure based on supply management. Li Peng holds that the arrangements this year, though aggressive, allow room for maneuver. It is necessary to concentrate our attention on the overall development of the rural economy, efficient operation of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, and the intensification and improvement of macroeconomic regulation and control. To make proper arrangements to implement all the major reformatory measures with the aim of establishing and perfecting the macroeconomic regulation and control system, focus should be placed on the reform of the financial and taxation system and of the banking system; it is necessary to actively, steadily, and appropriately carry out price reform; and it is necessary to establish a modern enterprise system that suits the needs of the developing socialist market economy. All countries believe that China is bound to emerge as a first- rate world power in the next century so long as it can keep the momentum of wholesome development. The American scholar of Chinese descendant and Nobel Prize for Physics winner Chen-ning Young said: If China has the qualified personnel it needs, can maintain discipline, be determined, and has economic support, it will enjoy greater development. For China, the first three conditions mentioned above are available in this century. I am confident that all the four conditions will be available by the 21st century. For this reason I am absolutely optimistic about China's prospects for development of science and technology in the 21st century. Seeking a Balance Between Reform and Stability The CPC higher leadership maintains that the most important task for the forthcoming NPC session is seeking a harmonious relationship between reform, development, and stability. While putting forward a major reform plan, it is necessary to properly solve the problem concerning relations between the central authorities, on the one hand, and localities and various departments, on the other; to avoid widening the gap in income between different localities and strata; to persist in the long-term effort to fight corruption and promote clean and honest government; to cope with local eventualities; and to conscientiously improve public security and social order. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee members Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, and other policy-makers, have reiterated time and again: the workload will be very heavy this year, and there will be quite a lot of difficulties. One must be fully mentally prepared for this. It is necessary for us to work more cautiously and in a down-to-earth manner. We must solve, through reform, new problems arising in our way ahead. Reform is the means, development is our goal, and stability is the basis. We must make every effort to stabilize the market, make things convenient for people in their daily life, and satisfy people's daily needs. Once the supply of daily subsistence to the people is not ensured, the community will become unstable. At the moment, we are facing an excellent situation. But in the meantime, we have seen a lot of "sparks" too. For instance, evacuation of residents from one site to another and the migrant laborer tide, as well as other incidents, may very easily arouse chaos if we fail to pay enough attention to them on the outset. Public Opinion Should Be Prepared To Be Favorable to Reform The CPC held a national meeting on ideological and propaganda work in late January. This was not only the first meeting of this sort ever held over the past 15 years since the reform and opening up process was initiated, but also the most important national conference on ideology held since 1957. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen, who is a member of the CPC Political Bureau and the director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, all delivered important speeches at the meeting. All of them stressed that propaganda should mainly be dedicated to positive aspects, and should serve economic construction, and it is necessary to pay attention to the efforts to guide public opinion and safeguard a political situation characterized by stability and unity. Deng Xiaoping repeatedly reminded his colleagues: "We certainly must attach great importance to work on the ideological front, this must be done conscientiously and in real earnest, and it brooks no slackness." "The work on the ideological front as a whole must be intensified." He demanded that the party's leading organ devote most of the time and resources to ideological and political work, while taking charge of formulation and implementation of principles and policies and employment of important cadres. At present, as China is shifting from the planned economy to the market economy, cadres at different levels have somewhat slackened ideological and political work, and some problems regarding party style and general social mood badly need to be dealt with. Jiang Zemin pointed out: Many party members have failed to keep up with the new situation, meet the requirements of new tasks, and keep abreast of rapidly developing and changing objective reality. Some party members are wavering in their ideals and faith, and swerving from their former world outlook and value concepts, while indulging in money worship, creature comforts, and extreme egoism. Corrupt practices, such as seeking personal interests by abusing official power, graft, and bribery, have been spreading. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and improve education for party members. It is necessary to strengthen education with specific aims in mind, uphold the principle of integration of positive teaching and self-education, uphold the principle of education according to the needs of different types of folks and different strata, and uphold the principle of integration of intensifying education, tightening administration, and strictly enforcing party discipline. The CPC authorities demand that ideological and propaganda work does not create confusion nor cause trouble, but helps promote economic construction and other works by enlisting popular support. A million-strong force composed of theoreticians, journalists, publishers, writers, artists, and grass-roots propagandists will be formed to serve as the propeller for reform and opening up. The rural economy in Shandong province has grown substantially in recent years. The key to the province's success is said to lie in intensification of socialist education in rural areas. This year the province is to start its fourth round of rural socialist education drive. The province has been praised by the CPC higher leadership for efforts in this aspect. This indicates that the CPC is striving very hard to retain the socialist system with a view to securing its ruling party status in the long run and preventing a Soviet-type political avalanche and political evolution. It cannot be denied that this attempt to stabilize the political situation has been quite effective, owing to the success in the economic structural reform and marvelous achievements in economic construction. This year is the crucial year to determine the prospects for reform in China through the turn of the century. Deeply impressed by their past experience in reform, CPC leaders noted that whenever a major reform of a deep-rooted structure is to be launched, some members of the public will always anticipate another round of price hikes, thus starting another round of panic purchasing. In this connection, Zhu Rongji demanded that leading cadres at all levels concentrate their efforts on publicizing and explaining the major reform measures that were to be introduced, properly prepare public opinion for reform, dismiss misgivings among the public, iron out conflicts and resolve problems, enlist the support of the broad masses of people for reform, and encourage them to play a part in reform. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Is a Gordian Knot At present, for the CPC, the Gordian knot of the reform still lies in whether a macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism can be perfected. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "To make the reform a success, we must carry it out in an organized and orderly manner. If we fail to do so, the reform will be plunged into chaos, and everybody will act his own way. This just cannot be tolerated." And, "to achieve macroeconomic regulation and control, the central authorities must do what they have said they would do." "If the CPC central leadership and the State Council have no authority, they will not be able to keep the situation under control." Now that we are introducing the tax division system and reforming the monetary investment structure, the existing interests distribution pattern will no doubt undergo a massive restructuring. In the latter half of last year, the macroeconomic regulation and control operation under Zhu Rongji's leadership curbed some symptoms of overheated economic growth and stopped the trend toward "bubble economy" stemming from the craze in real estate and development zone projects. Since the "pumping-the-brake" and "soft landing" strategies were adopted, drastic economic growth and slumps were avoided and tremendous losses were saved. However, this has not fundamentally changed the existing investment, banking, financial and taxation structures under macroeconomic regulation and control, and the country's capital investment scale remains colossal. It is reported that 15 international airports are going to be built in the Zhu Jiang Delta area alone. These are duplicate construction projects, and running so many projects at the same time is beyond the country's financial capacity. Zhu Rongji said: This year, we still have to continue to intensify and improve macroeconomic regulation and control measures, and then we will develop a regulation and risk-control mechanism for investments in fixed assets. The CPC authorities have decided to assign the newly founded National Development Bank to exercise centralized control over the volume of credit extended to finance capital construction projects and key basic industrial projects. Those projects that have been suspended and put off as ordered last year must not be restarted without approval. This year, in principle, no more applications for starting new projects will be approved. On the other hand, all localities and departments are required to adopt practical and effective measures to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control of investment; they must concentrate their financial and material resources to ensure completion of key projects; they must prevent further expansion of construction scale--any organizations which have started projects without approval, and their people in charge as well, will be held responsible for their acts; no financial institutions are allowed to divert inter-bank loans they have in hand to finance any fixed asset investment projects; it is necessary to strengthen regular administration over the capital market, and no financial institutions are allowed to expand the scale of bond distribution and the scope of joint-stock system pilot projects; investments in real estate construction projects and the financing of such projects must be put under the state plan regarding investment in fixed assets and related financing; it is also necessary to strengthen guidance and regular administration for direct investment projects run by foreign businessmen. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts and that of acting according to one's capacity, set store by efficiency and returns, and always bear in mind the country's overall interests. Of course, it is necessary to make every effort and concentrate all resources available to accomplish those infrastructure projects that have a bearing on the overall interests and are to meet the urgent needs of economic development. It is the CPC higher leadership's belief that only in this way will China be able to seize the opportunity; will it be able to plan, run, and manage infrastructure projects well in a centralized manner, based on a rational distribution; and thus squeeze the greatest returns possible out of the socialist economy. Judging from the present situation, the Pudong development of Shanghai, the economic zones situation on the rim of the Bohai Bay, and the 3-gorges project are eye-catching key projects and hot topics. Under Deng Xiaoping's direct concern and encouragement, Shanghai municipal leadership has proposed speeding reforms and development, has taken the lead in constructing a socialist market economic operating mechanism, and is spearheading reform and opening up in an attempt to turn Shanghai into one of the centers of international economy, finance, and trade. Municipal leaders have also said that they would "train 100 high-ranking party and government leading cadres, 1,000 high-level management talents, and a large number of various experts." The "Treasury Vault" Around Bohai Bay The Bohai Bay Rim region includes the six provinces and cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and Shanxi, all of their economic achievements and growth rates ranking first in the country. The average GDP of this region is well over four times the national average; its average social output value is 4.5 times higher than the national average. Turnover of its major ports account for 38 percent of the national volume; steel output 37 percent; crude oil output 41 percent; and agricultural output 24 percent, while it has only 18 percent of the country's farmland. Experts around the world look at the Bohai Bay rim region as a "treasury vault" with the greatest value for future economic development. The total deposits of iron, petroleum, and natural gas, and three of the 110 kinds of minerals discovered so far, respectively account for 44 percent, 37 percent, or 24 percent of the country's totals; while deposits of gold and diamonds amount respectively to 20 percent and 97 percent of the country's totals. Here there is a first-rate air, sea, and land transport network, and here is the golden zone connecting East and North Asia, not to mention the 4.2 million or so scientists and technologists, who make the region a place with the highest concentration of scientific and technological talents in the country. The Bohai Bay rim zone is estimated to become the "spearhead" for economic development in China's northern region. The 3-gorges hydropower nexus project--reputed to be a first- class world engineering feat--is now in the early-phase work preparatory stage. Development, resettlement, investment, works, and management offices have moved onto the site, and the official inauguration of construction is not far away. Li Peng stressed that it is a world first-class project and must have first-class work quality and modern management. Legislature No Longer a Rubber-stamp As a range of significant reformist programs are going to be unveiled this year, corresponding legislative work has also picked up speed; especially reformist legislation revolving around the construction of a modern corporate system, finance, taxation, banking, foreign trade, and the planned investment system; and establishing a market circulation and social security system--all these will be submitted to the National People's Congress [NPC] and its standing committees for deliberation. This will correct the phenomenon where legislation work falls behind. Why Was the Meeting Advanced There have been reports that the bills the current NPC will deliberate on include "a state budget law," "protection for Taiwan businessmen's investment," and so on. A casual perusal will tell us that the Eighth NPC session had been advanced more than once from the date when it was usually convened in the past--it has been moved from the second to the first half of March. It is understood that the reason behind this was that the NPC session last year did not end until the middle and second half of April, and almost six months had passed before delegates returned to their provinces, cities, and counties. From this we know that the state plan and financial revenue and expenditure budget had been conveyed to all levels when it was being tabled at the NPC. The deliberation and adoption of the budget at the session therefore did give one the feeling of a "rubber stamp." Many NPC delegates shared such a view. And strengthening NPC legislative functions is one of the major agendas in Deng Xiaoping's political reforms. Slowly advancing the NPC session convening date to such a time, when effective supervision can be pursued over the annual economic plan proposed by the State Council--this is aimed at establishing the authority of the country's highest legislature. There have been reports that in the future the convocation of the NPC session may be advanced to as early as early in the year.
