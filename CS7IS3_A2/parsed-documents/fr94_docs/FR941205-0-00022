FR941205-0-00022 FR941205-0-00002 A number of comments stated that refugees have the right to seek protection in the country of choice and that many asylum-seekers choose the United States because the countries through which they travel do not offer adequate protection from discrimination or home-country persecutors. Comments also argued that applicants may be deported to a country in which they had never been present. Furthermore, courts have held that an asylum-seeker may not be deported to a third country where there are no assurances that the asylum seeker would not be indirectly returned to the persecuting country, citing Amanullah v. Cobb, 862 F.2d 362 (1st Cir. 1988), vacated as moot, 872 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1989). Under the proposed rule, an asylee also would be required to obtain travel documents from his or her country of origin, which might endanger the applicant or the applicant's family. Other comments questioned how the United States would ascertain that the asylee would be protected in the ``safe country.'' One comment advocated that a careful and open review be conducted to determine that procedures in the designated first country of asylum are carried out in the same manner and with the same safeguards as asylum determinations made within the United States. In addition, this commenter suggested, there should be verifiable assurances that the denied applicant will be treated by the ``safe country'' in a manner consistent with United States legal obligations. Other comments expressed the opinion that a ``safe country'' may forcibly repatriate an asylee to the country of persecution or that the asylee will be transferred from country to country. Several comments stated that current rules regarding ``firm resettlement'' adequately prevent forum shopping. Other comments recommended modifications to the proposed rule. One comment advocated that additional factors such as the presence of family members in the United States, the applicant's ties (if any) to the receiving country, and whether the applicant has a criminal record, be used to determine whether or not to exercise the discretion to deny. Another comment stated that only immigration judges should be authorized to deny asylum under the proposed rule because only they have the power to order aliens deported. Response and Disposition: These comments have been considered carefully. It must be emphasized that the discretionary authority referred to in this provision is contingent upon bilateral or multilateral agreements with other nations, and that no such agreements now exist. In the absence of such agreements, discretionary authority under this section cannot be exercised. Prior to the implementation of any such agreement by the Department, public notice will be provided. The Department is satisfied that the basic standard set forth in this section is sufficient to protect the rights and interests of persons entitled to protection from persecution in the event that the United States enters such an agreement. In the meantime, most of the concerns presented in the comments relate to how the discretionary authority would be exercised. These concerns and others will be taken into account if and when a bilateral or multilateral agreement on this subject is made. This provision is retained in the final rule with an amendment to clarify that the alien may be returned only to a country through which the alien actually traveled en route to the United States. 16. Issuance of Employment Authorization to Asylees (Section 208.20) Proposed Rule: The proposed rule would have amended section 208.20 to provide that a person granted asylum who desires to work shall receive an employment authorization document (EAD) expeditiously upon application to the INS.
