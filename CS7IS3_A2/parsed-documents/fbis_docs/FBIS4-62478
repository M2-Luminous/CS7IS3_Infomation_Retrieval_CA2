In particular, that coal reserves had reached a critical level because of the financial crisis. At a press conference combine director G. Khandorin did not rule out the possibility that the enterprise could be shut down. Although he naturally expressed the hope that the government would not allow this. Otherwise a social explosion would follow, because one-fifth of the city's inhabitants are directly employed at the combine. Counting their families, the number increases about threefold. The main thing is that over one-half of the local budget comes from payments and taxes received from the combine. The combine's specialists believe that even a brief closure will have unpredictable consequences, and economic computations show that ensuring the safety of a closed combine is in no way cheaper than the cost of operating it. All these arguments were set out in a letter addressed to Head of Government V.S. Chernomyrdin. It was signed by atomic energy first deputy minister Konovalov and oblast administration head Kress. Tomsk inhabitants are requesting financial support. Not the one-shot kind but support in the form of regular credits, and even at the usual rather than a preferential interest rate. Someone might protest here: Russia's entire economy is in crisis and the budget deficit is enormous, yet nuclear power workers are asking for credit, and regular creditat that. But the whole paradox is that the Siberian chemical combine is a profitable enterprise. A fact, strange as it may seem. Even though in the first quarter the combine received 22 billion rubles [R] less than it should have. The "Tomskenergo" joint-stock company failed to pay a debt of around R8 billion. In turn the combine owed R17.4 billion for fuel for the AES [nuclear electric power station) and for coal for the TETS [thermal power station]. Yet the nuclear power workers say confidently that they will settle up with everybody at the end of the year. The letter to the government says unequivocally that all credits will be repaid with guaranteed interest. A profit of R150 billion is even planned by the end of the year. This can be explained very simply: The Siberian chemical combine has reliable partners in distant foreign countries. "The point is that Western partners pay only in two instalments," Yu. Samarin, the combine's deputy economics director, explains. "Once immediately prior to the moment when a contract starts to be implemented, and the second time when the final settlement is made. So it turns out that we have a positive balance for only three to four months a year. But on the whole we are in credit for the year. Even though money to acquire fuel and materials is needed every month." The Siberian chemical combine finds itself in the role of a poor little rich man. This will continue until the nonpayments crisis is eradicated and until a mutual settlement system which operates efficiently has been established. But until these times of plenty arrive the nuclear power workers need regular credits. Chernomyrdin responded to the letter positively. It has been passed to the relevant authorities with an appropriate resolution. There could still be slip-ups at this stage of agreements and settlements. The Finance Ministry is quite capable of making a negative finding. There is no spare money in the budget. Yet this is a special case. Both nuclear safety and the interests of an oblast of a million people must be borne in mind. The main thing is that it is not just another bottomless pit where credits disappear, never to return. As the saying goes, the product is guaranteed.
