The arms that were gathered once in the name of the Afghan jehad by its forces, plus the arsenals that were inherited from the Kabul regime, are now being used for an extensive massacre of rival jehadi groups. Those groups that were not so insistent on wasting their arms so inconsiderately during the 14 years of jehad as they are now are showing surprising generosity and are resorting to missile, artillery, and other deadly attacks against each other. Actually, the canons, mortar, and missiles that they did not use during the 14 years of jehad are now being used without any limit to force the other jehadi forces to kneel. Under such conditions, it is the people in Kabul and in all of Afghanistan who are the main losers in the inauspicious war and in the regrettable confrontation. [passage omitted] The Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed its regrets over the renewed fighting in Kabul and has called on the belligerent sides to end their clashes and to seek peaceful means to solve their problems. The truth is that the jehadi forces have never been able to correctly understand the oppressed Afghan people's wish to begin the era of reconstruction under the banner of Islam and they have never acted appropriately on the heavy responsibility that they shoulder. All this has led to the Afghan people's disillusionment since none of the jehadi forces has been able to fulfill their pure wishes. It was not, and is not, logical for the fruits of 14 years of the Afghan nation's struggles to be considered as "war booty" and for each group to want to gain as much of this booty as possible and to trample on the blood that was shed by 1.5 million martyrs during these struggles. It is bitter but true that some jehadi groups are showing the kind of determination to annihilate their rivals that they did not show during the jehad and are more hasty in taking revenge on their jehadi rivals than they were even at the climax of the jehad. The role played by the time-serving forces and those groups who shift their support to one group or another as conditions call for is perceptible today more than ever before. But the question is: When will Afghanistan be freed from such regrettable clashes? There may not be a clear answer to this question. But everyone knows that the jehadi forces are willing to pay any price to annihilate or to defeat each other. Even if this war of attrition is temporarily stopped, it will still be like ember under ashes for a long time to come, and it is precisely because of this that it is in the interest of Afghanistan and of the oppressed Afghan people that the wise begin to act to bring the views of the jehadi forces closer and not to waste more time in extinguishing a flame that is destroying the entire Afghan nation.
