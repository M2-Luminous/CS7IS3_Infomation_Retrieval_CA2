In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, in this situation, chambers "can set up a conciliatory commission in order to overcome the differences." Deputies have instructed the budget committee to start negotiations with the State Duma regarding forming such a commission and preparing a new version of the two points of the law, which the Federation Council has rejected. This decision was made five minutes before the lunch break in the chamber's day session. Sergey Aleksashenko, deputy finance minister, informed deputies that because there was no federal law on financing in the second quarter, the ministry will stop "as of tomorrow morning all financing operations, starting with the salary of the Russian Federation president." He explained that the Finance Ministry needs a law entitling it to spend money. However, there was no reaction from deputies rushing out for lunch.
