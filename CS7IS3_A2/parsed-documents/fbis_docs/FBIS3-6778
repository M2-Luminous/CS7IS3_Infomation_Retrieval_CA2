Ali Alatas told reporters in Jakarta that there has been no opposition to Indonesia's current candidacy. Thus, Indonesia is not expected to withdraw its candidacy. There has also been no other candidate from the Asian group. He said Indonesia had the intention of becoming a UNSC non- permanent member since assuming the chairmanship of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] in 1992, as a NAM chairman is traditionally an UNSC non-permanent member for a two-year term. Indonesia failed in its bid in 1992 because Oman representing the Arab countries asked Indonesia to withdraw its candidacy. Oman said it had been prepared for the post for a long time. Pakistan, which made its bid for a UNSC non-permanent seat, asked Indonesia to reconsider its candidacy in 1993. Indonesia is now confident that there will be no obstacles in its bid for the 1995-1997 term in 1994.
