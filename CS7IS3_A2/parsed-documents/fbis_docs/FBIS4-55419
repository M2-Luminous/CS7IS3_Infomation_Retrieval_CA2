Reports on the situation on the front are, however, contradictory. According to Radio Velkaton based in Velika Kladusa, the center of the Moslem Autonomous Province of West Bosnia (APZB), APZB supporters have in the past 24 hours captured a very important height near Cazin and have inflicted huge casualties and losses in equipment on the forces loyal to the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. APZB forces have suffered, as the radio said, minimum losses. Radio Velkaton said that troops of the army loyal to the Bosnian Moslem hardline leader, Alija Izetbegovic, are still deserting in large numbers and joining the ranks of the supporters of his moderate rival, Fikret Abdic. According to Radio Cazin, a town under control of Izetbegovic's forces, the forces loyal to Izetbegovic have managed to recapture an important portion of the territories near Cazin in the past 24 hours. Inter-Moslem fighting has been underway in the Cazin Krajina since last October, when Abdic proclaimed the APZB opposing Izetbegovic's belligerent policy. He also immediatelly concluded peace agreements with Bosnian Serbs and Croats.
