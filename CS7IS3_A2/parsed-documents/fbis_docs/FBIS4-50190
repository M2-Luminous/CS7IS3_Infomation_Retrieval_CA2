A total of 50 enterprises which were suffering from a great loss were recently chosen for a trial practice for the restructuring. A two-year period is also set for the handling of property rights for a great number of enterprises. State-owned enterprises in Guangzhou saw each item suffer from a loss of RMB 3 billion. [sentence as received] The number of industrial enterprises which registered a loss within the budget was nearly 36 percent of the total last year which was far beyond the government expectation. The measures for a solution to the loss made by state-owned enterprises will be centred on the transfer of shares of the large enterprises or group and in introduction of foreign capital, technology, the market and management. Enterprises in the red which are situated in prime sections in particular will make way for the development of real estate. Proceeds resulting from the real estate will be used to pay debt owed by those enterprises. The municipal government has asked foreign trade department for helping these enterprises to bring in foreign capital for exploitation of the real estate. Guangzhou will also make great effort in re-organizing the capital pattern of state-owned enterprises for diversification of investment and for popularity of the property rights. Involvement of foreign investment in the shareholding practice, employment of the shareholding system in enterprises and auction carried out for enterprises in serious loss are all aimed at making enterprises meet the market economy while at the same time the unlimited liability for enterprises held by the state had also to be changed. Enterprises were generally shifted into limited liability companies, a move to make enterprises have civil liability for the management of their property. [paragraph as received]
