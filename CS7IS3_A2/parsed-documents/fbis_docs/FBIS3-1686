Morgan & Co. Incorporated, and other council members here this morning. Shultz and other council members, including Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former British Foreign Secretary Geoffery Howe, have been here to attend the 40th session of the Council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28. Noting that many of the council members are familiar with China, Rong urged his guests to offer suggestions on building a socialist market economy in China. Rong said China is carrying reforms on taxation, finance, foreign trade and state-owned enterprises. "This is a year of crucial importance. If we succeed, our people will be guaranteed a relatively comfortable life by the end of the century," he said. China, while deepening its reforms and opening wider to the outside world, is paying equal attention to the maintenance of stability, Rong said. Stability promotes economic development, said Rong, adding that economic growth and the improvement of people's livelihood, in turn, help to maintain a stable political environment. China is constantly improving its economic legislation and investment environment. "We welcome direct foreign investment," he said. Recalling China's fruitful cooperation with the J.P. Morgan Company, Rong voiced the hope that the company would continue to play a role in China's economic development. Shultz said all the members of the Council which is made up of renowned political and business figures from around the world, without exception, are interested in China.
