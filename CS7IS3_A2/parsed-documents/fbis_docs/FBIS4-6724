The prince is quoted as saying "it is not right for Cambodian provincial governors to have to ask Vietnamese permission to transit [SRV] territory...we should be able to travel...on our own territory." He pledged that the government would build a road "as soon as possible"from Memot [Kompong Cham Province] and Snuol [Kratie Province] into Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri Provinces. He said assistance for this would be sought from the United States and "other friendly countries." The article noted that what roads there are in northeastern Cambodia have sustained war damage and are still mined. Ranariddh said that construction of "strategic roads along borders" would facilitate border defense and security. He concluded by saying that "if we cannot build these roads, we cannot resettle people" in the border areas.
