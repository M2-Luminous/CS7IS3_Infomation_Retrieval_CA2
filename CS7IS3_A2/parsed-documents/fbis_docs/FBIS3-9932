They have also disclosed the U.S. Embassy in Honduras released a note on 18 February stating "a delegation consisting of two personnel of the U.S. Senate" are visiting our country to learn about the cases in question. The same media also reported Senator Jesse Helms is sponsoring amendments to the internal legislation of his country "to exclude from foreign aid any state that 1) Has prior to, during, or after the amendment: a) Nationalized or expropriated any property that belongs to a U.S. citizen; b) Relinquished or annulled any contract or agreement with a U.S. citizen; or c) Taken any other action (such as levying discriminatory taxes or others) aimed at seizing or controlling property of a U.S. citizen. 2) Has failed to give adequate and effective compensation for the property within a three-year period. Such a compensation must be effected in convertible currency equivalent to the total value of the property as required by international law." Disregarding the peculiar language of the translation, it seems to us our government must carefully study this type of news, because they do not necessarily agree with that that is stated in our Constitution or with the rules of Public International Law or Private International Law which we have to follow. It is a known fact to everyone that Article 30 of the Constitution states "Foreigners must respect authorities and abide by the law from the moment they enter national territory." Article 33 establishes that "Foreigners cannot lodge a complaint or demand compensation from the state in any other way or case that Hondurans can." It also stipulates foreigners "will not resort to diplomatic channels except when justice is denied (and that) to that effect, the fact a sentence is not favorable to the person filing the complaint will not be seen as a denial of justice. Anyone violating these regulations will no longer be authorized to live in the country." Although it is no secret the United States is a superpower and as of today is the number one nation on earth, this does not mean, if it wants to act according to the law and morals, it should try to become sort of a comptroller supervising the legality of third states. Therefore, to prevent unnecessary frictions and so relations between our country and the United States can develop within the framework of mutual respect, our Foreign Ministry must ensure that all U.S. citizens who come in contact with our country memorize those two articles of our Constitution. The U.S. Embassy, on the other hand, should help in carrying out this task for reasons that obviously need not be mentioned.
