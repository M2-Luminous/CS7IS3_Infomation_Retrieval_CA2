In an editorial today, the paper says that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre revealed the serious dimensions of the Middle East conflict and proved that working for a just and comprehensive peace involving all parties concerned means providing security for all parties. It does not mean securing the existence of one party at the expense of the other. AL-JUMHURIYAH emphasizes that real peace requires ending all racist trends and discrediting all claims about the right to use force to expand into other people's lands and that peace means coexistence and cooperation without discrimination. Since the Palestinian people are disarmed under the occupation, the settlers living on lands they will never be entitled to under any circumstances must be disarmed, the paper stresses. AL-JUMHURIYAH affirms that Egypt will continue to back the Palestinian people with its firm, solid, and effective stances because this is the destiny it accepts willingly.
