The sum is approximately the same as in the current fiscal year. Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov: When this announcement was made, some congressmen asked themselves the question whether the already planned program of cuts in defense spending would be possible. The program provides for reducing defense allocations by $120 billion within the next five years. The congressmen began to analyze President Clinton's words that the United States must not cut defense further. They came to the conclusion that the adopted plan of cuts in defense spending remains in force, and the word further meant there would be no more cuts except those already planned. Senator Sam Nunn reacted positively to the conclusion. The most important thing is that the U.S. military budget is least of all linked with the relations between Moscow and Washington. Russia and the United States, the two great nuclear powers, do not consider each other as an adversary. Cooperation in the military field replaced confrontation. This showed itself in the agreement on the reduction of strategic arms and in the U.S. assistance in dismantling the Soviet nuclear arsenal. The level of mutual understanding is characterized by the recent agreement, under which Russian and American nuclear missiles will not targeted at each other's territory or any other country. So what's the reason for Washington's intention to cut the Pentagon's budget even more than it was previously planned? This is obviously attributed to difficulties of the military conversion process. There have been a number of reports in the American media on behind-the-scenes activities of congressmen from the military industrial regions. New threats is probably another reason: These are regional conflicts. John Murtha, chairman of the House of Representatives Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, believes the United States may face a dangerous conflict on the Korean peninsula, a conflict even more dangerous than Haiti, Bosnia, or Somalia. In the meantime, the Pentagon insists on a strategy calling for a military force ready to fight two major regional conflicts simultaneously. According to the mass media, there is no unanimity in the Congress to give up cuts in defense spending. According to experts and research institutions in the United States, the end of the cold war and military confrontation between Moscow and Washington has created a unique chance to direct material resources to civilian programs, the more so since regional conflicts can hardly be compared with the threat to life on earth. That was a commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov.
