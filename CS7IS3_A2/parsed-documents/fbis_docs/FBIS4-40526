Major General Panteleimon Giorgadze, member of the bureau of the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central Committee, delivered the opening address. He congratulated those participating in the meeting on the unification of socialist-oriented parties and organizations in Georgia and wished them fruitful labor in the struggle for Georgia's happy future. Those participating in the meeting unanimously supported the proposal made by Communist Pilipe Makharadze that the socialist- oriented political parties and organizations in Georgia unite to form one party that would be called "the Georgian United Communist Party." He pointed out: "Our strength and invincibility lies in unification. In order to form the right and effective leadership of the united parties, it is necessary to create a provisional political council in the period prior to the congress; this council will, at the same time, supervise preparations for the party congress." On his proposal, those participating in the meeting -- there were 452 Communists present -- adopted the decision that the current meeting of socialist-oriented parties and organizations should be called the United Congress of Parties Adhering to Socialist Ideas. A decision of the congress participants confirmed KOMUNISTI, the press organ of the Georgian Workers Communist Party, as the Georgian United Communist Party paper. [passage omitted] Following discussion of the question, the congress adopted a resolution and elected the members of the Georgian United Communist Party Political Council.
