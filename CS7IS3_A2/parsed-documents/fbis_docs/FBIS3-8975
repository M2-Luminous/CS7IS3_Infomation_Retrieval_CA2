Do you think that the Fidesz is looking in too many directions simultaneously? [Kover] I do not understand what it means to look in many directions. [Fekete] It is certain that, with the exception of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Fidesz is regarding all the other parties equally.... [Kover] That is true, but this would be an unprincipled thing to do if one could be sure about a new government based on the Liberal Bloc, namely the parliamentary majority of the SZDSZ, the Fidesz, the Agricultural Association, and the Entrepreneurs' Party. Naturally, there are chances of such a coalition, but a professional political party has to prepare for all the political possibilities. [Fekete] Even for a coalition with the MSZP? [Kover] We have not closed down the coalition possibilities, either to the left or to the right. Fidesz Chairman Viktor Orban only said that, personally, everyone has his limits, but life will not stop in any party if a politician is unable to take certain measures without giving up his personal integrity. The same way, we leave the possibility open to the right, therefore in the direction of the coalition parties too. To the best of my knowledge, the SZDSZ says the same thing as we do, they only place emphasis on different things. This is not something unprincipled. We think that a political party that puts itself in the center cannot participate in a game on who cannot cooperate with whom in the future. This competition does not serve the long-term interests of Hungarian democracy. The MDF, the SZDSZ, the MSZP, and the Fidesz should compete on the extent of their flexibility in making sure that a realistic but efficient government program based on compromises will emerge in the next cycle. [passage omitted] [Fekete] Viktor Orban, Janos Ader, and you are first- generation intellectuals. Who are the most certain Fidesz voters today: grandmothers or first-generation intellectuals mainly from the provinces? [Kover] Opinion polls do not make such a strong delimitation; they can only evaluate the educational level and composition of a given group of voters. Therefore, although I am not quite sure, I can imagine that the first-generation intellectuals like ourselves sympathize with us. It is sure that the history of the Fidesz also speaks about their possibilities. However, all the opinion polls agree that, although we have voters in all the age groups, the percentage of potential Fidesz voters among young people is much higher than for other parties and, perhaps, this is only natural. [passage omitted] [Fekete] A thirty-year-old leftist premier drifted Poland into a revolutionary situation in one year. Can you imagine that a considerable part of the adult population in Hungary will entrust Hungary to 30-35-year-olds, despite the leftist restoration condemned everywhere? Particularly in view of the fact that, recently, a journalist with a socialist daily said that they had made the Fidesz a big force, and they would also destroy it.... [Kover] I do not feel that the press might destroy us, but it is obvious that an intellectual civil war is currently being waged in the Hungarian press. Therefore, we reacted seriously to this declaration and we know that this had, and still has, very serious consequences regarding our popularity. However, we think that if politics is not something omnipotent in a democracy, the press is definitely not something omnipotent either. Therefore, the Hungarian press cannot decide the election results in itself; this also requires the achievements of the various parties. [passage omitted]
