Signs of a split in the movement first began to emerge with the sacking of Dr. al- Mohamed Sheriff as ULIMO's representative in the transitional council. This was followed by a claim by Alhaji Koromah that the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] of Charles Taylor were attacking ULIMO in Lofa and Bong counties but this claim was promptly denied by ULIMO's very own military head, Roosevelt Johnson. And now more evidence of a widening gap between the two men and their supporters have come to light. From Monrovia, Nienate Allison telexed this report. The rift in Alhaji Koromah's ULIMO is deepening. There was a shoot-out last night between Koromah loyalists and forces in favor of Roosevelt Johnson. The shooting, lasting for several hours, occured near the Po River bridge just outside Monrovia and sources said the situation remains confused today. Travelers who arrived here today from ULIMO headquarters in Tubmanburg said tension started building up when ULIMO leader, Alhaji Koromah, ordered the disarmament of elements of the Krahn ethnic group -- the second largest fighting force in ULIMO. They said Koromah loyalists had disarmed all Krahn elements in areas covering Kre and southwards toward the Po River bridge where they met some resistance and decided to return to Tubmanburg. However, they returned later in the day with reinforcement and succeeded in disarming Roosevelt Johnson loyalists. Thereafter, Roosevelt Johnson ordered troops from his base in Kakata, 35 miles north of Monrovia, into the Po River area to tighten security. Sources said that shooting broke out finally between the two sides and lasted into the early morning hours. On Thursday, the cracks in ULIMO were highlighted. In an interview on Focus on Africa, Koromah alleged that forces of Charles Taylor's NPFL were attacking ULIMO forces in Salayie. Roosevelt Johnson, chairman of ULIMO's military wing, denied Koromah's claim and yesterday accused him of attempting to derail the peace process. Meanwhile in another development, ULIMO today named (Dex Tayowo) as its representative on the five-man transitional state council. Tayowo, a Krahn, was an immigrant captain and until his appointment served as ULIMO press coordinator. He replaces Thomas Ziah, also a Krahn, who was sacked from the council on Thursday.
