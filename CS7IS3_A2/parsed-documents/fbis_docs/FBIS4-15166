This is absolutely adequate to form the leading organs of representative power. The voters supported the leaders and activists of the "Against Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption" bloc of the peoples' patriotic forces, which included representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia and the Agrarian Union, the Union of Commodity Producers, the "For Social Justice" electoral association, the trade union of the agro-industrial complex, the "Officers Union," and other organizations. They also refused to vote confidence in representatives of "Russia's Choice," "Democratic Russia," and the social democrats. The "democrats" conducted themselves in a very nervy manner right through the campaign, and their unofficial supervisor V. Shapovalenko, who holds the post of presidential representative, attacked the left-wing forces' candidates in radio and television broadcasts and violated the statute on the elections, which forbids officials of state organs of power to campaign. On election day, Shapovalenko conducted himself in a very tempestuous manner at the polling stations, striking fear in the hearts of commission members and verbally abusing communist candidates. The oblast electoral commission was forced to send the president an official statement about his improper behavior. He is now interpreting the election results loosely and is dissatisfied because practical men representing the working people's interests have been elected to the oblast legislative assembly. The compromising materials which the presidential representative prepared against candidates who were not to his liking and with which he hit television viewers a day before the elections, also failed to work. It is no accident that many Orenburg residents doubt whether the position of presidential representative is necessary.
