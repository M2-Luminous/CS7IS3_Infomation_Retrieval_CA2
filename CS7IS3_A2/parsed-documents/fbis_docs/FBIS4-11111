Ruben Blades visited various towns in Veraguas Province, where he met with supporters, discussed their problems, and offered solutions.

Meanwhile, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for the PRD and the United People alliance, said he was "looking to the future and not to the past." Perez Balladares toured various towns in Chiriqui Province and met fellow party members and supporters, to whom he stressed that people in rural areas have been forgotten by the current administration. Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate for the Solidarity Party and the Alliance for National Consensus, visited Los Santos Province, where he called for the unity among all Panamanians. Lewis Galindo urged the Panamanian people to avoid all forms of social confrontation. Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the Change '94 ticket, visited Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqui Province, where he "promised to respect the rights of the Indians and workers." Carles charged that the PRD has tried to eliminate the workers' 13th month bonus, and he added that the PRD leadership should be imprisoned on various charges of corruption. The PA presidential ticket toured Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro Provinces, where thousands of supporters greeted Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. She reiterated the PA will defeat the PRD on 8 May. When PRD candidate Perez Balladares was asked about other groups forming an alliance against him, he answered: "They are trying to repeat what happened in 1989, as if they were trying to work against Noriega. I reiterate that we will not return to the past. We will not return to militarism."
