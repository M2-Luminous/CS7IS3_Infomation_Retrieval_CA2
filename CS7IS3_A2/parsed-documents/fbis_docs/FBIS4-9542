"Our view is that the refugee population of Gorazde should be allowed to return to their villages" in the pocket, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman in Sarajevo, Peter Kessler. "For the moment there has been no official suggestion of a forced displacement of population," he said. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the idea of a movement of population was an "unfounded rumour." Earlier several humanitarian sources said a movement of up to 20,000 refugees in the Gorazde pocket was being discussed. "We know that discussions are under way to open up a passage through Serb-controlled territory for refugees from Gorazde," one said on condition of anonymity. "They are talking about up to 20,000 people, crossing the mountains on foot, within the next two weeks," the source said. UN officials say two-thirds of the Gorazde enclave's territory is occupied by Bosnian Serb troops who have imposed a stranglehold after a fierce offensive that began in late March. The town of Gorazde itself swelled with Moslem refugees. Serb forces pulled heavy weapons outside an exclusion zone Wednesday under threat of NATO air strikes, and the fighting has largely subsided. But Kessler said the enclave's civilian population was going to need "a permanent life support system" as the Serbs appear bent on making the region unlivable for the Moslems. He said one example of this was the Serbs' destruction of Gorazde's water processing plant as they pulled out of the town over the weekend. Humanitarian sources said that Serb psychological pressure on the Moslem population was such that many would accept an opportunity to leave. A similar idea was floated last April at Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia after Serb forces succeeded in eliminating the enclave's defences, but local authorities opposed the move, saying it would aid the Serb campaign of "ethnic cleansing." The Bosnian government has consistently opposed forced movements of population.
