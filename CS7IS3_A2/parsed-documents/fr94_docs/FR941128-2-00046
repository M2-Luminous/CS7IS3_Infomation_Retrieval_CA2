FR941128-2-00046 FR941128-2-00036 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5113&hyph;3] Acid Rain Program; Notice of Final Permits AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of permits. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving 5-year sulfur dioxide compliance plans, according to the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72), for the following 15 utility plants: Collins, Crawford, Fisk, Joliet 9, Joliet 29, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County in Illinois; Petersburg and State Line in Indiana; Allen S King, Black Dog in Minnesota, High Bridge, Riverside, and Sherburne County in Minnesota; and Poston in Ohio. These final permits were initially issued as direct final actions and were subsequently withdrawn and re-proposed as draft permits because of the submission of significant, adverse comments objecting to the issuance of the direct final permits. EPA's responses to the original objections and to all comments submitted during the comment periods for these permits can be found in the public dockets for each permit. Contact the Regional staff listed below for more information. The final permits set forth in this notice are based on and are consistent with the Partial Settlement Agreement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner , No. 93&hyph;1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993), which the Administrator determined to be a reasonable resolution of certain litigation issues concerning the Acid Rain regulations and which was signed on behalf of the Administrator on May 4, 1994. Further, the final permit for Petersburg is also consistent with provisions in ยง72.42 of the Acid Rain regulations that have been challenged in a petition for review. Pursuant to the delegation of authority from the Administrator, it has been found, under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, that each of these permits is based on a determination of nationwide scope and effect. Consequently, under section 307(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of final agency action in these proceedings must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days after the date that a notice of the final agency action is published in the Federal Register . Filing a petition for reconsideration of the Administrator of the final agency action does not affect the finality of the action for the purposes of judicial review, extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, or postpone the effectiveness of the action. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the final agency action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
