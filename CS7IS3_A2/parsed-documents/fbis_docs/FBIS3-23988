Communications workers had carried out their threat and stopped transmission of television and radio broadcasts, demanding that state companies and the government pay their debt of 80 billion. The same day, Viktor Chernomyrdin firmly promised to pay the debts by the end of the first quarter and pleaded with the communications industry to resume transmission. The threat to be left without the favorite "boob tube" has receded. For how long? How is state television to live and survive in this extremely hard economic situation? [Lazutkin] We have always thought that we had not yet hit the bottom. Today it is clear--this is the bottom. What can we count on? Only on radical political solutions. At this point the most unpopular and painful method was used--they took the money from some other sphere, where the house is not yet on fire, and gave it to television. Naturally, this is not going to solve the problem. Of course, we now need to do full accounting, go through the entire chain of calculations. Optimists believe that restructuring of the economic mechanism of the federal television system may produce savings measured by a two-digit factor. This is a lot--two zeros are erased, by the way. But expert modern economic analysis will take time. Not too many people know that the entire system of signal distribution rests on 8,500 retransmission stations. Can we dispense with ground stations and shift to satellite transmissions? Yes, but not before the year 2000. There is also a problem with satellites. Those that serve the Far East sometime by the spring will reach the end of their useful life and quietly die. In the past, there was a rule: One satellite is working; another is hanging nearby, just in case; and the third is on the ground, ready for launch. Alas, this situation no longer exists. Satellites are approaching the end of their utility, and there is no replacement for them on the ground. This is about television, but there also is radio. During COMECON times, radio stations were equipped with Hungarian equipment. Now all ties have been disrupted. There are no spare parts. So radio stations will also begin to crumble soon. Television centers are junkyards. Old equipment that keeps breaking down. In short, an enormous complex of problems. Today we felt it especially acutely, because everything went out at once. I can tell you one thing: This year is a year of survival for state television. [Petrovskaya] But how can it survive when this and that is not available, and the state is unable to provide a dignified existence for television? By the way, Chernomyrdin, too, when he spoke on television, suggested that state companies should start thinking what should be converted to joint-stock holding, and what should be privatized. There are rumors that Ostankino will soon be converted to joint-stock holding with the participation of large industrial and banking capital. [Lazutkin] It is impossible to build the country without a federal television and radio. This is the last thing that links together the cultural and information space of Russia. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve federal broadcasting--naturally, in an economical, sensible, aware mode. As to conversion to joint-stock holding--even if it applied to Ostankino--I have no social allergy to it. Nevertheless, today the only part that can be converted to joint-stock holding is the top of the television iceberg--everything that is related to production of programs. In this area, one can even earn a profit. But as soon as you calculate the cost of one hour of broadcasting, including communications services, you will realize that nobody in the nonstate sphere of the economy has this kind of money. Ostankino broadcasts 19 hours a day; its budget for this year is 1.267 trillion rubles. Of this, 88 percent goes to pay for communications services. This amount can be compared only with the national budget. I personally doubt very much that stockholders will undertake the financing of the real economic structure of television. It is unprofitable to convert a money-losing enterprise to joint-stock holding. Or are there illusions that it can be made profitable? We can and need to put some other, healthy economic foundation under television. I do not consider it a humiliation to search for a possible model together with specialists who have already come into their own in this country. Banks, large concerns, financial-industrial groups. To make a joint effort to give the country real, full-fledged, healthy television is our common civic task. Real joint actions are possible--but, of course, with the participation of the government. Because, I repeat, I do not see this kind of untied money in the society that can be thrown into the television furnace. [Petrovskaya] But Gusinskiy and the Most Group did find and did throw the money into the "television furnace." And, I think, they hit the jackpot. [Lazutkin] First, do not forget that this channel from the beginning was set up as commercial, free of any formal obligations. A charter of any commercial organization--both in our country and in the West--says: This is an enterprise set up for the purpose of making a profit. Programming is a vehicle for advertising, a machine for extracting advertising money from the airwaves. Therefore, I do not at all preclude the possibility that economic analysis--which undoubtedly preceded the channel's creation--showed that it could be made into a profitable enterprise. Second, Channel 4 is incommensurately cheaper; you cannot compare it with Ostankino, because it has a much smaller coverage area. But the most important part still is that the channel is separated from the state. Both Ostankino and VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and Radio Company] should probably remain state television--it has developed historically this way. Generally, however, I do not like the word "state." I prefer the model of "public television." [Petrovskaya] "Public" is social-legal television, which assumes, on the one hand, the existence of a law on television, and on the other--society's ability to influence television through taxes and subscriber fees. We do not have either. [Lazutkin] But we should arrive at this point. Why not? Our current status is transitional. We have to survive, to keep the "furnace" warm. Do note that we are not touching upon the image of television--whether we make good or bad television. Naturally, all our ambitions, complaints, appeals to the government, and to the president on behalf of the audience are justified only if we make decent television. The revival should take place not only in the economic and technological sphere, but also the creative one as well. But it is not smart and unnecessary to develop both the VGTRK and Ostankino in the same mode as NTV [Independent Television]. [Petrovskaya] We lost the right to speak of Ostankino as public or state television quite a while ago, because it is to a much greater extent than NTV a machine for extracting advertising money from the airwaves. [Lazutkin] If we judge by formal attributes, simply by the number of commercials on this channel, we have long been, of course, in the category of commercial stations. We do not collect the kind of money, however, that makes commercial companies profitable. For a variety of reasons. Some money settles in middlemen's pockets. Westerners coming to visit us say that there are now quite a few traveling salesmen who sell our advertising time in the West. We lose tremendous amounts of money on it. And the advertising rates we charge are, of course, far below those of a commercial station. At Western stations, advertising costs tens of millions, and ours so far goes for thousands of dollars. Unquestionably, we need to change the very approach to advertising activities, create large and strong advertising agencies around Ostankino. We are working on such plans at Ostankino now. What else describes the transitional character of today's Ostankino? All organization of production is obsolete. Huge staff. If one beautiful day everybody reports to work, Ostankino may even collapse. We cannot live this way, as the classic said. We need to switch to producer-based organization, as in the West. [Petrovskaya] If I understand it correctly, whether state television is to be or not to be, and what kind it will be, will be decided first and foremost by your federal service? [Lazutkin] The point is that the FSR has not been set up yet, only announced as a legal entity. Creating it will take time. We have already written a sixth draft of the service's statute and will still add to it, modify it, because the situation changes and we cannot foresee everything. Of course, we will propose some radical solutions, but the main point of our philosophy is that the state cannot lose television. There is an immense national broadcasting network; it has to be developed, and opportunities created for new broadcasters to get on the air. Another side of the service's activities is support of entrepreneurship in the area of television, and control over rational use of budget money--less ostentatious. But the service's main task is to protect the interests of the audience. The statute we are developing now will not have a single hint at some powers related to the practice of interference in the companies' programming activities. But the service will have the right to monitor the integrity of broadcasting, that the broadcaster's intents and obligations correspond to his practice. The state has an obligation to protect the moral health of the nation through its institutions. * * * I left Valentin Lazutkin's office without being any closer to an answer to the main question: How to save and preserve state television, which is on the brink of ruin? I agree that it is necessary to preserve state television--not because of its special mission, but simply because the more different kinds of television we have, the better; but I still never got an answer to the questions: --Why it is so necessary to "disengage" commercial television from the state? --Why is it not possible to predicate issuance of broadcasting licenses on certain requirements to the programs (the same "moral integrity," concern for expanding the audience's outlook, carrying out informational, consolidating, social-educational functions)? --Finally, why not study recommendations developed in this respect in European countries, where commercial television is certainly not just "an instrument for earning a profit"--the evidence of which, among other things, is ITN News broadcast on Channel "2x2"?
