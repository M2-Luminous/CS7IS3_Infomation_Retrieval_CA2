At about 1000 yesterday, the owners of all 68 shops on Gongbei's Buxing Street closed their shops and went on strike to show their resentment against the industry and commerce department's decision to raise shop rents. This attracted the great attention of the concerned departments in Zhuhai City. Early this morning, the leaders of the City Bureau of Industry and Commerce went to the Gongbei subbureau to hold a meeting to find a solution to the issue. They also held separate meetings of the directors of the self- employed laborers association, some shop owners, advanced backbone self-employed traders, and family dependents, to listen to their views and to discuss how to settle the matter. At 1100, this reporter found that all 68 shops in the Gongbei Market had closed their doors and stopped doing business. An official in charge of the Gongbei Industry and Commerce Subbureau told this reporter that, at about 0800, six shops opened their doors to do business, but closed them again not long after. At 1200, the industry and commerce department put up a placard in Buxing Street that read: "Business Suspended for Consolidation." At noon, the industry and commerce department decided to postpone the rent readjustment and hoped the owners of the shops would first resume business and then negotiate for a solution later. At about 1400, all 68 shops resumed business. The striking shop owners said that the shop rents were also readjusted in the past, but the readjustments were all within the range of 10 to 20 yuan, and that they went on strike because this time the readjustments were greater than they could afford.
