Many still say "Europe" when they mean West Europe. But Europe does not stop at the Oder-Neisse. Who can fail to recognise that Warsaw or Riga, Budapest, Prague or Ljubljana are European cities? The task of the Nineties, for Britain and Germany, is to make a political reality of that cultural reality. Had the Iron Curtain not divided Europe after 1945, none of the founders of European integration would have ever thought of excluding countries such as Czechoslovakia or Poland. We must project security and stability from our part of Europe to other European countries in the East. Eventually, they should participate fully in all European institutions -- in particular the European Union [EU] and NATO. At its last summit in January 1994, NATO declared that it was open to new members. The European Community summit in Copenhagen confirmed the prospect of membership for those countries which have concluded Europe Agreements. There are three fundamental reasons why we should consider enlarging the EU and NATO: security, prosperity and shared values. We shall not be secure if uncertainty and anxiety reign just beyond our borders. Stability in central Europe enhances our own stability. The basis of our prosperity is the open world trading system. We have now, on our doorstep, dynamic economies with highly skilled labour, rich in ideas and full of entrepreneurial vigour. The fastest growing stock market in the world last year was not in Shanghai or Canton: it was in Warsaw. We and our trading partners to the East are already benefiting from this. EC exports to central Europe increased by 87 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and now stand at around US$11 billion. The central Europeans themselves sell half of their exports in the EC. The Europe Agreements stipulate free trade by the end of 1995 -- with a few exceptions such as agriculture. But more remains to be done. Too often the EC reserves its greatest trade restrictions for precisely those goods that the central Europeans produce most efficiently. We have to face new competition. Closer ties with the economies in central Europe will mean more structural adjustment for us. But those structural changes will open the way for enormous overall increases in wealth -- for us and for our partners. Last, but not least, culture. Our Eastern neighbours belong to Europe, not just as a matter of geography or economics; there is a common culture. We have to increase the exchange of ideas -- particularly in the humanities and the social sciences. A sober assessment of our interests shows that they all point in the direction of enlarging the EU and NATO. That cannot happen overnight. Guarantees that exist only on paper do not contribute to security. Security guarantees must grow out of a sense of shared values, common interests and a common destiny. Enlarging NATO is a decision for the Alliance as a whole-not just for Britain and Germany. All its members, above all the United States which continues to do so much to maintain European security, must give their wholehearted consent. The Western EU is developing its role as the European pillar of NATO and as the defence component of the EU. Britain and Germany are working together with others to involve the central Europeans and the Baltic states in the work of the WEU [Western European Union]. New members must be capable of implementing EU law. That presupposes a competent administration and a proper system of justice. They must be capable of competing in the Single Market. On our side, too, there will have to be changes. EU institutions and EU policies will have to adapt to a wider community -- a community of 20 or more members. We must ensure that at every stage a wider community becomes a stronger one. Both for the EU and NATO, widening must not mean weakening. Those are goals for the medium-term. In 1994, we must open ourselves to our neighbours in as many ways as possible. The forthcoming German EU presidency will spare no efforts to draw our Eastern neighbours closer. But in all this, the transatlantic relationship remains a fixed anchor point for the EU. Without a continuing stake by the United States in European affairs, enlargement of the EU and NATO cannot succeed. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe also has a vital role. It is the only institution embracing all 53 European and North American states. Through the CSCE we can assure that developments in West and Central Europe are not misinterpreted by our Eastern partners. To enlarge the Alliance in a way that made those inside it more secure but left those outside feeling threatened would be no service to Europe. That means that other countries must be convinced that this is a development in which they are not ignored. No country is an island, whatever its geography. We have a duty to our European neighbours. They had to live under imposed isolation from West Europe. They are now returning to freedom and to the rule of the law. This is a historic task. Britain and Germany have committed themselves to this goal for the rest of the century.
