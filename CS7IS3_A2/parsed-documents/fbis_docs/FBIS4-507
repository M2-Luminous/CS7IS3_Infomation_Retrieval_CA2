Units of the force arrived in the Witwatersrand over the weekend and will be deployed in Thokoza and Katlehong, among others. [Begin SABC reporter Andries van Zyl recording] At De Brug outside Bloemfontein, where the major part of the peacekeeping force is being trained, Television News was refused admission. We were told that instructions have been received that no news teams are to be allowed in as the force is going through final preparations before deployment. The seven companies of about 1,800 men who have passed the training evaluation will be the first to be deployed. The pilot group was deployed in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] last week, but today there was some uncertainty as to whether all the seven companies will be sent there. Latest information is that the main force will leave De Brug by Wednesday and be deployed on Thursday. The five companies who have failed the evaluation are in the meantime being retrained. According to initial planning they will begin their duties next week.
