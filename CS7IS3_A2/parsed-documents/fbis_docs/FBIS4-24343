For several weeks now, UNITA has been putting increasing pressure on towns, such as Malanje and Kuito. Aid flights have been badly interrupted and civilians have suffered badly in the sieges. But now the government claims there has been a turnaround and that the UNITA tide is being pushed back. It says all the UNITA forces in Kuito have been driven out of the city. Robin White asked our Luanda correspondent, Chris Simpson, if he could confirm that. [Simpson] It seems to be born out by independent sources as well. The government have been gaining the upper hand. We understand they now control the road between Kuito and Kunje, four miles to the north. So, that is quite an important territorial victory, if that is proven to be correct. [White] How much of Kuito is left standing? [Simpson] It is difficult to know but I think it is very clear from those people who were based there previously that the last round of fighting has been particularly intense. When I was last in Kuito in February, it was a very battered city. Virtually every building was covered in bullet holes and one fears that the intensity of the recent fighting would have reduced it even more [words indistinct]. What people used to say when you talk to them there was how they thought it should be turned into a war museum. It wasn't a proper place to live at all, and I am sure they will feel that now as well. [White] How important is Kuito? [Simpson] Well, it is very much seen by UNITA as part of its heartland. What they always tell you is that Jonas Savimbi went to school there. They won an overwhelming victory in the elections there in 1992. It is very much part of their constituency, their heartland. What may alarm UNITA is that if the government recaptures or gains complete control of the airport that could have serious implications that the government could use the airport to strike out at UNITA positions around. I mean, UNITA still controls a vast wave of territory around Kuito, pretty much the whole of the Province of Bie. [White] You think UNITA can get back [word indistinct]? [Simpson] Well, in this war, there are very few clear-cut victories and the government may be sounding rather bullish at the moment talking about an important victory, but it is very much a [words indistinct] changes around quite rapidly. I am sure UNITA is capable of striking at government positions elsewhere in the country. They have certainly been putting a lot of pressure on N'Dalatando [words indistinct] and I certainly think it is certainly premature to talk about the government having firm control of Kuito for a foreseeable future even.
