During the visit he was to meet the Russian president and possibly sign the agreements initialled by Latvia and Russia. Ulmanis explained that the reason for this decision was the edict by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the creation of military bases in the CIS states and Latvia. Moreover, immediately after receiving the report, Ulmanis had proposed a talk with the Russian president. Yet he has still not received a reply. Ulmanis also has been trying unsuccessfully for two days to talk to Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of Forces. Ulmanis has the impression that Mayorov is deliberately avoiding talking. Ulmanis does not rule out the possibility that Yeltsin's decree might have come about in connection with a power struggle in Russia and disagreements between the Foreign Ministry and military corps in Russia. Ulmanis is also planning to present a proposal to the presidium of the Saeima on Saturday to cancel the extraordinary plenary session on 15 April, in the belief that at present there is no sense in discussing powers to sign the initialled agreements because in such a situation as this the signing of the agreements is not possible.
