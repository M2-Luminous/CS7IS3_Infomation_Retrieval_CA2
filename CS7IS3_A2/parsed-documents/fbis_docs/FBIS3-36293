The law envisages in particular the division of power into bodies of local self-government and bodies of state power. The chairmen of oblast, rayon, town, settlement and village councils are directly elected by the populace, and in accordance with their post they head the executive committees of the relevant councils and have dual subordination. The chairmen of councils and the executive bodies they head are accountable to and under the control of the relevant councils, but on issues of carrying out the authorities of state executive power delegated to them they are subordinate to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The last article of the law envisages that after elections of deputies and chairmen of councils and the formation of executive bodies, the law of Ukraine "On the Representative of the President of Ukraine" will become invalid. A separate resolution envisages that elections of deputies to village and oblast councils and their chairmen will be conducted at the same time as the election of the president of Ukraine on 26 June 1994. According to Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, the issue of amendments and additions to the law on elections of people's deputies of Ukraine was put to the vote for the seventh time on 3 February. But this time the voting did not yield positive results. [passage omitted]
