The decision was made following STRI's success in developing an experimental high-temperature superconducting IC. They plan to start this project in fiscal 1995. Technology for very high-speed optical communications, the area in which Japan lags behind the United States, is the key to realizing a multimedia society. MITI hopes to catch up with the United States in this area through the development of superconducting ICs. Technology for terabit communications enables one fiber optical cable to have a capacity equal to that of more than 15 million telephone lines, or to that of 30,000 wires for high-definition television images. It is expected that if terabit communications eventuate, the cost of communications will drop to almost zero and multimedia businesses such as interactive visual and data communications will bloom. Lasers for optical communications have a high frequency of more than 200 terahertz. This makes it theoretically possible to transmit 1 terabit of data through fiber optics, but in actuality the amount of data that can be transmitted through optical communications is limited to about 1 gigabit. Similarly, the amount of data that can be transmitted through the information superhighway which the U.S. Government is trying to develop is no more than 10 gigabits. The higher the transmission speed, the greater the electrical resistance inside receiver semiconductors. This makes it difficult to receive the data transmitted and is the reason for the limited amount of transmission data. STRI turned its attention to a superconducting element whose electrical resistance was almost zero, and succeeded last autumn in developing an experimental superconducting IC made of high-temperature superconducting material. The development of such an IC was the first in the world. This experimental IC has a simple structure. It is made of a superconducting antenna and six Josephson junction devices. The STRI has confirmed that the IC is capable of receiving a 23-gigahertz high frequency electric wave. STRI Director Shoji Tanaka said if the integration of the IC is raised, it would become possible to transmit and receive 100 gigabits or 1 terabit of data.
