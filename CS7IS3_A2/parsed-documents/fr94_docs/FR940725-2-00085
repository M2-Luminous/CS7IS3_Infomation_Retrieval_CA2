FR940725-2-00085 FR940725-2-00053 At the hearing, Respondent presented the testimony of witnesses as to his exemplary abilities as a physician and his favorable reputation in the community. Several witnesses, and numerous written statements filed on Respondent's behalf, also spoke of his successful efforts towards rehabilitation. Included among this evidence was a letter dated September 25, 1992, from the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Florida and counsel to the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine (Board), advising that Respondent had complied with the terms of his probation and the Board did not oppose his application for DEA registration. The Respondent testified regarding his accomplishments while incarcerated, including: his organizing of smoking cessation clinics for inmates; his conducting counseling and lecture sessions on health related issues for inmates, as well as, a continuing education program for incarcerated health professionals; and his becoming versed in Spanish for the purpose of becoming a medical missionary in Spanish-speaking areas. The Respondent further testified that in May 1989, he was released to a halfway house where he wrote a column on travel medicine for a hunting and fishing magazine. On October 20, 1992, the director of the halfway house wrote to DEA recommending that Respondent be granted DEA registration in light of his satisfactory rehabilitation. Respondent also presented the testimony of an attorney specializing in post-conviction issues, who testified that he represented the Respondent at the sentencing phase of the criminal proceeding, as well as, before the Parole Commission, and that Respondent was granted parole after serving forty months of his eight-year sentence. The witness testified that the silencer conviction resulted in imposition of a special parole term, but that he successfully sought early termination of Respondent's special parole term in light of Respondent's exemplary conduct while incarcerated. The witness further testified that the institution recommended early termination of Respondent's special parole and that the reduction of four years in a five year term was highly unusual. Prior to, and after moving to the State of Florida in the fall of 1990, Respondent took continuing education courses, including a course in prescribing controlled substances, and on March 26 and 27, 1991, Respondent took the State's examination to practice medicine and passed. On June 22, 1991, the Board approved the Respondent for licensure subject to a two-year probation, with terms including: that if and when Respondent obtained a DEA registration, he write Schedule II controlled substances prescriptions in triplicate; that he practice only under the indirect supervision of another physician; and that the monitoring physician file semi-annual reports with the Board regarding the level of care provided by the Respondent. In late 1991, Respondent was hired as the only full-time medical professional at a clinic in Cutler Ridge, a low income area of South Miami. The president and chief executive officer of the clinic testified at the hearing that Respondent told him about his history and lack of DEA registration, and that Respondent was very professional in treating mostly welfare patients.
