Shieh made the remark prior to his departure for Managua, Nicaragua with President Li Teng-hui, who embarked on a 13-day official visit to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland Wednesday morning. To help promote Taiwan's efforts to become an IDB member, Shieh said, the Ministry of Finance has earmarked NT [new Taiwan] $135 million (US$5.09 million) in its 1995 fiscal year budget as a trust fund for the Inter-American Bank. In addition, he pointed out, the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] has decided to join with the IDB to extend a soft loan of US$50 million to Nicaragua, of which the Export- Import Bank will provide US$30 million. Founded in 1959, the IDB boasts 19 members and is the world's largest regional development bank. The bank, with its headquarters in Washington, D.C., offers medium and long-term loans to Latin American countries to help boost their economic development.
