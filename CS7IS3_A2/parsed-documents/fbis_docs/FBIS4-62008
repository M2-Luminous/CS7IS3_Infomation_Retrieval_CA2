The statement says that in the current situation of fragile stability in the state of Lithuania, the idea of early Seimas elections proposed by the Tautininkai Union and the Democratic Party has in essence been dictated by petty party interests and not by the interests of the state and the nation. The most important thing now is stability in the state, the prime minister maintains. According to him, signs of economic and political stability can now be clearly seen in Lithuania, and this is testified by the significantly reduced inflation, stable national currency, and the formation of governmental structures. Adolfas Slezevicius says that western confidence in Lithuania is growing and that investments are growing, too. This is the prospect for improving the currently hard life, the leader of the ruling party said. According to the statement, early Seimas elections would be bring about yet more political and spiritual confusion, unnecessary budget expenditure, and would waste people's efforts.
