In his reply, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that this issue has not been officially raised with Bulgaria. He said that all our neighbors have been repeatedly informed of the Bulgarian position regarding the conflict in former Yugoslavia. He recalled some of the elements of this position: nonparticipation in the conflict, whether directly or indirectly, including under the aegis of the United Nations, and appeals made to neighboring Balkan states to refrain from participation in the conflict. He said that a nationwide consensus exists in Bulgaria on this issue, which is shared by the political forces, the president, parliament, and the government, and no grounds exist for altering this position.
