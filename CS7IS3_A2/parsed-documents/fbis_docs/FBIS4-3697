The communique, issued by the Chinese side at the end of premier Li Peng's four-day official visit to Kyrgyzstan, says that the two sides will continue to negotiate an early agreement on the unsettled border issue. Pending a resolution of the issue, both have agreed to take steps to maintain the status quo of the border, so as to guarantee peace and stability in the border areas, the communique says. Leaders of the two countries positively assessed the border talks between the Chinese delegation and the joint delegation of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan as well as talks on measures of mutual troop reduction in their border areas and confidence-building in the military field, according to the communique. Meanwhile, the two sides are willing to expand the scope of bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, trade, cultural and other fields, it says. They have agreed to further develop their trade and economic cooperation, including direct links at regional, provincial, city and border area levels, the document adds. They will work for better conditions, including improved legal basis and economic infrastructure, for diversified forms of this cooperation, according to the communique. Both sides have also expressed their willingness to strengthen cooperation in the building of a modern "silk road," holding that such collaboration would help expand the central Asian nations' economic and cultural exchanges with the East as well as with the West, the communique says. During the visit, Premier Li had in-depth exchanges of views with Kyrgyz President A. Akayev, Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov and Parliament leader Medetkan Sherimkulov [spelling of name as received] on ways of furthering bilateral relations and on regional and international issues of common concern. The two sides have reiterated that they will strictly abide by the five principles of peaceful co-existence and maintain a long- term stable and friendly relationship of mutually-beneficial cooperation, which they said is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and will be conducive to peace, stability and development in Asia, the document says. It says that the two sides believe that the situation in Asia- Pacific region is moving towards relaxation of tension and stability in general, and the maintaining of peace and stability in Asia conforms with the common interests of all countries in the region. Both are willing to work for the safeguarding of peace and security in Asia in the light of its conditions and characteristics. Furthermore, the two sides adopt a positive attitude towards multilateral economic cooperation in Asia, the document says.
