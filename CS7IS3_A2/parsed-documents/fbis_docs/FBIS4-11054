All other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. The results are based on a random telephone survey of 1,200 people in the five largest cities who said they intended to vote. Respondents were equally divided between men and women. A 3 percent margin of error was reported. (EL ESPECTADOR, 29 Mar) When viewed according to city, results were as follows: in Bogota the two candidates were in a virtual tie, with Samper at 42 percent and Pastrana at 41; in Medellin, the two were tied at 44 percent; while in Cali, Samper had a substantial lead of 54 to 27 percent, in Barranquilla he led 44 to 29 percent, and in Bucaramanga, he had only a marginal advantage, 44 to 41 percent. Samper led Pastrana among male respondents obtaining 47 percent of the vote compared with 36 percent for Pastrana; Pastrana showed a slight lead over Samper among female voters obtaining 44 percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for Samper. When asked who they felt would be better prepared to take over in the event of the president's absence--Samper's running mate Humberto de la Calle or Pastrana's running mate Luis Fernando Ramirez--respondents gave De la Calle 67-80 percent of the vote depending upon the city, compared with 10-15 percent for Ramirez. There was no appreciable difference between preferences of male and female voters. Pastrana said he was "not worried" by the poll results. (EL ESPECTAD0R, 30 Mar) Ramirez viewed De la Calle's lead in that poll as "normal" given that De la Calle had been campaigning for months, while Ramirez had just begun. Samper expressed his satisfaction with the results, noting that it showed that his decision to select De la Calle as his running mate was "correct." Samper also declared that the candidates' "commitment to social issues" was emerging as the central factor in the elections. (EL ESPECTAD0R, 30 March) A second poll conducted on 25-27 March by the National Consulting Center and commissioned by the Bavaria firm, showed Samper leading in the first round with 49 percent of the vote compared with 41 percent for Pastrana. (EL TIEMPO, 30 Mar) All other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. In a runoff election, Samper was said to receive 54 percent of the vote, compared with 43 percent for Pastrana. When asked whether they intended to vote in the elections, 57 percent said they would, 20 percent said they probably would, 6 percent said they probably would not, and 17 percent indicated they would definitely not vote. These results are based on reported face-to-face interviews with 3,102 persons, selected at random, in urban areas of 40 municipalities. Maza Decries Illicit Campaign Funding When asked during an interview with EL ESPECTADOR newspaper whether he believed reports that money from illicit sources was being used to help finance the campaigns, independent presidential candidate Miguel Maza responded that "there is not the slightest doubt." Maza described the use of such funds as "an insult to a country submerged in poverty and lacking in basic services." Maza added that illicit funds originated either from drug trafficking and other types of criminal actitivity, or as a result of corruption involving state contractors. According to Maza, such money is "circulating in abundance." (EL ESPECTADOR, 2 April) Pastrana Campaigns in Miami Andres Pastrana traveled to Miami during Holy Week to bring his campaign message to Colombian citizens there. He reiterated his criticism of the renewal late last year of diplomatic relations with Cuba, declaring that now was not the "proper time" for such a move. He recalled that during his visit to Colombia last year, Cuban President Fidel Castro refused to condemn the activities of Colombian guerrillas. (EL TIEMPO, 2 April) Pastrana also warned that it was important for Colombia to "act quickly" to gain entrance to NAFTA and said the country must continue to press ahead with economic integration efforts in Latin America. (EL TIEMPO, 2 April) While in Miami, Pastrana attended a Colombian-American Chamber of Congress luncheon, which drew a capacity crowd. The candidate also granted interviews to several radio and television stations, toured Colombian-owned businesses in the city, and hosted a fund-raising dinner. Ernesto Samper had originally planned to travel to Miami that same week, but reportedly canceled his trip for security reasons. (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March) Samper Responds to Bishop, Calls For Hostages' Release Before taking a few days off from campaigning during Holy Week, Ernesto Samper responded to Bucaramanga Archbishop Dario Castrillon's charge that Samper's appointment of Senator Claudia Rodriguez de Castellanos, a member of the evangelical Christian Movement party, to the Commission for the Renewal of the Liberal Party was politically motivated. Castrillon reportedly made the comments during a recent homily in which he said that Samper's action could create conflict with other sectors of the population who hold different religious beliefs. Samper denied any political motive, claiming he would not permit discrimination of any kind in his campaign and adding that he does not recognize "any differences among Colombians based on creed, ideology, sex, or race." (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March) Samper also called on the country's guerrillas to free all their hostages, including the father of Luis Fernando Ramirez, vice-presidential candidate of the rival Conservative Party. (EL ESPECTADOR, 30 March) Candidates Revise Campaign Itineraries As a result of the decision to postpone the presidential elections until 29 May, candidates are reportedly revising their campaign intineraries, scheduling visits to additional municipalities and making plans to revisit certain key areas, according to EL TIEMPO (2 April). Although Ernesto Samper is said to be the strongest candidate in the Atlantic Coast region, his campaign advisers have decided he should visit several of the departments in that region as often as possible during the remaining weeks of the campaign. They recall that in 1982 former president Lopez lost in that region of the country, even though it was considered a bastion of support for both the Liberal Party and Lopez himself, an outcome they attribute to the feeling of complacency that set in following the Liberal Party's good showing in the legislative elections. Andres Pastrana will also be targeting this region during the remainder of the campaign, according to EL TIEMPO. Pastrana is currently strong in Medellin and Bogota, which, the paper says, explains Samper's recent decision to name three "heavyweights"--Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de Ia Fuente, and former Bogota mayor Sonia Duran--to help direct his campaign in Bogota. Antonio Navarro has been trying to garner support among residents of the poorest municipalities, continuing to promote his list of "promises" which he signs in the presence of a notary at each location he visits, according to EL TIEMPO.
