FR940105-0-00011 FR940105-0-00002 Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants and activities associated with the possession or transportation of Category I material. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards issued by the Small Business Administration in 13 CFR part 121. Backfit Analysis The rule represents a relaxation from current part 26 requirements for drug testing since the rule permits (but does not require) licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the rule. Accordingly, the rule does not represent a backfit as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), and a backfit analysis is not required for this rule.

As a minimum, tests must be administered on a nominal weekly frequency and at various times during the day. Random testing must be conducted at an annual rate equal to at least 50 percent of the workforce. * * * * * Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of December, 1993.
