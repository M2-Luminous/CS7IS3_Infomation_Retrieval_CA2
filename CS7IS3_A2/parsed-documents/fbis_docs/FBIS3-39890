After a rally, called by trade unions, Greens, and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], 1,000 Lower Saxon policemen used extremely harsh measures to put an end to all attempts to block the Republikaner event. After a protest march to the Stadthalle, which was completely cordoned off, Helga Christensen, Hannover district chairwoman of the German Trade Union Federation, and IG-Metall district head Juergen Peters made speeches, pointing to the connection between mass unemployment and the danger from the right. Hannover Mayor Herbert Schmalstieg (SPD) said at the rally that it was a mistake to have leased part of the Stadthalle to the Republikaner. Schmalstieg regretted that the city's attempt to ban the Republikaner rally failed because of a decision by the Administrative Court. After the rally, calls to block the Republikaner event were issued by megaphone. Previously there had been individual brawls between young demonstrators and Schoenhuber fans. Eggs, fire crackers, and bottles occasionally flew in the direction of the Stadthalle or the police. The police acted with extraordinary brutality against the remaining demonstrators. A mounted police unit galloped into the crowd. Three water cannons fired at the Republikaner' opponents. Individual groups of demonstrators were herded together and beaten with truncheons, even while some of the demonstrators were already on their way home. The leftist group Anti-Republikaner Action Alliance later spoke of "a police operation as Hannover had not seen for a long time." Gila Altmann, spokeswoman of the Alliance 90/Greens Land Executive Committee, criticized the police operation as "excessive and brutal." Within just a few minutes the police made the first, second, and third calls on the demonstrators to disperse, so that afterwards they could act against the anti-Schoenhuber demonstration with all possible harshness. One cannot speak at all of de-escalating behavior by the police, which had been agreed on beforehand.
