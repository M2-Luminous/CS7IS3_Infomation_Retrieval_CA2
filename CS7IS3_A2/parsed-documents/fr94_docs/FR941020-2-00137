Applicants state that Account I will register with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act and that the offer and sale of variable annuity contracts to be funded through Account I will be registered under the 1933 Act. Applicants incorporate the registration statements into the application by reference. Account I has nine subaccounts. 5. The Other Accounts will be separate accounts of either Company used to fund Other Contracts. Applicants state that the Other Accounts will register with the Commission under the 1940 Act. 6. The assets of Accounts U and V are, and the assets of Account I will be, invested in shares of John Hancock Variable Series Trust I (the ``Fund''). The Fund is a diversified, open-end management investment company and was reorganized as a business trust under Massachusetts law effective April 29, 1988. The Fund is the successor to John Hancock Variable Series Fund I, Inc., which was incorporated under Maryland law on September 23, 1985. The Fund currently has nine portfolios, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies. 7. The Existing Contracts are individual combination fixed/variable annuity contracts, issued to plans qualifying for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''). The Existing Contracts will also be issued to individual persons doing their own retirement planning, and to plans and trusts that do not qualify for special tax treatment under the Code. The Existing Contracts will be deferred annuity contracts that are deemed to be ``periodic payment plan certificates'' within the meaning of Section 2(a)(27) of the 1940 Act. 8. The Companies will deduct any premium tax levied by any governmental entity as a result of the Contracts or the Accounts. Purchase payments received under the Contracts will be allocated, after the deduction of applicable premium taxes, to any one or more of the subaccounts of the appropriate Account or to a fixed annuity account of either of the Companies at the discretion of the owner of the Contract. The application states that the applicable premium taxes are determined by the then current state of residence of the Contract owner. Premium taxes currently range from 0.04% to 5% of purchase payments or of the amount annuitized. Applicants state that, where permitted by state law, the premium taxes will be deducted upon annuitization. In all other jurisdictions, the taxes will be deducted upon the death of the annuitant, surrender or withdrawal as directed by the law of the Contract owner's state of residence.
