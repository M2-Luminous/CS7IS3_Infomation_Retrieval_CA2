He would require first the departure of the military who overthrew him, then his return to power within 10 after the designation of a prime minister. In a letter to the UN Security Council, a copy of which AFP acquired on 23 February, Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz Longchamp presented the sequence proposed by President Aristide for an irreversible resolution of the Haitian crisis. This sequence provides first for the departure of the leaders of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, as stated in the Governors Island accord. This can be obtained through the adoption of more severe sanctions against Haiti by the UN Security Council along with efforts to put an end to the flood of goods entering the country through the border with the Dominican Republic, the document adds. President Aristide's proposal then provides for the adoption by the Haitian parliament of some measures including an amnesty for the military and a law on the creation of a new police force. The following steps include the deployment of the UN technical assistance mission, the designation of a new prime minister, and the return of President Aristide 10 days after this appointment. Finally, Mr. Aristide's plan provides for the lifting of the sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council, the prime minister's taking the oath, and the resumption of economic assistance to Haiti. These counterproposals have been presented by President Aristide following the plan proposed in Washington last week by a group of Haitian parliamentarians. This plan, which is actively supported by the United States, provides first for the appointment of a prime minister and the creation of a government of concord, but does not specify a date for Aristide's return to Port-au-Prince. According to Mr. Longchamp, it would be irresponsible to proceed to designate any prime minister -- who would risk his own life -- before the deployment of the UN mission. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who talked on the phone with Aristide on the evening of 22 February, had no comments to make for the moment on Mr. Longchamp's letter, stated UN spokesman Joe Sills. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly supported this week the plan of the parliamentarians. The secretary general invited President Aristide to come quickly to UN headquarters to continue the discussions with representatives of the friends of Haiti -- including Canada, the United States, France, and Venezuela -- in an attempt to look for a solution to the crisis, Mr. Sills added. However, Mr. Aristide, who has to go to Europe in the next few days, advised Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali that he would contact him on his return scheduled for 5 March. This answer has given rise to a certain irritation among UN officials in New York.
