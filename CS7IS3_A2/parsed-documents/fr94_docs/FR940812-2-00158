FR940812-2-00158 FR940812-2-00052 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3679; FR&hyph;3329&hyph;N&hyph;04] NOFA for the Rental Voucher Set-Aside for Homeless Persons With Disabilities for FY 94; Amendment AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of fund availability for FY 1994; Amendment. SUMMARY: The Department published a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) on February 1, 1994, that announced the availability of a set-aside of rental voucher funds of up to $147.7 million for very low-income homeless persons with disabilities and their families in a regional competition. The deadline date for applications was May 2, 1994 at the HUD State or Area Office. The Department received a large number of applications in response to the NOFA and began the review and ratings process. During the review process, HUD determined that many housing agencies (HAs) did not submit a request for a specific amount of Section 8 budget authority in addition to a request for the number of units, shown in the Form HUD&hyph;52515. The lack of a budget authority request, or, in the case of some HAs, an inadequate budget authority request based on the number of units listed in the Form HUD&hyph;52515, led to circumstances in which the certification in Attachment 7A of the NOFA was either rendered meaningless (in the absence of a budget authority request) or the application was rendered unacceptable, since the dollar-for-dollar match requirement was not met. Based upon the information originally submitted by the HAs by the May 2, 1994, deadline, HUD determined that a large number of applications would be rejected. The Department has decided through this amendment to the February 1, 1994, NOFA to allow HAs to submit an initial or revised request for Section 8 budget authority. This request must equal the amount of Section 8 budget authority necessary to fund the number of units requested in the Form HUD&hyph;52515. The HA may request that the HUD Office calculate this amount for the HA if the HA provides to HUD the number of units by bedroom size and the average monthly adjusted income. It will also be used as the amount of supportive services commitments to which the HA, or other entity, commits itself in the Attachment 7A certification. If the new request for Section 8 budget authority does not match the amount of budget authority needed to fund the full request for units, as shown in the Form HUD&hyph;52515, the application will be rejected. HAs should be aware that the new request for Section 8 budget authority may affect the value of the supportive services certified by the HA in Attachment 7A of the NOFA. HAs should also be aware that the first year firm financial commitments may not be modified although the change in the request for Section 8 budget authority may affect the score received under Selection Criterion 5: Documentation of First Year Supportive Services. HAs will not be allowed to revise any other aspect of their applications and any other information submitted by HAs under this amendment will not be accepted. DATES: Revised data must be received by 3:00 p.m., local time, September 12, 1994, in the HUD Office to which the original application was received. ADDRESSES: Submit revised data to the same HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office to which the original application was submitted. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald J.
