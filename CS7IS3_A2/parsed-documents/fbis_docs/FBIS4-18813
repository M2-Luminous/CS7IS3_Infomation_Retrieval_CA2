Only 19 percent of the people support the Prosperity Party [PP]. I believe that it is wrong to panic over the local election results. No party can come to power with a 20 percent vote in any country. Even if it does, it cannot remain in power. The Turkish nation expressed its real belief with its votes. Some 80 percent of our people proved that they are against fundamentalism and anachronism. So why this fear of the PP in all the cities and towns? To tell you the truth, the PP victory in the big cities has jolted certain circles back to reality. It was obvious that the PP which raised militants in mosques, religious schools, and in every street in the cities for years would collect many votes in the first elections to come along. The first step in this direction was taken when the PP won the municipal elections in six Istanbul districts a year and a half ago. We warned both the social democrats and the liberals. The secular and pro-Ataturk voters are always strong and faithful. Unfortunately, the parties are divided both at the center right and at the center left. The electorate was forced to divide its vote among the True Path Party, the Motherland Party and the Nationalist Action Party in the right, and among the Social Democratic Populist Party, the Democratic Left Party, and the Republican People's Party in the left. The total number of votes the rightist parties received was 50 percent, and the total number of votes the leftist parties received was 25 percent. The PP only got 19 percent throughout Turkey. The division in the right and left was certainly going to lead to such results. If the PP is singing with the joy of victory today it is thanks to the pretentious party leaders who do not know what they are doing, not thanks to the voters. These leaders who caused the defeat of their parties as well as the pro-Ataturk masses in the country should not be allowed to remain in the political arena. The party grassroots will sooner or later find the way of getting rid of the current leaders; they must. [passage omitted]
