President Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) agreed during their meeting in Bonn to bring about a cooperation agreement between the European Union (EU) and Russia under the German EU Presidency beginning early in July, which would help Russia in the economic area. Yeltsin announced that Russia would join the Partnership for Peace with NATO, if Russia's particularities were first considered in a protocol. Kohl and Yeltsin agreed to honor the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from Germany on 31 August with a ceremony in Berlin and not, as originally planned, in Weimar. Kohl and Yeltsin were in the Palatinate on 12 May; earlier, Yeltsin met with Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party -- FDP) played tennis with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, on 13 May and then made an excursion to Cologne. They also took part in a ceremony in Aachen, in which Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was awarded the Charlemagne Peace Prize. Kinkel will hold talks with Yeltsin in Bonn this Friday [13 May], he will then go to Stuttgart to conclude his visit. Kinkel and Kozyrev will jointly fly to Geneva to take part in the meeting of the contact group of several foreign ministers dealing with the war in Bosnia. Yeltsin, Kozyrev, Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had negotiated with Kohl and other German government members on 11 May; Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) did not take part in these negotiations because he was in the island of Ruegen where he met with the Danish and Polish defense ministers. State Secretary Schoenbohm stood in for Ruehe in Bonn and held a separate discussion with Grachev on 12 May. Yeltsin demanded "access to all European organizations" and to the international trade forum, GATT, for Russia. People should not forget that "we are a European country." Kohl promised he would work to allow Russia to take part in the world economic summit of the seven major industrial nations (G7) without any restrictions in the future. He said that this could not be expected for Naples in July where Russia would only take part in the political talks. However, the desire for Russia to cope with the transition problems made it necessary for the G7 to allow Russia, in the foreseeable future, to take part in economic discussions: "Developments are tending to go in this direction." Yeltsin and Kohl described Russia and Germany as the most important mutual partners in Europe. Kohl confirmed Germany's interest in Russia developing into a democratic, economically stable country: "Within the scope of our possibilities, we will support Russia in word and deed wherever Russia considers this desirable." According to the chancellor, this holds true for its inclusion in the work of the World Bank, the IMF, and the EU. "We are betting on and fully support President Yeltsin's reform effort." Russia's full membership in the EU "is not of current interest." First of all, we must energetically "pursue association." Yeltsin voiced the hope that within a month, agreement could be reached with Brussels on quotas and access to the market. Being a European country, Russia should also be a member of the Council of Europe, he said. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) and his counterpart, Aleksandr Shokhin, agreed on an order worth 500 million German marks for the German railroad wagon company, Deutsche Waggonbau, in Halle this year. To guarantee this project financially, Germany will again grant special conditions. In 1995, smaller orders will follow. This cooperation is intended to lead to the joint development of Russian railroad wagon capacities. The German and Russian government members said relations between the two countries were free from burdens and troubles. A commission of historians was instituted which will begin, at the end of June at the latest, to utilize the sources that have now become accessible for evaluation of recent history. By the middle of June, the next meeting of the German-Russian commission on the return of artistic items, which so far has been unsuccessful, will take place. Kohl insisted that the cultural agreement should form the legal basis for the return of such items. Now "concrete results" must be achieved: "Several problems have yet to be clarified." Yeltsin said that he and Kohl would agree on a schedule for further commission meetings before the end of this year. The negotiations on the opening of a consulate-general in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) have not made progress. Yeltsin linked his wish for Russia's participation in the world economic summits with Moscow's cooperation within the Partnership for Peace and said that both were elements of "the all-round integration processes of Russia for the preservation of peace and security." Russia's "great role" must be taken into account, he said. In return, Russia supported Germany "as a worthy candidate" for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Because Germany was the second largest country in Europe after Russia, the close relations with Bonn were making it easier for Moscow to find a place in Europe's security system, said Yeltsin. "However, without a special protocol, we cannot sign the document on Partnership for Peace, with which we basically agree." Yeltsin said that what had to be considered as distinctive was the fact that Russia has an Army of 3 million men and equipment that is not in accordance with NATO standards. "Russia will start work with NATO in May to formulate the protocol." Yeltsin said: "Following the signing of the protocol -- and I do not think there will be any major problems -- Russia will also sign the Partnership for Peace document." Yeltsin was satisfied that following the differences over the farewell ceremonies for the Russian troops, Kohl "has seen the mood of the people and their president." Referring to the military's annoyance with the original plan for a civilian ceremony in Weimar, Yeltsin said: "One cannot proceed in such a way that the situation in Russia is destabilized." "Therefore, the federal chancellor quickly agreed to hold the ceremony in Berlin, but without the allies." Kohl said it was his "wish to see off the soldiers in a dignified and respectful manner and in a friendly spirit." He added that he and Yeltsin would "personally deal" with the details of the "entire ceremony in Berlin, in order to meet our responsibilities." Kohl indicated that he would like to see Russia bring its influence to bear on the Serbs, and said that both sides were in agreement that a solution for Bosnia was urgent. Yeltsin reiterated his suggestion of a "summit meeting" in Moscow of Russia, the United States, the Eu, and the parties involved in the Bosnian war: "However, at first we must be sure that the problem will be solved." That is why the meeting must be well prepared: "The foreign ministers have started work." He said that nationalism had also provoked wars in some CIS republics of the former Soviet Union: "We in Russia have shed no blood for such reasons." Yeltsin said he was not afraid of Zhirinovskiy and his nationalists: "No, no, we are not afraid of him; he has no substance." Yeltsin added: "Russia, which suffered in the war from 1941 to 1945, knows what nationalism means."
