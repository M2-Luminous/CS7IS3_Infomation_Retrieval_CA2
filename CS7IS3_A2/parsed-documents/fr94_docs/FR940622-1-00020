FR940622-1-00020 FR940622-1-00009 15 CFR Part 990 RIN 0648&hyph;AE13 Natural Resource Damage Assessments AGENCY: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Summary of Public Comment; Notice of Specific Issues for Comment; Notice of Availability of Summary of Cooperative Damage Assessment Workshops. SUMMARY: Section 1006(e)(1) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the President, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, to promulgate regulations for the assessments of natural resource damages resulting from the discharge of oil. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposed those regulations on January 7, 1994. (59 FR 1062) Since its rule was proposed, NOAA has held six regional workshops and a public meeting in Washington, D.C. It was requested, and NOAA agreed, to publish a summary of the public comments received at the workshops and Washington, D.C. meeting. In light of the extension of the comment period until October 7, 1994, this Notice requests the public address some of the issues and questions raised during the workshops. In addition to the workshops, NOAA in cooperation with the American Petroleum Institute and the Coastal States Organization, held six regional workshops on cooperative natural resource damage assessment. This Notice informs the public of the availability of the ``Summary Report of Six Cooperative Natural Resource Damage Assessment Workshops.'' DATES: Written comments should be received no later than October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written inquiries are to be submitted to: Damage Assessment Regulations Team (DART), c/o NOAA/DAC, 1305 East-West Highway, SSMC # 4, 10th Floor, Workstation # 10218, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3281. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Burlington or Eli Reinharz, Office of General Counsel, DART, telephone (202) 606&hyph;8000, FAX (202) 606&hyph;4900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq ., provides for the prevention of, liability for, removal of, and compensation for the discharge, or substantial threat of discharge, of oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive Economic Zone. Section 1006(e) requires the President, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, to develop regulations establishing procedures for natural resource trustees to use in the assessment of damages for injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources covered by OPA. Section 1006(b) provides for the designation of federal, state, Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees to determine resource injuries, assess natural resource damages (including the reasonable costs of assessing damages), present a claim, recover damages, and develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources under their trusteeship. NOAA has published eight Federal Register Notices, 55 FR 53478 (December 28, 1990), 56 FR 8307 (February 28, 1991), 57 FR 8964 (March 13, 1992), 57 FR 14524 (April 21, 1992), 57 FR 23067 (June 1, 1992), 57 FR 44347 (September 25, 1992), 57 FR 56292 (November 27, 1992), and 58 FR 4601 (January 15, 1993) requesting information and comments on approaches to developing damage assessment procedures prior to issuing its proposed rule on January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1062). The proposed rule summarizes the written comments received by the agency and issues raised during the public meetings and workshops, responds to those comments, and contains proposed regulatory language on the various issues raised. Many of the specific comments summarized in the proposed rule refer to the status report published by NOAA in the March 13, 1992, Federal Register Notice. Within the preamble to the proposed rule, NOAA specifically listed a series of issues that were raised during the various meetings and comments (at 59 FR 1071&hyph;1074). The goal of this statement of issues of interest was to stimulate discussions on some of the more intriguing suggestions considered in developing the proposed rule. After publication of the proposed rule, NOAA held six regional meetings in January and February of 1994 in New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle. These meetings began with a discussion of the issues identified in the preamble to the proposed rule, but were open to discussion of other issues. There was a diverse turnout, interest, and response at those meetings. In response to requests from many interested parties, on March 1, 1994, NOAA extended the comment period on the proposed rule to July 7, 1994. (59 Fed Reg 9688) A final workshop on March 25, 1994, was held in Washington, D.C. A set of discussion papers was distributed at the Washington meeting. These discussion papers reflected issues and questions raised during the regional meetings. The discussion papers were not intended to reflect final agency position on any issue. Instead, they were intended to focus on some relevant questions raised by the rulemaking to date. Although the Washington, D.C. meeting emphasized the issues presented in those papers, discussions on other concerns were encouraged. These discussion papers have been incorporated into this Notice.
