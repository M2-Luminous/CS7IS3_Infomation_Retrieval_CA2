[Kuncze] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Demmocrats has done well in these elections. We received more than 1 million votes on the lists. In effect, this means that we repeated our 1990 election results, that is we have achieved the aim we had set for ourselves. The SZDSZ is the only party which has a chance of preventing a landslide victory by the Hungarian Socialist Party and of preventing the continuance of a covert one-party system after the May elections. We have to wait for the results of the second round. [passage omitted] [Laszlo] There is an agreement between the SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] that candidates who scored poorly are to step down in favor of the other party's candidate. Having seen the Fidesz results, do you think that is going to happen? Will the Fidesz candidates step down in favor of the SZDSZ? [Kuncze] The Fidesz leaders have stated several times that they respect the agreement. The SZDSZ has also said this. Therefore, I am sure that this agreement will work. I also add that the same is true of the Agrarian Alliance and the Liberal Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party. [passage omitted]
