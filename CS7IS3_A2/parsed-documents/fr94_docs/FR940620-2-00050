FR940620-2-00050 FR940620-2-00029 National Part Service Amendment to the General Management Plan, Environmental Assessment for Power Line Relocation, Manassas National Battlefield Park, VA AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Availability. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of the environmental assessment (EA) for relocating a 500 kilovolt (kV) power line on one set of towers, and 230 kilovolt (kV) and 115 kilovolt (kV) power lines on another set of towers, within Manassas National Battlefield Park. DATES: The EA will be on review for 60 days. Comments should be received no later than August 19, 1994. A public Open House was held on March 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the EA should be submitted to the Superintendent, Manassas National Battlefield Park, 12521 Lee Highway, Manassas Virginia 22110, phone (703) 754&hyph;1861. A copy of the document is available on request from: Kenneth E. Apschnikat, Superintendent, Manassas Battlefield Park, 12521 Lee Highway, Manassas, Virginia 22110, phone (703) 754&hyph;1861. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The focus of the environmental assessment (EA) is for the orderly termination and relocation of the Virginia Power transmission corridor, which runs through the Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill tracts. These tracts are where the Second Battle of Manassas erupted on August 28, 1862. Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill were incorporated into the park through legislated boundary adjustments in 1980 and 1988, respectively. These two areas on the western edge of the park encompass 870 acres and are bordered on the south by Interstate 66, on the west by Pageland Lane, and on the east by Groveton Road. U.S. Route 29 runs between the tracts. The Manassas National Battlefield Park Amendments Act of 1988 (the Act), title X of P.L. 100&hyph;647 (16 U.S.C. 429b(b)) legislatively took possession of Virginia Power's easements, powerlines, and towers on the Stuart's Hill tract at the park. The National Park Service has sought to define and analyze alternative alignments and has selected a preferred alternative that relocates the facilities to the western most edge of the park. Relocation would stand as the method and extent of compensation required by the Act. The EA analyzes three alternatives for moving the power lines. It identifies the location and type of equipment needed and assesses the impacts that power line relocation alternatives would have on the environment. This EA presents the preferred alternative (alternative B), which proposes relocating the existing power line right-of-way within the park boundary, and a no-action alternative that implements legislation to move the power lines completely outside the park boundary (alternative C). This EA also includes an alternative that analyses conditions under which the power lines might remain in their present alignment (alternative A). The preferred alternative would enhance interpretive experiences of the second battle by relocating the power lines away from the historic core of the Brawner farm and Stuart's Hill tracts to a corridor just inside the western boundary of the park. The responsible official for a decision on the preferred alternative is Robert G. Stanton, Regional Director, National Capital Region, National Park Service. Terry R. Carlstrom, Acting Regional Director, National Capital Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14965 Filed 6&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;M
