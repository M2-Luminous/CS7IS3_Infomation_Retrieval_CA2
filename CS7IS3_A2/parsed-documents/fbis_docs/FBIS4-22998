Pavlov, St. Petersburg; UDC 612.28+612.014.41:612.7] [Abstract] Reports that nitrogen substitution with the inert and less dense helium lowers resistance and facilitates respiratory muscle work and the reverse effect of air substitution with an SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixture prompted an investigation into the characteristic features of breathing control during inhalation of normotoxic helium- and SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixtures at rest and during constant muscular activity on the basis of analyzing rapid and stable changes in the ventilation and biomechanical parameters of the respiratory system and the level of the central inspiratory activity. To this end, ten healthy 22-42 year old men, trained beforehand in order to adapt them to the experimental conditions until full stabilization of the indicators under study, were examined using He and SF[.sub]6[/] as the diluent gases changing the respiratory mixture density at a 20.9+/-0.5% oxygen concentration. The SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] density exceeded that of air by 4.21 times and the He-O[.sub]2[/] density was less than that of air by 2.94 times. The experimental procedure is outlined. The study shows that at rest and especially during muscular work, air substitution with the He-O[.sub]2[/] mixture suppresses the central inspiratory drive, respiratory work, and electric activity of the inspiratory muscles while inhalation of the SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] mixture definitely has an opposite effect: the effort for developing an level lower maximum inspiratory flow at a constant pulmonary ventilation (compared to air) and a constant chemoreceptor stimulus rises while the central inspiratory activity increases by almost threefold. It is speculated that afferent signals from the respiratory muscles' mechanoreceptors which maintain the necessary alveolar ventilation within a broad range of mechanical stress play a crucial role in optimizing the ventilation regime in humans in gaseous media with different density while the ability to assess the stress imposed on the system is maintained even in patients with a traumatic severance of the spine in the neck area. Consequently, participation of the nonmuscular afferents in the respiration resistance perception cannot be completely ruled out, yet an analysis would call for a different experiment design and new methodological techniques.
