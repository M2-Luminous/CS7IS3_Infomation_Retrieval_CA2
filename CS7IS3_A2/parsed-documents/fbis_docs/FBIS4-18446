Agri governor Dogan Hatipoglu told the semiofficial Anatolia news agency that militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were infiltrating into Turkey over the Iranian border but that lately modern physical barriers put up on the border and better security measures had reduced this traffic. Noting that they had a dialogue with Iran on security issues, Hatipoglu said "we have seen this dialogue work out. Iran was previously claiming that the PKK did not exist in its territory but changed this view after talks and seeing documentation. Now they are also struggling against the PKK with their own forces. ``They have returned some terrorists either dead of alive.'' [paragraphing as published] Hatipoglu said Turkey was extremely pleased over Iran's attitude and called on other neighboring countries to take a similar approach as well.
