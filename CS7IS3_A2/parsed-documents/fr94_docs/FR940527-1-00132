FR940527-1-00132 FR940527-1-00014 Comparison of Factors and Adjustments_Fiscal Year 1994 Federal Rate and Proposed Fiscal Year 1995 Federal Rate 1␣ 1␣ 1Change 1Percent Change Update factor1: Fiscal year 1994: 1.0304 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 1.0222 1.0222 2.22 GAF/DRG adjustment factor1: Fiscal year 1994: 1.0053 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 1.00115 1.00115 0.12 Outlier adjustment factor2: Fiscal year 1994: 0.9454 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 0.9372 0.9913 ^0.87 Exceptions adjustment factor: Fiscal year 19942: 0.9485 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 0.9797 1.0329 3.29 Budget neutrality adjustment factor2: Fiscal year 1994: 0.8947 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 0.7986 0.8926 ^10.74 Federal rate: Fiscal year 1994: $378.34 Proposed Fiscal year 1995: 353.87 0.9353 ^6.47 1The update factor and the GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors are built permanently into the rates. Thus, for example, the incremental change from FY 1994 to FY 1995 resulting from the application of the 1.00115 GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor for FY 1995 is 1.00115. 2The outlier reduction factor, the exceptions reduction factor, and the budget neutrality factor to assure that payments do not exceed 90 percent of what it is estimated would have been paid on the basis of reasonable cost are not built permanently into the rates; that is, these factors are not applied cumulatively in determining the rates. Thus, for example, the net change resulting from the application of the FY 1995 exceptions reduction factor is 0.9797/0.9485, or 1.0329.
