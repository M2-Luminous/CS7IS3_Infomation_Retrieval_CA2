According to a statement by the U.S. Information Service, Mr. Nimetz has drawn the conclusion that both sides desire a relationship based on cooperation and mutual respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity, and they also admit the dangers to stability in the region if the dispute continues. However, the statement points out that the differences between the sides are complicated and not easy to overcome. The statement further stresses: Mr. Nimetz will submit a report to Washington, present his views to UN mediator Cyrus Vance, and continue his efforts to support the negotiations within the UN framework. Mr. Nimetz will return to the region when this is deemed appropriate. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed the hope that there is progress on the Skopje issue before his visit to the United States. He noted this in response to a correspondent's question while he was going to the meeting of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Central Organizing Committee. Mr. Papandreou described the initiative by President Clinton's special envoy Matthew Nimetz as positive but pointed out that [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov remains intransigent and pressure should be exerted in this direction. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the U.S. side's initiative toward resolving the Skopje issue as successful and serious.
