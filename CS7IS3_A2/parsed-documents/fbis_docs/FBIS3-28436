A commentary of NODONG SINMUN says there is probably no other pack of traitors like the Kim Yong-sam group which even bans fellow countrymen from meeting each other while kissing aggressive foreign forces. The analyst notes: For the Chondoist organisations of the North and the South to have a contact for a joint celebration of the centenary of the Kabo Peasants' War was originally proposed as part of an independent civilian-level dialogue; the authorities need not and must not interfere in it. However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique of South Korea put its nose into this matter and trampled upon the agreement on having in early February a contact of Chondoist delegates of the North and the South. This was an impudent act of those who do not know their position and another unpardonable fascist outrage of the treacherous regime wearing the "civilian" mask. The Kim Yong-sam group brought forward the "nuclear issue", blocking the contact between Chondoist delegates of the North and the South. This was an absurd pretext to bar not only the contact between Chondoist delegates, but also a joint organisation of the celebration of the centenary of the Kabo Peasants' War by the North and the South. This was a sophism which could convince nobody. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, a group of despicable traitors, truculent fascist dictators, savages and villains, must be overthrown in South Korea. Chondoists and other people of South Korea must not pin any hope on the Kim Yong-sam traitor group but bring down a sledge hammer on its head and throw it onto the dust pin of history, united in a high patriotic spirit like the people who turned out in the Kabo Peasants' War. MINJU CHOSON in a commentary says the South Korean puppet clique's blocking a working-level contact between Chondoist delegates of the North and the South was an anti-national act of those who do not know of the ancestors. This group of hooligans must be removed from the nation as soon as possible, it stresses.
