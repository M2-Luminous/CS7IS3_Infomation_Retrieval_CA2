Lomonosov; UDC541.63+547.898] [Abstract] Trans-cyclohexanocrown esters are macrocyclic ligands having complex-forming properties which can be regulated by introducing variously orientated substituents at the cyclohexane fragment of the molecule. The possibility of such regulating is due to the change in relative stability of the two conformers (A and B) during a change in conformational energy of an alkyl substituent (R) in the molecule. The macrocycle in conformer B is much more susceptible to formation of complexes with cations than the extended macrocycle in conformer A. This has been confirmed experimentally: the addition of inorganic salts to solutions of the trans-cyclohexanocrown esters in CD[.sub]3[/]OD and (CD[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]CO results in an equilibrium shift in conformer IB. The regulating role of substituent R consists of destabilizing the IB-cation complex, which becomes intensified with an increase in conformational energy of the substituent. In the present work the trans-cyclohexanodithiocrown ester homologous series was synthesized from corresponding trans-1,2-cyclohexanodiols. The ratio of conformers to one another was determined by PMR from the synthesis products. It was demonstrated that the position of conformational equilibrium is determined by the size and structure of the macrocycle and by the volume of the substituent in the alicyclic fragment.
