Menem announced: "They [not further specified] have hired specialists in transforming lies into rumors and rumors into accurate news." In this regard, Menem emphasized that an agreement had been reached with "U.S. citizens to establish this issue of the president's illness," even though he did not disclose the names of the people responsible for this alleged campaign. Menem again charged "some media -- not all of them, but some" -- with allegedly conducting a campaign against him. He described this campaign as "a maneuver by some criminals who proliferate around there in some media." The chief executive complained: "Now, how will I stay for three days in the United States? Do you know what some people say? That I will be admitted [to a hospital] in that country. These people have no restraint." Menem urged the people: "Listen to the radio, watch television, read newspapers and magazines -- pay attention to the serious, responsible, and credible media, not those that use scandals to make a few more pesos. This is no good." Nevertheless, the president emphasized that he would give the journalists "more freedom, if there is still anything left to give them." Menem said: "Let them go on saying things. It does not make any sense because, as Peron used to say, reality is the only truth and the reality, which you can see now for yourselves, is that the president, this brother of yours, is healthy, strong, and willing to continue working." Menem made these remarks during a 9 June Justicialism Meeting of Mutual and Cooperative Organization Leaders at the Central Market. Addressing the issue of the economy, Menem criticized a petition made by "many entrepreneurial sectors that want a peso devaluation." Menem stressed: "They are aware of the fact that, as a result, they would export more. Nevertheless, what would happen to the workers? This fraud will never happen again in Argentina." The president indicated that if our "friends, the entrepreneurs, want to export, they have in their hands all the means to do it; they simply have to transform the enterprises to adjust them to current circumstances."
