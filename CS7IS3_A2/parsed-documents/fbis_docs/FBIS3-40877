If this process were allowed to continue without limitation, it would affect the national "debt service ratio" (DSR) which, at present, is 32 percent. Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad made this statement to reporters after installing several senior executives in office at the Department of Finance in Jakarta on 4 January. Furthermore, he urged private businessmen not to be too ambitious in carrying out large, capital intensive projects with funds derived from foreign loans. According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, the size of the private foreign debt strongly affects the national "debt service ratio" (DSR) which, at present, is 32 percent. About 11 percent of this figure consists of debts entered into by private business, while the remaining 21 percent consists of government debt. According to BUSINESS TIMES, which was published on 3 January by Standard and Poor (SP), a U.S. debt rating company, PT [Company Limited] Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Corporation and PT Inti Indorayon Utama, two private Indonesian companies, are on the list of companies with the highest debt burden in the private sector. The two companies have succeeded in raising $175 million in commercial paper on the bond market in the United States. Mar'ie said that so far the private sector has been too dependent on funds obtained from the banks. As a result, in their investments their own private capital has been smaller than the capital of the State Enterprises Board (BUMN). In this connection, according to Mar'ie, there has been a new development in terms of finding sources of investment funding. That is, the capital market has become active once again. He estimates that interest in the capital market, which grew during 1993 will continue into 1994. The minister of finance gave this warning in connection with the prospect for growing indebtedness of the private sector in the national development field during the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Plan. According to the minister, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, which will begin in April 1994, the private sector will have a larger role in national development, compared to previous five-year plans. He said: "At present the private sector is responsible for about 67 percent of national development activity. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan this role will increase to at least 75 percent." Furthermore, foreign-owned private firms will also be given an opportunity to participate in development projects which are presently dominated by the government. As an initial step the government has given the private sector an opportunity to participate in the construction of the Paiton electricity generating plant. Later on it may become possible for the private sector to have a role in the construction of major harbors under the "build, operate, transfer" (BOT) system. Changes On this occasion Minister of Finance Mar'ie installed T.L. Yousuf in office as a staff adviser to the minister of finance in the field of government receipts. Yousuf had previously been director of customs in the Directorate General of Customs and Excise. Abdul Kadar, who had previously been chief of the Jakarta Regional Office of the State Credit and Auctions Board (BUPLN), was installed in office as chief of the Bureau of Information and Law of BUPLN. Samsul Chorib, who had previously been chief of the Medan I Regional Office of BUPLN, became chief of the Bureau of State Credit and Banking of BUPLN. Also on this occasion the minister installed in office two managing directors and one director of government banks. Towil Heryoto and Sjahrizal, who had been managing directors of the Bank Tabungan Negara [State Postal Savings Bank] (BTN) and the Bank Pembangunan Indonesia [Indonesian Development Bank] (BAPINDO), respectively, exchanged positions. Towil became managing director of BAPINDO and Sjahrizal became managing director of the BTN. Furthermore, Dady Efendi, who had previously been manager of the Jakarta branch of the BRI [Bank Rakyat Indonesia--Indonesian People's Bank], was installed in office as a director of the BRI. According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, these changes of position and the installations in office of managing directors and directors of government banks are part of a process of consolidation in the banking sector. Mar'ie, a former director general of taxes, said: "These individuals have now been assigned to more appropriate positions, but this does not mean that up to the present they have not been suited to the positions they held."
