For the first time in China, this picture album comprehensively displays the features of Chinese democratic party and nonparty personalities, thereby portraying an angle of the success of cooperation between our party and personalities outside the party. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chief of the CPC Central Committee's United Front Work Department, wrote the preface to the picture album. The pace of history is advancing speedily toward the 21st century. A review of this century makes us understand that the main factors that have brought about profound changes in Chinese society are reform and revolution. Hearing the clarion call of the revolution, the predecessors and progressive forces of the Chinese revolution, represented by Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty, thus ending some 2,000 years of the feudal autocratic system in China. The Chinese communists, represented by Mao Zedong, led the Chinese people in overthrowing the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism, thus making China arise in the East. In the historic choice for reform, the Chinese communists, represented by Deng Xiaoping, have sought truth from facts, emancipated their minds, unswervingly taken the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made world-renowned achievements. One of the most outstanding achievements in this great, epic practice is the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and political consultative system. This achievement has enabled the CPC to unite with all forces that can be united and to enjoy the broadest possible sympathy and support. This achievement has enabled a large number of Chinese with lofty ideals to find the glorious path to serving the motherland; participating in decisions on China's future and in the formulation of major state policies; and contributing their wisdom and efforts to the motherland's independence, freedom, democracy, and prosperity. A philosopher once said that history will not forget those who created history. By providing pictures and explanations, this large picture album being presented to readers has collected for the first time the exploits of fanous Chinese democratic party and nonparty personalities who have participated in creating this glorious history, so as to display their features to the whole country and the world. Without question, this achievement will become richer and more developed, and will shine with even more splendor in the historic course of peacefully reunifying the motherland and achieving the Chinese nation's great revitalization under the leadership of the CPC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.
