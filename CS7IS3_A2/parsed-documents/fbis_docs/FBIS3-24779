The victims include women--some of them pregnant, children, and the elderly. All of them were unarmed. The most recent of these savage acts was carried out by the U.S. forces at about 0500 this morning, 31 January 1994, near Kilometre Four in Mogadishu, when a U.S. armored personnel carrier opened fire on civilians, some of whom were collecting food from the Saudi agency. Some were walking along the street, and others were going about their business. Eyewitnesses said that the dead and injured number more than 30 people. [passage omitted] The report added that the number of deaths confirmed so far is 17, with 13 injured. It was also reported that most of the dead bodies were taken to houses. A spokesman called on the Somali people to make known the number of those wounded and the number of the dead who had been taken home. He said that it is unfortunate that while the SNA was striving to strengthen the cease-fire and keep away from anything that would cause a confrontation, the foreign troops, especially those of the United States, were engaged in a massacre of the Somali people that can be seen as a continuation of their enmity and revenge on the Somali people. The SNA was expecting to heal the wounds of the past and has complained strongly to the U.S. Government about the problems its troops are inflicting on the Somali people. We ask for an explanation why the U.S. forces are not observing the cease-fire and prefer to continue with their enmity against Somali people. Finally, the SNA spokesman called on the Somali people to exercise tolerance and calm and called on foreign troops to stop the unjust massacre they are carrying out against the Somali people.
