Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 and Original Volume No. 2, the revised tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing, to become effective February 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that these revised tariff sheets are filed pursuant to Section 15.1, Electric Power Cost (EPC) Adjustment, of the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Section 15.1 provides that Texas Eastern shall file to be effective each February 1 revised rates for each applicable zone and rate schedule based upon the projected annual electric power costs required for the operation of transmission compressor stations with electric motor prime movers and to also reflect the EPC Surcharge which is designed to clear the balance in the Deferred EPC Account as of October 31, 1993. Texas Eastern states that these revised tariff sheets are being filed to reflect changes in Texas Eastern's projected expenditures for electric power for the twelve month period beginning February 1, 1994 based upon actual expenditures for the twelve month period ending October 31, 1993. Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers of Texas Eastern and current Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1 and IT&hyph;1 shippers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
