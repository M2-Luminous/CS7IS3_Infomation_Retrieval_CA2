Ten years later came the unexpected decline: The party plunged to 3.9 percent in the 1990 Bundestag elections. A comeback now seems possible for the Greens (who have, in the meantime, merged with the Alliance 90 [to form the Green Alternative--GAL]). With a radically changed course, they even want to achieve more than 10 percent in the super election year. Polls are encouraging them. The institutes predict double-digit results. The reason is that the Greens are creating a new image. "Money instead of muesli" is their new slogan. Former anticapitalists are suddenly turning into convinced advocates of the market economy. Mass unemployment, flexible working hours, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises are central topics of the election campaign. "We finally want to address economic issues," strategist Joschka Fischer stressed. The head of the GAL in Hamburg, Krista Sager, believes that the Greens might turn into a people's party. She is confident that she will win the first direct mandate for the Greens in the history of the FRG in the upcoming Bundestag elections in the GAL stronghold Hamburg. To achieve the high goals, the election campaign is being planned strategically. For the first time, all land organizations want to wage a joint election campaign. An agency is currently coining glib slogans like "Green please." "Ecology is no longer necessarily our priority." This is how Saarland spokesman Hubert Ulrich described the new strategy. His party wants to acquire a stronger profile in the economic sphere and enter parliament again after the next landtag elections. To everybody's surprise, the Greens in Saarland do not even rule out an alliance with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] led by Environment Minister Toepfer. The environment minister is not against this idea. "There are many points where cooperation would be possible." He considers alliances between the CDU and the Greens to be quite conceivable. This is no isolated case: In Saxony, the Greens and the CDU are also moving closer together. "Why should we not cooperate with the Alliance 90," the education expert of the CDU in Dresden, Matthias Roessler, asked. "We have a great deal in common with many members of our old citizens movement." The conservative Deputy Minister President Volker Schimpf expressed a similar view regarding a coalition after the elections in the fall. "Ninety percent of the functionaries support a coalition between the CDU and the Greens," an insider stressed. Things have reached a more advanced stage in Thuringia. In the district capital, Meiningen, the Greens officially offered the CDU nationwide cooperation for the first time. The CDU group in the city parliament has already signalled its interest. In the local elections on 12 June, the citizens in Thuringia will, for the first time, be able to vote on this unique project. An eastern model with export chances?
