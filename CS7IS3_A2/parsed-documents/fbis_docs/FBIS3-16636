The program consists of excerpts from an interview with Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy foreign minister, a dispatch from Israel by correspondent Vladislav Flyarkovskiy, and Svanidze's own comments. The program begins with comments by Igor Ivanov, who says: "The withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the Jericho region was due to have been completed by 13 April, after which the process of establishing Palestinian self-rule would have begun. You see, these were specific and practical steps. They were not just talks, they were practical steps that would have been the result of the complex talks that continued over two years. "It is difficult to say at the moment whether this murderer was acting individually or whether he was an instrument in a larger conspiracy, as both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides have set up investigative commissions. As you know, there are substantial disagreements about this question as well, and the results of these investigative groups will show how things really are. "But independently of that, unfortunately this crime had the most negative consequences on a wider scale." Svanidze then introduces the theme of the program, noting that the United Nations plans to adopt a resolution of principle on the Middle East tomorrow, and that Russia and the United States are named as the resolution's cosponsors. Ivanov's interview continues: "On the one hand, some people in the region tried immediately to interpret our activity as a kind of attempt, following our diplomatic successes in the Yugoslav settlement, to develop this success in the Middle East. Others also tried to interpret it as an attempt to, as it were, in some way pass the United States on the bend in that region. "In our view, a very tough UN Security Council resolution should now be adopted, which on the one hand condemns the crime in Hebron and on the other, outlines specific measures that would both promote the security of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and clear the way for the resumption of the talks process. Why do we believe this? Because today those tiny shoots of trust that had just appeared between the Israelis and the Palestinians have been seriously damaged." There then follows a three-minute dispatch from Jerusalem by correspondent Vladislav Flyarkovskiy, who describes the situation in the region three weeks on from the Hebron massacre. Ivanov's interview continues: "I would like to explain that this resolution contains a condemnation of the Hebron crime, and an appeal to the Israeli side to adopt measures to prevent more acts of violence toward Palestinians. It contains an appeal for measures to be worked out to ensure the security of Palestinians, including the sending of this or that international presence. And it contains an appeal to the two cosponsors -- the United States and Russia -- to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resolution clauses are implemented, and to promote the continuation of the peace process." The final two interview excerpts are interspersed with Svanidze's own comments and conclusions: Ivanov continues: "I am not expecting any opposition to the resolution. There may be certain privately held views about individual clauses in the preamble to the resolution, particularly where the references to Jerusalem are concerned, where the United States will probably abstain. There should be full unanimity concerning the resolution proper. "As far as our efforts in the Middle East are concerned, I repeat that they are currently very carefully thought out, and they meet our long-term interests." Svanidze then ends the program with his own comments.
