President's Apparatus Conference"] [Text] On 29 April in the president's apparatus, under the chairmanship of President of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, there was an expanded conference with the participation of management workers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The conference opened with an introduction by Geydar Aliyev. A report was heard from Minister of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan Vagif Novruzov. Speaking of the activity in recent years of the ministry, which occupied an important position in the system of state structures, the speaker noted that, while implementing a number of measures, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had still been unable to handle the duties assigned to it. Serious mistakes had been made in the area of providing for collegial leadership and in the selection and placement of personnel. The speaker was disturbed about the negative public opinion that had developed concerning the workers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and local police organs, who were called upon to wage a battle against crime, bribery, and corruption. The speaker emphasized that we must not put up with the fact that confidence in the police organs is decreasing each day. The fight against crime has slackened and cases of traffic safety violations are becoming more frequent. Analyzing the activity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the speaker noted that, having at one time been subjected to pressure from certain political groupings, the central apparatus of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has ended up incapable of performing the difficult tasks facing it in this difficult period for the republic. Although many devoted professionals work here, people who honestly serve the interests of the people, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs cannot organize their work correctly. The lack of unity in the central apparatus and among members of the collegium has led to serious shortcomings in the ministry's work. The atmosphere created in the collective has not been benevolent and possibilities of improving its work are not being taken advantage of. Serious shortcomings have been allowed in the organization of the activity of local internal affairs organs. Having discussed problems of selection and placement of personnel, the speakers noted the shortcomings in this sphere. Sometimes new appointments were made without the knowledge of members of the collegium and there was a negligent attitude toward suggestions to regulate personnel policy. The speakers spoke with alarm about the fact that cases of bribery and corruption are encountered in the very organization that is called upon to fight such phenomena. It was noted that the main reason for the serious mistakes and shortcomings in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs lies in the lack of the corresponding republic legislation. Police organs are still working with obsolete laws and regulations, which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the measures taken. At the conference the idea was expressed that workers of the police force, which was previously called upon to defend the interests of the people and the interests of the state, should not join any political group. There was also discussion of the need to strengthen the material and technical base of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the use of advanced practice for stepping up its activity, and the adoption of measures to reinforce social protection of police workers and improve the conditions for their work. The results of the conference were summed up by the President of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, who discussed in detail the tasks facing organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs today. First Deputy Prime Minister Fuad Guliyev, state advisers Arif Ragimzade and Gabil Guseynli, and other officials participated in the work of the conference.
