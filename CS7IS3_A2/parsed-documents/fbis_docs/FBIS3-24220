Myasnikov by Andrey Vinogradov; place and date not given: "Chinese Civilization Has Proven Its Capacity for Survival"] [Text] Vladimir Stepanovich Myasnikov is a well-known Sinologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Institute, and leader of the Russia-China Center. The author of more than 200 scientific works on the history of Russo-Chinese and Soviet-Chinese relations and problems of the development of countries of Northeast Asia. [Vinogradov] Vladimir Stepanovich, you were a member of the delegation that accompanied Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, to China. In connection with the fact that there was quite scant coverage of Kozyrev's trip in the press, could you describe this visit in somewhat more detail? As far as I know, the visit is seen in the Foreign Ministry as having been exclusively successful. It did not seem so to me.... [Myasnikov] In order to evaluate the success of a visit it is necessary to compare the purposes that were set for it and the results that were obtained. This visit had been planned long since, but its preparation was dragged out, and then the elections, formation of the cabinet, and so forth were approaching. A decision was ultimately made on a visit at government level by the foreign minister. The main task consisted of two components. First, following the visit of President Yeltsin, it was necessary to conduct a stock-taking, as it were, of how the agreements were being fulfilled. And, as practice shows, things are not moving successfully in all directions. This inspection purpose was combined with a desire to make good what had not been done during President Yeltsin's visit. You know that he was unable to go to Shenzhen, and a purpose of the visit, therefore, was a trip to the free economic zones. Specifically, the area of Heihe and Blagoveshchensk on the Russo-Chinese border, where it is planned to create a joint zone. And, of course, Shenzhen--a zone that has been in operation for 15 years now, which is the best-known in China, and which has achieved excellent results. The Chinese Government has decided, as you know, to make a northern Shenzhen of Heihe. [Vinogradov] These matters are more within the jurisdiction of Shokhin, it would seem to me, not Kozyrev.... [Myasnikov] You are right. As I said, the visit of another member of the government had been planned originally, but in connection with various matters (I dislike the term "government crisis") the most suitable figure in this case was the minister of foreign affairs. But traveling with him were experts, administration chiefs, people involved in actual economics.... And some of them, what is more, Ivanov, chief of the Administration of Chita Oblast, and Volkov, chief of the Administration of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, say, had already been to Shenzhen as part of the group accompanying the president. The appropriate invitations were made to the Chinese side during Yeltsin's visit for a return visit. But changes had occurred in this time in the Chinese leadership also, and it was necessary to extend an invitation to the new persons. In addition, agreement was reached on the visit to China this spring of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and problems of bilateral relations, border problems primarily, were discussed. You know that the transparency of the border and its openness and penetrability are a two-edged sword. On the one hand this stimulates border trade, on the other, a negative effect is manifested also: The potential for crime increases. Quite broad masses of representatives of the Chinese and Russian sides are coming into direct contact, but these are not, to be blunt, the best representatives of the two peoples. Prior to this, the "main conduits of relations with China" with us were L. Tolstoy, Gorkiy, a whole group of prominent Soviet writers, and so forth. Their works and they themselves are known in China and treated with great respect. Exhibitions of the Chinese artist Xu Beihong were held in our country in the 1930's, and the actor Mei Langfang, many theatrical ensembles, and so forth visited us. Today this line of cultural relations is somehow dormant, and quite a different line of interaction has emerged instead, which is causing quite a good deal of negative consequences of a purely psychological plane both in China and in Russia. The nations' ideas of one another are changing, and not for the better, what is more. This could create distorted stereotypes, which would influence our countries' relations in the future, in the 21st century. You know that, according to information of the Chinese side, at the end of the past month there were over 2 million Chinese on the territory of Russia. This figure is growing all the time. How many Russians, I cannot account for.... [Vinogradov] Quite a few also, particularly in Beijing. But not millions, of course.... [Myasnikov] If we wish to achieve mutual understanding, which is very important for good-neighborliness and for the strategic development of the relations of the two countries, order needs to be brought to bear. This does not mean that we have to ban or close down some things--we need elementary order at the state level. And the Chinese side is better and more successful here, as a rule. For example, they entrusted Heilongjiang Province with dealing with Russia and the CIS. Everything is specialized there: There is a permanent annual fair in Harbin and there is a particular set of companies that pursue commerce. On our side, on the other hand, total freedom, but not in the best meaning of this word. It was decided as the first order of business, therefore, to establish visa conditions. [Vinogradov] As far as I recall, these matters were raised in the course of Sergey Shakhray's trip to China last July also.... [Myasnikov] Shakhray discussed primarily models of national relations within the country. He was beginning his campaign as leader of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] at that time. China is the same type of multinational country as Russia and is typologically very close--the history of the creation of the two states is very similar. True, Shakhray had a mandate from the Siberian Accord public organization to discuss questions of border cooperation also. But I believe that neither he nor the Chinese side were prepared for a serious discussion. In this case this is within the jurisdiction of the minister of foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs, and minister of state security. [Vinogradov] As far as I know, the Chinese and Russian Ministries of Security have signed an agreement on the mutual extradition of criminals.... [Myasnikov] Yes, but besides this, a new agreement has now been signed which amounts to the following: Persons who are truly engaged in developing trade and economic, scientific and technological, and other relations between China and Russia and Russia and China have preferential conditions for crossing the border. They may be issued multiple visas and one-year, two-year passports. Obstacles are put in the way only of people engaging in semi-legal and illegal business and making episodic raids on the neighboring territory. [Vinogradov] How is the one distinguished from the other? [Myasnikov] I agree that making the distinction is difficult. Development will, obviously, be along the lines of the consolidation of firms. If a firm has given a good account of itself, its representatives will be granted preferential conditions. I recall that we were visited here in the institute by staff of the embassy and the trade mission of the PRC in charge of economic problems, and they were severely critical of us at that time: "You sign an agreement immediately with the first Chinese who gives you his card. But this does not mean that he is a person backed by a real business or administrative structure. It is not hard to make calling cards in China." [Vinogradov] I also have repeatedly taken part in such "negotiations" which subsequently were not continued. More, when I would attempt to find in Beijing the office of the "major firms" with whom we had been negotiating in Moscow, this proved more often than not to be a tiny stall. [Myasnikov] For the entire world practice of the market economy, checking out one's partner and his actual possibilities is one of the main rules. Aside from the new rules of visa conditions, therefore, other agreements will be signed also. But not all at once. This needs to be done thoughtfully to avoid foolish mistakes. In addition, serious regional problems, the Korean problem specifically, were discussed. As we all know, following the meeting in Seattle, this has become a controlled problem, and China is now performing a principal role in the achievement of a balance of interests. The proximity of positions was discussed and confirmed. A second important question that was of interest to the Russian side was Russia's participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC). As we all know, a three-year moratorium on the admittance of new members to the council was imposed in Seattle. The question of the need to make an exception for Russia was raised in the course of the visit. The Chinese side took note of our wish. [Vinogradov] But did not express a reciprocal wish to actively support the Russian aspiration.... [Myasnikov] It cannot make such declarations immediately. I can give you my viewpoint, which I conveyed to representatives of the Chinese side before, during, and after the visit. We should not be arguing along the lines of the "you help me, I'll help you" principle, of course. The Soviet Union formerly did a great deal for China's admittance to the United Nations. The support was very strong, even in the confrontation years. We refused to sign the San Francisco Treaty because the PRC had not been invited. But this does not mean that China must today pay us back. China should proceed from its own interests. [Vinogradov] How far is it in China's interests to promote an increase in Russia's economic role in Asia, thereby creating competition for itself and depriving itself of a monopoly position in the sphere of contacts with the Russian Federation to a large extent? [Myasnikov] I will explain it this way. Very important economic projects, in which China also has an interest, are being advanced at the present time. The idea of the creation of a free trade zone in Northeast Asia, say, which would encompass China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Russia, has been mooted for two years now. Without Russia it would be impossible to link this zone with the North American Free Trade Area: Mexico, Canada, and the United States, in Alaska. Could such a project be realized without Russia's membership of APEC? Or, say, the far-reaching "Yakut gas" project--the transfer of Yakut gas to China and South Korea. I believe that this would be extremely difficult on a bilateral basis. The Tyumenjiang project is also part of these integration economic processes, and Russia's participation is essential not only, of course, in the United Nations, where this project is being stewarded, but in APEC also. Of course, quite a tough struggle is under way in structures of an economic kind, but common rules of the game for this region should be formulated, and formulating such rules without Russia would be unrealistic. [Vinogradov] You always emphasize in your articles and speeches that Russo-Chinese relations represent a zone of contact of two different civilizations. To what extent are psychological differences influencing specific bilateral relations? [Myasnikov] We are undoubtedly representatives of two different civilization complexes. We will not say whose civilization is the more ancient, this is not the issue. But for an understanding of one's partner, an understanding of the motives of his policy, and an understanding of his political mentality a knowledge of civilization features is extraordinarily important. I have the impression, what is more, that the Chinese side has progressed further in this respect than us. It is possible that the Sinologists, you and I, are at fault here. The Chinese side is making very skillful use of the particular features of the Russian mentality and knows history well, which is a hallmark of far from all our representatives. China is today laying the foundations of a new state of the 21st century, and its policy is pursuing long-term goals. The main thing here is plan orientation and precise adherence to the charted plans. And a particular feature of the Chinese mentality, what is more, is the fact that the plans are formulated by all the participants in the foreign economic process. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs or some other body over it may collate a whole number of proposals, but each organization necessarily has its own plan of interaction with its partners, which, as a rule, is not the case with the Russian side. In a word, it is necessary in all situations to take account of a whole number of salient features of Chinese custom and the Chinese mentality. [Vinogradov] In respect to the human rights problem, for example.... [Myasnikov] If we are speaking of human rights, the millennial experience of Chinese civilization and Chinese philosophical social thought has formulated entirely different criteria of the relationship of the individual and society, the individual and the state. What are Western human rights today? They are Protestant morals in generalized form. At the start of the 19th century a number of founders of American democracy formulated some basic parameters, in their opinion, of democratic institutions for their country. They then embedded some messianic character in these notions of theirs and began to spread them to other countries. But inter-civilization convergence should not even contemplate the imposition of one's own historical experience. This is the mistake of the West today: demanding that China conform to its ideas or adopt its human rights legislation. It is necessary to perceive one's partner in international relations as he is, not attempt to remake him. Otherwise there will be conflicts. China understands Western experience and studies it, but cannot adapt it in a few years. There has to be a sufficient amount of time for an evaluation of the moral principles of Protestantism also. From China's viewpoint, they could seem absurd. After all, a beautiful European opera could be perceived by the Chinese as some preposterous cacophony. Just as Chinese traditional music is not accepted by Europeans. Political music is heterogeneous also. Of course, it is the job of diplomacy to level these differences. But diplomatic barriers cannot be crossed. The ideas of the Chinese concerning human rights are shaped by Confucian precepts, which exist in society. These are by no means communist inventions, against which the West is struggling. The Chinese communists, incidentally, have always made skillful use of their people's traditional experience and have adopted it in propaganda and ideological work. In the precepts that exist in China today there is a very great deal that is purely traditional. Let us take a look. A campaign to limit the birthrate is being conducted in China at this time. This is the sole rational policy possible in this country in this specific historical period. And combating it from the standpoints of human rights, as the American Congress has done at times, is to become ridiculous. [Vinogradov] The events in Tienanmen Square in 1989, for example. I personally encountered in China the fact that even liberals and intellectuals today justify the actions of the authorities in that situation since this helped preserve stability in society. Except for the students who took part in these events themselves, almost no one in China now sees them as some crime on the part of Deng Xiaoping and others. They regard them as a tragedy, but historically necessary. [Myasnikov] Yes, I also heard such opinions, and we need to try to understand them. Remember the events in Kwangju, in South Korea, when the students rebelled against the then Chon Tu-hwan regime. After all, liberal thought did not condemn the South Korean regime of that time for the shoot-up in Kwangju. Nor during their visits did the prime ministers of China and Japan condemn the events in Kwangju, but observed: There must be stability in Asia. That is, stability at the state level, at the level of international relations, was put above democratic aspirations. This is the point. So let us leave things Western to the West, things Eastern, to the East. The West has been operating in the East for five centuries now--since the times of the great geographical discoveries. And throughout these centuries the West has continually attempted to bring here at times Christian standards, at times, Catholicism, but the foundations of the oriental civilizations have proven quite strong. In addition, they are today undergoing a renaissance, a positive renaissance, I would say, because the "dragons" of East Asia have largely grown up in the soil of Confucianism and traditional ideology. So we should not be fighting inter-civilization differences, we should be adapting to them. [Vinogradov] What are the prospects of Russia's relations with China? After all, according to some estimates, China has today reached the position of the third economic power. China's role and influence in the world are increasing, and its overall might is growing. Is this not a challenge to Russia, for having such a neighbor is far from safe.... [Myasnikov] We have today entered an entirely new historical period, and we need to look at this with open eyes. China's rate of development is outstripping that of Russia. Although many people have yet to recognize this, we will have to build a new model of relations with China. A particular feature of this model is the fact that China is today the world's third economic power, and the decline in production in Russia is continuing. I do not believe that Russia will in a year or two in a sudden spurt catch up with and overtake China. Russia is not today, thank God, confronted with the task of catching up and overtaking--its task is that of survival. It is under these conditions that the new model of relations will take shape. Full consideration of the national interests of Russia and the civilization features of both Russia and China are needed here, therefore, as are very well considered measures for the economic development of our Far East and Siberian oblasts that abut China. The book "21st Century--Age of Chinese Civilization" has just been published by the Renmin Chubanshe official publishers. A very interesting book, which says that Chinese civilization is superior to other civilizations in terms of the essential characteristics, humanitarian parameters primarily, contained in it. And this will ensure China's triumph in the 21st century on a world scale. Without bloody clashes and without wars, mankind will be forced to acknowledge the superiority of Chinese civilization. [Vinogradov] And if it does not so acknowledge it without wars and clashes? [Myasnikov] I realize that this could, perhaps, be an extreme viewpoint. But such viewpoints reflect a growth of national self-awareness connected with economic growth, with the growth of the might of the country and China's new world role. This is the first point. Second, such forecasts usually appear in periods of a millennium--a change in the span of 1,000 years. Some are filled with eschatological sentiments: The end of the world is nigh, others, on the contrary, see new horizons. I believe that the horizons of the 21st century are, truly, visible and that many of its parameters may be imagined quite realistically even today. And China will, of course, perform a principal role in the world arena as an economically, politically, and, yes, culturally most powerful state.... [Vinogradov] Militarily also, I believe.... [Myasnikov] I proceed from the fact that military factors will be on the wane in the 21st century. Nonetheless, competition will develop primarily according to economic and cultural indicators. In addition, China has one strategic trump card, which was planned by Mao Zedong even and, perhaps, by earlier rulers also--the size of its population. I do not believe that it will diminish appreciably in the 21st century. [Vinogradov] We need to take account also of the upcoming unification with Hong Kong and, possibly, with Taiwan. In addition, there is Singapore, where ethnic Chinese constitute 70 percent of the population. [Myasnikov] Yes, the Great China idea. If these countries' GNP's are added together, the result will be a supergiant. [Vinogradov] There are, in addition, the huaqiao scattered throughout the world.... [Myasnikov] The huaqiao mean relations with the whole world. Plus a compact Chinese economic community furnished with all the latest achievements of Western civilization and aware, what is more, of its messianic role, if you will, in bringing the whole of the rest of the world closer not to Protestant morals but to Confucian values. Let us look at the Europeans, the Americans. After all, many of them are enraptured by East Asian civilization and culture. Those who know and perceive it. Adaptation is taking place quite easily here also. I believe, therefore, that the talk about the possible disintegration of China at the national or economic, provincial, administrative level--these are all hopes which are, perhaps, desired, but which are unrealistic. Chinese civilization has in the four millennia of its existence and written history proven its exceptional capacity for survival.
