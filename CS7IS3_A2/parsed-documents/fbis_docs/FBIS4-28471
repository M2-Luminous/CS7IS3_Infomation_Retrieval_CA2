Commenting on this, a top Foreign Ministry official stated on 9 June that, the report "does not correctly describe the stance of the Japanese Government." He stressed the Japanese Government is positively taking part in all international negotiations to persuade North Korea to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including trilateral talks with the ROK and the United States.
