"The data of sociological research undertaken on the initiative of the European Union and carried out by the Sociology Department of the Yerevan State University testify to this," Lyudmila Arutyunyan, head of the department, told a correspondent of the NOYAN TALAN Agency. The analysis was conducted on the basis of the responses to 10 questions, which affords an opportunity to draw a conclusion as to the extent to which democratic principles are observed in this country. Whereas in 1993 some 30 percent of those polled in Armenia responded to the question: "With which country do you link your hopes?" that they were counting "on themselves," more than 30, on Russia, and fewer than 30 percent, on Europe, in 1994, according to the results of the poll, 72 percent link their hopes with the Russian Federation, and only 4 percent are, as before, counting on themselves. To the question as to whether human rights are respected in the country, 19 percent answered in the affirmative, 81 percent, negative. On the whole, affection for the United States has diminished, having come to be replaced by a positive attitude toward the European Community. The sociological research undertaken by the European Union ("Eurobarometer") has been carried out in all countries of East Europe, and of the CIS countries, in Ukraine, the European part of Russia, Belarus, and Armenia.
