The prince welcomed the Vietnamese foreign minister's visit to Cambodia, considering it a new step toward reinforcing the mutual understanding and the relations of friendship between the two countries. In his reply, H.E. Ngyuen Manh Cam recalled the traditional relations between Vietnam and Cambodia as well as the traditional struggle conducted by the two peoples for their own independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. He also spoke about Vietnam's past economic, social, and diplomatic achievements and the country's efforts to promote fine relations with its neighbors and other countries with a view to strengthening regional stability. H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam said Vietnam can never forget Cambodia's support and assistance in the 1960's. He thanked His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman for his policy toward the Vietnamese people's struggle. He was confident that under the king's leadership, Cambodia would successfully achieve national reconciliation and peace and have good relations with its neighbors. He reaffirmed that Vietnam always respects Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and wants to have harmonious relations and cooperation with the latter for the sake of the two countries' interests. Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut promised to present the invitation for the king to visit Vietnam soon. In the meeting, the two sides discussed the border issue and the issue of Vietnamese immigrants and decided to set up two processes. The first is to establish the border negotiation framework in order to turn the Cambodian-Vietnamese border into a border of lasting peace and friendship so as to ensure security along the border. On this issue, the prince said discussion over the matter should be based on the Kingdom of Cambodia's border of the 1960's that was recognized by Vietnam and certain other countries and in the spirit of the 23 October 1991 Paris accord, which has a clause stipulating that every agreement concluded before 23 October 1991 and contrary to the spirit of the Paris accord concerning Cambodia's sovereignty should be considered null and void. Concerning the second process for determining the status of Vietnamese immigrants, the prince said the issue of the immigrants will be examined after the Cambodian National Assembly has adopted an immigration law and that it will be resolved according to international law and practice. The two sides jointly denounced past violence against the Vietnamese immigrants. They also discussed the issue of a Mekong committee and concurred that exploitation of the Mekong River should be conducted based on unanimous agreement; this is in the interests of all countries with access to the river.
