FR941205-2-00068 FR941205-2-00043 (b) Each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund which have a total net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client Plan's pro rata share of the assets of the CIF on the date of the transfer, based on the current market value of the CIF's assets, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner at the close of the same business day, using independent sources in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act and the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a-7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&I. (c) A second fiduciary who is independent of and unrelated to M&I (the Second Fiduciary) receives advance written notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure of information concerning the Funds (including a current prospectus for each of the Funds and a statement describing the fee structure) and, on the basis of such information, authorizes in writing the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a corresponding Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. (d) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of the proposed exemption in the Federal Register , M&I sends by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after completion of the transaction, containing the following information: (1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4); (2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and (3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. (e) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of the proposed exemption in the Federal Register , M&I sends by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a written confirmation that contains the following information: (1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and (2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares.
