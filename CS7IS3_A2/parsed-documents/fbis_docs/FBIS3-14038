She called on the Security Council to take a firm stand in this connection. In a statement to AL-HAYAH before leaving Medina, Bhutto said that the international community has a moral responsibility to ease the suffering of unarmed civilians in Kashmir. Their plight is the same as that of other Muslims throughout the world such as the Somalis, the Bosnians, and the Burmese. She pointed out that Pakistan has urged international organizations to intervene for the recognition of the Kashmir people's right to self-determination. She accused the Indian Government of dithering on this issue in order to maintain its occupation of Kashmir despite the mounting opposition to Indian rule among the majority of the population. She said that "the genocide operations carried out by the Indian forces against the Muslim population coincide with the persecution of Muslims by the Hindus. These moves are a prelude to a plan to impose Indian hegemony on the region." She warned that the "apparent failure of the international community will charge sentiment in the Islamic world." Bhutto stressed that her country was making global diplomatic efforts in support of the principles of human rights, regardless of the legal aspects, and in support of the principles of the Geneva Convention for the prevention of massacres and the punishment of perpetrators. She asked: "Will the people of Kashmir meet the same fate as the Bosnians, who are the target of premeditated liquidation?" She added that "the struggle of the people of Kashmir is based on the quest for freedom, which is a legitimate demand in all civilized societies." She reaffirmed Pakistan's moral and material support "for the struggle of the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir." *
