The helicopter was forced to return to base despite the fact that advance notice of its flight had been given to the UN Protection Force. The act is incomprehensible, the statement says, because the Croatian side has made it clear that it would support all humanitarian actions -- something which it recently confirmed in practice when it allowed a Muslim aid convoy to pass through territory controlled by the HVO.
