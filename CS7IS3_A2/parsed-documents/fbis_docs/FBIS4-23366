PAC Western Cape Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said an anti-election faction within the movement had accused PAC bodyguards of collaborating with the system and had threatened to kill them. Conflict within the security structures of the movement started long before the elections when PAC youths, who had been sent to Transkei for military training, returned to their respective regions with an anti-election attitude, he said. They had been sent for training to protect the rank and file supporters of the movement during the elections. Mr Lugulwana said the youths were apparently politically indoctrinated by some influential leaders of the PAC in Transkei who were opposed to the elections.
