Instead, she intends to try to catch the pernicious bird. Regarding the bird (the cuckoo, in particular)--this is a quote from the angry verbiage unleashed by Larisa Pavlovna at a postelection press conference in Lviv. As most of those who lost personally, she is firmly convinced that elections were lost by the democratic forces, completely and wholesale. And the party at fault for this is the same, in the former deputy's opinion, as the one that is always at fault for everything--Chornovil's Rukh. With a far-reaching hint at behind-the-scenes intrigues, she proposed to "figure out" who was the cuckoo who slipped an egg into the friendly democratic nest, which later produced a nasty chick who pushed everyone else out of the nest--the Rukh Party... The scandal continues in the electoral district where L. Skoryk and A. Gudyma (a Rukh candidate) ran. As already reported, the district electoral commission invalidated the elections. The Central Electoral Commission [CEC] has not yet handed down a decision. The Rukh oblast organization adopted a statement of no confidence in the head of the district electoral commission and is protesting against electing him as commission chairman at the upcoming elections of local bodies of authority. Meanwhile, Larisa Skoryk and the district commission insist that propaganda in favor of the candidate and a put-down of his opponent were conducted on television during pre-election Saturday, and they are ready to defend this opinion in the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Gudyma has turned to the CBU [Ukraine Security Service]: He says that during his absence (attending the Rukh congress in Kiev), unknown persons called his home and threatened him and his family. The "burp" from the recent elections may add a few unsavory details to the above. A claim has been filed in court against People's Deputy Mikhail Kosiv. The same district commission of the same district believes that he publicly accused it of dishonesty. Thereby insulting its honor and dignity. The KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], meanwhile, is appealing to the CEC, questioning the results of elections in another district... Rukh's ill-fated television broadcast has brushed a KUN candidate as well. The most interesting part is that there actually is a winner in this district, and not just anybody, but Rukh's deputy head Aleksandr Lavronovych. Based on the above, it seems questionable that any real bloc of more or less centrist, more or less democratic forces will be fielded at the local elections. Nevertheless, right now the need for this is being proclaimed rather loudly. People who have tried so hard not to quarrel with extremists have finally stooped to using phrases like "extreme right danger," and so on. The local Rukh and oblast authorities said this. They said it frankly. There are reasons, they said: imperial-communist, national-democratic, and extreme right. And while in the eastern part of Ukraine the situation is defined by the confrontation between the first and the second, in the western part it is between the second and the third. It has been said. Albeit a little late... The "heroes" of UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense], who acquired legitimacy thanks to breaking into the deputy ranks, called up a rally a few days ago. They exhorted the voters to come to the local elections under the juicy slogan: "UNA to power, UNSO--go storming, traitors to be impaled on a spike!" Rallies are not in fashion today. So this one, much like the others, only featured a gathering of a small group of, to put it mildly, customarily unbalanced persons. But that is not the point. The authorities of our fantastic state are still doing something incomprehensible. For instance, law enforcement organs of Zhitomir and Lviv in tandem whipped up a case: A year ago UNSO member Pavlyuk knocked off some protruding parts from Lenin's monument in a factory garden in Zhitomir. Now he is being extradited with fanfare from Lviv to the site of commission of the crime. Here he is, a ready hero-martyr so much needed by the Bolshevik movement; here it is--a case one can milk emotionally for a long time... The funny part is that numerous transgressions by these goons that do indeed require punishment have gone unpunished. While a semi-anecdotal, outdated both in terms of timing and subject, is being blown out of proportion. Complete stupidity? Or, on the contrary, design? The local elections in Galicia promise to be tense. As to the second round of elections in three "open" Supreme Council districts, there is one almost-sensation. At the aforementioned press conference Larisa Skoryk suddenly said that she would not run for a second time even if she were granted such right in the event the elections in her district are deemed invalid. She is so unhappy with those already elected that she decided to follow the Bible: Blessed is he who does not go to the council of the profane... There is a temptation to explain this away as a woman's emotional outburst, but would such an explanation not be too frivolous? Lady Larisa is a person who is extremely close to presidential circles. Just yesterday she conducted her campaign with energy and drive. What has changed? Has someone made the decision that the new Supreme Council is stillborn anyway?...
