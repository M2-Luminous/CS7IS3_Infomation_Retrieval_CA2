The Palace of the Herons was the site for the signature of this important document, during a ceremony headed by President Guillermo Endara Galimany. The Chapultepec Declaration is the product of an historic hemispheric conference held at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City on 11 March 1994. It includes 10 principles, which establish that freedom of expression is a right. It also points out that the media and journalists must not be the object of discrimination or favors because of what they may or may not say or write. The declaration points out that the credibility of the media is linked to its commitment to truth, the search for accuracy, impartiality, and fairness in the information being released. [Begin recording] [LA PRENSA Director Roberto Eisenmann] It is said that freedom of expression is the mother of all freedoms. I want to tell you, colleagues, that the president of the Republic, is not signing this document for simple protocol. We can testify that he has personally studied the document. He has consulted us, he has thought it out very well because we know of his deep convictions regarding freedom of expression. [EL PANAMA AMERICA Director Rosario Arias de Galindo] This document is especially important because of the events in our recent history. We hope to be able to understand it so as never to allow our freedom of expression to be taken away. [end recording] President Guillermo Endara Galimany, when delivering his speech, said the ceremony was a protocol event because Panamanians enjoy freedom of expression and democracy. [Begin Endara recording] I have respected freedom of expression. It has hurt me, I must confess it. The use of this freedom has hurt me, but the injury to government officials in general, not only myself, can never cause us to say that because it hurts us we will not allow the media to make use of its freedom of expression. A democratic president has the duty of defending this freedom no matter how much power he may have, including constitutional and legal powers. A democratic president must tolerate, as Panamanians say, he has to resist it. [end recording] The president of the Republic noted that freedom of expression has to be defended at all costs and he said he was optimistic the new government will respect that right. [Begin Endara recording] Despite certain doubts we may have had, I have the conviction that the new government will respect freedom of expression, but if it does not respect it -- and I do think it will respect it -- we all have the duty, including myself, to take to the streets to defend freedom of expression. [end recording] At the conclusion of the ceremony, the participants agreed that the Declaration of Chapultepec, which places an emphasis on freedom of expression, is a key element for strengthening democracy.
