FR940407-0-00066 FR940407-0-00014 2. Program Baseline The determination of a program baseline is the first step in projecting program results. Results from EIP's can be projected in terms of quantifiable emissions reductions, or, in the case of directionally-sound programs, in terms of other emission-related parameters. Further, some types of incentive strategies depend upon the establishment of a program baseline, in terms of a level of mass emissions or emission-related parameter(s), for each affected source or aggregated overall affected sources, as a starting point for the incentive program mechanism. For example, a marketable emissions permit program could be initialized by a program baseline that allocates to each source a cap on mass emissions that serves as its starting point for any emissions trading transactions or future emissions reductions requirements. For other types of programs, this program baseline could be defined in terms of emission-related parameters, such as average emission rates, solvent content, or vehicle ridership factors. 3. Nondiscriminatory Section 182(g)(4) provides that statutory EIP's must be ``nondiscriminatory'' and must be ``consistent with applicable law regarding interstate commerce.'' The EPA interprets these requirements to mean that a statutory EIP must not discriminate in favor of intrastate commerce and against interstate commerce. In addition, an EIP must meet any other applicable limitations under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. For example, State taxes must meet the requirements, to the extent applicable to the tax, set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977). There, the Court stated that a State tax will pass scrutiny under the Commerce Clause only if ``the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.'' Id. at 279. Under the EPA's interpretation, Congress did not intend, by the provisions authorizing EIP's, either statutory or discretionary, to delegate its authority under the Commerce Clause to the States, and thereby release State EIP's from the limitations that would apply under the Commerce Clause had Congress not specifically authorized the EIP; rather, Congress intended to maintain those limitations. C. State Program Election and Submittal The mandated schedules for the development, submittal, review/approval, and implementation of statutory EIP's, submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act, may leave as little as 6 months for the EIP to be operational prior to the next milestone requirement. Thus, in these cases, the time available to develop, implement, and achieve emissions reductions from an EIP will be extremely limited if a State waits until a milestone failure occurs to initiate the selection and development of a statutory EIP. As a result, the EPA encourages States to initiate development of an EIP as soon as they determine that a milestone failure is likely, or even sooner, as part of their SIP. States are encouraged to consider inclusion of discretionary EIP's, where appropriate, in the SIP's (or SIP revisions) due within the first 4 years after enactment of the amended Act (e.g., sections 182 (b)(1) and (c)(2), 187(a)(1)). Submittal at that time would more likely allow sufficient time to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the program. If such an early EIP submittal is made, States must account for the effects of the EIP in any subsequent required SIP submittals. Nothing in today's notice precludes a State from revisiting and amending its original EIP, or any other pre-existing rules, as necessary, to ensure consistency with any subsequent required SIP submittals. The requirements of section 182(g)(3) and 182(g)(5) of the Act apply any time that a State fails to submit an adequate milestone compliance showing, or when the EPA determines that a milestone has been missed by an area covered by these provisions. For example, if such a milestone is not met by a serious or severe O 3 nonattainment area, the area may elect among three options, including an EIP. The Act does not provide any additional or different requirements that would apply when a State that missed one milestone, and makes a proper election, misses a subsequent milestone. Accordingly, if a subsequent milestone is missed, the same choices are available, including the election of an EIP. Thus, the imposed requirements or specified options apply not only the first time that a milestone is missed, but also if subsequent milestones are missed even if an EIP had previously been implemented. Similarly, the EPA interprets section 187(g) (requiring serious CO nonattainment areas that fail to attain to adopt an EIP) as applying even if the area previously missed a milestone and adopted an EIP pursuant to section 187(d)(3). A second missed-milestone program must provide reductions beyond the reductions from a first statutory program. The second EIP may either be a new program or a substantive revision of the first program. D. State Program Requirements Under today's rules, EIP's must be State and federally enforceable; nondiscriminatory (with respect to interstate commerce); and consistent with the timely attainment and maintenance of NAAQS, all applicable RFP and visibility requirements, applicable PSD increments, and all other applicable requirements of the Act. Programs in nonattainment areas for which credit is taken in attainment and RFP demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the effects of the program are quantifiable and that the credit taken is limited to that which is surplus to other SIP-credited requirements. Statutory EIP's must be designed to result in quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions.
