[Siradeghyan] I know one thing with certainty: The dissolution of that agency can at least help the investigative bodies. The investigation of the assassination of [former Armenian KGB chief Marius] Yuzbashyan will now probably move forward. That agency was supposed to help in the investigation of that assassination but did nothing--indeed it "put it to sleep." An investigative team has been created which incorporates the Ministry of the Interior, the SANS and the prosecutor's office. One day after Yuzbashyan's burial, his wife--who was a SANS major--fled to Moscow. She is the last person who saw Yuzbashyan alive. It is still not known whether the wife offered any assistance. That investigation was frozen one day after Yuzbashyan's burial. I am deeply convinced that that "soyuzni" [allied] KGB (I do not say Armenia's KGB) purged its own former chief who knew much about the beginnings of the Karabakh movement and who knew many people. Let me also mention that Yuzbashyan was killed by a single shot, but several empty shells were left at the assassination site to give the impression that there were several shots. They killed Ashot Sargsyan with a single shot with the same skill, the same boldness and the same cowardice. Thus the dissolution of the SANS was essential. As for the appointment of Davit Shahnazaryan, let me say that for this work it was necessary to appoint a man in whom the president has full confidence. There was no other alternative.
