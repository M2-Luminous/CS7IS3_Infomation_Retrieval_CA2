FBIS4-13452 "drnes076_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Rabin Ready To Go Beyond IDF Recommendation Rabin Ready To Go Beyond IDF Recommendation TA1904145894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1400 GMT 19 Apr 94 TA1904145894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that he is ready for a greater withdrawal on the Golan than that recommended by the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff. The prime minister's statement was made in reply to a question from Knesset Member [MK] Beni Begin. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the prime minister stressed that the working paper he received from Major General Ilan Biran did not refer to a total IDF withdrawal from the Golan. Also at today's Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee session, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, said the regular troops are in a difficult situation, because all the men are tied up in operational activity in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Rabin noted that instead of the planned six months of training, the regular troops were barely receiving three months, and if the situation continues, the level of preparedness will be affected. The prime minister added that there are many friction-prone sites in Hebron, which are liable to lead to a conflagration. For that reason, the best units are tied up in that location. [A related report by Tamar Asalem on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 April adds: "The prime minister said that Jordan may not attend the Washington talks because of the naval blockade imposed by the United States on al-'Aqabah. He believes, however, that an agreement with Jordan will be possible only after one is achieved with Syria. ["Discussing the Syrian issue, the prime minister stated that there is a principle of international presence on the Golan, but he did not specify the nature of the presence. The prime minister added that all decisions would be made by the political echelons, and all publicized documents merely represent the process of data gathering and preparatory work. ["MK Beni Begin told the prime minister that he understood that the General Staff recommendations specified a smaller withdrawal area than Rabin found acceptable. Rabin's simple reply: Yes. There is no argument that in the military sense, the present line is better than any line lying farther to the west, but our work is based on a certain political reality."]
