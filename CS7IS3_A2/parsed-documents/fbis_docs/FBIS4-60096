Security Men Kill Student in Asyut LAWYER TORTURED TO DEATH An approximately 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages 1 and 7 describes the "state of anger and furor" that gripped lawyers following the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani during "torture" at a State Security Intelligence office following his arrest on 26 April. An emergency meeting of the Lawyers Association Council on 7 May decided to report the incident to the public attorney to order an autopsy on Madani's body to determine the cause of death. In addition, the council decided to "stage a sit-in at the association's headquarters until an inquiry is opened and the names of the culprits announced, to hold a funeral march for the martyr from the association's building, to declare a one-day public strike at every state court, and to pay a sum to the martyr's family in compensation." A statement by the council warned that the crime will not go unpunished. The Egyptian Human Rights Organization has issued a statement expressing concern and regret at the circumstances surrounding the death of its member, Madani. The statement feared that the death could have been the result of "torture" following his arrest. The organization gave its account of how Madani was arrested at his office and of the "illegal and repressive measures" used during the arrest. The deceased, the statement noted, was blindfolded by security men and taken to an unknown destination. After noting that his colleagues confirmed that Madani had been in "good health," the statement referred to its request to the public attorney on 7 May to set up an independent medical team to conduct an autopsy on Madani's body. ISLAMISTS WIN LAWYERS ELECTION An approximately 100-word unattributed report on page one reports the victory of named Islamic candidates in elections to fill half the seats of the Lawyers Association Council in al-Jizah on 8 May. The turnout is said to have been over 75 percent. ANTI-ISLAMIC QUARTERS BEHIND YEMEN'S WAR Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in a 2,500-word article on page 3 entitled "The Desert Storm Reaches Yemen," views the war in Yemen. Noting that the Gulf war was a "link in a chain to rechart the map of the Arab region to confront the Islamic tide, Husayn adds that the "Western camp and its advocates in the region continue to reshape the region and finish off the Arab-Islamic front that has rejected the foreign military presence." After reviewing aspects of what is seen as a Western onslaught on Islamic movements in Tunis, Algeria, Lebanon, and Sudan, Husayn says: "Yemen is now paying the price of its independence," because, the writer adds, it seems that the United States "accepts nothing short of obedience, blind obedience." After tracing the course of Yemen's unity and the Islamists' participation in power through the alliance between the General People's Congress and the Reform Party, Husayn claims that as a result, Yemen became an "aberration" of the U.S. order imposed on the region, in view of Yemen's independence and the Islamists' participation in power, which could lead them to win by a majority in any election and thus rule the country singlehanded. As a result, he adds, the Marxists of the south were encouraged by some Gulf quarters and the United States to stiffen their position, even if it led to a separation from the north. He adds: Dividing Yemen into two states is the West's "ultimate goal." Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur echoes the same theme in part of his approximately 2,000-word article on page 5. He asks: "What promoted south Yemen to conclude unity with north Yemen four years ago? And why is it adopting this stance today, a stance that could bring unity to an end?" He adds: "We know there are quarters that want to fragment the Arab and Islamic world and preclude any unity. These quarters move other hands to stir sedition among the Arab peoples, as was the case in Somalia, where thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced." 4 MAY DAY OF MOURNING FOR PALESTINE Writer Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh, in an approximately 1,200-word article on page 4 entitled "A Day of Mourning by Arabism And Islam for Palestine", writes on the self-rule agreement signed between the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 4 May. He notes that the 4 May agreement is not the choice of the Islamic people, who believe that Palestine is Islamic and who have faith that jihad is the way to liberate and restore it. He adds: "We must realize that our enemy knows for certain that the threat to its usurpation of Palestine comes from the pan-Arab current as well as the rising Islamic tide, and that is why it is lying in wait against these two forces." Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur shares Abu-al-Futuh's views in his article on page 5. He notes that the Gaza-Jericho agreement has been depicted as a "historic victory" for the PLO, whereas in fact it is an utter "disgrace, shame, and humiliation." He points out that the record of the "Zionist enemy" is replete with incidents against peace, so how could there be peace between it and the Palestinian people? He concludes by urging the current Muslim generations not to be duped by the peace "festivals" aimed at giving legitimacy to the "humiliating defeat" in this agreement. Palestine, he adds, will remain alive in the hearts of every Muslim until it is fully liberated and the al-Aqsa Mosque rescued from captivity. BAN ON ISLAMIC WRITER BLAMED ON PRESIDENT In an approximately 600-word article on page 12, Muslim Brotherhood member and writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus notes that Islamic writer Fahmy Huwaydi's weekly articles in AL-AHRAM are still banned. After noting that the ban shames the newspaper itself and discredits the regime's claims that it does not ban any writer or opinion, 'Abd-al-Quddus points out that a review of some of the banned articles he has seen shows that the ban is sheer injustice. One of the articles, he says, speaks about the application of Islamic Shari'ah in Kuwait, in which the writer cautioned against any hasty implementation of Islamic rulings since this could be harmful to Islam. Another banned article, 'Abd-al-Quddus adds, notes the defeat of secularism in Turkey on its home grounds at the hands of the Islamists. Defending Huwaydi, the writer notes that the prominent Islamic writer is accused of being extremist, but his views in defense of the Copts and democracy attest to the contrary. He adds: "I believe that banning his articles is not the responsibility of the chief editor alone, since the owner of the newspaper has greater responsibility--and by the owner I mean the head of state, who owns AL-AHRAM as well as other government papers and who makes appointments there." He notes that it is clear that "the president of the republic does not encourage any talk about the application of shari'ah in our country; in fact, the contrary is definitely true. The prevailing tendency under the current regime is to try to separate religion and the state." In conclusion, the writer gives the following advice to the president: "Beware of those who seek to deify you. They are the ones responsible for 'Abd-al-Nasir and al-Sadat's drift. Remember your first years in power, when you were very sensitive to anything that could tarnish your image among the people, rejected hypocrisy, and viewed your birthday as a personal occasion and not an opportunity to glorify yourself." Touching on the same topic, writer Midhat Abu-al-Fadl notes in his approximately 1,500-word article on page 8 that there is a "coordinated media campaign seeking to exclude moderate Islamists from public work or to harass them, if possible. This campaign is now focusing on the well-known Islamic writer Fahmi Huwaydi." He notes that the secularists in charge of this campaign use all means, legitimate and otherwise, to attain their goals, which shows that to the secularists freedom of opinion is nothing but a slogan. He cites as an example an article by writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan published in the magazine UKTUBAR on 1 May, in which Ramadan accused Huwaydi of defending terrorism. After refuting Ramadan's claims, Abu-al-Fadl says that Ramadan is inciting the authorities against a man whose only fault is using his right of freedom of speech. ROOTS OF VIOLENCE IN DAYRUT ANALYZED An approximately 3,000-word report by Jamal Imbabi on page 6 views the situation in the city of Dayrut, with its violence between security forces and Islamic groups. The writer interviews several officials and citizens, who give opinions of the roots of violence in the city, which is situated 60 km north of Asyut. Former People's Assembly deputy Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahim believes that the ruling National Democratic Party has kept itself busy with partisan affairs and left the way open to the Islamic militants to build clinics, schools, and Koranic recitation centers and to organize religious seminars. In the absence of a state role, these groups helped the poor and assisted students. Thanks to the political vacuum, many accepted their beliefs, 'Abd-al-Rahim adds. Another former People's Assembly member, Husam al-Kilani, attributes the spread of these groups and the rise in violence to unemployment and a deterioration in the standards of living. Teacher Ibrahim Zayid blames the violence on police brutality and mistreatment of people. The writer notes that despite the relative calm in the city of Dayrut, security sources say that 13 senior members of the group are still at large. According to the chief of intelligence in Dayrut, once they are captured, 80 percent of violence in the city will end, since it will be very hard for the group to find similar experienced people. MUFTI'S FATWA ON CHILD CARE CRITICIZED A 200-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7 criticizes Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the republic, for passing what the writer terms a "strange" fatwa, or religious ruling. The mufti ruled that it is permissible for the state "to enact a law withholding medical care and educational benefits from the family's third child as part of its family planning campaign." According to the mufti, "The officials in charge may restrict what is permissible if the ruler and officials see a need for this after consulting with the experts, so long as the restriction serves the nation's interests." SECURITY MEN KILL STUDENT IN ASYUT An unattributed report on page 7 notes that State Security Intelligence men shot Amin Shafiq Hammam, a student in al-Azhar University branch in Asyut, after having kidnapped him from his room in the university dormitory on 25 April. A statement by al-Azhar University students in Asyut notes that Hammam was taken in a car to al-Walidiyah neighborhood, where shots were heard. Next day, the students were surprised to read in the papers that Hammam had been killed in a clash with security forces and that he was found to be in possession of weapons and explosives.
