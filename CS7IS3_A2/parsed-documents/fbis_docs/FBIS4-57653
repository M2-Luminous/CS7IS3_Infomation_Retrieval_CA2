Following two working meetings with ministers charged with social issues portfolios, he noted that President Caldera's government should control the crisis in the public's perception of the country's economic problems. He observed that the monetary crisis, for example, is a key issue. It seems to be following a kind of plot that engenders a lack of confidence in the current administration. Enrique Iglesias explained that other countries have experienced worse situations and overcome them with fewer resources. He is therefore "reasonably optimistic" that Venezuela will be able to "manage the crisis" and overcome difficulties. Iglesias praised the government team's economic guidelines. He believes that the budget and tax policy, in conjunction with incentives for private investment, are enough to achieve economic balance. The Finance Ministry is coping effectively with the core of the problem, which is the fiscal issue, in an effort to balance the economy. Also, guidelines are being drafted so that relations between the private sector and the government will be consistent. This year, the IDB will invest 50 percent of its funds earmarked for social projects in Venezuela. This sum is over $300 million. Regarding IDB conditions for the loans, the IDB president explained that the feasibility and profitability of the projects will not be the most important concern but that each project will be discussed with the head of each ministry. The resources will be used in three fundamental areas: health, housing, sanitation, and potable water works. An urban transportation plan designed to improve the highway infrastructure in several states of the country is being contemplated. The program, which will be cofinanced by the IDB and the nation's private sector, will have an accompanying plan for maintaining the country's principal highways. Overall investment in the health plans will be $300 million, of which 50 percent will be contributed by the IDB and the other half by the national government. Health Minister Carlos Walter, member of the social cabinet, explained that the money will be used to decentralize medical services, restructure the Health Ministry, and implement health education plans. He explained that the resources will not be used to equip hospitals, as he feels it is necessary first to restructure the health system in order to improve services. In this regard, Iglesias added that "before spending," it is necessary "to improve the impact of what will be spent. This will be achieved by making the central administration more efficient."
