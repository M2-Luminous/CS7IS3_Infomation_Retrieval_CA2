FR940830-0-00011 FR940830-0-00004 The Act increased the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons and changed the eligibility for producers to serve on the Board. The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision clarifies the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group and also applies to voter eligibility. In addition, the increase in the exemption level from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' will determine producer's eligibility to vote because only producers of 10 acres or more will be eligible to vote in the referendum. Therefore, this rule will amend §§1210.201 and 1210.202. The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Therefore, since they will be covered by the Plan, voters in Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia are entitled to vote in the referendum. This rule will amend §1210.201 accordingly. The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act will now allow referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which will reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule will amend §§1210.203 and 1210.204. Minor changes are made in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. In addition, conforming changes will be made to §1210.201. After consideration of all relevant material presented with regard to the procedures to conduct a referendum, it is found that they effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to the provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) A proposed rule with request for comments was published in the Federal Register and comments were received and they are addressed in this rule; (2) It is necessary to have these procedures in place in order to conduct the referendum in November 1994; and (3) No useful purpose will be served by a delay of the effective date.
