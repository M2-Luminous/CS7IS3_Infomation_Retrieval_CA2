KEA wants to complete its talks with the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) by the middle of February and finish company talks before the end of March, Hwang said. "As the government has set this year's goal at strengthening international competitiveness of the nation and has a strong will to control prices, price hikes will not be so considerable a reason for wage increases," he predicted. Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok and Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui told FKTU Chairman Pak Chong-kon on Saturday [8 January] that the government intends to control prices, and Pak said FKTU will seek to end its wage negotiations with KEA as early as possible if prices are controlled. KEA will draw up wage demands by the middle of this month and select negotiators to meet with FKTU late this month. "Government, management and labor met in October and agreed to change ties between management and labor to autonomous and cooperative," an FKTU spokesman said. "Moreover, workers share the view that increasing competitiveness is the only way for Korea to survive in a competitive international arena." KEA and FKTU agreed on a unified wage hike plan in April for the first time.
