This is an important step which we have taken toward inhibiting inflation in consideration of the general interests of reform, development, and stability. By following the State Council's policy decision, the general inspection of commodity prices has scored initial results across the country over the past two months or so. The following are some main achievements: 1. A deeper understanding has been gained of the necessity to exercise regulation and control of prices under market economy conditions. During the general inspection of commodity prices, the State Planning Commission and the Propaganda Department have organized a propaganda campaign through the mass media with the main theme of deepening reform, intensifying regulation and control, and advancing the wholesome development of the market. We have widely publicized and elaborated on several viewpoints through the news media. For instance, the view that the decontrol of prices does not mean the completion of reform, laissez-faire policies should not be applied to the market prices, and the creation of the price mechanism through the market requires the deepening of reform in various aspects; and the view that the establishment of a sound price regulation and control system is an important part of the shaping of a socialist market economic structure. By systematically publicizing and implementing all the price regulation and control measures, the party and the government have proved they are really concerned about the public's livelihood and are striving hard to manage commodity prices in accordance with the latest development of the socialist market economy. Local leading comrades have realized that the price regulation and control is one of the government's important functions and producers and traders have realized that independent pricing does not mean that the state's supervision and control of prices are void. 2. The inspection of commodity prices has expedited implementation of all the price regulation and control measures formulated by the state. Some localities have already set up their grain marketing risk funds and nonstaple foodstuff price regulation funds. The marked price system has basically become a common practice among state-owned and collective-run retail shops and executive government organs which render services for fees and substantial progress has been made in introducing the marked price system among private enterprises and individual retail stalls. The state has formulated and promulgated the specific procedures for monitoring the prices of daily necessities and services and local authorities have expanded their price monitoring network to cover vegetables, medicines, salable residential flats, hairdressing services, bath house services, and so on, according to their local circumstances. Shanghai Municipality has taken the lead in formulating and promulgating the "Interim Regulations Against Price Cheating and Staggering Profits" and the "Detailed Procedures Governing Investigation and Handling of Cases of Staggering Profits Related to the Entertainment Business, Catering Industry, Clothing, and Mechanical and Electrical Products," which have played a positive role in curbing the practice of seeking staggering profits and in protecting the consumers' interests. These have been appreciated and endorsed by the public. Shenzhen City has lifted restrictions on the wholesale dealings in vegetables and pork and exercised control of the price margin in retail sales. This has not only ensured reasonable profit margins for the traders but also protected the producers' and consumers' interests. 3. A number of cases of violation of laws related to commodity prices have been investigated and handled. Incomplete statistics show that a total of over 190,000 cases of violation of laws related to commodity prices were investigated across the country from 10 March to 10 May. The amount of ill-gotten gains involved in these cases totaled nearly 400 million yuan. Over 100,000 of these cases have already been handled and the amount of fines resulting therefrom came to more than 88 million yuan. Of the cases involving malpractices, more than 41,000 are related to basic daily necessities, over 4,800 are related to the prices of monopolized capital goods, more than 2,700 involved prices of agricultural means of production, and more than 8,100 cases were related to charges for public utilities and services. Through the investigation and handling of cases of violation of price control laws, the trend of arbitrary price increases and unreasonable service charges is being checked. 4. The general inspection of commodity prices has caused the producers and traders to intensify self-regulation of prices. Through the investigation and handling of cases of violation of the state's price-control laws, enterprises have been guided to observe the principle of legal operation, fair transaction, and equal competition, and producers and traders have realized that legal pricing behavior is the principle that must be observed by enterprises when they are marching toward the market. At the same time, the enterprises have been helped to establish and improve the price control system and heighten their sense of self-restraint regarding pricing. Shandong Province has extensively introduced a sound self-restraint mechanism regarding pricing, the core of which is the appointment of price monitors and the establishment of five systems (specifically, the accounting system, the decision-making hierarchy system, the marked price system, the regular price inspection system, and the market survey system). While fully appreciating the achievements made in the general inspection of commodity prices during the previous period, we must also be aware that we have not done an equally good job everywhere else. In just a few localities, people have not thoroughly realized the important significance of the general inspection of commodity prices, so they have acted a little slackly; on the other hand, since the legislation process has lagged behind, management has been inefficient, policies have not been clearly defined, and there has not been sufficient manpower to carry out the inspection. These few localities have been facing great difficulties and obstacles in the investigation and handling of cases of violation of laws related to price controls. All these issues deserve much attention and should be resolved at the next stage through effective measures. Carry Out the General Inspection of Commodity Prices in Depth and In Line With the Principle of Realizing Reform, Development, and Stability in a Balanced Way Reform, opening up, and the economy have kept on developing along a good track since the beginning of this year. All the reformatory measures in the fields of finance and taxation, banking, foreign exchange and foreign trade, and the investment structure have been basically operating well since they were introduced and some of the measures have scored better results than expected. At a time when major reform projects have been presented, economic operations on the whole are gradually developing in a direction in favor of macroeconomic regulation and control. In the first quarter, the GDP increased by 12.7 percent over the same period last year, while the gross industrial output value in January to April increased by 18.4 percent. The financial situation has remained stable and revenue has continued to increase. The net amount of money withdrawn from circulation was 5.07 billion yuan in January to April, an increase of 41.92 billion [amount as published] over the amount of money withdrawn in the same period last year; meanwhile, the financial revenue increased by 22 percent over the same period last year. The foreign trade import-export volume and the state's spot exchange balance continued to increase. In January to April, the total import-export volume increased by 21.2 percent over the same period last year and, meanwhile, the state's spot exchange balance increased by $8.1 billion over the figure at the beginning of the year. The margin of growth in fixed assets investments continued to narrow since efforts were made to intensify the management of extending loans for financing investments in fixed assets, to bring newly started projects under strict control, and to launch a general inspection of investments. In January to April, the value of investments made by state-owned units increased by 38.4 percent over the same period last year, with the growth margin decreasing by 30.5 percentage points as compared with the same period last year. The dramatically rising trend of the general commodity price level has been slowing down in the wake of the implementation of various macroeconomic regulation and control measures and the start of the general inspection of commodity prices. In April, the nationwide retail price index increased by 19.5 percent over the same period last year, with the inflation margin decreasing again by 0.7 percent as compared with that for March. It is expected that the price raises will continue to subside in May and June. However, we should also be aware that the current balance between the aggregate supply and demand is not very secure, some negative factors unfavorable to agricultural production still exist, the threat of inflation is still valid, the price raises are still quite high, and we are still far from our set target in our efforts to bring inflation rate under control. Therefore, we should never show any slackness in our work. To ensure that the set targets are reached in the general inspection of commodity prices while maintaining a balance between reform, development, and stability, in the next stage we must continue to strive to really fulfill the five requirements set out by the State Council: 1. To further implement the price regulation and control measures put forward by the state, speed up the pace in formulating specific measures to introduce the marked price system and the price monitoring system, set up the grain marketing risk fund and the nonstaple foodstuff price regulation fund as soon as possible, and formulate price control laws and regulations. 2. To curb arbitrary price raises and unreasonable service charges for major categories of products and services, stop the practice of raising prices under the pretext of reform, and investigate and handle cases of violation of price-control laws. 3. To continue to publicize typical cases, positive and negative alike, thus giving fuller play to the initiative of the masses and the role of public opinion in monitoring prices. 4. To cause the producers and traders to exercise self-restraint and self-supervision and to heighten their sense of observance of laws and discipline as far as commodity prices are concerned. 5. To make great efforts to ease the price raises and to ensure that inflation continues to slow down. In light of the current economic situation, we must lay stress on the following aspects in our efforts to fulfill the abovementioned five requirements: First, it is necessary to further advance various price reform projects and implement all the regulation and control measures. In the process of the general inspection of commodity prices, we must give a stronger push and guidance to all localities on implementation of all the major measures adopted by the State Council regarding price reform and macroeconomic regulation and control. The establishment of the grain marketing risk fund, the nonstaple foodstuff price regulation fund, and the important commodity reserve system are important measures taken by the state to lower commodity prices through economic means. All localities must establish these systems this year according to the requirements set by the State Council. It is necessary to actively study ways to establish the risk fund system regarding the supply of nonstaple foodstuffs, to gradually improve the economic means for the state to regulate and control commodity prices. The monitoring of prices for basic daily necessities and of service charges is a moderate administrative and guiding measure adopted to prevent decontrol and drastic fluctuation of commodity prices, under the precondition that the enterprise's decisionmaking powers regarding price setting are respected. All localities must formulate special implementation procedures in accordance with their local circumstances. Within the range of commodities and service items that are subject to price monitoring, those put under state control must undergo rigid price adjustment; as for those which are already free of state control, local authorities must, according to the principles laid down by the State Council, formulate specific implementation procedures governing the price adjustment operation reporting and application system, as well as the regulation of price differences and profit margins. It is necessary to make every effort to stabilize the prices of rice, food, and fuel. Second, it is necessary to continue to investigate and curb the practice of arbitrarily raising prices under the pretext of reform. To cope with new cases and new problems which have emerged during implementation of the reform plans regarding finance, taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, investments, and prices, the State Council and departments concerned have already formulated corresponding measures and methods which are now being carried out, step by step. Through the general inspection of commodity prices, we must oversee the producers and traders conscientiously implementing these measures and methods and we will lower prices which have been raised on their own without approval. We must take it as an important task to ensure the smooth implementation of all reform plans, work conscientiously, resolutely stop the practice of marking up prices at every link of the marketing chain, and strictly minimize any chain effects. Cases of lawbreaking behavior, such as raising prices in disregard of state regulations and seeking staggering profits, must be promptly investigated and dealt with severely. Third, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate a market order which encourages open, fair, and just competition. As a result of our efforts during the previous stage, the price disorders have been rectified to a certain extent. However, the phenomena of arbitrarily raising prices and collecting unreasonable service charges are still pretty serious. These are highlighted by the following cases: Some marketing units sell nationwide standard-price commodities at higher prices in disregard of state regulations; some enterprises producing chemical fertilizers and steel products, with their dominance over the market, sell their products at high prices; a small number of industrial and commercial enterprises have joined forces to monopolize the market; some enterprises take advantage of reformatory measures to raise prices; many medical services, education, postal and telecommunication services, and rural power supply sector grass-roots units arbitrarily charge their customers for services; and it is a common phenomenon that some private business owners and hawkers in the catering and garment marketing sectors seek staggering profits by cheating their customers. We should make unremitting efforts to stop these practices, resolutely fight activities contravening price-control laws, and develop a market environment which promotes open, fair, and just competition. We must make further efforts to set up the marked price system and expand it to cover all commodities and services; see that private enterprises, individual producers and traders, and stall owners and hawkers in all market places practice the marked price system; increase the degree of transparency of the pricing process; and we must place pricing under the public's supervision. We must keep integrating the general inspection of commodity prices with investigations and study. We should further analyze the causes contributing to price disorder in light of the problems exposed in the general inspection of commodity prices, draw lessons from our past experience, check out loopholes, formulate in good time some measures to intensify price regulation and control, and establish and improve the regulations and systems concerned. With the aim of establishing the socialist market economic structure, we must speed up legislation regarding price controls; step up the formulation of the "price law"; formulate antitrust, antistaggering-profit, and anticheating laws and regulations; set standards to regulate pricing behaviors; and draw up the "price monitoring and inspection regulations." Those laws, ordinances, and regulations which have been promulgated should be improved to suit new circumstances. Some regulations and legal documents on regulatory functions which urgently need to be revised should be re-formulated. For instance, the "Interim Regulations Governing Simple Trial Procedures for General Cases of Violation of Price-Control Laws" and the "Regulations on Penalties on Cases of Violation of Price-Control Laws Regarding Failure To Lodge Application For and Report Price Adjustment." Those regulations and legal documents on regulatory functions regarding price control which no longer suit the actual circumstances should be sorted out and rescinded. Prior to the promulgation of nationwide applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding price control, local authorities may formulate some local laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding price control, on their own and in light of their local conditions. We will work, step by step, to put the price regulation, control, management, supervision, and inspection on a standardized and legal basis, so that we can exercise price control according to the law.
