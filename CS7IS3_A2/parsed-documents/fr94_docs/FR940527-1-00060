FR940527-1-00060 FR940527-1-00014 Wage Conformity Across Labor Markets Table C presents the assessment of wage conformity across labor markets. We determined that a ``boundary problem'' existed for a target hospital (that is, the hospital whose wage index value is being calculated) if_ •Among nearby hospitals, one or more other hospitals' wage index value is at least .04 greater than that of the target hospital, corresponding to approximately a $100 difference in payments per case, and •The hospital with the lower wage index value pays higher wages than the hospital with the higher wage index value. ``Nearby hospitals'' were defined as the 20 nearest hospitals or if a hospital does not have 20 other hospitals within a 35 mile radius, all hospitals within a 35 mile radius. Table C shows the number of hospitals with one or more boundary problems and the average size of the wage index difference for those boundary problems. An average wage index difference of .12 corresponds to a payment difference of about $300 per case. Table D shows the effects that different labor market alternatives would have when compared to the current FY 1994 pre-reclassified wage index.
