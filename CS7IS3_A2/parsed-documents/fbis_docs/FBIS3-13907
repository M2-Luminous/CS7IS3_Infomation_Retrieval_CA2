Concerning the changes which have been made in next year's budget, [Qorban 'Ali] Dorri-Najafabadi, chairman of the Plan and Budget Committee of the Islamic Consultative Majles, said: [Dorri-Najafabadi] In the first instance, the changes which were made were changes in the revenue which constituted a major change between the bill approved by the Majles and the bill presented by the government. There was nearly a change of 380 billion tumans [each tuman is 10 rials] in the general sector. If you add to this the government owned companies, the figure will show a difference of 1,000 billion tumans between the figure approved by the Majles and the figure presented by the government in the budget bill. In other words, the figure approved by the Majles is less than that proposed by the government. Of course, certain mechanisms have been instituted so that if certain incomes were received by the government as part of their revenue the government would be able to cater for it. The next change which we introduced in this connection, is stressing and changing the ratio of the revenue [as heard]. We have made major changes in the revenue from taxation, especially the revenue from customs duty and commercial benefit tax [sud-e bazargani]. This was a positive change in the direction of supporting the domestic products of the country. First of all, we have introduced some savings in the current sector, between 7 percent and 13 percent [as heard]. We have made subsidies universal, so that in the coming year the government will provide subsidies for essential goods and medicine as far as it can and which can be sustained by the present conditions. We have taken good steps concerning deprived areas, above the ceiling set by the government budget. Although we have reduced the budget by 380 billion tumans, we have not reduced the ceiling. On the contrary, we have provided greater assistance, we have increased the amount in this budget. [Correspondent] Mohammad Reza Bahonar, deputy from Tehran and spokesman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Majles, also concerning the main elements of the budget and mechanisms for preventing an increase in prices and controlling inflation believes: [Bahonar] To be able to balance our revenue with our expenditure, we have put some pressure on some unnecessary government expenditures. In one sentence, if we are going to move toward a policy of balancing the budget we should achieve a balance between general demand and general supply. Demand has two main sources: From the government sector and from the people. So far, the pressure has been placed on reducing the public demand by increasing prices. However, alongside reducing public demand, we can at least reduce the demand by the government to some extent. This can be done by reducing government expenditure. If the government demand is reduced at least to the level of the reduction in public demand, the situation of expenditure will be improved in favor of the people. I think that if we wish to define in one word the characteristics of the 1373 budget compared to previous budgets, we should say that it can be summarized as: 1. Being more realistic about our revenue; 2. Reducing expenditure on the basis of our revenue; 3. Concentrating these reductions in unnecessary expenditures. Where the expenditure has been necessary not only have we not reduced it, on the contrary we have even increased it. Another important issue that we can see in the budget is the issue of supervising and controlling bank credits. For the first time, we have defined bank credits and we have allocated 55 percent of banking loans and credits to the people. In controlling inflation -- the most important reason for which is the increase of cash in circulation [roshd-e naqdinegi] -- we have controlled this increase in circulation for the coming year. In technical language, we have limited the growth in banking facilities to 7,000 billion rials [roshd-e mande-ye tashilat-e banki ra dar mahdudeh-ye haft hezar milliar rial motevaqqef kardim]. If this increase is brought under control, and God willing it will be controlled, we hope that next year the growth in our cash flow will be about 15 percent. The increase in Gross National Product should also be calculated, and these two will determine how much is going to be the increase in our inflation. [Correspondent] Regarding some of the directions, specifics, and also the effects of the rial's exchange rate on the amount of foreign currency allocated to subsidize essential goods, Morteza Nabavi, a representative of the people of Tehran said the following: [Nabavi] Since no mechanism has been thought of to cushion the poor members of society against the effects of an increase in the price of gasoline and other oil products, the Majles did not agree to raise the prices of these products. This was welcomed by the people. An increase in the price of these products without a program to neutralize the effects of this on the life of the oppressed would have increased pressure on the people. Last year, the amount of currency allocated to subsidizing essential goods was worked out at the exchange rate of seven tumans to the dollar. [Words indistinct] This year, the currency allocated to subsidizing essential goods was worked out at 175 tumans. The rial for this has been predicted so that payment can be made [as heard]. As a result, as far as the people are concerned, the price of essential goods reaching them will not change. In other words, the price at which rationed essential goods were offered to the people through coupons this year will not change next year. [Correspondent] The topic of income generated through the sale of oil and other related issues were addressed by Mohsen Yahyavi, a deputy from Tehran and the head of the Oil Committee of the Islamic Consultative Majles: [Yahyavi] The psychological and technical factors that affect the production of oil, and also the price of oil, were assessed by the Majles during its debate on the budget bill. In the end, what the Majles approved, that is for the ceiling of income from oil sales for the year 1373, was $10.154 billion. This is nearly $1.646 billion less than the income predicted by the government. We are now able to provide most of the raw materials of our factories. There is less need than before for currency to obtain such materials.
