FR940325-1-00072 FR940325-1-00008 Section 4120.3&hyph;1␣Conditions for Range Improvements This section would be amended by inserting a new paragraph (f) addressing reviews of decisions associated with range improvement projects. The amendment clarifies the process for administering protests and appeals of the decision and directs appeals through the administrative remedies process (43 CFR part 4160) provided for in grazing administration. At present, appeals of these decisions regarding range improvements go to the Interior Board of Land Appeals without an opportunity for a local field hearing on the facts of the case as is the practice with other rangeland grazing program decisions. Section 4120.3&hyph;2␣Cooperative Agreements The section heading would be revised to clarify that this section deals with cooperative range improvements as opposed to ``cooperative agreements'' with other Federal or State agencies. The proposed rule would amend this section to make it clear that the United States would have title to all new permanent grazing-related improvements constructed on public lands. Title to temporary grazing-related improvements used primarily for livestock handling or water hauling could be retained by the permittee or lessee. This change conforms with the common practice of keeping title of permanent improvements in the name of the party holding title to the land. The amendment would not change the agreements currently in effect. Section 4120.3&hyph;3␣Range Improvement Permits This section would be amended to make it clear that a permittee or lessee may apply for a range improvement permit to install, use, maintain, or modify range improvement projects, whether permanent or temporary, needed to meet management objectives established for the allotment. The permittee would hold title to removable livestock handling facilities and to temporary improvements such as troughs for hauled water or loading chutes. The amendment would also clarify that permanent water improvement projects would be authorized through cooperative range improvement agreements. The proposed rule would remove the provision that permittees or lessees would control the use of ponds or wells by livestock. Permittees and lessees would be the graziers and, therefore, would control livestock use of water sources. The proposed amendment will not affect ownership or rights currently held in a range improvement. A provision was added to those presented in the advance notice to make clear that the authorized officer would retain a record of permittee or lessee contributions to specific authorized range improvement projects. This record would be used in determining compensation due the permittee or lessee from the BLM in the event a permit or lease is canceled in order to devote the public lands to another public purpose, including disposal of the lands. The record would also be considered prior to the transfer of grazing preference. The rule would provide for the BLM to mediate disputes about reasonable compensation for the operation and maintenance of facilities when another operator is authorized temporary use of forage that the preference permit holder cannot use. Section 4120.3&hyph;8␣Range Improvement Fund The proposed rule would add a new section to this part that addresses the distribution and use of the ``range betterment'' funds appropriated by Congress through section 401(b) of FLPMA for range improvement expenditure by the Secretary of the Interior. The range betterment fund has been called the range improvement appropriation by Congress and is known by that title in the BLM. The proposed amendment would provide for distribution of the funds by the Secretary or designee. The proposed rule would provide that one-half of the range improvement fund would be made available to the State and District from which the funds were derived. The remaining one-half would be allocated by the Secretary or designee on a priority basis. All range improvement funds would be used for on-the-ground rehabilitation, protection and improvements of public rangeland ecosystems. Current policy requires the return of all range improvement funds to the District from which they were collected. The BLM has found this not to be in the best interest of the public because it prevents use of the funds in areas where they are most needed and results in some offices experiencing difficulty expending available funds efficiently. The proposed amendment would correct the imbalance by ensuring that the funds are distributed on a priority basis. The proposed rule would clarify that range improvement includes activities such as planning, design, layout, modification, and monitoring/evaluating the effectiveness of specific range improvements in achieving resource condition and management objectives. Maintenance of range improvements and costs associated with the contracting of range improvement was added to the list of activities included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for which range improvement funds may be used. Maintenance was an allowable use of range improvement funds prior to a policy change made in 1982. The proposed rule would require consultation with affected permittees, lessees, and the interested public during the planning of range development and improvement programs. Multiple resource advisory councils would also be consulted during the planning of range development and improvement programs, including the development of budgets for range improvement and the establishment of range improvement priorities.
