He told the constituent conference of the Council for Foreign Investment that the Cabinet had developed legal norms providing for major changes in the taxing regime for foreign investors. For instance, enterprises with joint Russian-foreign capital will be freed from taxes for five years following registration; limitations on the movement of capital will be lifted, while enterprises founded entirely with foreign capital will be given the right to own the land on which they are located. Chernomyrdin said that changes in the domestic scene allowed President Yeltsin to use his enormous reform potential much more efficiently. As an example he referred to the packages of economic decrees, aimed at accelerating reform and putting industrial production on a new footing. Chernomyrdin also said that the Russian economy was fully working on the basic laws of the market economy and that its response to market fluctuations had become more predictable. He said that the external situation was favorable for overcoming the crisis and for stable economic development. He spoke about the progress made during the talks with the London and Paris clubs on the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt inherited from the Soviet Union, and about the conclusion of the agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European Union. He announced that during his recent visit to the U.S. the first step was made towards granting Russia most-favored-nation status. The conference is attended by the leaders of major world companies, including BASF (Germany), Coca Cola, Ernst & Young, Procter & Gamble (the U.S.), representatives of Japanese, French and British firms, and Russian business people.
