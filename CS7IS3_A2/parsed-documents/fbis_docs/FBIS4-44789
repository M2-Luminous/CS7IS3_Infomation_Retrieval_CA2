High Level Task Groups Reflecting this belief was the creation of a number of high-level task forces. The one most closely related to technology is headed by Commissioner Martin Bangemann (Industrial Affairs, Information Technologies and Telecommunications). It met for the first time in Brussels on 15 February, bringing together a group of experts ("wise men"), mainly leading industrialists. Their task is to pave the way for the "information highways" which form part of the Trans-European Networks, a system of infrastructure which the Commission has planned in order to complement the Single European Market. The Bangemann group agreed on a work programme and the views of the professionals were garnered on the proposals for establishing a trans-European telecommunications network, one of the White Paper's priorities. Two sub-groups were established. Their chairmen are Carlo de Benedetti, president, Olivetti, and Etienne Davignon, Societe Generale. The Christophersen Task Force, chaired by Henning Christophersen, (Economic and Financial Affairs -- in agreement with Mr. Delors -- Credit and Investments, Statistical Office) met for the second time on 21 February in Brussels. Its job is to oversee the implementation of the more conventional infrastructure programmes like transport and energy, ensuring efficiency, consistency and speed. These task forces will pave the way for key aspects of the Trans-European networks highlighted by the White Paper, which is the response of Commission President Mr. Jacques Delors, to the European Union's unemployment crisis. It envisages the creation of 15 million jobs between now and the end of decade, by "making employment policy the centrepiece of our overall strategy." Strong Role for R&D Research and development and the extensive implementation of technology strongly linked to economic and industrial policies represents one of the White Paper's central themes. The Trans-European Networks providing a coherent infrastructural system is a clear manifestation of this. The White Paper accepts that in some circumstances technological progress can erode jobs. However, it also sees it as a major stimulant of growth and hence job opportunities. The White Paper looks towards creating a "sustainable development model" by creating a healthy, open and decentralised economy. It therefore points to the following requirements: -- making the most of the Single Market; -- supporting the development and adaptation of small and medium-sized enterprises; -- pursuing the social dialogue that has, to date, made for fruitful cooperation and joint decision-making by the two sides of industry, thereby assisting the work of the Community; -- creating the major European infrastructure networks; -- preparing and laying the foundations for the information society. To ensure that the information society becomes a reality, the White Paper has drawn up an Action Plan consisting of the following: -- promote the use of information technologies; -- provide basic trans-European services; -- create an appropriate regulatory framework; -- develop training on new technologies; -- improve industrial and technological performance. The Bangemann Task Force is expected to report to the Council before the end of March, so that the Action Plan can be applied as soon as possible. The information networks will integrate concepts like highways, access channels, service areas and highway users. Telecommunications hardware consisting of broadband optical fibre networks will represent the physical basis of this system. The anticipated priority applications of this are: teleworking; teletraining; telemedicine; and, links between administrations. Information Highways on the Way Over the next ten years, it is expected that something like ECU150 billion will be needed to create these sort of high-tech structures. ECU67 billion will be required between 1994 and 1999 for priority projects. The source of this investment will mainly be the private sector, with European money playing a kick-starting role. R&D is also accorded some importance for job creation in coming years. Research at the national and Community level will be stepped up, embracing greater cooperation between companies. The Commission will propose that Member States implement this innovative vertical cooperation on the basis of a restricted number of large joint projects in the following areas: -- new information technologies; -- biotechnology; -- ecotechnologies. A forum for concertation and exchanges between the various European research bodies and centres is suggested. A science and technology assembly to encourage the development of concerted strategies linked to the Community's activities is another measure being advocated. Other aspects of the Trans-European Networks, such as transport and energy, are dealt with by the White Paper. In essence it is a statement of economic policy which assesses the need to develop Europe-wide infrastructure, embracing the most advanced information and communication technologies. It also formally reaffirms the importance of mobilising and coordinating R&D efforts towards clearly-defined economic goals.
