Many incidents, Albanians murdered while asleep or awake, beaten en masse, and so on, but...the problem that makes you forget many other things is the large number of our refugees that are living and working in Greece. Analysts underscore the fact that refugees, including a large number of Albanians, cost Greece tens of millions of U.S. dollars per year (this figure has been accurately extracted by a U.S. Commission for the Balkans.) Nevertheless, the Greek-Albanian "line" is vacillating in such a way that makes you feel something new is going to happen, and if we bear in mind the declarations of certain Greek circles laying claim to Albanian lands, our fears and doubts about peace between our two countries grow. However, if we refer to foreign news reports, a certain position of sitting on the fence, or as our people put it, a "neither here, nor there" stance is to be observed, particularly on the part of the United States. For example, in an article published the day before yesterday in "The Balkan News," the following parallel conclusions were drawn: Albania must be convinced that Greek aims do not include the annexation of North Epirus. In the same way, Greece must be convinced that it is not Albania's aim in itself to eject the Greek minority from its southern provinces. Further on, it is added that the influx of people from Northern Albania (the part of Kosovo) are aimed at changing the constitution of the population and the equilibrium in the region. In fact it sounds strange enough to declare, as the U.S. newspaper does, that Greece does not have such aims, at a time when events showing the opposite are taking us by surprise. Another thing that attracts our attention is the somewhat particular attitude regarding the two points: Greece and Kosovo. So the United States alone must be the reliable power, capable of blaming both sides if necessary, provided the necessary practice of "good-neighborliness" is guaranteed. Thus, the United States is helping us, or why not the Greeks, if you like....?
