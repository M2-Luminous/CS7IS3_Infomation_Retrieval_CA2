Today, nearly 100 years later, Panama is preparing for another important historical event -- the country's entrance into the 21st century. The government we will elect on Sunday will be responsible for preparing and implementing a national program that will allow us to enter the 21st century ready to participate and compete advantageously. We must resolve the current crisis; we must strengthen our institutional, cultural, economic, political, and moral values; and we must begin the construction of a new country capable of facing the challenges of a new century. To achieve these goals, the new government will have to work with the greatest degree of honesty, dedication, and patriotism, and it will have to work with only one goal -- to serve Panama. For this reason, it is vital that the executive branch not be controlled by private interests that are represented by the leadership of the traditional political parties. The bosses of these parties do not differ from one another. All of them have betrayed their own rank-and-file, and they have also betrayed the ideals of their original leaders. See how today, given the actual possibility that decency may win, they are uniting to attack us in a shameful campaign of lies and infamy. Let us start putting things in their rightful order, because we will not let them insult the intelligence of our nation's men and women. The same conceit and arrogance that prevented them from seeing the nation's problems have also prevented them from recognizing the balanced proposals of the Papa Egoro Movement. Moreover, they were unable to foresee the consequences of their blindness. Now that the people's wisdom has bested them and the Panamanian people are overwhelmingly supporting a new and different program, they have been unable to find arguments that enable them to fight fairly. In this immoral campaign, which I suppose will continue until Election Day, I am being accused of being a CIA agent, of being a communist, of trying to change the currency, of being a hireling of the military, of using drugs, and of many other things, and all of these accusations are made without evidence or are based on false or forged evidence. I assure you, honest men and women of my country, that all of this is part of a plan to cause confusion and undermine our movement's support. It is all a lie. They want you to believe that the option of decency has no possibility of winning, as well as believe that, in these elections, you can only choose between two options which represent the past and which have squandered the best opportunities Panama ever had. We, on the other hand, propose a government that will be honored and proud to work for our country and will also exalt all of us in order that we may recover the feelings of national pride which glorify a nation. The government we propose includes capable professionals who come from all social, political, and labor groups in Panama. They are people with vast professional experience, noble qualities, and whose leadership is based on merit. This government team will set an example of unity and tolerance among brothers, honesty, creativity, goodwill, independence, national pride, ability, imagination, and all of the good qualities of the Panamanian people. This is what we need in order that, when the Canal is handed over to the Panamanian people, the reverted areas do not become political loot for irresponsible individuals capable of sacrificing a whole country to satisfy their material ambitions. Let us remember that the Canal is not simply an important economic resource; it is a responsibility shared by all Panamanians before the entire world. The seriousness of its management will determine the amount of respect we receive within the international community. The Papa Egoro Movement has stated and repeated many times that it is necessary to change the Panamanians' political conduct so that their participation in the government may become a true civic goal. I agree with the school of thought that defines the failure of traditional politics as the failure of men and women whose moral corruption has been unmasked by power, or who have been compelled to accept corruption to achieve a covetous share of power. We have to make an effort -- all of us, together, all social and economic groups, the rank-and-file of all political parties, and all ethnic groups -- to elect and support a government that makes a change. I am confident we will achieve this, because the Panamanians who are responsible, decent, and prepared to work for a better country represent the majority. This determination to solve our problems and establish the groundwork to enable Panama to begin to change must be clearly stated at the ballot boxes as an exemplary civic duty. I congratulate those who will vote for their candidates, not because they will get a sinecure or a job, or as a result of vengeance and retribution, but because they are convinced by their proposals and because they believe in those men and women. The electoral challenge we now face is a struggle between hope and failure, between an honest political position and politics for the sake of politics, between the desire to honor the homeland and the desire for personal gain, between the future and the past, and between honesty and corruption. Let us go out and win this battle for the sake of Panama, for the sake of our highest thoughts, for the sake of our finest feelings, and for the sake of honesty. I am asking the Panamanians to go out and vote and unequivocally state that we all want true change, and I am asking them not to let money and false promises prevail when they make their decision. This time, please, listen to your consciences and hearts. Thank you.
