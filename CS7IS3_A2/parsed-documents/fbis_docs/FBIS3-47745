Here is our radio review of U.S.-Vietnam relations: Many reports about the visits to Vietnam by six American delegations have emanated from Hanoi this month. The first visit was by Washington senators [word indistinct] the most senior U.S. active-duty office to visit Vietnam, Admiral Charles Larson, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. Meanwhile, the latest search for the remains of American servicemen missing in action is now underway in 15 provinces and cities throughout Vietnam. And American politicians continue to voice positive remarks about Vietnam. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently said: Considerable information on the MIA issue has been achieved. This was due, he said, to positive cooperation and goodwill from Vietnam. Senator John Kerry, a leading player in the search for American soldiers missing in action said last week: Vietnamese Government and people have done their best in cooperating with the U.S. to settle the issue. Pending issues were created by the U.S., not Vietnam. He further noted that the U.S. should continue the internal struggle to dismantle obstacles that hinder the normalization of relations between the two countries. A significant number of American politicians and people now want to lift the embargo against Vietnam and to normalize relations with Vietnam. In a recent Gallup poll held in the USA last year, among over 1,000 questioned people, 58 percent supported normalization with Vietnam. And the NEW YORK TIMES commented that the most legal reason to lift the sanctions was that it was no more in conformity with the interests of the U.S. itself. While the whole world was now having free-trade ties with Hanoi, the embargo punishes American businessmen. It would be much better if the U.S. lifts the embargo. Nevertheless, if the U.S. still keeps its outdated attitude, Vietnam will continue to develop its cooperative relations with other countries. Now the ball [is] in the American court. The question is whether the U.S. is breaking up [words indistinct] proposals raised by American politicians, people, and businessmen.
