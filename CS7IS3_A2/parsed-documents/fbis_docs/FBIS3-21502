Gen. Engineer 'Amir Muhammad Rashid, director of the Military Industrialization Organization [MIO], has expressed amazement over the contradictions contained in the statements Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special Commission, made to the U.S. television Cable News Network [CNN], yesterday, Tuesday, 15 February. In a statement to INA, Lt. Gen. Rashid added that in his statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq continues to withhold information on chemical weapons. The MIO director urged the chairman of the UN Special Commission to shoulder his responsibilities fairly, to confine himself to the tasks of the UN Special Commission as spelled out in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and to steer clear of the U.S. anti-Iraq political maneuvers and pressures, which have nothing to do with the UN security Council resolutions. The following is the text of the statement: MIO Director General Lt. Gen. 'Amir Muhammad Rashid has said: We have received with extreme amazement the statements Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special Commission, made to CNN on 15 February 1994. In these statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq continues to withhold part of the information pertaining to chemical weapons. As a matter of fact, Ekeus has made it clear in letters addressed to me that Iraq has provided the required information regarding its previous programs, that this information is credible and comprehensive, and that it is sufficient for the purposes of the UN Special Commission, as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Hence, his recent pronouncements and statements to CNN misrepresent facts, and contradict the documents he himself has submitted to the UN Security Council. Lt. Gen. Rashid said: It has become clear to us, particularly after Iraq accepted Resolution 715 in November 1993, that Ambassador Ekeus makes himself part of the U.S. political maneuvers which seek to prolong the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. Therefore, he makes contradictory statements serving in fact the purpose of U.S. maneuvers. Rashid continued: We ask the chairman of the Special Commission to shoulder his responsibilities in an objective manner, adhere to the Commission's tasks as defined by the UN Security Council resolutions, and dissociate himself from the U.S. anti-Iraq maneuvers and political pressure which has nothing to do with the Security Council resolutions. On Ekeus statements on the effects of the blockade on the Iraqi people and his arbitrary criticism of Iraq for not implementing what he called a mechanism presented to it by the United Nations to sell a fixed amount of oil to buy food and medicine under international supervision, Rashid said: First, this subject is not within the jurisdiction of the chairman of the Special Commission. It is within the jurisdiction of the UN general secretariat. Second, Ekeus wants to dissociate himself from being largely responsible for continuing the blockade imposed on Iraq and hence the continuation of the Iraqi people's suffering. This is because under U.S. pressure, Ekeus is reluctant to tell the truth which he knows only too well; namely, that Iraq has abided by UN resolutions. Had he possessed the courage and objectivity required from an international official, he would have presented his report on this issue to the Security Council, thus, leading to the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and ending the Iraqi peoples suffering. The blame he levels at Iraq because it rejects arrangements that infringe on its sovereignty and dignity is blatantly ridiculous.
