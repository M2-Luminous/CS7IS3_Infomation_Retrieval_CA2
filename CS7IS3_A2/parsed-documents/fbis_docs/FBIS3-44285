The meeting was called by Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign Trade on Monday. Huang said he will invite officials from the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, Council of Agriculture, and the Industrial Development Bureau to work out guidelines for tariff concessions and discuss rates for import tariff cuts. On Nov. 24, 1993, the United States demanded ROC authorities slash tariffs on 699 U.S. imports. The ROC could not meet the U.S. deadline, and officials from the two sides agreed to meet in Washington on Jan. 19-20 for tariff negotiations. Meanwhile, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang plans to convene an intra-ministerial meeting on Jan. 13 to discuss protection of intellectual proierty rights (IPR). Chiang said the U.S. might hold unofficial discussions on the IPR issue with ROC delegates during the Washington negotiations. He hopes that the ROC delegation can convince their American counterparts about the ROC's determination to guarantee IPR protection in Taiwan.
