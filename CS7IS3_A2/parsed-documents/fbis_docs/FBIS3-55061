Local observers note his resignation is linked with strengthening of leftist-radical forces in the leadership of the Dniester Republic, Moldova's breakaway province. The radicals support Tiraspol's tough position at talks on settlement of the Dniester-Chisinau conflict. They also oppose economic and social reforms in the region.
