FBIS4-6167 "dreas075__a94024" FBIS-EAS-94-075-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Foreign Insurers To Underwrite Satellites Foreign Insurers To Underwrite Satellites OW1804082294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 18 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1804082294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of Finance will open the underwriting of nonlife insurance for artificial satellites to foreign insurance companies not holding a Japanese license as early as before the end of 1994. The opening of satellite insurance to foreign companies has been announced in light of an agreement at the GATT Uruguay Round, and will be implemented as soon as the Uruguay Round accord is ratified. As to insurance for oceangoing vessels and aircraft, the ban on foreign participation will be lifted in fiscal 1995, together with the reform of the insurance industry, because this requires amendments in the relevant laws. The underwriting of insurance by foreign insurers is known as a "cross-border transaction." This has not been allowed for insurance companies not holding a license to operate in Japan, except for international cargo and a limited number of other items. Due to strong demands to open the market from Western nations, the opening of insurance for oceangoing vessels and aircraft has been included in the "outline of external economic policy reform" announced on 29 March, apart from the Uruguay Round agreement. Implementation of this policy in artificial satellites is being frontloaded because this does not require any legal amendment. Insurance fees for artificial satellites sometimes cost several billion yen due to the high risk of failure in launching satellites. In Japan, when the National Space Development Agency launches its satellites, Japanese nonlife insurers usually underwrite insurance jointly, and reinsure with foreign insurers. By opening the market to foreign companies, foreign reinsurers can now underwrite insurance directly. With regard to ships and aircraft, the selling of insurance policies is prohibited for foreign insurers not holding a Japanese license under the "Foreign Insurance Companies Law."
