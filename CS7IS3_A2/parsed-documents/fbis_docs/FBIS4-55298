This draft decision does not conform to the Bulgarian Constitution and would deceive the country. This was stated by Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction, after the meeting. The proposal of Aleksandur Yordanov was not discussed because he withdrew it. Edvin Sugarev described that proposal as a joke.
