Stressing that our northern neighbor has started threatening our borders, General Gures said: "I inserted this fact into the official records of one of the NATO meetings." During our airport meeting, we asked the chief of General Staff his views on relations between the Russian Federation and Turkey, military and political developments abroad, and the latest developments concerning the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]. The chief of General Staff, who for the first time felt the need to reply to the abundant verbal threats against our country coming from the officials of the Russian Federation, said "Russia is now posing a greater threat than it used to during the Cold War," and added: "Russia is also threatening our borders. Each day it flies 40 planes to Armenia, which is at war with Azerbaijan. It is sending arms and military hardware on board these planes." When asked about the latest developments in relations between the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and Turkey, he made the following assessment: "Nakhichevan is not in danger. This is because Turkey has already expressed its resolute position on this matter. There is no need to repeat that. Besides, a very important Azerbaijani military force, a brigade, is stationed in Nakhichevan. For these reasons, it will not be easy to attack Nakhichevan." Disclosing that in one of NATO meetings last year he strongly objected to the Russian chief of General Staff's statement that they would sent Russian forces to the former Soviet republics and regional countries, Gen. Gures said: "In reaction, I inserted into NATO official records the need to send a multinational force under CSCE supervision." Noting that at this same meeting the German chief of General Staff supported his views on this matter, Gures said that "thus Russia's dangerous intentions were obstructed." The chief of General Staff reiterated the existence of the Russian threat by saying: "I repeat, Russia now poses a far greater threat than it used to during the Cold War era." He continued with the following important statements and assessments: "Russia wants to annex Crimea. I want to draw attention to this fact. The Turks in Crimea are in a critical situation. Our esteemed president is visiting Ukraine at such a critical period. And, look at Georgia, where Russia is on the verge of bringing that country under its control. The Russians want to send troops to Azerbaijan, but the latter is resisting it." Asked to comment on reports that a coup is being prepared against Azerbaijani President Aliyev, Gures said: "They cannot do anything to Aliyev, but unfortunately such preparations exist." Apo Is Finished In reply to our question on the PKK, General Gures said the operations have been very successful and this separatist organization started to vanish sooner than expected. Gures said: "I thought they would surrender in September. But it happened sooner than that. I can state that the PKK, which is now on the verge of collapse, will eventually turn into an urban terror organization. The PKK will become an organization like Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left Organization]." Asked what will become of Apo [alias for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan], Gures said: "I do not know.... He might flee. He is already looking for a place to escape to." [passage omitted]
