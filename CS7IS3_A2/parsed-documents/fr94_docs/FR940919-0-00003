FR940919-0-00003 FR940919-0-00001 Comment: Section 400.54(b)_the proposed reduction of transitional or determined yields by the stated 80 percent for maintaining one year of actual records and 90 percent for maintaining two years of actual records is inadequate to serve as an incentive for insureds to report all four years of actual production in relationship to the 65 percent reduction for no records. Also, there does not appear to be a penalty for maintaining only three years of actual records. A greater penalty is needed for not maintaining less than four years of records. Comment: One comment suggested that if a producer applying for Federal crop insurance coverage has no previous production records (an example of this would be production of the alternative crop Kenaf, where very little production history exists), that individual should be able to receive crop insurance coverage for the entire crop. The only way to accomplish this is to raise the transfer yield to 100 percent, as opposed to 65 percent. The comment also recommended that an option be provided to allow producers to purchase additional coverage for crops having no previous production records. Comment: One comment urged FCIC to exclude those losses resulting from catastrophic events in the loss ratio determination. Response: The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended, requires FCIC to take actions as necessary to improve actuarial soundness of the multiple peril crop insurance program. FCIC is mandated to achieve an overall loss ratio, within certain parameters, of not greater than 1.10 by October 1, 1995. FCIC's research using existing insureds' APH data indicates insureds with no records of production (or one or two years of records) are paid disproportionate losses compared to insureds who have provided three or more years of production records. Further analyses by FCIC using modified APH procedures and existing insureds' APH data, indicates that 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield (hereafter referred to as T-Yield in FCIC's responses) is an appropriate percentage to attain the required loss ratio for persons who have not submitted records. Independent analyses from a private insurance association support these findings. Insureds who have provided three or four years of records have lower loss costs and do not require the use of reduced T-Yields. Modifications to APH are not intended to reduce insurance protection to farmers, rather the intent is to base yields more fully on actual yields and to rely less on T-Yields. APH procedures allow ample opportunity for producers who have not raised insurable crops (and therefore have not had the opportunity to establish records) to qualify for APH yields greater than 65 percent of the T-Yield through use of new producer, added land, and new practice procedures. Producers are encouraged to provide as many years of actual yields as possible. Above average yields will reduce the impact of low yields. If actual yields reported are higher than the T-Yield, modified APH procedures allow a better opportunity for increased insurance yields as compared to previous APH procedures. FCIC is not able to provide APH yields higher than the insured's average yields without adversely affecting FCIC loss ratio and financial accountability. FCIC has researched options that provide coverage based on yields higher than the insured's APH yield or the yield history available for the crop on a county basis. This analysis indicates that a significant increase in premium rates is required to make such a program actuarially sound. FCIC will retain the APH structure as proposed. 3. Section 400.50 Availability of APH Program Comment: The last sentence of ยง400.50 states, ``Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply.'' Concern was expressed that this regulation may override the terms and conditions in current crop filings. The commentor indicated that policy language should not be superseded by any other published regulations since policyholders receive copies of policy provisions but do not receive Federal regulations. Response: Federal regulations have the force and effect of law and all have constructive notice of the provisions. As a practical matter we are not aware of any provision of the published policies in conflict with these regulations. As crop insurance policies which base production guarantees on APH yields are revised, those provisions relating to APH will be changed in accordance with the final APH regulation. Reinsured companies furnish policyholder's letters that describe changes to each crop insurance contract. These letters also suggested that insureds contact their agents for a full explanation of the changes and once so advised, insureds then can make informed crop insurance decisions. Copies of these letters should be provided by the insurer to all affected policyholders. 4. Added Land (Purchased or Leased) Comment: One comment stated concern that, under the proposed regulation, the producer is not eligible to transfer his or her skill and history to new land purchased or leased. It was suggested that a producer's history be taken into account when calculating coverage under a crop insurance policy. Response: The regulation provides general rules while allowing flexibility for program details to be provided in procedures. Added land procedures for APH yield determinations are available that provide insureds the opportunity to establish approved APH yields higher than 65 percent of the T-Yield when new land is purchased or leased. FCIC has added a new paragraph to ยง400.54(b) consistent with those procedures which allow yields for added land that are more comparable to approved APH yields determined from acreage with records.
