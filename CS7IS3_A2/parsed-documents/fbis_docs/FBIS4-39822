He believes this is determined by the historical necessity to live together, the economic interests and ancient cultural ties. Belarusians cannot and will not be spongers of Russians while participating in inter-state division of labor and cooperating with them on a mutually advantageous basis in all spheres of life, the premier noted. The agreement on the unification of the monetary systems of the two countries is the first step towards a closer alliance, and the head of the Belarusian government is doing everything in his power to put into practice these aspirations of the peoples of both countries. Touching on national minorities in sovereign Belarusia, Vyacheslav Kebich said that for him such a term was unacceptable. People of different nationalities live in Belarusia and there cannot be any pretext for inter-ethic strife, the Belarusian prime minister emphasized.
