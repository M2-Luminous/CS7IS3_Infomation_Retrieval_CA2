The Economics Institute is a comprehensive research institute engaged in research on the macroeconomy. Most of the institute's former directors and vice directors have been seasoned economists. Fan, 40, went to the Great Northern Wilderness in northeast China to join the local production and construction corps in the 1960's. He was admitted to the Economics Department of Hebei University in 1978 and to the Postgraduate Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1982. He then received Master's and doctorate degrees. From 1985 to 1987, he was at Harvard as a visiting scholar. Since 1988, he has worked with the economics institute. Fan's ideas are dynamic and he is an industrious writer. He has published many books, of which the important ones are: Theoretical Outline of Publicly Owned Macro Economy, (he was the principal author of this book); Comparison and Synthesis of Three Major Contemporary Economic Theoretical Systems; and Progressive Path-- Economic Ideas in Economic Reform. He has also published over 100 academic papers with two million characters in total, including "Gray Market Theories" in JINGJI YANJIU [ECONOMIC RESEARCH] and other academic journals. His work has had a rather big impact on theoretical circles. In 1992 he was promoted to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as a researcher, which was an exception to the rule, and was conferred with the title of a state-level middle-aged and younger expert, as he had made outstanding contributions, and in 1993 he became one of the youngest tutors of doctoral students in social science circles. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has boldly promoted a number of middle-aged and younger scholars to leadership positions. Li Peilin, 39, was appointed vice director of the Institute of Sociology; Cai Fang, 37, vice director of the Institute of Population Studies; Zhuo Xinping, 39, vice director of the Institute of Research on World Religions, and Zhao Yifan, over 40, vice director of the Institute of Foreign Literature.
