National accounts figures just released show annual economic growth now stands at 5 percent -- up from 4 percent previously. Belinda Trump reports that the figures are likely to increase fear the economy cannot keep up the pace. [Begin Trump recording] Gross Domestic Products rose by 1.9 percent in the March quarter -- double some market expectations. The main contributions to growth were strong household and government spending, while business investment remained weak. The March quarter was the eleventh consecutive quarter of growth, but where the economy goes from here is a major issue. Financial markets see the fast growth as a pointer to rising inflation down the track and fear the government may have to bring forward an increase in interest rates to control economic growth. For the moment, though, the government has the best of both world -- fast growth with further signs in today's figures that inflation during the March quarter remained low. [end recording] Meanwhile, the federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says the big jump in economic growth confirms the Australian economy is on track for a sustained recovery. Mr. Willis says the strong growth marginally reflects the influence of a number of one-off factors, such as a big increase in public spending. Treasurer says however, the complementary jump in private consumption, combined with rising profits, provides a highly favorable environment for increases in business investment. The prime minister, Paul Keating says it is 30 years since the country has the economic conditions as good as this.
