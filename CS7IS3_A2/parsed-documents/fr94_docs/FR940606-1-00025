FR940606-1-00025 FR940606-1-00008 If a control device is used, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the overall control efficiency requirement of at least 81 percent. The percent reduction achieved by a control device may be determined based either on total organic compounds (TOC) minus methane and ethane or on total organic HAP. For a carbon adsorber, the overall control efficiency would be determined using a mass balance. The mass balance calculation would be made every rolling period (the length of the rolling period will vary from facility to facility and will range from 1 to 30 days). For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, the overall control efficiency would be based on capture efficiency and destruction efficiency. Capture efficiency would be determined based on the procedure specified in ยง52.741(a)(4)(iii) of 40 CFR subpart O, unless the operation is performed within a total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements of a total enclosure as specified in ยง52.741, appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR subpart O would have a capture efficiency of 100 percent. The destruction efficiency of a control device other than a carbon adsorber would be determined using the following methods. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used for selection of the sampling sites, and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate. Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic HAP at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Also, any other test methods or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. The proposed standards would also allow the use of alternative application methods provided that they generate organic HAP and VOC emissions less than or equal to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. The emission levels of the alternative application method must be determined under actual production conditions. This test would first involve determining the organic HAP and VOC emissions for the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation of the alternative application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns would be used. The alternative method would then be used on actual production parts or assemblies for a period of time sufficient to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated in the initial 90-day period. Coatings used during the test period must be the same as those used during the initial 90-day period. In addition, the dried film thickness must be equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day period. The organic HAP and VOC emissions for the period of time where the alternative method was used would then be calculated. Where the organic HAP and VOC emissions after implementation of the alternative method are less than or equal to the emissions for the initial 90-day period, the alternative application method is in compliance. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), in conjunction with the California Air Resources Board (CARB), is currently developing a test protocol to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment. This test protocol would represent an alternative method of qualifying application equipment for use under the proposed standards. Since this test protocol is still under development, the EPA is requesting comments from those familiar with this test protocol or any other transfer efficiency laboratory test method concerning the ability of these procedures to accurately and repeatedly measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment. In addition, the EPA is requesting comments on other methods that may be used to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment. c. Depainting. For the organic HAP emissions portion of the proposed standards for depainting, the only test method or procedure that would be required is the determination of the organic HAP content of each chemical stripper. The proposed standards would require the use of information supplied by the manufacturer to determine the organic HAP content. If the organic HAP content of the chemical stripper cannot be determined from manufacturer's data, then the owner or operator would submit an alternative procedure for determining the organic HAP content for approval by the Administrator. For the annual limit on the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used for spot stripping and decal removal, the total annual volume as applied of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper and the number of aircraft depainted would be determined from company records. The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator to calculate the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per aircraft. This calculation would be performed for each annual period.
