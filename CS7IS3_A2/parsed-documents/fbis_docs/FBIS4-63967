During his talks with Ukrainian top officials Hurd said that ten days ago EU [European Union] leaders discussed ways to expand ties between Brussels and Kiev and ensure control over of Ukraine's's part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Despite attempts by some EU countries to interconnect these two issues, the European Council decided not to condition the signing of a comprehensive cooperation agreement with Ukraine on the full withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory, Hurd said. He also called Kiev to join as soon as possible the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Ukraine's participation in the treaty is very important not because the European Union is suspicious of Ukraine, but because it is much more concerned about the reaction to the current state of affairs from the countries seeking to obtain nuclear weapons, he said. He said the EU believes the assurances received from Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and his government that the agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons will be strictly observed. He emphasised that neither Britain nor the European Union link the withdrawal of nuclear weapons with any of the existing problem. Hurd called on the Ukrainian Parliament to give guarantees of the implementation of the agreement. Parliament Chairman Aleksandr Moroz assured Hurd that the lawmakers are strongly against nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The British foreign secretary noted that there is only one way to solve the nuclear problem in Ukraine -- strictly observe and implement the agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.
