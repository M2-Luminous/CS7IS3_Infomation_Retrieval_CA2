FR940228-1-00027 FR940228-1-00003 (a) Radiographic exposure devices measuring less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) from the sealed source storage position to any exterior surface of the device must not have a radiation level in excess of 0.5 millisieverts (50 millirems) per hour at 15 centimeters (6 inches) from any exterior surface of the device. Radiographic exposure devices measuring a minimum of 10 centimeters (4 inches) from the sealed source storage position to any exterior surface of the device, and all storage containers for sealed sources or for radiographic exposure devices, must not have a radiation level in excess of 2 millisieverts (200 millirems) per hour at any exterior surface, and 0.1 millisieverts (10 millirems) per hour at 1 meter from any exterior surface. The radiation levels specified are with the sealed source in the shielded (i.e., ``off'') position. (b) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to all equipment manufactured before January 10, 1992. After January 10, 1996, radiographic equipment other than storage containers and source changers must meet the requirements of §34.20. Section 34.21 applies only to storage containers. §34.22 [Removed] 16. Section 34.22 is removed. 17. Section 34.23 is revised to read as follows: §34.23 Locking and relocation of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers and source changers. (a) Locked radiographic exposure devices and storage containers must be physically secured to prevent tampering. (1) Each radiographic exposure device must have a lock or outer locked container designed to prevent unauthorized or accidental removal of the sealed source from its shielded position. The exposure device and/or its container must be kept locked (and if a keyed-lock, with the key removed at all times), when not under the direct surveillance of a radiographer or a radiographer's assistant or as otherwise may be authorized in §34.51. In addition, during radiographic operations the sealed source assembly must be manually secured in the shielded position each time the source is returned to that position, in those exposure devices manufactured before January 10, 1992. (2) Each sealed source storage container and source changer must have a lock or outer locked container designed to prevent unauthorized or accidental removal of the sealed source from its shielded position. Storage containers and source changers must be kept locked (and if a keyed-lock, with the key removed at all times) when containing sealed sources except when under the direct surveillance of a radiographer or a radiographer's assistant. (b) Radiographic exposure devices, source changers, and storage containers, before being moved from one location to another, must have the guide tubes and control cables disconnected, safety plugs or covers applied, locked and physically secured to prevent accidental loss, tampering or removal of licensed material, and must be surveyed to assure that the sealed source is in the shielded position. §34.24 [Removed] 18. Section 34.24 is removed. 19. Section 34.25 is revised to read as follows: §34.25 Radiation survey instruments. (a) The licensee shall keep sufficient calibrated and operable radiation survey instruments at each location where radioactive material is present to make the radiation surveys required by this part and by part 20 of this chapter. Instrumentation required by this section must be capable of measuring a range from 0.02 millisieverts (2 millirems) per hour through 0.01 Sievert (1 rem) per hour. Survey instruments must be checked for operability before use each day. This may be accomplished by evaluating the instrument response to the previously measured fields at the projection sheath port or the control cable sheath port on a radiographic exposure device. (b) The licensee shall have each radiation survey instrument required under paragraph (a) of this section calibrated_ (1) At intervals not to exceed 6 months and after instrument servicing, except for battery changes; (2) For linear scale instruments, at two points located approximately one-third and two-thirds of full-scale on each scale; for logarithmic scale instruments, at midrange of each decade, and at two points of at least one decade; and for digital instruments, at 3 points between 0.02 and 10 mSv (2 and 1000 millirems) per hour; and (3) So that an accuracy within plus or minus 20 percent of the calibration standard can be demonstrated at each point checked. (c) The licensee shall maintain records of the results of the instrument calibrations in accordance with §34.65. §34.26 [Removed] 20. Section 34.26 is removed.
