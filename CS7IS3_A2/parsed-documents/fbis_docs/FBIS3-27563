The official said that EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is scheduled to arrive here on Saturday [26 February] to attend the 13th Sino-EC joint commission on trade and economic cooperation and he will also hold talks with MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi. They are expected to touch on issues of bilateral economic and trade relations and new ways to further expand cooperation. The official said that China attaches importance to its imports from the EC and the import volume has been on the rise during the past few years, with last year's trade volume hitting 14.4 billion U.S. dollars. He especially mentioned that between 1991 and 1993 China sent three purchasing delegations to Europe. China purchased as much as 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in 1993 alone, mostly technical equipment. However, he pointed out, the expansion of China's imports from Europe is limited by the quota restrictions on China exports to Europe and the discriminatory moves in protecting the European market. Last year, China had a trade deficit of nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars with Europe, he said. Traditional items, including textiles, light industry goods, local and livestock products and grain and edible oils, remain the major commodities of China's exports to Europe. In recent years, with the increasing inflow of foreign capital to China, light industrial products take a larger share in the exports to the EC, he said. During the meeting of the Sino-EC joint commission of trade and economic co-operation, the two sides will hold consultations on the restoration of China's signatory party status in GATT, he said. This is the first time China and the EC will have exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT. The official hoped that the EC could reach an agreement on China's restoration protocol as soon as possible. It is known that there are the basis and wishes on both sides to develop bilateral economic and trade relations. From 1979 to 1993, the EC's contracted investments in China amounted to five billion U.S. dollars, 40 percent of which had been poured into the productive fields of automobiles, telephones, glass and medicine. Though the EC's investment in China is smaller than those from the U.S. and Japan, it increased rapidly in the past few years, and some large enterprises, in particular, strengthened their involvement in China. The official welcomed the EC countries to invest in China, and said that China will provide favorable conditions for their business activities.
