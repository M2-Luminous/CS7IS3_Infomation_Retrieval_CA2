FBIS4-59707 "drnes095_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 ISRAEL Ministry Official Rejects Criticism of Christopher Ministry Official Rejects Criticism of Christopher TA1605182694 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 16 May 94 TA1605182694 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Hebrew BFN [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen -- recorded] [Text] [Rosen] It may well be that the basic problem is that al-Asad still believes he is being lied to. Several days ago, so we have learned, al-Asad asked UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali whether he can believe the Israelis. Butrus-Ghali told him that yes, he can -- at least according to what he later told Israeli elements. Warren Christopher arrived in Damascus yesterday after making an effort to lower everybody's expectations. Yet, anyone who examines his reservation for King David Hotel rooms will find signs of optimism. The rooms are booked until the morning of 19 May, which means that this time the secretary plans a double Damascus-Jerusalem trip. This is Christopher's third shuttle mission to the region. It took James Baker, his predecessor, seven such tours to convene the Madrid conference. But, Christopher is not given too much credit. They say that he is not a middleman but a mailman. He lacks initiatives and ideas, and often falls asleep during discussions. [Eytan Bentzur, deputy Foreign Ministry director general] I certainly do not share this criticism. I believe it is not warranted. I believe that the secretary and the team that accompanies him make a skilled and very experienced team which makes a real contribution to the process. [Rosen] Baker sewed the seeds; Christopher is yet to reap the fruit, but his caution is a matter of policy, and does not only correspond with his personal character. Eytan Bentzur says that Madrid was an entirely different ball game, and that Baker's disposition could have caused a crisis here at this time. [Bentzur] He believes that the process of negotiations will develop gradually; that his role is to bring the stands closer together, make them clearer and, when the time comes, perhaps to bridge the gaps between the stands. [Rosen] Al-Asad is very disappointed and mad at the Americans. They do not apply enough pressure on Israel. And, what is worse, they do not make the bilateral moves toward Syria and are not removing it from the list of countries which sponsor terror and drug trade. This, perhaps, explains the unscheduled meeting Christopher, who was on his way to the airport, held this morning with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. Jerusalem does not yet know whether Washington will accept the Israeli security demands, not to mention whether Washington will skip summer vacation to conduct negotiations. The key, however, is still in the hands of Hafiz al-Asad. His agreement for the convention in Washington of teams of military experts to discuss security arrangements will be considered a great achievement. If al-Asad makes such a move, Rabin may follow it with a very meaningful statement on, for example, eliminating the Golan Law; recognizing Syria's demand for sovereignty over the Golan Heights; or mentioning the government resolution from June 1967 about a full withdrawal to the international borders, with a deliberately vague definition of the term international border. Rabin has recently rejected suggestions by senior Foreign Ministry officials to make such a statement at this time. If al-Asad moves forward, Rabin will be willing to favorably reconsider the suggestion.
