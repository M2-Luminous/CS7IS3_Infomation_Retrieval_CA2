He said today he will not touch the government economic plan. Ricupero will spend the next four days in Brasilia, talking with the economic team to learn about issues at his new ministry. He admitted he is not well acquainted with all issues and that it would be premature to comment on any decision he might make. Ricupero confirmed that he intends to maintain the entire current economic team but he also is bringing along five advisers to help him in his new post. He also promised he will not modify the government economic plan. He said he totally favors the economic plan, and that he believes in the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan's success. Ricupero also chose the fight against inflation as his No. 1 goal: [Begin Ricupero recording] I consider inflation the first problem that must be solved because without stability, there is no solution. Without stability, no commerce, or regional system, or industrial policy, or anything else will work. Therefore, that is the main subject of my convictions. As for the details and how inflation will be curbed, evidently it depends on the daily analysis of the economy's performance. [end recording] Minister Ricupero added that President Itamar Franco is analyzing some names to replace him in the Environment Ministry. According to Ricupero, some of the possible candidates are former Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources] President Fernando Cesar Mesquita and Amazon Secretary Henrique Brandao Cavalcanti.
