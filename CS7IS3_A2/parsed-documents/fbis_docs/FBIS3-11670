You have already seen the two assassins on your TV screens. One of them is Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. There are two alleged killers. They are already under arrest. One of them fired at the PRI candidate. He is on screen right now. He is Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. This morning, the Tijuana State Prosecutor's Office conducted a Harrison Test on him, and the test was positive. The Prosecutor's Office reports this confirms that the suspect had indeed fired a gun. Preliminary Investigation No. 739-94 initiated in the killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio indicates Aburto Martinez used a .38 caliber pistol. The investigation also says the suspect is from Zamora, Michoacan, where he lived until age 15. Aburto Martinez said in his initial statement that he is not going to talk, even if he is tortured. This is in line with the disdainful disposition that, according to witnesses, he assumed after attacking the presidential candidate. At the moment of his apprehension by an angry crowd, he bragged he had fired on Colosio. Preliminary investigations have established that the alleged assassin lives in Mexicali and also has a residence in Tijuana, that he has four brothers who live in the United States, and that he works in a mechanic shop in Buenos Aires Norte neighborhood, in (Mesa de Otay), Tijuana. He said he is the author of pacifist books that he has already delivered to the foreign media. Amid a great deal of secrecy, the Federal Attorney General's Office is also interrogating Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, a man arrested as a witness [testigo]. Mayoral Valenzuela is also from the border city of Tijuana. Attorney General Diego Valadez has been in that city since last night.
