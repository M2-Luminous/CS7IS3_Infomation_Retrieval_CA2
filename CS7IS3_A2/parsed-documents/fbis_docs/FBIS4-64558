Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans will formally present Lubbers' candidacy to the European Union soon, the Ministry said in a statement. Lubbers resigned earlier Tuesday as general elections were held in the Netherlands. He was not running for re-election. Until now Lubbers, 55 in a few days, had refused to say if he was aiming for Delors' job, saying to discuss it would be inappropriate as long as he was head of the Dutch government. Delors' term expires on January 5 of next year. In 1992 the Frenchman said Lubbers would be a good successor, and Dutch television said Tuesday it was Delors himself who encouraged Lubbers to seek the post. Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Christian Democrat like Lubbers, is also seeking the job and diplomats say he has the support of France and Germany. Lubbers has led three coalition governments in the Netherlands over the past 12 years.
