According to reports from Tajik military, in the Afghan provinces of Takhar and Kondoz, opposition combat detachments' reinforced wit armored vehicles are accumulating. Abdullo Nuri, leader of the Tajikistan Islamic Renewal Council, recently issued another bellicose statement about his readiness to continue the armed struggle "against Emomali Rakhmonov's antipopular regime." The tactical exercises by the CIS coalition peacekeeping forces in "Tigrovaya balka," which ended last Thursday, were a kind of reply to this. Soldiers and officers of the 201st Russian motorized rifle division, the Tajik Army, and an Uzbek battalion took part. A scenario for the repelling of a massive attack from the direction of Afghanistan was rehearsed. The engines of tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, and Tu-22F "Backfire" strategic aircraft roared in the mountain gorges. Coalition Peacekeeping Forces Commander Boris Pyankov believes that the scenario which is being rehearsed could be real. "It is true that I would not like it very much to happen," the colonel general added, "but Allah alone knows how it will all turn out." Whether Tajikistan will fall into the abyss of a new fratricidal bloodbath depends largely on the success of the talks between the opposition and official Dushanbe. Talks on the subject have long been under way, but the first outlines of the meeting -- it is planned to hold it in Moscow -- have been carved more or less clearly. Delegations of seven people each are to sit down at the conference table, and the opposition has received a guarantee of safety. At UN insistence, the talks should begin without any preliminary conditions. The sides have something to discuss. There is the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees scattered not only in neighboring Afghanistan, but also throughout the former Union, the collapse of the Tajik economy, and the future identify of the state and power structures. But, of course, the most important thing is to put an end to the bloodshed, without which getting out of the rockfall of problems descending on the young independent republic is inconceivable. Obviously, the peace process in Tajikistan is encountering a series of underground rocks. Thus, the radical opposition defending its interests with weapons in hand is insisting that the delegation include Chief Justice Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod, the Muslims' former spiritual leader, and Mukhammad Sharif Khimmatzad, leader of the banned Islamic Revival Party. They are both regarded in Dushanbe as the main culprits in unleashing civil war. For the Tajikistan leadership, sitting down at the same table with them means recognizing them as equals and in part "losing face." Most likely Dushanbe's strategic partner, Uzbekistan, also opposes this twist to the affair. It is hardly fortuitous that a criminal trial began in Tashkent recently of a group of officials of the Central Asia Muslims' spiritual directorate. Arrested nearly a year ago, they are accused not only of large-scale embezzlement, but also of transferring $200,000 to the Tajik Muslim leaders to buy weapons. If the guilt of the "servants of Allah" is proven, and there are few doubts that it will be, then the Turkestan public will be even more convinced of "who is who" and Dushanbe will acquire new trump cards. The Tajikistan authorities obviously consider it acceptable for them to conduct talks with the so-called moderate opposition, which has united in a democratic forces coordination center with headquarters in Moscow. Representatives of "Rastokhez" and other organizations are of course far less involved in the bloody disputes and have nothing to do with the fierce terrorist actions. And it may be expected that official Dushanbe will soon find a common language with them. At the same time the situation in Tajikistan itself is not that simple. It is no secret that a decisive role in the victory of the progovernment forces was played by the National Front, where the Kulyab people set the tone. Today, they have occupied the majority of key posts in the capital and locally, and that has destroyed the traditional balance of power artifically maintained in the past by the Communists. Gornyy Badakhshan remains a zone of heightened tension. The drugs mafia have a strong hold there. The former harmony between Tajiks and local Uzbeks is lacking there. Not to mention the Russians, who are still leaving the Pamir in droves since it has become a danger to their lives. It is characteristic that Tajikistan's opposition and official powers are in favor of good relations with Russia. That of course attests to their realism. Moscow, with its CIS allies, is doomed to be a guarantor of peace in the Pamir. Formally its troops should leave Tajikistan at the end of this year, but that is unlikely if only because, as Pavel Grachev put it, the border with Afghanistan must be held because of the strategic interests of Russia and the CIS. Probably as a reserve option in case the talks fail, at a recent meeting of the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Russia, and Kazakhstan in Dushanbe Andrey Kozyrev suggested convening an international conference with the participation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. But will that suit the opposition, which will most likely observe this meeting from the sidelines? One thing is clear: We must not lose the chance of a political solution to the Tajik problem. That is fraught not only with the danger of the aggravation of the conflict, but also with the danger of its spread throughout Turkestan, dragging into the crater of war new participants, among whom the greatest danger is presented by the Afghan mojahidin and the extremists from the fundamentalist organizations of the Muslim world.
