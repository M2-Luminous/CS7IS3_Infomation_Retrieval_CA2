This is how the minister reacted to an interview Meshkov held with INTERFAX, in which he accused the Crimean MVS and its leadership of corruption and inability to effectively fight crime. At a time of distrust, when the press, your team, and you personally are spreading mass fabrications and rumors that the MVS and its leadership are connected with criminals; when legal nihilism and the lack of control came into being under your administration, it is practically impossible to work -- thus reads a letter written by Oleksandr Plyuta to Yuryy Meshkov.
