(a) The operator of a solid waste disposal site in operation as of September 1, 1984, within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System, having been in continuous operation on January 23, 1995, and who wishes to remain in operation, must submit to the proper Superintendent for review by the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of January 23, 1995, a permit request and an environmental report as described in §6.4(b) (1)&hyph;(9). (b) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in paragraph (a) of this section will not be allowed to continue operations and must immediately fulfill all applicable closure and post-closure care requirements. (c) The Regional Director may approve a request to allow the continued use of a solid waste disposal site only if the operator has shown and the Regional Director finds that: (1) Adverse effects resulting from leachate, noise, odor, vehicular traffic, litter and other activities upon natural and cultural resources will be adequately mitigated; (2) The proposed operator meets all other applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, including permit requirements; (3) The site will no longer be used for the storage, handling or disposal of a solid waste containing: (i) Hazardous waste; (ii) Municipal solid waste incinerator ash; (iii) Lead-acid batteries; (iv) Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) or a PCB Item; (v) A material registered as a pesticide by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.); (vi) Sludge from a waste treatment plant, septic system waste or domestic sewage; (vii) Petroleum, including used crankcase oil from a motor vehicle, or soil contaminated by such products; (viii) Non-sterilized medical waste; (ix) Radioactive materials; or (x) Tires; (4) The proposed closure and post-closure care is sufficient to protect the resources of the National Park System unit from degradation; and (5) The site conforms to all of the restrictions and criteria applicable to the site under 40 CFR 257.3 and 40 CFR part 258, or where applicable, 40 CFR part 240, Guidelines for the Thermal Processing of Solid Waste. (d) If the Regional Director finds that the permit request and the environmental report do not meet the conditions for approval set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Director shall reject the request and notify the proposed operator of the reasons for the rejection. Within 90 calendar days of such notice, the operator of the solid waste disposal site must cease disposing of solid waste at the site. The operator may resume disposing of solid waste only upon submission and approval of a permit request and environmental report that the Regional Director determines meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. (e) Site expansions. (1) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or vertically, is considered a request for a new solid waste disposal site and is subject to the conditions of §6.4(a), except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (2) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or vertically, will be judged by the approval conditions of paragraph (c) of this section if the operator shows that: (i) The solid waste is generated solely from sources within the boundaries of the unit; (ii) The area proposed for site expansion encompasses only nonfederal lands owned or leased by the operator; and (iii) the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail, or adequate water access to any lands outside the unit for all or substantial portions of the year.
