How does the government intend to organize the collection of national taxes. [Issoufou] Following a working session with the major revenue collecting services at the Ministry of Finance, I said that our financial vacation is over. This is justified because we have witnessed a progressive reduction in taxation in our economy since 1987. This has led to a drastic fall in the state's tax revenues. As I have often emphasized, this has led to a fall in taxes collected compared with the total revenue, the gross domestic product, generated in the country. In the early eighties, taxes amounted to 13 percent of the gross domestic product. When we took over the management of the country, taxes hardly made up 7 percent of the gross domestic product. In my general policy statement, I made clear that one of the government's priorities was to streamline the public finance and to boost our economy. The streamlining of the public finance must be accomplished in two phases. The first phase bears regards the increase in revenues earned from taxes and the second concerns the sound management of the state's expenditure. Your question concerns the first phase related to increasing revenue earned from taxation. We plan to increase our fiscal revenue from 7 percent to 15 percent. In the stabilization and economic reform program which we have signed with the IMF...[pauses] in the confirmation agreement which we have signed with the IMF and in the program which we intend to sign to facilitate a strong structural adjustment program, our objective is to be able to collect taxes making 11 percent of the gross domestic product in 1996. How does the government intend to reach this goal? As you know, the government has been able to identify the obstacles that caused the fall in fiscal revenues. One of the greatest obstacles is the domination of our economy by the unofficial sector. We will fight against this. The decision to devalue the CFA franc on 12 January also falls under this category. The devaluation was aimed at effectively reducing fraud which is most commonly used by the informal sector. We will take particular steps to fight fraud. We will also provide the services with the necessary human and material resources accomplish this goal, because, as you know, unfortunately, our fiscal administration organ is understaffed, both the Central Revenue Department and the Customs Service. All these departments are understaffed. The government's objective is to increase the human resources of these departments. There is also the problem of transportation. We cannot control, for example, the long border which we have with Nigeria without vehicles to enable the Customs Service to accomplish this mission. These are therefore the measures to be taken by the government to achieve this goal. [Fadoumouchi] How far have the Niger authorities gotten on negotiations with our mining partners concerning the new price of uranium? [Issoufou] As you know, every year the Government of Niger meets with buyers who are also shareholders in the uranium mining companies, the Akouta Mining Company and the Air Mining Company. Negotiations began at the end of 1993 resulting in a fixed uranium price for 1994. It was fixed at 14,440 CFA per kilogram. These negotiations also led to the fixed levels of production. The level for 1994 was set at 3,000 tonnes. The decision to devalue the CFA franc was made on 12 January. Considering the fact that these mining companies import a great quantity of other materials, they were obliged to review their production costs. Generally, the price of uranium is [word indistinct] price which is fixed according to the production cost of the mining companies. So, as the production costs have changed, the price must also change. Consequently, we have decided to meet with the buyers again to hold fresh discussions in order to fix a final price for uranium considering the devaluation. [Unidentified correspondent] Soon after the devaluation of the CFA franc, the government took a number of steps to exempt some goods from customs duties. This measure must end in April. Have you already thought of the end of April? Have some measures already been taken to prevent the situation from worsening? [Issoufou] You have asked an important question concerning the CFA devaluation. Before answering your question, I would like to remind you of the arguments on which this devaluation decision was founded. Our governments had outlined a program of stabilization and economic reforms. These programs were intended to streamline the public finances and boost the economy through internal adjustment measures. This is why, from the beginning, the program was drawn up on a number of factors, based first on the rate of growth of the gross domestic product which was fixed at around 4 percent. [passage omitted] This is why we have decided to reflect on the issue of devaluation. This is why we have analyzed the positive and negative effects of devaluation. Among these effects is the fall in the purchasing power of the people. This in turn is linked to the subsequent increase in inflation which we estimated to be a level which, fortunately, was not attained. All the analyses made and all the information received from the statistics department have shown that the average inflation is currently around 22 percent. As a first step, we reacted by freezing the prices of essential goods because we felt that the stocks of these commodities were in the stores; they were acquired before the devaluation. So there was no reason for increasing their prices. This is the reason for the government's first decision to freeze prices, but the government cannot keep prices frozen forever. This means that imports must continue under new post-devaluation conditions. This is why we have envisaged a second phase of regulation and administration of prices, and it is this new phase that we are currently in. As you know, the Ministry of Commerce is charged with fixing prices of essential goods to protect consumers and avoid penalizing businessmen. We have also envisaged that at the local level, committees should fix prices as in traditional markets. All this has helped to contain inflation. We know that during the month of Ramadan fasting the inflation was high. We are now witnessing a readjustment of the market and an effective reduction in the rate of inflation. This reduction in the rate of inflation was also obtained because the government has taken a number of fiscal steps to reduce the effects of imported inflation and it is in so doing that the government has reviewed taxes on goods and services. For example, customs duties have been reduced by half. All this was done, not only to protect consumers, but also to protect our enterprises which have a relatively large quantity of intermediary goods to import. These are the measures taken by the government and these measures have yielded extremely positive results because, as I have said, they have helped to contain inflation. [passage omitted]
