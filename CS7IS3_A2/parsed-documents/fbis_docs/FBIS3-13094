FBIS3-13094 "drnes046dd_94019" FBIS-NES-94-046 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Commentary Urges U.S. Pressure on Israel JN0503213894 Baghdad Voice of the PLO in Arabic 1700 GMT 5 Mar 94 JN0503213894 Baghdad Voice of the PLO Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, committed by a group of Zionist settlers against worshipers and the subsequent escalation of undeterred suppression and killing of Palestinian citizens by the Israeli settlers and forces, emphasized the futility of Israeli authorities' allegations about the possibility of adopting measures that restrain--and we do not say stop--the settlers' recklessness. The full right given to the settlers by the Israeli authorities to possess weapons and open fire at Palestinian civilians whenever they are able to do so makes these authorities officially responsible for all crimes and organized killing of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. The international consensus to denounce the crime and condemn its perpetrators and the influential officials within the Israeli leadership who stand behind them showed--though with different degrees, that securing international protection for the Palestinian people under occupation has become a pressing subject which needs urgent and immediate measures to deter the unrestrained Zionist violence. The Zionist violence is threatening--now more than ever-- to torpedo the peace process. Peace cannot be realized in the absence of a reasonable degree of security and peace. The Palestinian people, who have been and are still the victims of Zionist massacres and the continuation of the Zionist occupation of their homeland, have the right to live in peace and to enjoy all their human and national rights away from terrorism and the weapons and repressive practices of the Israeli occupation. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, as called for by the international norms and charters on human rights in times of war, require relentless efforts by all international forces concerned with peace to realize these rights. They should not be satisfied with acquainting themselves with observers reports that reject Israeli violations of these rights. The world was already acquainted with many of these violations, which are increasing daily as as a result of the absence of any international deterrence and because international legitimacy does not carry out its duties, does not shoulder its responsibilities, and does not apply a single yardstick toward the peoples' causes. It a time for action because the explosive situation in occupied Palestine requires a serious position from the international community and the United States, in particular--a position which contributes to dissipating the imminent Zionist danger that exposes the whole peace process to deterioration and setback. The United States has announced more than once its eagerness to render the peace process successful--the process for which the United States is the main sponsor. The United States has repeated this positions scores of times. So can the United States prove the credibility of its ideas by forcing the Israeli Government to accept practical measures that secure international protection for the Palestinian people? The United States should be aware that the Hebron massacre has not only exposed the falsity of Israel's eagerness to realize peace, but has also revealed the dangerousness of the continuation of this situation--we mean the continuation of occupation and the continuation of settlements and settlers. This question does not go along with the peace process, peace spirit, and the efforts to establish peace. It is time for the United States to be aware that this stage requires adding deeds to words, keeping away from ambiguity, and resorting to clarity of positions--as they are and as they should be--active positions against crimes, terrorism, and occupation that deter the killers, provide protection for the Palestinian people, and keep the road to peace open until its noble objectives are realized.
