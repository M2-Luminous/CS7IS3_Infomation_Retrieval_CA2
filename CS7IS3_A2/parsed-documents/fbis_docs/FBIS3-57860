"I find Klaus Kinkel's offer to meet with Zhirinovskiy disconcerting," said Peter Hintze, the secretary general of the CDU in an interview published in the daily Berlin newspaper B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG]. "It would be a grave error to minimize or even worse to politically boost (Zhirinovskiy) by organizing public discussion with him or by inviting him for a television debate. "No reasonable political official should allow himself to be tempted," he added. Kinkel said Monday that he would be willing to meet with Zhirinovskiy, who heads Russia's far-right Liberal Democratic Party and who was refused a visa to Germany last week. "Personally, I'm not scared of talking with him," Kinkel said. "We can't deny the fact that based on the number of votes he garnered he does have a following in Russia." Zhirinovskiy, who was expelled from Bulgaria last week and is unlikely to be welcomed into France where authorities said they would also deny him a visa, threatened Germany with "a third world war" after his visa application was turned down. On Monday he sought to correct his statement by telling a German television station that he was "a friend of Germany." He is expected to submit another visa application following an invitation to attend a congress of European far-right parties in Cologne next month.
