Ross reported that, in the first stage, approximately 485,000 union leaders will discuss ways to solve the internal financial problem, one of the most complex and important problems with regard to the island's serious economic situation. In statements to the local press, the worker leader said the workers' opinions must be gathered because "they are the backbone of everything that may be done with regard to this topic." He also mentioned that, at the last session of the Cuban Parliament -- 27 and 28 December -- President Fidel Castro said none of the measures that Cuba may need to adopt can be decided without the support and consensus of the workers. The Cuban deputies did not reach agreements because -- as was learned -- they previously decided to carry out a profound consultation and clarification process among the entire population and later convoke an extraordinary meeting of the parliament to continue debating the affair, with a higher level of information. For the parliament members and the country's directorate the meeting served as a way to reflect and exchange ideas on how to improve the existing financial imbalance. In this regard, it was learned that the excess circulating currency amounted to over 10 billion pesos (the same amount in dollars, according to the official exchange rate), the subsidies due to losses in 1993 amounted to 4.6 billion pesos, and the state budget deficit amounted to 4.2 billion pesos, most of it in subsidies. Of those, the excess circulating currency is the most harmful as it contributes to decreasing efficiency, decreasing productivity, as well as declining labor discipline. Some of the solutions viewed by the Cuban deputies were: changing the currency, implementing a new tax system and price policy, as well as charging for some services that are currently offered gratuitously.
