FBIS3-28787 "dreas028_a_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Defense Budget Discussed OW1002095094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0939 GMT 10 Feb 94 OW1002095094 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry proposed to the cabinet on Thursday [10 February] a fiscal 1994 defense budget of 4,678.8 billion yen, up 0.8 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 budget and the smallest increase in 34 years. In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the ministry set aside 882 billion yen to acquire frontline weapons, such as four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767 airborne warning and control system (AWACS) planes, ministry officials said. The figure represented a 0.2 percent rise over fiscal 1993. Of the contract-based figure, 24.1 billion yen will be used as a down payment, with the remaining 857.9 billion yen payment to be deferred in coming years, the officials said. Pressed by sagging state revenues, the ministry "did its utmost efforts to curb the Defense Agency-requested increases in frontline weaponry in view of the generally favorable international situation and the very serious fiscal conditions," an official said. The agency initially requested an overall defense outlay of 4,734.5 billion yen for the fiscal year starting April 1, up 1.95 percent over fiscal 1993 that ends on March 31. Despite a recent government proposal to trim levels of defense outlays in coming years, the ministry is aware of "the need to prevent possible policy decisions from dashing the possibility of future defense outlay increases," an official said. He was referring to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's suggestion last year to review the level of defense spending and consider defense budget cuts. In view of that, the ministry sanctioned a Defense Agency request to purchase an antimissile Patriot interceptor system and a sophisticated computer system to enhance the intercepting capability of the Japanese military's armory of Patriot missiles to counter a threat from North Korea's "Nodong-1" missiles, they said. The Patriot missile system, including a radar and flight control system, will cost 33.5 billion yen, while the computer and computer software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said. The computer system will enhance the capability of two of Japan's 26 Patriot missile firing units to the level of the "PAC-2" Patriots, which were used by U.S. troops during the 1991 Gulf War to repel Iraqi Scud missiles, they said. One firing unit comprises four missiles and five launchers. The Defense Agency has been pushing for purchases of an improved version of the Patriots to counter the threat of North Korea's missiles, which the 1993 Defense White Paper warned "will be able to reach most Japanese territory if Pyongyang deploys it to specific areas." The draft defense budget accounts for 0.947 percent of Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994. The ministry boosted its allocations to help U.S. Forces in Japan. The figure was increased from 400.9 billion yen in fiscal 1993 to "more than 425 billion yen" in fiscal 1994, said Hirofumi Gomi, a senior official who helped draft the budget. Of the 425 billion yen, the ministry allocated 123.4 billion yen toward "75 percent" of total labor costs of the some 22,000 Japanese employees working at U.S. bases in Japan, utilities and other costs, he said. The spending is mandated under the 1960 Japan-U.S. Security Pact and the 1991 pact known as the Special Measures Agreement. The outlays are meant to cement the security solidarity of the two allies.
