Nevertheless, the fight for control over this region has intensified sharply of late. The reason for this is the departure of Igor Ustinov from the post of chairman of the administrative committee (AC) of the Nakhodka FEZ after his election as a deputy to the State Duma of Russia. With the aim of not permitting the appointment of Aleksandr Kotikov, the director of the department of investments of the administrative committee, to the position of FEZ manager, the city administration accused Ustinov's "team" of corruption and incompetence. In this connection, a regular commission of the Maritime administration of the tax service yesterday initiated a check on the financial activity of the FEZ administrative committee. [begin boxed item] Economic Potential of the Nakhodka FEZ --four ice-free ports --70 percent of the port capacities of the Far East --50 percent of the port capacities of Russia --20 percent of the export-import operations of Russia --272 joint enterprises --48 enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital --$128 million of foreign investments --2,000 new enterprises in two years [end boxed item] The Nakhodka FEZ today can be characterized as a zone of clashes of interests of a whole number of major corporate and authoritative Russian and foreign structures. Among them are the city and kray administrations, a consortium of South Korean and American firms, and large international and interregional associations and corporations associated with them. However, the former unity in lobbying for governmental decrees and laws necessary for the development of the FEZ, which has continued over the course of two years, changed to tough confrontation after everyone was faced with the need to determine the candidate to the post of chairman of the administrative committee--in other words, to decide the question concerning to whom in these influential groups the FEZ leadership will belong. As early as last year the Nakhodka administration took specific steps for the purpose of replacing the functioning administrative committee of the FEZ and removing Igor Ustinov from the job. Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the Nakhodka city administration, sent a letter to the apparatus of the president and the Council of Ministers in which Ustinov was accused of "wrecking work" and "corruption." The result of this step was a whole series of financial and tax inspections of the activity of the administrative committee. Despite the fact that the operating commissions did not confirm cases of violation of financial and tax discipline, a commission of the Maritime Kray tax service office began another check on the activity of the FEZ administrative committee. The absence of cases of violation in the activity of the "Ustinov" administrative committee can only indicate that the usual fight for control over the activity of commercial structures was going on, including with the participation of foreign capital. The fight between various groups reached its apogee after Igor Ustinov relinquished his authority in connection with his election as deputy of the State Duma. The vacated position was most realistically vied for by Aleksandr Kotikov (director of the department of investments of the FEZ administrative committee), Sergey Dudnik (general director of the Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy), and Gennadiy Ukrainchenko (first deputy mayor of the city of Nakhodka), who represented the interests of various authoritative and corporate groups. As a result of a series of negotiations, the opposing sides were unable to reach an agreement, and the tension only mounted. Then followed the removal of the candidacy of Gennadiy Ukrainchenko, with the subsequent concurrence of Sergey Dudnik to subordinate the administrative committee of the FEZ to the city authorities in the event he is appointed its head. The next step was the adoption last week of a joint decision of the city administrations of Nakhodka and Partizansk concerning the appointment of Sergey Dudnik to the post of chairman of the administrative committee. Thus Ustinov's "team" suffered a defeat. The most negative result of this collision can be considered the fact that the interest of the city authorities in the future development of Nakhodka as a free economic zone was replaced by an apparatus fight for authority over the territory. The previous administration of the zone planned to return privileges to FEZ enterprises on the basis of conferring on it the new status of a "free economic territory." The draft decree on the experiment, which was calculated for 10 years, was developed by experts of the government and the former Supreme Soviet of Russia jointly with representatives of the administrative committee of the Nakhodka FEZ. In accordance with the draft, the territory could acquire a single governing organ and a single legislative authority consisting of representatives of the two cities and one agricultural rayon. However, as recent events have shown, the local administration does not intend to share authority in a region subordinate to it with some other organ of administration. In principle, this kind of position fully satisfies the federal departments, mainly the Ministry of Finance and the state tax service. The fact is that in the event of the appearance of an independent organ of administration on the territory of the FEZ (as this was before with the administrative committee of the Nakhodka FEZ), the enterprises, under whose aegis they are established, are granted tax benefits, and problems would arise with the receipt of taxes in the full amount. However, when everything is lumped into a common city pot, it is very difficult to show who is exempt from taxes and who is not. A precedent can serve as an example, when the regional tax service after the adoption of the Law "On the Customs Tariff" demanded from all joint enterprises operating on the territory of the FEZ payment of the full amount of taxes for two years in the sum of 2.5 billion rubles [R]. In addition, the favorable tax system that operated for joint enterprises before the adoption of the law was not taken into consideration. The recent events in Nakhodka have already led to concrete results: Work has been stopped in the government on the "free economic territory" project, and many foreign investors have postponed negotiations on investment projects for an indefinite period.
