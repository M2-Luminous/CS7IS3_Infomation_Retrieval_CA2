On the horizon is the coming into being of a new model of the world. In overall features that model must be based on cooperation among states and, naturally, must include the Russia Federation as an integral part. Nevertheless there is something not quite right in this rosy haze, in any case for us Russians. Too many questions have accumulated to make it possible to ponder on them aloud. But the most important point is the following: on the part of certain of our partners, unlike the rather good declarations, one actually senses the deaf imperception of Russia's legal rights in the international arena, which are equal to other inalienable rights of Russia. Such as those that the carrying out of which, for themselves, these partners reckon in the rank of natural national interests. Such as those that Russia intends to promote not in order to bypass the generally accepted behavioral norms for states, but strictly within their confines. In this situation it is apparently beneficial to prepare a business memorandum for our partners (as well as for ourselves) that is aimed at removing any misunderstandings. A memorandum, first of all, about the healthy and constructive, in our view, strivings of Russia in the outside world, and, secondly, about why it is difficult for us to accept our partners' lack of readiness to take them into consideration. The first is, indisputably, the right of the Russian Federation to be reborn as a great power, the right to eliminate the frustrated position in which it has found itself. This task is not a challenge to anyone, but it is a defense of national interests. Situations that were extremely similar after World War II were De Gaulle's course aimed at restoring the grandeur of France and the restoration by China of its positions as a great power. No one saw anything unnatural in this. Therefore one would scarcely think that it is possible to agree with the fact that similar strivings by Russia are being treated today as imperial vanities. Moreover, this is being presented on the level of the most highly placed foreign-political leaders of the recent past and as a conceptual theory: allegedly the "constant threat" against the West is immanently inherent through the centuries to any Russia, "tsarist or Soviet" (H. Kissinger), or, as a subvariant, to "Great Russian imperialism" (Z. Brezinski). What are unacceptable are the sometimes cutting, albeit on another level, expectations that are directly hostile to Russia. Unfortunately, there are plenty of examples. A research study by the Carnegie Foundation in Washington that was published on the eve of last year predicted that the Russian Federation would not survive the year 1993 and would collapse. The London ECONOMIST, in its turn, gave the following predictions on the same subject: "This disintegration is not necessarily bad... Everything depends on whether that disintegration will be orderly." The second is Russia's inalienable right to security that is equal with other powers. For every country the primary guarantee of security is to assure that there are no complications on the part of neighbors, and that their territory does not become a corridor through which third forces can travel. The removal of this problem by political methods, on the basis of voluntary cooperation, is universally positive in its consequences. That was the situation with the understanding between France and Germany, which countries undertook, after confrontation in two world wars, to establish smooth bilateral relations The United States and Canada, which also waged war with one another at one time, refused to reinforce their common border, actually integrating their military organizations. That is their right. The striving by the Russian Federation to prevent at least a movement backward in its own security is therefore logical. Hence the desire to preserve the reliable ties in this area that developed among the current CIS countries. This is the sphere of the previous single military structure, and one sees preserved in it both the important strong points of Russia itself, and the joint interest of the CIS participants in taking joint action. But wherever, as in the Baltic and East Europe, cooperation in guaranteeing security is rejected by the other side, Russia proceeds from the critical minimum. Namely, not to be faced by a situation in which the former republics of the USSR and its previous allies are included in a military bloc of which Russia is not a member. The third is the legal right of the Russian Federation to lack of discrimination in the world economy. Russians do not feel that someone else is supposed to pull their country out of its current difficulties. This is their own task. But what Russia naturally expects if the proposal is made that it become integrated into the world economy is to have completely equal conditions. The time has come to remove the trade, economic, and other barriers. But, instead of this, quota limitations sometimes appear. And it is completely improper to strive to use our problems as a lever for exerting pressure. Just as, according to the Russian Ministry of Finance, the creditor banks in the London Club would like to pay off our debts by means of the forced sale of Russia's property abroad. Finally, the Russian Federation has the undisputed right to have its special interests taken into consideration in the international situations that are important to it. The specific concerns of any country are more the norm than an exception. It is only important for good will to be manifested and for the partner's interests to be taken into consideration. Just as, for example, it is typical for the relations between the United States and Japan. Thus, the present factual situation can scarcely cause satisfaction. In the proclaimed postconfrontational world it is still a long way to truly parity partner relations, at least to the extent that this pertains to respect for the rights and interests of the Russian Federation.
