But, cautioned Nong Keqiang, head of the Foreign Co-operation Division under the Ministry of Machinery Industry, controlling stakes in key enterprises with large shares of the domestic market must be held by Chinese. In the past year, many multinational corporations, including Siemens, ABB, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric, Linde and Hitachi, have come to China looking for co-operative partners. Their targets are large and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the industry. The Ministry of Machinery Industry also hopes to renovate these State enterprises with foreign technology capital and management, Nong said. However, most foreign companies interested in turning these enterprises into joint ventures want majority stakes. They also ask for control of sales and marketing and deduct a percentage of sales revenue for research and development costs. This will hinder joint ventures in developing new products, Nong said. In order to maintain State control, he said, the ministry has ruled that Chinese partners must have the final say when turning key enterprises in basic industries into joint ventures. Nong said the ministry will intensify its efforts to raise foreign capital this year to promote industry-wide development. Foreign investment will be channeled into basic machinery products and components and into power generating equipment, which are the industry's priorities. Because of the country's massive demand for energy, many foreign companies wish to set up joint ventures to produce power generators and transmission equipment. Nong said China will open part of its domestic market to attract foreign investment. However, he said that if a large State enterprise is turned into a joint venture, no less than 70 percent of the stake must remain in Chinese hands. If part of an enterprise is turned into a joint venture or a new venture is launched, foreign companies can own the majority of its shares. Foreign companies can also hold controlling stakes if they bring in advanced technology that China lacks. China's production of power generating equipment is dominated by three giants in Heilongjiang and Sichuan provinces and Shanghai. The Dongfang Power Station Equipment Corp, in Sichuan, will set up several joint ventures with Siemens AG of Germany to produce thermal power generating equipment. Parts of the Shanghai Power Station Equipment Corp will be turned into joint ventures with the Westinghouse Electric Corp, which will invest nearly $90 million. The Harbin Power Station Equipment Corp in Heilongjiang, China's largest manufacturer in this field, is planning to establish a joint venture with General Electric Co to produce gas turbines.
