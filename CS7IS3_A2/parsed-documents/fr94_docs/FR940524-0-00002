FR940524-0-00002 FR940524-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Parts 959 and 979 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;959&hyph;3FIR] Onions Grown in South Texas, and Melons Grown in South Texas; Revision of Continuing Handling Regulations AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule that relaxed the handling regulations for South Texas onions and melons by allowing handlers the option to submit a shipment release form to Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) authorities at road guard stations. The shipment release form provides adequate information to enable the TDA to determine whether the onions and melons have been inspected and meet marketing order requirements, thereby helping ensure compliance with order provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Belinda G. Garza, McAllen Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 1313 East Hackberry, McAllen, TX 78501, telephone 210&hyph;682&hyph;2833, or Robert F. Matthews, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, telephone 202&hyph;690&hyph;0464. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 959 (7 CFR part 959), as amended, regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas, and Marketing Order No. 979 (7 CFR part 979), regulating the handling of melons grown in South Texas, hereinafter referred to as the ``orders.'' These orders are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are 38 handlers of South Texas onions subject to regulation under Marketing Order No. 959 and 97 onion producers in the production area. There are 19 handlers of South Texas melons subject to regulation under Marketing Order No. 979 and 40 melon producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The South Texas Onion and Melon Committees (committees) met November 9 and December 9, 1993, respectively, and discussed procedures for clearing shipments of onions and melons at road guard stations operated by the TDA. The committees unanimously recommended revising paragraphs (d)(2) of ยง959.322 and (c)(2) of ยง979.304, respectively, to make the regulations consistent with current industry practice. Previously, the regulations specified that onion and melon shipments must be accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate or other documentary evidence indicating that the shipment had been inspected and met marketing order requirements and that such documents be presented to TDA road guard authorities. This rule continues to allow shipments of onions and melons to be accompanied by a shipment release form issued by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service which would be surrendered to authorities. The shipment release form identifies truck lots to which inspection certificates are applicable and certifies that the shipment of onions or melons has been inspected and meets the respective marketing order requirements. Thus, the shipment release form may continue to be used as proof of such clearance when presented at a road guard station.
