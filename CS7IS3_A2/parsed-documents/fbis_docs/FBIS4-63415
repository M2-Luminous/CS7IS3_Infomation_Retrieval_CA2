We Will Know the Answer in the Fall"] [Text] Will Russia be buying grain abroad this year or will it make do with its own resources? Despite the frequent statements by Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha to the effect that there are enough grain reserves in the country to enable us to do without imports, this issue is keeping Western business circles in a state of tension. For example, the British weekly PUBLIC LEDGER has stated that "some Russians" made an appearance on the U.S. market at the beginning of May and "intimated that they require grain immediately" (250,000 tonnes of durum wheat and 150,000 tonnes of soft wheat). These Russians were Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of the "Roskhleboprodukt" RKK [expansion unknown], and Aleksandr Belik, president of the "Eksportkhleb" Joint-Stock Company. Petr Tolstopyatenko, deputy director of the "Zerno" firm (the former Main Administration for Grain Purchases) confirmed that this trip did take place, but it does not provide an answer to the question of whether or not Russia will import grain. It is impossible to give an answer to this question until spring sowing has been completed, which will not be before 1 June at the earliest. In his opinion, the prospects for the Russian harvest are good: Crops sown in the fall have wintered well, and the area sown in the spring is getting bigger without any exhortations or goading, since the production of this sort of wheat is highly profitable. According to Tolstopyatenko, the country possesses both "emergency" state reserves of grain (approximately 18 million tonnes) and nonstate reserves. Thus, kolkhozes and sovkhozes have been holding 700,000 tonnes of wheat in storage at their elevators since last harvest. There are reserves of millet for making course-ground millet, oats, and corn for making groats. So rumors about the need for immediate supplies have been exaggerated, most likely by the Western press. At least, Leonid Cheshinskiy did not recognize himself in the story as it was portrayed by the Western press. Andrey Sizov, general director of the "SovEkon" research center, explained that L. Cheshinskiy and A. Belik did indeed visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the beginning of May and asked the price of U.S. grain. But they were talking about a commercial deal rather than state purchases. The independent firm "Roskhleboprodukt," pursuing its private interests, wanted to buy 400,000 tonnes of wheat for its own money without taking out government loans to do so, which used to be the norm. Asked why the corporation should wish to purchase grain abroad when, according to A. Zaveryukha, reserves of home-grown grain total 18 million tonnes and there is probably even more stored away in kolkhoz barns, Andrey Sizov replied that the corporation is doubtless making preparations for a coming grain price war. This very day the Russian Agriculture Ministry announced that agricultural producers are asking 180,000-200,000 rubles per tonne of grain. If the high cost of transportation and storage is added to this, Russian grain could work out more expensive than grain from overseas: The Russians were offering the Americans grain at $100 a tonne (including freight). All the indications are that "Roskhleboprodukt" is looking for a cheap commodity to beat down the price of grain from the new harvest on the Russian market. It is true that the Americans did not sell their grain at $100 a tonne, thinking this to be too cheap. But there is also the European market, where grain is traditionally more expensive while transportation is cheaper. In Andrey Sizov's opinion, "Roskhleboprodukt's" emergence on the world market as an independent commercial organization is well timed: The state would be obliged to purchase U.S. grain since it is bound by credit relations. But the fact that the market can be exploited is in itself gratifying. And so A. Zaveryukha's assurances remain valid, he is responsible for state reserves and has the right to draw his own conclusions. The "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation has announced its presence in the world market on the basis of its own commercial interests, the harvest forecasts will be clarified at the beginning of June, and we will get a precise answer to the question of whether our country can do without grain imports in the fall. According to data from "SovEkon," the chances of exporting Russian grain abroad are not very great. For example, the country has small rye reserves, but rye is not much in demand on the world market. Reorienting ourselves toward imports from CIS countries is also an unreliable option: Last year our trading partner Kazakhstan delivered 1 million tonnes of grain under the intergovernmental agreement instead of the promised 3 million tonnes. Judging by the weather and fuel problems that have been dogging the Kazakh harvest, supplies are unlikely to increase this year.
