The report "does not correspond to reality and is wishful thinking of reporters," General Vitaliy Yakovlev told TASS on Thursday commenting on a Wednesday report of the "SEGONYA" daily. "No train with nuclear charges has departed from the neighbouring country to Russia so far," he added, but expressed hope that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament will begin soon. Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear weapons under an agreement signed with Russia and the United States in Moscow in January. According to Yakovlev, there are nearly 2,000 nuclear charges in Ukraine at present. Their safety level causes great concern of experts and delays in their transportation to Russia can result in unpredictable consequences, he warned. Russia guarantees to Ukraine safety of all work during transportation and scrapping of the nuclear weapons, according to the general.
