China is a country rich in marine energy resources. Based on current technical levels, China has about 400,000 to 500,000MW of renewable marine energy including 100,000MW of tidal energy, 70,000MW of wave energy, 30,000MW of marine current energy, 150,000MW of seawater temperature differential energy, and 110,000MW of salinity differential energy. Currently, with the exception of a few small tidal power stations and miniature wave power generators, the utilization of China's marine energy is basically nil. In the present situation of energy resource shortages and continual development of new technologies, many countries are extremely concerned with developing marine energy. In the long term, mankind will march toward the seas and will inevitably make full use of marine energy. For tidal power generation alone, France completed the 240MW La Rance Tidal Power Station in 1967; its operational condition so far has been excellent. Subsequently, the former Soviet Union completed the (Jisiluo) Tidal Power Station with an installed generating capacity of 2MW and Canada completed the Annapolis Preliminary Tidal Power Station with a single unit capacity of 20MW in 1983 to develop large-scale tidal power generation for the 4,000MW of power in the Bay of Fundy. England, India, Korea, and other countries also plan to build large-scale tidal power stations. The United States, Japan, France, and others are now speeding up research on marine temperature differential power generation and are now conducting MW-grade power station experiments. Norway and Denmark, as well as England and Japan, which are renowned for marine research, have also established several wave power generation devices of varying sizes. China has built seven small tidal power stations along its southeastern coast with a total installed generating capacity of 8.3MW. They include the Jiangxia Tidal Power Station in Zhejiang's Wenling County, the most representative, which now has five generators with a total capacity of 3.2MW having an operational arrangement utilizing bidirectional power generation for rising and falling tides using bulb-type generators. Their operating situation has been excellent since they were placed into operation in 1980. Besides generating electricity, this power station has also facilitated communication on both sides of the bay, enclosed over 5,000 mu of farmland and orchards for reclamation, and developed the reservoir breeding industry, so the overall economic benefits have been significant. For this reason, after a Korean delegation visited Jiangxi Tidal Power Station in 1991, they immediately decided to study China's experiences in developing tidal power stations, and in 1992, following several civilian technology exchanges between the two countries, the Koreans finally requested that their government approve the long-planned (Jialulin) Bay Tidal Power Station (400MW) program be turned over to a group of Chinese experts for a feasibility discussion, and they plan to utilize Chinese technology and equipment. This is the world's biggest tidal power station to date. The situation outlined above shows that China has a rather good hydropower technology foundation and tidal power station practice and experience and that accelerated development of tidal power generation, especially in the economically developed coastal areas that have relative power shortages, is essential. Through integration with the state's improvement of our national territory and preferential development of coastal islands, resettlement to develop barren islands with no permanent resident population must first of all provide them with supplies of energy resources and fresh water. If we can rationally utilize all types of marine energy and renewable solar energy, wind energy, and biomass energy, adapt to local conditions, and persevere, this will benefit our nation and our people.
