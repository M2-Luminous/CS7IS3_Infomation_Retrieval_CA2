The sentence came just two weeks after the police officer who beat up Yan was given just a one-year suspended sentence. Yan's detention has been cited by Beijing's dissident community as yet another effort by the authorities to muzzle pro-democracy activists, who had championed the legislator. The Beijing Municipal Labour-Education Administrative Committee handed down Yan's sentence on Tuesday after he had been found guilty of stealing a new Forever-brand bicycle, worth about 400 yuan (HK$355), from outside a Beijing University canteen on September 17 last year. The committee did not say why Yan had been given such a severe penalty for a relatively trivial offence but yesterday's BEIJING DAILY described the legislator as an "inveterate evil-doer" who basically deserved everything he got. The newspaper said that the outrage expressed by many people at the lenient treatment of the police officer who beat up Yan reflected an inadequate understanding of the law. The officer acted strictly within the law in forcibly detaining an "unreasonable and argumentative" Yan after he "caused chaos" on a public bus by demanding to be let off in between designated stops, the paper said. Yan, a painter associated with the artistic community at Beijing's Old Summer Palace, had become something of a cause celebre in the capital after he took the police officer to court last year. Analysts said the sentencing of Yan and lenient treatment of the police officer was probably designed to act as a warning to the people of Beijing not to challenge the authority of the police and the Government. In January, more than 300 of the nation's leading intellectuals put their names to a petition addressed to National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi demanding an investigation into the abuse of police power as evidenced in the Yan case. Leaders of the petition included Beijing University law lecturer Yuan Hongbing and law graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who were arrested in early March for masterminding another petition demanding improvements in labour rights. "The authorities are taking it out on Yan because the Yan-related petition is seen as the one that galvanised the pro-democracy movement this Year," a source said.
