Moreover, Di Tella denied that there will be a "witch-hunt" among foreign residents in Argentina, in search of presumed subversive elements. The foreign minister said that President Carlos Menem was already concerned about the issue "before", especially because there were reports that members of several guerrilla groups which were active in the 1970's had sought refuge in Mexico and could have joined the EZLN. "Many ex-guerrillas have been absorbed by the policy of democracy, others have not," the minister said in remarks to the newspaper CLARIN. He said that the information being studied by the government was not provided by his Mexican counterpart. He also denied that the CIA had provided information on this matter, although he admitted that there had been an "exchange of information via diplomatic channels with the State Department and other Latin American governments." He said that in the case of EZLN uprising in Chiapas, "there is a very important organization which was based on a social problem." He added that the Argentine socioeconomic situation is "totally different" from that of Mexico. Although "there is the possibility of a subversive infiltration" in some Latin American countries, he explained that that is not the case in Argentina. He thus ruled out the possibility that the alert given by the executive branch to the intelligence services on a supposed subversive outbreak could prompt "a witch-hunt." However, yesterday some 30 illegal Peruvian residents were deported for "usurping a house" at 600 Senillosa Street, although there are still two weeks before 31 January, the legal deadline established by the Immigration Department for the regularization of foreigners who are in an illegal status.
