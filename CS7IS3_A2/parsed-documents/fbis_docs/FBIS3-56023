He added that the plan is an alternative to the expansion of NATO which East European nations want to join. "An approach has been selected which is oriented towards the development of partnership relations and practical cooperation with all European CSCE member-states, including in the East of the continent, and which provides equal possibilities for all potential partners," Karasin said. Russia plans to hold a detailed exchange of opinions with all European states on the results of the NATO meeting in Brussels in order "to determine the optimal ways of maintaining a truly pan-European cooperation in the field of stability and security," according to the spokesman who added that prospects of such cooperation will be discused during the Russian-U.S. summit. Karasin however explained that "the Russian-U.S. dialogue on the issue has nothing in common with any separate agreements between the two powers." This is only a search for such instruments of strengthening the European stability which would reliably guarantee the interests of all European states without exclusions, regardless of their size, georgraphic situation, economic or military potential."
