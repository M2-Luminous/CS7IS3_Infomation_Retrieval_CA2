Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce Sulayman al-Sulayyim yesterday in Beijing. Al-Sulayyim is leading a large business delegation to seek a greater share of the Chinese market, especially the petrochemical sector. His visit lasts until Saturday. Saudi Arabia had a deficit of about $400 million in trade with China last year. "We will seek to balance our bilateral trade in a positive fashion. We are in favour of increasing imports to achieve that effect," said Wu. China has agreed in principle to buy 3.5 million tons of oil from Saudi Arabia each year beginning in 1995. Wu said China attaches great importance to developing trade with the Gulf nation. "We welcome Saudi Arabia to invest in China in any form," she said. Worldwide investors have pledged $220 billion in 174,000 projects in China so far. but Saudi Arabia has yet to gain a large share. Wu said she hoped the Gulf nation will be part of the international investment boom in China. Al-Sulayyim said good opportunities exist for bilateral cooperation in small- and medium-sized industrial projects.
