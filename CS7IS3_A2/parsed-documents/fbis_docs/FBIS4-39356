FBIS4-39356 "drsov110_i_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 CENTRAL ASIA Kazakhstan Nazarbayev Proposes Formation of `Eurasian Union' Nazarbayev Proposes Formation of `Eurasian Union' LD0706154294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1455 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706154294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has sent to the leaders of CIS countries a draft document on the formation of an Eurasian Union, a new integrating association of post-Soviet countries. The plan INTERFAX has at its disposal implies that potential members of the union should sign a treaty forming the legal and organizational prerequisites "for deepening integration with the purpose of forming an economic, currency, and political union." According to the plan, associated membership in the union is not permitted. The termination of hostilities is one of the preliminary conditions for entering the union. The preamble of the document says that the potential of the CIS has not been exhausted. The Commonwealth plays a positive role in offering a legal framework for relations between its member-countries. However, according to the Kazakh leader, the existing structure of CIS bodies does not allow to fully benefit from the potential of integration. Nazarbayev believes that economic integration prompts the need to develop political institutions having sufficient powers. Among such supernational political structures of the future union Nazarbayev named the Eurasian parliament -- the supreme consultative body formed of an equal number of MP's from member-countries or through direct elections. The main purpose of the parliament would be the coordination of laws of member-countries guaranteeing the development of a common economic space, social security and human rights. Under the plan the decisions of parliament would come into force after their ratification by member-countries of the union. Nazarbayev also suggested forming a permanent executive committee. He feels that a ministry for the Eurasian Union should be set up in each country for better coordination and more effective joint activities. The plan sent to CIS leaders also implies the formation of several supernational economic bodies such as the economic commission of the Council of the Heads of State that would work out the strategy of economic reforms, a commission for raw materials that would coordinate and approve prices and quotas of exported raw materials and fuel as well as gold and other precious metals. An international investment bank would be set up as well as a commission for a common unit for settlements. Nazarbayev also suggests setting up a commission for international financial and industrial groups and joint ventures and economic arbitration. The latter would settle disputed matters and impose fines. In keeping with Nazarbayev's plan the Eurasian union would have a common defence space and coordinated defence activities. For the purpose a treaty on joint efforts to strengthen the armed forces of member-countries and on the protection of the common borders would be signed. A collective peace-keeping force would be formed and the UN Security Council would be asked to give the contingent an appropriate status. "All union members, except Russia, would keep their nuclear-free status," the document says. Nazarbayev favors the formation of an environmental fund of member-nations. The plan also speaks of the need for an international treaty on dumping nuclear wastes. Among the long-term joint programs for restoring the environment Nazarbayev named the Aral sea, Chernobyl, and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test ground. Under the plan, if a citizen of a union member-country chooses to move to another Eurasian country, he or she will automatically become citizen of the new country of residence. It is suggested to make Russian the official language of the union and a city near the dividing line between Europe and Asia, for instance Kazan or Samara, the capital of the union. IF [INTERFAX] Note: Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a Eurasian Union during his Moscow visit last March. CIS leaders have regarded the idea with reserve, except the Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev who welcomed it. It was not discussed at the latest CIS summit in April. In a recent statement for newsmen the press secretary of the Kazakh leader Nurlan Danenov said Nazarbayev's idea became the subject of an incorrect political debate which is allegedly aimed at driving a wedge between CIS leaders due to their different approaches to Nazarbayev's concept. Analysts believe that Nazarbaev's plan will hardly become the subject of an official discussion of CIS leaders in the nearest future. Neither do they foresee great changes in the attitude of most Commonwealth leaders to the plan despite Nazarbayev's assurances that the union would be only an additional integration structure, not an alternative to the CIS.
