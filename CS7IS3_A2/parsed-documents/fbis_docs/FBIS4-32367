He told his political opponents in the so-called constructive opposition that "imitation is not forbidden." He recalled that during the last Sejm the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) when in opposition had supported some of the proposals of the government. The basic pre-condition for the success of the strategy was the lowering of inflation, Borowski said. That was why the government had to find sources of financing its budget deficit beyond the banking sector. He said that the SLD thought that foreign capital was such a source. Borowski said the SLD did not favour lowering taxes for the most well off. He added that the constructive opposition should remember that some of the points in the strategy would be ready for implementation in three years time, when the present opposition may form the government. Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) said the strategy created a harmony between the free market and state interventionism. The strategy was based on factors dependent on people not on capital. All the parties which left the Sejm two weeks ago when Finance Minister Kolodko introduced the strategy maintained that the strategy was too general and full of wishful thinking. Tadeusz Syryjczyk of the Freedom Union (UW) saw in the strategy a realism in evaluating the recent past, common sense in microeconomic matters and in agricultural policy. However he added that there were also aspects to the strategy which raised some doubts. He was not sure if the idea of a management board for state property was not aimed against privatisation. Neither was it clear what role local government was to play. In addition the strategy did not say whether there was too much or too little welfare expenditure. Labour Union (UP) leader Ryszard Bugaj said that the strategy contained no real macroeconomic or industrial policy. He said that there were too much tax relief for the already rich and there was no provision made for increasing pensions or the wages of public sector workers. Wojciech Blasiak of the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) said that the strategy meant the "Latinisation" of Poland. He said that continuing the policy imposed by the IMF and the World Bank meant that it was a strategy for "dependent, peripheral economic development." Jerzy Eysymontt of the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) said his grouping was treating the strategy as a declaration of intent but had serious doubts concerning privatisation, investment finance and export. The BBWR would still be considering how to vote on the strategy, he added.
