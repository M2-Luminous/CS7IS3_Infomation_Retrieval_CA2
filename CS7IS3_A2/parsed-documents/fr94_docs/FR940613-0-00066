FR940613-0-00066 FR940613-0-00015 In the language of the regulation we are adopting today, requiring an emergency vehicle to unload separable pieces of equipment would ``compromise the intended use of the vehicle.'' Emergency vehicles meet the definition of a nondivisible vehicle or load. Spent Nuclear Fuel: The Pennsylvania DOT pointed out that the FHWA informed the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials several years ago that the FHWA regards overweight casks used to move spent nuclear fuel as nondivisible. This determination was not reflected in the SNPRM. The casks used to transport spent nuclear materials, especially nuclear fuel, are extraordinarily strong and heavy, both to prevent a release in case the transporter vehicle was involved in an accident and to block radiation that would penetrate lighter materials. Some of these containment devices can make a vehicle overweight even before the nuclear materials are loaded. These vehicles cannot be used for any other cargo or reduced to legal weights without frustrating their purpose. A new provision has therefore been added which essentially states that specially designed casks used to move spent nuclear fuel meet the definition of a nondivisible load. Other Issues: The Pennsylvania DOT suggested that the SNPRM be amended to acknowledge that both the President and State governors [H]ave the executive authority to temporarily modify any vehicle size or weight law or regulation, including the nondivisible criteria, in order to provide for emergency relief to promote the general welfare and public safety, without threat of Federal sanction after the emergency. While the FHWA would not necessarily impose sanctions if weight enforcement suffered during emergencies that threatened public welfare, Federal weight law simply does not authorize waivers of the Interstate limits or regulatory definitions. The Connecticut DOT suggested that we use the definition of a nondivisible load to establish ``an Ultimate Limit or a guideline to be used by manufacturing.'' Federal size and weight laws confer no authority to regulate manufacturers. The FHWA mentioned in the SNPRM that bulk commodities such as liquids, grain, and cement are inherently divisible. The CRASH suggested that the definition include ``a much more complete listing of loads that are inherently divisible *␣*␣*␣.'' In view of the enormous variety of products that move by truck, we do not believe divisible loads could reasonably be itemized. Grove Worldwide, a manufacturer of cranes, proposed that a load be defined as nondivisible if dismantling it would cause a competitive disadvantage, compromise the integrity and safety of the equipment when disassembled, or jeopardize the warranty. The FHWA considers these tests too far removed from the question of physical divisibility to be appropriate. Procedure to Review and Correct Final List Sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA provide a review and correction procedure for the final list of ISTEA vehicles, published today as appendix C to 23 CFR part 658. Any person or State may request that the Secretary review the final list to determine if there is cause to believe that it contains a mistake. The Secretary may also initiate the review. If the Secretary believes an error exists, he or she must commence a proceeding to determine if the list should be corrected, and if so, make the correction. Proposed language establishing such a procedure was included in the SNPRM. No comments were received on this issue. Accordingly, that language has been adopted, unchanged, by this final rule in §658.23(f). Temporary Exemption for Public Transit Vehicles Section 1023 of the ISTEA was amended by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year (FY) 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;388, 106 Stat. 1520. Section 341 added a new subsection (h) which reads in part as follows: (h) Public Transit Vehicles._ (1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight limitations for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, shall not apply, in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional year. This prevents the FHWA from sanctioning States that fail to enforce the Interstate axle-weight limits for public transit vehicles at least until October 6, 1994. If the Secretary exercises the authority to extend the exemption an additional year, it would apply until October 6, 1995. The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States to suspend axle weight enforcement on the Interstate System against public transit vehicles while the Secretary conducts the study called for in section 1023(h)(2). That study, which is currently underway, is to determine whether or not public transit vehicles should be exempted from the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 127, State weight laws, or if such laws should be modified to accommodate these vehicles. The FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration published a joint notice and request for comments on this issue on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60481). A report on the results of the study, along with recommendations, will ultimately be submitted by the Secretary to Congress.
