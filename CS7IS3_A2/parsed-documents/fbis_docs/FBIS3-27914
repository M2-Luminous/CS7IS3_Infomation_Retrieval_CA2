As the demonstrators tried to proceed toward the American Embassy and Chongwadae [presidential residence], police cordoned them off, in the course of which they violently clashed with stick-wielding demonstrators. A group of demonstrators raided three unoccupied police buses near Samil Building, setting fire to one of them and smashing the windows of the two tohers. They also destoryed a nearby garbage truck and smashed the doors of a KBS sedan. In another action, student demonstrators surrounded 100 riot police at Chongkye 2-ka and collected and set fire to their helmets, shields and gas masks. The police decided to criminally punish those who took part in violence as well as those who organized the rally. The rally was attended by Yi Ki-taek, head of the Democratic Party, 11 other opposition party lawmakers, and a number of dissident leaders.
