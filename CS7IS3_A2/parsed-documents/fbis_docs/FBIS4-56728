Panamanians must respect the people's decision. [Begin recording] [Ford] The elections have been a model of civility and have displayed a great sense of homeland. The international community should respect the Panamanian people. Most important now are the results and the Panamanian people abiding by the majority of the Panamanian people's will. [Reporter] Do you think the political parties will accept the people's decision? [Ford] All of the parties and all of us politicians must abide by the National Vote-Counting Board's decision, which I am sure will be endorsed by the various officials of the Catholic Church, as well as by international observers. The question is not whether we wish to accept the decision of the majority of the Panamanian people -- we must. [Reporter] What do you think about the young people who have gone out into the streets, each in his own party's name, to celebrate? [Ford] Inasmuch as it is celebration, I praise it; nevertheless, I hope such a celebration will not lead them to a confrontation, because we will not permit that. I am asking the young people and every Panamanian citizen to behave themselves. Let's wait for the final results to decide the next Panamanian president. [end recording]
