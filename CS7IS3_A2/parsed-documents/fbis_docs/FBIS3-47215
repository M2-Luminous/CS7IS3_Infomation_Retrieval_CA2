The ruling coalition parties are working hard to iron out their difference on whether to hike the consumption tax to finance an income tax cut, EPA Director General Manae Kubota told a regular press conference. When a consensus is reached on this "thorny issue," Kubota said, the ruling coalition parties will coordinate their view with the government at a joint economic forum. The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest in the seven-party coalition, has been strongly opposed to hiking the consumption tax.
