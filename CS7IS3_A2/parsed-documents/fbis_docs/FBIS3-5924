While this thinking has been taken for granted, it is now becoming increasingly unclear whether the people really believe that to be true in the bottom of their hearts. That doubt is now here because in no way can we really believe that either the Hosokawa government or the Clinton government is seriously thinking that way. Some people say there is no need to worry "because the two nations are so deeply involved with each other economically." That may be true, but economic relations are indeed mercenary relations of interest, and there is nothing as changeable as such relations. The sharpening conflict in bilateral relations over the economic consultations is the best testimony to this. Some people say there is no need to worry "since the two nations are closely tied by the security pact." That may be true as well. But the security pact is informed by intentions on one side that are sometimes different from the other and vice versa, resulting in the peoples of both countries occasionally becoming sensitive and emotionally disgruntled toward each other. For instance, the presence of U.S. forces in Japan is now apt to be viewed as a heavy burden by both Japan and the United States. The problem, after all, arises from thinking that Japan-U.S. relations affect only the two countries themselves. That line of thought leads to the egotism of one side clashing with the that of the other. We would like to think of the U.S.-Japan relationship in terms of bilateral ties, but the relationship does not end there. Let us think. Japan and the United States between them hold about four-tenths of the gross national product (GNP) of the world. We need to realize how much trouble the quarreling of the two countries is causing other countries in the world. In fact, only recently, THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE reported in a big- headline article that Asian countries are concerned about catching side blows from these quarrels. We think former Ambassador Mansfield had that thought in his mind when he used the phrase "most important bilateral relations." We do not want to repeat here what the Japanese and U.S. Governments are saying with respect to the economic consultations. All people of the world agree that the Clinton government's way of doing things is crude and high-handed. But if anyone thinks other countries in Europe and Asia approve of Japan, this is simply not true. The world is bitter about Japan's trade surplus, which amounts to $130 billion. No wonder the people of the United States, which has a deficit of some $60 billion with Japan, should have emotional anti-Japanese feelings. Japanese prime ministers of the past kept on telling U.S. presidents "please wait a little more" or "we must look at the economy in the long-term." High deficit figures are the result of all of this. President Clinton has some justification for openly criticizing Japan in news conferences. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who arrived in Japan on 9 March and has spent his days as scheduled, will be leaving for China today on 11 March. The secretary has met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. The ministerial meeting on Japan-U.S. security attended by foreign ministers and defense chiefs of the two nations, which has been pending for some time, will be held today as well. According to reports, in the meetings held so far, the parties have not held any in-depth discussions on restoring bilateral ties. Maybe there has been more meaning in the fact that they met, rather than in anything that came out of the meetings. We would like to think this way in good faith. But, after all, a show performance is nothing more than a show performance. We do not mean to ridicule Prime Minister Hosokawa by saying that such exhibits are his forte. But we do wish to say there is no doubt that the longer the delays continue, the more difficult it becomes to restore relations that have gone awry. Anyway, the ball needs to be sent back to the United States' side of the court. It needs to be an infallible shot as well. The only thing left for the prime minister to do now is to be resolved and exercise leadership over the legions of bureaucrats.
