In a speech commemorating the 33d anniversary proclaiming the socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and Militiamen's Day, Raul Castro denounced the United States, saying that at a time when the United States is closing bases in its territory and in other countries to reduce its gigantic military budget, it maintains its enclave in Caimanera as a point of constant provocation and humiliation of Cuba. Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that in 1993 and so far in 1994, a climate of tranquillity has predominated on both sides of the fence that separates Cuban territory from the U.S. Naval Base. He said I will do everything in my power so that it continues this way. That is why, underscored Raul Castro, necessary measures will be adopted to frustrate the outrageous attempts by those intending to leave the country through the Caimanera base -- attempts which not only seriously endanger their lives, but can also cause warlike incidents of unpredictable consequences. The leader of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces called on the United States to discourage illegal departures by Cubans, not only those through Guantanamo, but also those using unsound vessels to reach the Florida coast, where they are allowed to stay -- something that is not granted to any other foreigners in the United States.
