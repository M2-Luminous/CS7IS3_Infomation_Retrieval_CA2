Advocates of the EU are convinced that cooperation within the EU will have a positive effect on Nordic cooperation, whereas Norwegian opponents, in particular, doubt this. During the debate, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the leader of the Moderate Coalition Party, who seemed to be the person most enthusiastic about the results of the negotiations with the EU, cited Carl Jonas Love Almqvist and made a comparison with Robinson Crusoe's meeting with Friday. "Regarding the platform that Almqvist sketched out, he says that it would be valuable to have a coin of the same value," quoted Bildt from the 1846 work of the writer, Almqvist. "It was right then," he continued. "It has been right since then, and it continues to be right," he said, responding to a question raised by Norwegian Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein, who may be said to symbolize EU opposition in Norway. In her speech, she wondered how politicians who are in favor of the EU intend to get the people on their side and pointed to opinion polls showing that opposition to the EU has a firm base among the broad masses. "When policies get really bad, then they hide behind opinion polls," remarked Bildt. He praised the informal cooperation that also characterized Nordic cooperation and views the EU as a possibility. "We are taking the step into the European, but this is providing us with opportunities to give Nordic cooperation a new lease of life. I am convinced that those who believe that cooperation will now be weakened do not understand what is happening. It is now that the Nordic area has its big chance." When Enger Lahnstein said that she was worried about losing independence, Bildt made his comparison with Robinson Crusoe: "Robinson Crusoe was independent on his isolated island. He made all his decisions for himself until Friday appeared on the scene. When Friday arrived, Robinson Crusoe lost a little of his independence," Bildt admitted, but he went on to say that in today's world there was no room for a Robinson Crusoe policy on an isolated island. Anneliese Dorum of the Norwegian Labor Party wondered whether conservative or social democratic policy will be pursued in the united Europe. In reply, Bildt could only say that it would be the voters who decided that. Norway's Kjellbjorg Lunde, from the Socialist Left Party, said that she believes that Bildt wants the help of the EU to scrap the Swedish welfare state. Prime Minister Bildt sees a no to the EU as a yes to isolation and views this as the worst alternative in every respect. Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson, the leader of the Swedish opposition, also spoke of the EU in glowing terms: "The Nordic area is being given a whole new platform to revitalize its own cooperation," said Carlsson, who does not believe that Nordic cooperation will be watered down within the EU. "Brotherly and sisterly feelings are not lessened by getting together with our cousins. If the political will is there, then I am convinced that, on the contrary, European cooperation will strengthen the family's togetherness." Nothing About the Nordic Council in the EU Agreement Eduskunta deputy Mats Nyby of the SDP [Finnish Social Democratic Party] wondered why Nordic cooperation had not been written into the outcome of the negotiations with the EU that had been achieved the previous week in Brussels in the same way that it is written into the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. He is worried that the omission of this clause from the EU agreement could hinder Nordic cooperation in the united Europe. Nyby suspects that Council cooperation was deliberately left out of the agreement. Meanwhile, Eduskunta deputy Claes Andersson of the Left-Wing Alliance wondered why the EEA administration is already being dismantled before the referendums have been held in the respective candidate member states. In his opinion this demonstrates a contempt for democracy and the will of the people. Ole Norrback, the minister for Nordic cooperation, made it clear that membership in the EU did not mean that there would necessarily be any haggling over Nordic cooperation. On the contrary, such cooperation is a more active period. "Nordic cooperation can certainly function best if all the Nordic countries have the same relationship to the EU, but no country can be left out of Nordic cooperation, regardless of what happens with the membership of the remaining countries." Eduskunta deputy Erkki Tuomioja (SDP) said that the Nordic Council must not become an oversight body for Nordic European policy. A European Line Vis-a-Vis Russia During yesterday's session, Prime Minister Esko Aho reiterated his conviction that the EU simply presents Nordic cooperation with a challenge. In his speech, he also touched on the line to be taken toward Russia. "As far as Russia is concerned, there is only one European line, which the Nordic area should also support and actively promote. We must avoid isolating Russia or allowing Russia to isolate itself from the European community or from Nordic cooperation." Hjorleifur Guttormsson of Iceland's People's Alliance wondered why in his speech Aho did not go into the EU's foreign and security policy, which Finland as an EU member state must embrace. Aho stated that Finland has said that it is ready to participate in that process "if we are members of the EU when it happens." However, he said that in the future too the guiding principle in Finland's foreign and security policy will continue to be military nonalignment and an independent defense force. Also Finnish Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen believed that it was important for Finland to be involved in shaping the EU's foreign and defense policy. Lipponen also promised that the Social Democrats in Finland will make a constructive contribution to resolving any outstanding questions concerning Finland's national subsidies for farmers "after the government had examined the matter and reached a decision on its proposals." The Center Party's Timo Jarvilahti outlined Finland's farmers' need for additional support, "so that it will be profitable to cultivate crops throughout the whole country."
