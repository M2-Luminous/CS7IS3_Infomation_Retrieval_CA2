SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the proposed rule and related notices of 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 275 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department has also reviewed this proposed rule in relation to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed requirements will affect food stamp applicants and recipients and the State and local agencies that administer the Program. Eligibility criteria will be simplified and some currently participating households will realize an increase in Program benefits. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
