FBIS4-9980 "drlat066_m_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Brazil Foreign Minister Favors Talks Over Sanctions on DPRK Foreign Minister Favors Talks Over Sanctions on DPRK PY0504173994 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1242 GMT 5 Apr 94 PY0504173994 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Beijing, 5 Par (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said here on 5 April that Brazil prefers dialogue to the imposition of sanctions on the DPRK because of its alleged nuclearization for military purposes. The minister thus replied to a question asked by an EFE journalist on a request that U.S. officials made today in Brazil, asking this country to cooperate with an eventual imposition of sanctions on the DPRK if it refuses to engage in dialogue and does not follow the UN recommendations in this regard. Amorim explained that developing nuclear weapons is not favorable to the DPRK's interest, but demanded prudence on the subject, noting that this would give more credibility to the United Nations, and adding that the Chinese position on the subject is "very constructive." In response to another question asked by the EFE reporter on Beijing's opinion on the expansion of the UN Security Council, and -- in a such case -- about the possibility of Brazil occupying one of the new positions as a standing council member, Amorim replied that China and his country have several similarities on the subject. Brazilian authorities, Amorim explained, believe that an expanded Security Council will have more legitimacy, will prevent the expansion of the imbalance between developed and developing countries, and will make Security Council action more efficient. He noted that the Chinese position "is very similar," although he gave no details of it. Brazil and the PRC act jointly in the United Nations to preserve world peace, the chief of Brazilian diplomacy said. This, he said, falls within the framework of "strategic relations" that the two countries maintain. The largest Latin American country seeks to reinforce its presence in Asia, with whom it maintains -- except for the Middle East oil-producing countries -- 16 percent of its trade. This is why on 2 April Amorim held a working meeting with 24 Brazilian ambassadors accredited to this continent, including to the Russian Federation. Brazil, which is under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recently ratified a nuclear cooperation agreement for peaceful purposes with Argentina and is willing to broaden this cooperation to the PRC, Amorim said. Brazil also is willing to sign without conditions the agreement on the control of medium-range missiles (MCR) [acronym as received] because, according to Amorim, it will allow a greater possibility of cooperation in the field of space research with countries like the PRC, whose "Long March" rockets will place two Brazilian natural resources monitoring satellites in orbit by 1996. The Brazilian foreign minister announced that his Angolan counterpart will visit Brazil to discuss the situation in his country, and he asked the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for "the necessary flexibility" to reestablish peace in Angola.
