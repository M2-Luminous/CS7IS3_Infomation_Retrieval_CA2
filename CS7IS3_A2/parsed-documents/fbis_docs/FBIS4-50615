In a fundamental sense, observers here said, MFN has become the minimum requirement of meaningful economic exchanges between two countries and cannot be used by the U.S. to exercise leverage in foreign policy. "MFN status is not a concession or foreign aid, but merely the normal basis for international trade," said Robert Manning, senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute and researcher at George Washington University. As President Bill Clinton is nearing his decision on China's MFN status, the relatively technical term has become a matter of intense debate which, observers said, should be put in the proper context. The articles of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) contains a MFN clause that applies to all members' tariffs and all other rules relating to imports and exports, which form the keystone effort to liberalize trade. Washington has two basic sets of tariff rates, with the lower tariff rate, referred to as MFN, applicable to most countries, including those to which the U.S. has serious policy differences. The non-MFN tariff rates, promulgated in the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act at the peak of U.S. protectionism, average over 40 percent and are believed to be instrumental in causing the then world depression. MFN became an instrument for Washington to express its moral outrage in 1974, when President Richard Nixon, wanting to give the Soviet Union MFN, tried to use it to force Moscow to permit Jewish emigration. With the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, MFN can be extended, and thus renewed annually, to non-market economies only when a special waiver is issued by the President saying that the country does not impede emigration. In the case of China, not a GATT member but enjoying MFN status in the U.S. market since 1980, MFN expires on June 3 every year. Congress, if objecting to MFN renewal, must come up with a joint resolution by September 1. The President, then, has the option of vetoing the resolution, in which case Congress has 15 legislative days to override the veto only with two-thirds votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. "Ironically, the original intention of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment has been forgotten," said Nicholas Lardy, professor at the University of Washington and author of numerous studies on China's economy. On the basis of the original emigration criterion, Lardy noted, China qualifies for MFN status since Chinese emigration to the U.S. is restricted mainly by U.S. immigration policy rather than by Chinese policy. New conditions to renew China's MFN were included in Clinton's presidential order in May 1993, although none of them was envisaged in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment as a criterion for extending MFN to non-market economies. "In Christmas tree-like fashion," Robert Manning of the Progressive Policy Institute said, "Congress added conditions to MFN renewal as though it were stringing lights on a Christmas tree." These conditions include U.S. concerns on trade, human rights and weapons proliferation. "On its own terms, MFN conditionality has not worked," Manning added. In a recent statement, the National Manufacturers Association (NAM) described the America's unilateral imposition of restraints on bilateral trade relations to convey concerns about other policy as "historically ineffective". MFN "is not an issue of us granting something to the Chinese," NAM's president Jerry Jasinowski explained. "Non-discriminatory or MFN treatment is the commercial equivalent of diplomatic recognition." Even with MFN status, observers here noted, China is still disadvantaged in its trade with Washington as compared with most of the other developing countries which receive other tariff benefits. These benefits include the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), which offer lower tariffs to as many as 138 countries and regions in the world.
