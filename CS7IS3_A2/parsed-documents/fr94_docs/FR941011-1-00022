Background The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) currently requires contracting officers to evaluate the compensation systems of a contractor and to make a determination as to the allowability of personal services compensation costs claimed by the contractor (FAR 31.205&hyph;6 and 42.302(a)(1)). The Defense Contract Audit Agency has raised concerns that the language in FAR 31.205&hyph;6(b) may be susceptible to differing interpretations and that the FAR does not provide adequate guidance with regard to contractor compensation systems. Some have misinterpreted the current cost principle to place equal weight on all factors affecting the reasonableness of compensation. Others have held that all the factors affecting reasonableness are stated in the cost principle. This proposed rule is intended to make it clear that the Government requires contractors to maintain sound compensation systems that consistently provide employee compensation costs that are reasonable, complaint with laws and regulations, and subject to applicable financial controls. The proposed rule does not require a contractor to change its compensation practices or its compensation system. The basic requirement that the contractor demonstrate the reasonableness of its compensation costs for personal services still exist. An adequate system requires documented compliance with the cost principle, enforced by internal reviews. An inadequate system does not automatically mean that the compensation claimed is unreasonable. However, an inadequate system may be a factor in the contracting officer's evaluation of whether the compensation claimed is reasonable. An inadequate system generally indicates that a contractor lacks sufficient documentation to support the reasonableness of its compensation costs and/or lacks adequate controls to ensure that its established policies are properly enforced. This proposed rule clarifies existing language at FAR 22.101&hyph;2; adds definitions at FAR 31.001; adds a new paragraph FAR 31.205&hyph;6(a)(6) addressing contractor compensation systems and referencing a new FAR subpart 42.13; clarifies the standard for reasonableness of labor-management compensation agreements at FAR 31.205&hyph;6 (b) and (c); removes the examples from FAR 31.205&hyph;6(b); revises FAR 31.205&hyph;6(b)(2) to clarify what special circumstances are covered, provide guidance to contracting officers confronted with those situations, remove references to the Internal Revenue Code, and make unallowable or place limitations on certain high-risk type of payments; revises FAR 31.205&hyph;6(i) to remove the current series of allowable examples and substitute a general allowability rule to preclude the need to add further examples to paragraph (i); clarifies FAR 42.302(a)(1); and establishes a new FAR subpart 42.13 which contains policies, procedures, and minimum standards applicable to contractor compensation system and reviews of such systems. This proposed rule also makes editorial changes, corrects administrative errors, and adds clarifying language throughout FAR 31.205&hyph;6. Most notable of these changes is the redesignation of FAR 31.205&hyph;6(f)(2) to a restructured and renamed FAR 31.205&hyph;6(d) to improve the flow of the cost principle and provide a more logical placement of the language. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , applies, but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR Case 93&hyph;5 in correspondence.
