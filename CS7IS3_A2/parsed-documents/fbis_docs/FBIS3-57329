Moscow Intends To Get 250 Billion Rubles Returned"] [Text] Leaving yesterday for Orel for a conference of the heads of administrations of central Russia, [Prime Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin was busy even on the plane solving regional problems, one of the most painful of which is federal government debts. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who had interrupted his vacation, did his utmost to use the flight together with Russia's head of government to get from the premier a firm guarantee: The federal government will pay up its debts to Moscow. Despite the declared intention to discuss at the conference the prospects of interaction between central Russian regions in resolving the problems of the agro-industrial complex, and provision of food for big urban centers, the main topic of the meeting will of course be the federal government's debt, assessed at 8 trillion rubles [R]. The total federal government debt to Moscow today is about R250 billion. The mutual settlements debt accounts for R117 billion, the Finance Ministry has failed to transmit R102 billion for the purchase of food, and R33 billion is owed for the maintenance of Moscow's subway system. The Moscow mayor's push seems to have yielded results, which is likely to lend confidence to the heads of other administrations. Although the regions, perhaps, are trying to force an open door: Addressing the first session of the new Russian Government, its head named as an immediate task the payment of all government debts to the agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and the budget sphere.
