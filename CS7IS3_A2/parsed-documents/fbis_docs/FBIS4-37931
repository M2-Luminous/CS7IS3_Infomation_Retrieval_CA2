FBIS4-37931 "drnes123_l_94005" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Commission: Goldstein Acted Alone in Hebron Shooting Commission: Goldstein Acted Alone in Hebron Shooting TA2606105494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1000 GMT 26 Jun 94 TA2606105494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] We open with the findings of the Shamgar commission of inquiry into the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the Hebron Cave of the Patriarchs. The report was just published 30 minutes ago and its main finding is that Barukh Goldstein acted alone. New arrangements are to be introduced for prayers in the cave and there will be a complete ban, which applies to soldiers as well, on carrying weapons. At the Supreme Court, where the Shamgar report was released for publication at 1230 [0930 GMT], is Mark Weiss: I am speaking here from the Supreme Court. The report was delivered to journalists just half an hour ago: a 350-page document, very detailed. We received the conclusions -- some 30, 40 pages in English -- and as you said, the main conclusion is that Dr. Barukh Goldstein's actions were premeditated and that he acted alone. Let me quote this important section from the document: We were not presented with credible proof that he was helped while carrying out the killing or prior to that time by another individual acting as an accomplice nor was it proven to us that he had secret partners. According to the evidence before us, his wife was also not aware of the matter. The report also found no evidence that Goldstein threw a hand grenade, as claimed by some of the Muslim worshipers, or that soldiers fired into the Isaac hall. There is no reliable proof of how Goldstein entered the Isaac hall although entry via the main entrance or via the Yosifya door are the most likely. Concerning the deployment of security forces in and around the cave on the morning of the massacre, the commission concludes this, and again I am quoting directly from the report in front of me: The absence of the full complement of forces at the time of the massacre was an unfortunate coincidence whose roots lie both in shortcomings in coordination between the forces and in the level of discipline in some of the units. The Shamgar commission also found that if the forces that were supposed to be on duty were present then they could have impeded Goldstein's efforts to enter the Isaac hall. A lack of coordination is noted between the police and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units. Regarding opening fire regulations, there is no justification for different guidelines for opening fire in cases of disturbances and criminal offenses. The report here is talking about the different guidelines that existed at the time for the police and Army. The last conclusion is that the report found serious shortcomings in the area of law enforcement in the territories and in the absence of effective law enforcement, the report says, there could be no effective government. Now those are the main conclusions. Briefly to the main recommendations following those conclusions. The main recommendation concerns prayer arrangements at the mosque. Again I am quoting directly: We recommend first and foremost that arrangements intended to create complete separation between the Muslim and Jewish worshipers be adopted in order to ensure the safety of all worshipers, and to prevent friction, dispute, and acts of violence. Other recommendations from the findings are that security outside the tomb should be provided by a regular army unit while the findings recommend the creation of a special tomb guard unit that will be responsible for security at the entrance gate and inside the tomb. Members of the two units should serve for at least a year. The report also recommends an absolute ban on individuals carrying weapons entering the tomb. It calls for larger police funds to ensure law and order for the Jewish residents in the territories and finally recommends that open fire instructions be formulated in a clear manner, with reference to disturbances and violent offenses.
