Exhibit A_Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-Aside Program Subpart T_Disaster Set-aside Program §1951.951 Purpose. This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for establishing and implementing the Disaster Set-aside Program (DSA). The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO), Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF). Non-program (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have program FP loans. FP borrowers have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Requests received after this date will not be accepted. §1951.952 General. Disaster set-aside is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than 1 installment behind on any and all FP loans may be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each eligible FP loan to the end of the loan term. Borrowers whose loans are restructured in accordance with subpart S of this part after the disaster occurred are not eligible for the DSA program. The intent of this program is to relieve some of the borrower's immediate financial stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government. §1951.953 Notification and Request for DSA. (a) Notification. The County Supervisor will use form letter 1951&hyph;1&hyph;T to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in §1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who operated a farm or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated as a disaster area, or contiguous county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter will be notified within 10 days of the effective date of this instruction. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the notification requirements set forth in subpart S of this part. (b) Request for DSA. (1) All FP borrowers liable for the debt must request disaster set-aside in writing prior to July 1, 1995. (2) Borrowers must provide the County Supervisor with actual production, income and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information is already in the borrower case file. (3) Borrowers may only be considered for DSA one time. (c) Eligibility requirements. (1) The borrower operated a farm or ranch in a county declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter, or a contiguous county to such an area based on a 1993 disaster. The borrower must have been operating the farm or ranch at the time of the disaster. (2) The borrower has acted in good faith as defined in §1951.906 of subpart S of this part. (3) All nonmonetary defaults have been resolved. This means that even though the borrower has acted in good faith, he/she may still be in default for reasons, such as, but not limited to: no longer farming, prior lienholder foreclosure, bankruptcy, not properly maintaining chattel and real estate security, not properly accounting for the sale of security as agreed, or not carrying out any other agreements made with FmHA. (4) The borrower is current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans at the time the scheduled installment(s) will be set-aside as reflected on the Finance Office 540 or 582 status reports. (5) The borrower's projected income for the disaster year was reduced as a result of the disaster, causing insufficient income available to pay all family living and operating expenses, pay debts to other creditors and pay FmHA. This determination will be based on the borrower's actual production and income and expense records for the disaster year. Releases of normal income security will continue as set forth in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. (6) The term remaining on the loan(s) receiving set-aside equals or exceeds 2 years from the due date of the installment being set-aside.
