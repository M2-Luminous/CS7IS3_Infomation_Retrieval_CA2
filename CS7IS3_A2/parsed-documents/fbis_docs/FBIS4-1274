This calm has just been shattered 20 days later. Elements of the Burundi Armed Forces, dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried once again to seize power yesterday. The coup plot was quickly foiled and was mostly unnoticed in Bujumbura. Here is our correspondent Celsius Senguyunva with a report. [Begin Senguyunva recording] Officially, the information has not yet been confirmed or refuted. We have been able to obtain some scraps of information from the Army Headquarters which say that about 10 soldiers tried to stage a coup by mobilizing others who did not follow them. These 10 people have been arrested. The Army Headquarters is still not prepared to disclose the identity of these people. All we know, and I am repeating what the Army chief of general staff told us on the phone just a while ago, is that the people who attempted to stage this coup are the same ones who tried to stage the October coup in which President Ndadaye was killed. He said that these people were already on the black lists of the investigators and could have been arrested at any moment. Reports trickling out to us say that some of the soldiers managed to escape. There are some senior officers among these soldiers. [end recording] The mutiny was therefore quickly quelled in Bujumbura, but the number of soldiers involved remains unclear. According to the Army Headquarters, six or seven soldiers including four officers have been arrested. Others managed to escape. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the current speaker of the National Assembly, who is acting as president of the Republic, confirmed the coup attempt to Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou. [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] Last night, some unusual movements were observed within a unit of the Burundi Army. The Army chief of general staff and [words indistinct] military defense units tried to monitor the movements and they confirmed this morning that an attempt was made. [Saliou] Could you confirm to us reports that the four soldiers, who are allegedly the brains behind this putsch, have been arrested? [Ntibantunganya] Actually, two officers have been interrogated at the Army Headquarters and have provided some information, which I cannot comment on now. [Saliou] Do you fear for your life now? [Ntibantunganya] If someone is a politician he always fears for his life. This is especially true in a country such as ours which is experiencing difficulties, but I am not scared. [end recording] The new coup attempt in Burundi illustrates the agitation within the ranks of some Tutsi extremist soldiers, who have never accepted the coming into power of the Hutus, yet are nonetheless in the majority. [passage omitted] This morning, gunfire could still be heard in the outlying northern districts of Bujumbura. Armed clashes have for several days now been taking place between soldiers and armed Hutu militiamen. However, according to military sources, these clashes are not linked to the coup attempt. The rest of the capital and the country is calm.
