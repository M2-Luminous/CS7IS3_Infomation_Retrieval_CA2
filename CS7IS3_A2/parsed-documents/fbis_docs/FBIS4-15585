He told journalists in Tbilisi Friday, however, that unexpected events might take place if the security guarantees for the refugees were full implemented. Kavsadze said that this agreement, like the earlier ones, could be wrecked but emphasized the need "to try to succeed jointly. You don't stop when you go in darkness, torch in hand, just because the torch may go out." The Georgian parliament's Deputy Chairman Vakhtang Rcheulishvili said that future documents on Abkhazia had to be a detailed blueprint for the political structure of the autonomous republic. He called for equal rights to be given to all the citizens. "If the Georgian and Abkhazian populations are not convinced that these rights are guaranteed, there will be no peace," he emphasized. Rcheulishvili said that those who had fought on the Abkhazian side, notably North Caucasian nationals, and seized houses belonging to Georgian families "are automatically regarded is illegal residents there."
