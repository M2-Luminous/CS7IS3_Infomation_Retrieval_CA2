As China's leading financial arm for rural investment, the bank plans to lend more than 29 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) to farmers for their production this year, up 28 per cent from 1993. Loans affecting farm production still receive top priority in lending policy decisions taken at the bank. However, the government-set schedule for separating commercial banking from policy banking will eventually make the bank's practices more commercial. Mandatory lending will be turned over to the soon-to-be-created Agricultural Development Bank. The bank is responding to the government's call for ensuring that loans earmarked for agricultural production account for at least 10 per cent of the country's total bank credits in 1994, up 4 percent from last year. To cope with the growing demand for capital from the countryside, the bank officials said, the bank's arranged loans this year also include 4 billion yuan ($460 million) in poverty alleviation loans and 2 billion yuan ($230 million) for comprehensive agricultural development. Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank will also strongly back construction in the country's 500 centrally-controlled grain production centres and the 150 State-controlled high quality cotton-growing counties, bank officials said. Ma Yongwei, president of the bank, predicted inflationary pressure in 1994 will exert greater pressure on farmers to cut production costs. If inflation remains at last year's level, he said, it will stimulate a spiralling of agricultural prices as well as a higher demand for bank loans. In addition, Ma added, the disparity between available capital and the demand for credit will widen this year, as the Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State treasury bonds and co-operated bonds. Official figures show that during the first quarter of this year the bank lent nearly 20.1 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) to farmers for their production, two times more than in the same period of 1993. The bank's major branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin and Nanjing expanded their agricultural loans by 300 million yuan ($34.5 million) to 500 million yuan ($57.5 million) each during the January-March period, a busy season in the agricultural calendar. This was backed by a considerable increase in the bank's personal savings deposits, which jumped 23.8 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) over a year ago.
