The survey by pollsters IPSOS showed 12 percent would back the "Europe begins at Sarajevo" list in the June 12 elections to the European parliament. The poll is to be published in the Saturday edition of the weekly LE POINT. French intellectuals led by journalist and writer Bernard-Henri Levy have warned they will present the Sarajevo list if the political establishment fails to embark on a "ethical about-face" to place the Bosnian capital "at the heart of Europe." According to the survey, all major French parties barring the extreme right National Front would lose votes if the threat is carried out. The group says five conditions must be fulfilled if the "Sarajevo" candidates are to back down prior to the May 27 closing date for registrations. These include lifting the arms embargo to former Yugoslavia in favour of Bosnian Government forces -- which both France and Britain said Thursday they opposed -- and withdrawing a European plan earmarking 51 percent of the republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs. The IPSOS survey was carried out between May 19 and 24 among a representative sample of 1,000 French voters.
