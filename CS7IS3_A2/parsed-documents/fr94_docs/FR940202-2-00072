FR940202-2-00072 FR940202-2-00054 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Biweekly Notice Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations I. Background Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from January 7, 1994, through January 21, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2859). Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By March 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Carolina Power & Light Company, Docket No. 50-261, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, Darlington County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: November 4, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 6.13.1 to provide use of alarming dosimeters in high radiation areas. This change includes newly revised 10 CFR Part 20 requirement references and is consistent with NUREG-1413, Standard Technical Specifications - Westinghouse Plants, Specification 5.11.1. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change could involve a reduction in personnel radiation exposure by utilizing alarming dosimeters. This change does not involve any plant systems or components which could increase the probability of an accident. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This change could reduce the possibility of an accidental overexposure by alerting personnel when their maximum allowable exposure has been received. This change does not involve any plant systems or components. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Due to the nature of this proposed change, it is not related to any plant system. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Hartsville Memorial Library, Home and Fifth Avenues, Hartsville, South Carolina 29550 Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: S. Singh Bajwa Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. STN 50-454 and STN 50-455, Byron Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Ogle County, Illinois Docket Nos. STN 50-456 and STN 50-457, Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Will County, Illinois Date of amendment request: August 27, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would revise the Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, and Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications (TS) regarding inspection requirements for pipe snubbers. The proposed changes implement Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, and would affect the surveillance requirements of TS section 4.7.8 and the bases for these requirements, section 3/4.7.8. Specifically, the amendment would change the existing inspection periods, visual inspection acceptance criteria, and functional test requirements. Additionally, there would be changes to the bases to include reference to GL 90-09, and other editorial changes would be made. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The amended surveillance requirement adds a table that addresses the maximum number of snubber failures that can be tolerated prior to reducing the inspection interval. This number is a function of the population size of a particular type of snubber. The revised requirement will allow the inspection intervals to be compatible with the 24 month fuel cycles, and provisions are included to extend the inspection interval up to 48 months. A provision is included to allow an evaluation to determine operability to justify continued operation with a snubber that is unacceptable. The purpose of the amendment request is to provide for alternative inspection intervals that take the size of the population of a snubber type into account. The proposed change provides the same confidence level and allows snubber inspection and corrective action to be performed during refueling outages. This allows the plant to avoid a mid-cycle outage due to a small number of snubber failures. The proposed change allows for a small percentage of snubbers in each category to fail the required visual examination without adjusting the inspection frequency. If a statistically significant percentage of snubbers fail, the visual examination inspection interval is reduced based on the percentage of failed snubbers. The proposed change has no direct or indirect impact on reactivity management activities. The change is not expected to have an impact on equipment failures. Any snubbers that fail to meet the visual examination acceptance criteria are either functionally tested in the as-found condition to verify continued acceptability, or an evaluation is performed to demonstrate the acceptability of continued operation with an unacceptable snubber. No new equipment is being introduced and no systems are operated in a configuration that has not been evaluated, so no new failure modes are introduced. The affected transients are the design basis earthquake and the spectrum of event initiating transients, with the capability of imposing significant dynamic loads or otherwise which impact the structural integrity of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). The snubbers are installed to ensure the structural integrity of the RCS and required support systems. Their failure is passive in nature. The probability of a transient initiating event occurring is unrelated to the existence or condition of equipment that is designed to perform a mitigating function. The snubbers are installed to ensure an acceptable system response to a dynamic load, and their availability does not impact the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes or other transients resulting in significant dynamic loading. The revised testing provisions are designed to allow some flexibility while still maintaining a high probability that the installed snubbers will be capable of performing their intended function when required. The revised surveillances appropriately consider the size of the population of a particular type of snubber, and are sufficient to ensure the consequences of an accident will be unchanged when the revised requirements are implemented. By maintaining a statistically high level of confidence in the function of the plant's snubbers, the system response to transient initiating events will be as designed and thus, the off-site dose projected to occur of any affected transient will remain acceptably low. As previously stated, the revised surveillance provides a high confidence that the affected systems will remain intact and functional. Evaluation of the effects of operating with a degraded snubber is required to ensure that adequate margin exists to support continued plant operation. If this evaluation cannot adequately justify continued operation, the appropriate action statement will be applied. These provisions are sufficient to assure that the probability of an equipment malfunction will not increase. The consequences of equipment malfunction will not increase. Sufficient redundancy exists to accommodate the complete failure of one train of required equipment. The requisite electrical and physical separation are sufficient to ensure that the redundant train remains unaffected. This redundancy is adequate to ensure that the undetected failure of a snubber will not have a severe impact on overall system response to a transient. 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The possibility of a new or different type of accident is not created by this change. No new or different equipment is being introduced, and no system will be operated in a different configuration without first having the effects of the new configuration evaluated. The new configuration would be system and/or plant operation with a snubber installed that has failed its visual examination. The required evaluation must be sufficient to provide confidence that continued operation is acceptable; otherwise, the provisions of the action statement will be observed. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. No reduction in the margin of safety will occur as a result of this proposed change. As previously described, the controls in place will provide a high confidence the affected systems will continue to be functional. No significant increase in the rate of occurrence of undetected inoperable snubbers is expected to occur, and the allowable failures prior to applying an increased test frequency is still a small percentage of the total snubber population. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Kankakee Street, Wilmington, Illinois 60481 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: James E. Dyer Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. STN 50-454 and STN 50-455, Byron Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Ogle County, Illinois Docket Nos. STN 50-456 and STN 50-457, Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Will County, Illinois Date of amendment request: September 2, 1993, supplemented by letter dated January 7, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, and Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications (TS) to allow replacement of the 125 Volt DC Gould batteries with the new 125 Volt DC AT&T batteries and rephrase their design duty cycle. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise the batteries crosstie loading limitations and the crosstie breaker limitations. The associated Bases would also be revised to discuss the purpose for the crosstie limitations and to discuss design duty cycle requirements. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: A. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The replacement AT&T battery has been selected to meet or exceed the design, functional, and operational requirements of those of the present Gould battery, including crosstie load limitations. The crosstie breaker limitation change to allow crosstie between two shutdown units is consistent with the Safety Evaluations issued with Technical Specification Amendment 5 for both Braidwood and Byron Stations. The remaining changes are administrative in nature or provide clarification to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications and the Standard Technical Specifications. The overall design, function, and operation of the DC system and equipment has not been altered by these changes. The proposed changes do not affect any accident initiators or precursors and do not alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of an accident as analyzed in UFSAR Chapter 15. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. B. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The replacement AT&T battery will provide the same functions as those of the present Gould battery and will be operated with the same types of operational controls. These limits will include battery float terminal voltage, individual cell voltage and electrolyte specific gravity, and crosstie loading. Crosstie conditions are allowed under the present Technical Specifications. The remaining changes are administrative in nature or provide clarification to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications and the Standard Technical Specifications. The DC system and its equipment will continue to perform the same functions and be operated in the same fashion. The proposed change does not create any new or common failure modes. The proposed changes do not introduce any new accident initiators or precursors, or any new design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created. C. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The replacement AT&T battery will meet or exceed the design, functional, and qualification requirements of those of the present Gould batteries. The proposed Technical Specification limitations for the AT&T battery are derived from the same methodology and margins as those for the Gould battery. Increasing the crosstie loading limit takes advantage of the larger AT&T battery capacity with its increased design margin. The proposed change to the crosstie loading limit will continue to conservatively envelop the postulated design requirements. The remaining changes are administrative in nature or provide clarification to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications and the Standard Technical Specifications. The inherent design conservatism of the DC system and its equipment has not been altered. The DC system and its equipment will continue to be operated with the same degree of conservatism. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: For Byron, the Byron Public Library, 109 N. Franklin, P.O. Box 434, Byron, Illinois 61010; for Braidwood, the Wilmington Township Public Library, 201 S. Kankakee Street, Wilmington, Illinois 60481 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: James E. Dyer Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-373 and 50-374, LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, LaSalle County, Illinois Date of amendment request: October 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) injection valve stroke times and ECCS response times for Motor-Operated Valve (MOV) modifications that increase injection valve stroke times. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1) The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because: The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of this change, because the only modification being performed is to the stroke times for the LPCS [Low Pressure Core Spray System], LPCI [Low Pressure Coolant Injection System], and HPCS [High Pressure Core Spray System] injection valves. Changing the opening or closing time of the injection valves for these ECCS systems does not cause any accident previously evaluated to occur. Therefore, modifying their stroke times will not increase the probability of occurrence for any accident previously evaluated. The consequences of a LOCA [Loss of Coolant Accident] are not significantly increased and do not exceed the previously accepted licensing criteria for this accident. GE [General Electric Company] has calculated the revised licensing basis PCT [Peak Centerline Temperature] for LaSalle Station to be 1260 ○F, which is well below the 2200 ○F criterion of 10 CFR 50.46 and Section 15.6.5 of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan). The acceptance criteria for cladding oxidation, metal-water reaction (hydrogen generation), coolable geometry and long-term cooling also continue to be met with the increased valve stroke times. GE has performed sensitivity analysis justifying the continued applicability of previous analyses for Anticipated Transients Without Scram (ATWS), containment analyses, off-site dose (Main Steamline Break Outside Containment), and HPCS-related transients (Loss of Feedwater Flow). Other events are not affected because these systems are not assumed to function. 2) The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because: The only modification is to increase the stroke time of the injection valves for LPCS, LPCI, and HPCS. This does not result in any changed component interactions, other than to increase the affected ECCS response times. The injection valves will still provide the function for which they were designed. Since the systems will continue to function as intended, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because: While the calculated licensing basis PCT is larger than that previously calculated with the current valve stroke times, the new PCT remains far below the 2200 ○F licensing acceptance limit associated with a LOCA. This limit has been previously evaluated as providing a sufficient margin of safety. All other LOCA licensing limits also continue to be met with the increased stroke times. For other accidents and transients, the increased stroke times have a negligible effect on the results, so the margin of safety is preserved. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Public Library of Illinois Valley Community College, Rural Route No. 1, Oglesby, Illinois 61348 Attorney for licensee: Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60690 NRC Project Director: James E. Dyer Consumers Power Company, Docket No. 50-255, Palisades Plant, Van Buren County, Michigan Date of amendment request: April 15, 1992, as modified by letters dated December 8, 1992, and June 25, 1993. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications to incorporate Generic Letter 90-06, ``Resolution of Generic Issue 70, `Power-Operated Relief Valve and Block Valve Reliability,' and Generic Issue 94, `Additional Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection for Light-Water Reactors,''' power-operated relief valve (PORV) requirements for power operation, and to modify the primary coolant system (PCS) overpressure protection specification venting requirements. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed Technical Specification requiring Operability of the PORVs and their block valves does not alter plant operation or configuration in any way. It is current practice to maintain these valves in an Operable condition to meet the requirements of existing Specification 3.1.8, which is applicable when below 430 ○F. The effect of the proposed changes is to extend the applicability of the Operability requirement for these valves. The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. Replacing the requirements to vent the PCS through a 1.3 square inch vent with a vent capable of relieving 167 gpm at a pressure less than the Appendix G limits will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an overpressurization event occurring. The 1.3 square inch vent area in Technical Specification 3.1.8 was intended to be a means of protecting the Primary Coolant System (PCS) from exceeding the limit of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, curve following an overpressure transient. Analysis has shown that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide a relief capacity of 167 gpm at a PCS pressure of approximately 115 psig, well below the minimum 331 psig limit (Appendix G curve limit for a 40 ○F/hr heat-up). This relief capacity will protect the PCS against a pressure transient caused by a maximum charging/letdown imbalance coincident with a 40 ○F/hr PCS heat-up rate and a 60 ○F/hr pressurizer heat-up rate. Two other pressure transients, a High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) pump start and a Primary Coolant Pump (PCP) start, are also precluded. With the PCS in a vented and depressurized state, the PCS would be below 212 ○F Existing technical specifications require both HPSI pumps to be rendered inoperable below 260 ○F and, with the system depressurized, normal operating procedures prohibit a PCP start due to insufficient pump net positive suction head (NPSH). Therefore, the 1.3 square inch requirement can be replaced with a requirement to have a vent capable of relieving 167 gpm at a PCS pressure less than or equal to the Appendix G limit with no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an overpressurization event occurring. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above will not alter plant operation or configuration. It will not alter any equipment or analyses. Therefore the addition of these PORV Operability requirements will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The new technical specifications requirements for PCS vent capacity will provide an equivalent or better, overpressure protection as compared to the existing requirement. No analysis has been found that shows that the existing 1.3 square inch vent area will protect the PCS from exceeding the Appendix G curve limit. However, analysis has been developed which shows that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide adequate relief capacity, maintaining PCS pressure within the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, limits. Furthermore, two other pressure transients, a HPSI pump start and a PCP start, are also precluded by either existing technical specifications or normal plant operating procedures. Another related analysis has shown that relief valve RV-3164, the Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) pumps, the LPSI pump seals, and the system piping of the shutdown cooling system have the capability of providing adequate overpressure protection to the shutdown cooling system. The addition of the manual vent valves do not introduce a vent path where a vent path had not previously existed. Therefore, the possibility of an accident of a new or different type, than previously evaluated in the FSAR, will not be created. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety will not be reduced by the proposed Technical Specifications changes. The extension of PORV Operability requirements has no effect on any margin of safety. The previous requirement assumed that a vent with an equivalent flow area as the original PORV would provide the same relief as the PORV itself and gave no consideration to how that flow area should factor in system losses or vent location. The new technical specification requirement offers a means to ensure the PCS will be protected against all achievable overpressure transients for the system configuration, with analyses to support it. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Van Wylen Library, Hope College, Holland, Michigan 49423. Attorney for licensee: Judd L. Bacon, Esquire, Consumers Power Company, 212 West Michigan Avenue, Jackson, Michigan 49201 NRC Project Director: A. Randolph Blough, Acting GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: December 16, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment clarifies the requirements for maintaining secondary containment integrity when one or more Reactor Building Ventilation supply and exhaust valves are declared inoperable. The technical specification (TS) change adds a new Limiting Condition for Operation, Basis Statement, and Surveillance Requirements for these isolation valves. The change revises TS definition 1.14c, adds new Specifications 3.5.B.2, 3.5.B.3, 4.5.R, and a Basis statement to TS 3.5, edits T.S. 3.5.B.1.1. It also renumbers TS 3.5.B.2 through 3.5.B.4, to 3.5.B.4 through 3.5.B.7. It also revises specification references within to reflect new specification numbers. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: GPU Nuclear has determined that operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications does not involve a significant hazard. The changes do not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. The failure of any component in the [Reactor Building Ventilation System] RBVS was not considered as a credible initiating event for a design basis accident. However, the RBVS is designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential radiological release by the isolation of all supply and exhaust ducts to the environs. Since the failure of the RBVS was never considered as one of the initiators of an accident, this proposed change cannot increase the probability of occurrence of an accident. During the proposed Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), the supply or exhaust duct will be isolated within 8 hours by one isolation valve secured in its post accident design position. Since the duct can perform its post accident design function (isolation), there is no increase in the consequences of an accident. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The design function of the RBVS automatic isolation valves is to isolate the ducts which penetrate the Reactor Building or Secondary Containment during a radiological release. During the LCO, the duct will be isolated within 8 hours by one isolation valve secured in the closed position. Since the duct will be isolated, this change will not create a possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously identified. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. If a RBVS automatic isolation valve (supply) is declared inoperable, the proposed LCO would allow continued plant operation with that supply duct isolated. Since the RBVS can still perform its design function (redundant ductwork) under normal plant and design accident conditions, there is no reduction in the margin of safety. For an inoperable isolation valve in the exhaust duct, the exhaust duct will be isolated within 8 hours by one isolation valve secured in the closed position. Further, the RBVS and the [Standby Gas Treatment System] SGTS will be aligned for an accident condition with no reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: John F. Stolz Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-315 and 50-316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan Date of amendment requests: November 17, 1993 Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendments would modify the Technical Specifications to allow a portion of the Waste Gas Holdup System (WGHS) Explosive Monitoring System to be inoperable for 160 days on a one-time basis. This is to allow replacement of the Waste Gas Oxygen Analyzer. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: We have evaluated the proposed T/S changes and have determined that the changes should involve no significant hazards consideration. Operation of the Cook Nuclear Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of the hydrogen and oxygen monitors is to measure the concentrations of these gases in the WGHS to ensure that the gas mixture is non-flammable. We can accomplish this purpose and ensure safe operation of the WGHS by operating the system in the proposed manner. During the equipment replacement interval, we will be assuming that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%). The limiting factor then is the oxygen concentration at which hydrogen and oxygen become flammable. The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify the hydrogen level. The information provided by the oxygen monitor being replaced is not essential to the safe operation of the WGHS since it is redundant to information provided by the remaining oxygen monitor. The only difference between the two (2) oxygen monitors is that the one being replaced provides an automatic isolation of the waste gas decay tank when the oxygen concentration reaches 3%. The isolation of the waste gas decay tanks will be performed manually during the replacement. In the event the remaining oxygen monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the currently approved T/Ss. Since operation of the WGHS in the manner we have proposed will ensure that the purpose of the oxygen and hydrogen monitors is fulfilled and safe operation of the WGHS is maintained, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed incident. The proposed change to the Automatic Gas Analyzer (QC-31) tag number to QC-1400 will not reduce in any way requirements or commitments in the existing T/Ss. The proposed change will eliminate confusion of spare parts of the new analyzer panel installed in 1990. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. During the replacement of the monitors the waste gas holdup system will continue to operate normally. The proposed method of operation will ensure that the oxygen and hydrogen gas mixture is non-flammable. For this reason, operating the explosive gas monitoring system in the proposed manner will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition. Therefore, we believe that this change will not introduce a new or different kind of accident than previously analyzed. The proposed editorial change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated, because these changes will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The remaining oxygen monitor will be available to maintain the oxygen concentration below the limit required for hydrogen flammability in oxygen. In addition, the oxygen grab samples will provide redundant information and will serve as a check of the monitor's readings. If the remaining monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the actions of our current T/Ss. During the equipment replacement period, we will be assuming that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%). This will then make the oxygen level the controlling parameter in a possible flammable combination of oxygen and hydrogen. The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify the hydrogen level. These proposed interim measures will not significantly affect our ability to maintain the hydrogen and oxygen concentration within the limits to prevent flammability. Therefore, we believe that operation of the system in this manner does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed editorial change will not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety, because all accident analyses and nuclear design bases remain unchanged. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Randolph Blough, Acting Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-315 and 50-316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan Date of amendment requests: December 20, 1993 Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications to change Train A and B Emergency Loads from 8 hour to composite 4 hour, delete a load on the Train B batteries load list, and revise the operational loads on the Train N batteries. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration if the change does not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Criterion 1 The change is proposed to comply with the LOCA/LOOP [loss-of-coolant accident/loss-of-offsite power] and SBO [Station Blackout] requirement for Cook Nuclear Plant for battery testing. The composite test as addressed above meets these requirements for four hour test profiles. This change is consistent with the UFSAR three hour LOCA/LOOP and NUMARC 87-00 Station Blackout Rule four hour. Based on these considerations, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Criterion 2 The change only addresses the battery profile test which meets both LOCA/LOOP and SBO for Cook Nuclear Plant. No specific physical or operational changes to the plant will occur due to this change. Thus, the change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Criterion 3 The proposed change revises the battery profile test table from an eight hour to a four composite test which complies with both LOCA/LOOP and SBO as defined for Cook Nuclear Plant. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Randolph Blough, Acting Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-315 and 50-316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan Date of amendment requests: December 22, 1993 Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications section addressing steam generator stop valves making it more consistent with the revised Standard Technical Specifications and clarifying certain surveillance requirements. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration if the change does not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or 3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Criterion 1 The limiting conditions for operation involving the steam generator stop valves are not altered by this proposed change. The surveillance requirements are lessened for Unit 2 in that valve stroke timing does not have to be performed on valves that are closed. This is consistent with the wording of the Unit 1 T/S, and reflects the fact that, when closed, the valves are already in the position required by the assumptions in the safety analysis and therefore stroke timing is not necessary. The remaining changes are consistent with NUREG 1431, and as such, have already been found acceptable by the NRC. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Criterion 2 No changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the steam generator stop valves are proposed as part of this amendment request. The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the plant. The changes will allow operation in Modes 2 and 3 with more than one steam generator stop valve inoperable. However, inoperable valves must be closed and their closure periodically reverified. When closed, the valves are already in the position required by the assumptions in the safety analysis. Thus, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Criterion 3 The limiting conditions for operation involving the steam generator stop valves are not altered by this proposed change. The surveillance requirements are lessened for Unit 2 in that valve stroke timing does not have to be performed on valves that are closed. This is consistent with the wording of the Unit 1 T/S, and reflects the fact that, when closed, the valves are already in the position required by the assumptions in the safety analysis and therefore stroke timing is not necessary.

Local Public Document Room location: Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085 Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037 NRC Project Director: A. Randolph Blough, Acting Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 22, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.4.e (Emergency Ventilation System). TS 3.4.4.e currently permits fuel handling operations to continue during refueling for up to 7 days with one circuit of the emergency ventilation system inoperable provided all active components of the other emergency ventilation system circuit are operable. The proposed revision would permit fuel handling operations to continue during refueling beyond 7 days with one circuit of the emergency ventilation system inoperable provided the remaining emergency ventilation system circuit is operable and in operation. The licensee stated that the proposed revision is consistent with recently issued Amendment No. 47 to the Nine Mile Point Unit 2 TSs and with the NRC's Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Emergency Ventilation System responds to a release of radioactivity to the secondary containment by maintaining a negative pressure in secondary containment and by providing a filtered elevated release. The proposed change to LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. A plant specific PRA [Probabilistic Risk Assessment] was performed to evaluate the probability of a fuel bundle drop event resulting in a need to start the Emergency Ventilation System with a concurrent failure of the Emergency Ventilation System that would result in an unfiltered ground level release under the current Technical Specifications and the proposed change. The results of this assessment indicate that the probability is not significantly increased. In addition, the order of magnitude of the probability of such a release, under the current or proposed Technical Specifications, is very small, i.e., 10 -6 . This amendment requires no physical changes to NMP1. Therefore, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. Section XV.C.3 of the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] evaluates a fuel bundle drop accident. The radiological consequences of this accident are within the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100. The UFSAR radiological evaluation takes credit for the operation of an emergency ventilation circuit in mitigating the consequences of this accident. During refueling with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable for more than seven days, the proposed Technical Specification change would require that an operable emergency ventilation circuit be placed in operation. With an operable emergency ventilation circuit operating prior to a fuel bundle drop accident, the radiological consequences of this accident remains bounded by the current UFSAR evaluation. Therefore, from a radiological perspective, the proposed Technical Specification change is bounded by the current radiological evaluation in the UFSAR. Therefore, the Technical Specification change does not significantly increase the consequences of a previously evaluated accident. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This amendment does not involve any accident precursors or initiators. During an accident involving the release of radioactivity to the secondary containment atmosphere an operable emergency ventilation circuit would already be running and performing its safety function. The operating status of a running emergency ventilation circuit, which was manually started, would be unaffected by the receipt of an automatic start signal due to the detection of high radiation in secondary containment. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The current Technical Specifications, LCO 3.4.4, provide a margin of safety by requiring both emergency ventilation circuits to be operable during a refueling condition. With one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable, the current Technical Specifications allow continuation of refueling for up to seven days, at which time refueling must be stopped. This Technical Specification requirement ensures that an emergency ventilation circuit will be available to provide a filtered release to the environment during an accident which could result in the release of radioactivity to the secondary containment atmosphere. The proposed change to LCO 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. By placing the remaining operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, active single failures associated with its startup have been eliminated. These eliminated failures include automatic initiation instrumentation, relaying logic, breaker operation, fan startup and valve operation. With an operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, its safety function is being performed. In addition, the status of the operating emergency ventilation circuit is indicated in the control room. Therefore, the running, operable emergency ventilation circuit provides a level of safety comparable to two non-running, operable emergency ventilation circuits. Based upon the above analysis, the margin of safety is not significantly reduced by allowing refueling to continue beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable since the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. These changes are consistent with Amendment No. 47 for Nine Mile Point Unit 2 and with the Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433. Accordingly, as determined by the analysis above, this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Capra Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 27, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would relocate Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.2.7, ``Reactor Coolant Isolation Valves,'' and 3.3.4, ``Primary Containment Isolation Valves,'' from TS 3.2.7/4.2.7 and 3.3.4/4.3.4, respectively, to a plant procedure overning lists removed from TSs per Generic Letter (GL) 91-08, ``Removal of Component Lists from Technical Specifications.'' The plant procedure would be subject to the requirements specified in the Administrative Controls section of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (NMP-1) TS. The proposed amendment would also make conforming changes to the TS Bases. These lists of valves will continue to be included in the NMP-1 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The licensee stated that the proposed changes would be consistent with NRC staff guidance issued in GL 91-08. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 1.The proposed amendment does not involve a physical change to any system, structure, or component that affects the probability or consequences of any accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety. Relocation of the component lists to plant procedures and the Updated FSAR is in accordance with Generic Letter 91-08. This change does not alter the existing operability or surveillance requirements for the components to which they apply. The proposed changes are under the change control provisions in Section 6.0, ``Administrative Controls,'' of the Technical Specifications. The changes associated with the Bases for Specification[s] 3.2.7/4.2.7 and 3.3.4/4.3.4 are consistent with the issuance of prior license amendments. Since the proposed amendment does not affect the operation or testing of any plant systems or components, it will have no impact on the probability or consequences of accidents or malfunctions previously evaluated. 2.The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.2.7/4.2.7, 3.3.4/4.3.4 and Bases do not introduce any new modes of plant operation or new accident precursors, involve any physical alterations to plant configurations, or make changes to system setpoints which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The proposed changes relocate Reactor Coolant Primary Containment Isolation Valve Tables 3.2.7 and 3.3.4 into a procedure governing controlled lists removed from TS per Generic Letter 91-08 under the change control provisions in Section 6.0, ``Administrative Controls,'' of the Technical Specifications. The testing associated with these valves remains unchanged, therefore, it will not affect system or component operability. In addition, the removal of generic reference to the 60 second closure time is consistent with previously issued license amendments and has no impact on either the Limiting Condition for Operation or Surveillance Requirement. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Technical Specification Limiting Conditions for Operation and Surveillance Requirements for the valves listed in Tables 3.2.7 and 3.3.4 are not being altered. The valve lists will be incorporated into a procedure governing controlled lists removed from TS per Generic Letter 91-08. This is controlled by Section 6.0, ``Administrative Procedures.'' In addition, removal of generic reference to the 60 second closure time is consistent with previously issued license amendments and has no impact on either the Limiting Conditions for Operation or Surveillance Requirements. Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wetterhahn, Esquire, Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-443, Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, Rockingham County, New Hampshire Date of amendment request: October 4, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would delete the emergency diesel-generator engine speed specification from Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.8.1.1.2a.5 and would replace the diesel engine speed requirement with an electrical frequency requirement in SR 4.8.1.1.2g. Currently, SR 4.8.1.1.2a.5 specifies both a minimum engine speed and a nominal electrical frequency and acceptable deviation from the nominal value. SR 4.8.1.1.2g currently specifies only a minimum engine speed. The specified minimum engine speed is not consistent with the acceptable frequency deviation below the nominal value. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is presented below. A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes merely delete the specification of emergency diesel-generator minimum engine speed while retaining or substituting the specification of electrical frequency to be attained by the emergency diesel-generator. The diesel engine and generator are directly coupled and must rotate at the same speed, therefore, speed and frequency are directly related and specification of acceptance values for both parameters is redundant. Furthermore, electrical frequency, not engine speed, is the parameter of interest with regard the ability of the system to power emergency loads. The proposed changes do not affect the adequacy of the surveillance test or the reliability of the system to power emergency loads, and do not involve any physical changes to facility structures, systems, or components. Therefore, since the reliability of the emergency diesel-generators will not be reduced, the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated is not increased. B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because no physical changes to facility structures, systems, or components are involved and they do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated. C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or involve changes to equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility. Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Stolz North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-443, Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, Rockingham County, New Hampshire Date of amendment request: October 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would implement 13 of the 47 line item Technical Specification (TS) improvements recommended by Generic Letter 93-05. Most of the proposed changes would revise the allowable time intervals for performing certain Surveillance Requirements (SR) on various plant components during power operation or would delete the requirement entirely or under certain conditions. One proposed change would modify testing requirements identified in an ACTION statement. The specific changes are as follows: 1. SR 4.1.3.1.2 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of any partially or fully withdrawn control rod would be increased to 92 days from 31 days. 2. SR 4.6.4.1 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the hydrogen monitors by performing an Analog Channel Operational Test (ACOT) would be increased to 92 days from 31 days, and by performing a Channel Calibration to every refueling outage from 92 days on a staggered basis. 3. SR 4.3.2.1, Table 4.3-2, Functional Unit 3.c.4 and SR 4.3.3.1, Table 4.3-3, Functional Units 1 through 6 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the radiation monitors by performing an ACOT and Digital Channel Operational Test (DCOT) would be increased to quarterly from monthly. 4. SR 4.4.6.2.2 - The time the plant may be in Cold Shutdown before Pressure Isolation Valve testing is required prior to entering Mode 2 would be increased to 7 days from 72 hours. 5. SR 4.4.11.1 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the Reactor Coolant System vent block valves would be increased to cold shutdown from every 92 days. 6. SR 4.4.3.2 - The allowable interval between tests to verify pressurizer heater capacity would be increased to each refueling outage from 92 days. 7. SR 4.5.1.1.1 - The requirement to verify the boron concentration of the accumulator contents after a volume increase of 1-percent or more would be removed under certain conditions. 8. SR 4.5.1.1.2 - The requirement to perform an ACOT and Channel Calibration on accumulator water level and pressure instrumentation would be deleted. 9. SR 4.5.2 - The requirement to visually inspect the containment sump upon completion of each containment entry would be modified to avoid unnecessary containment sump inspections when multiple containment entries are made on the same day. 10. SR 4.6.2.1 - The allowable interval between tests to verify that each containment spray nozzle is unobstructed would be increased to every 10 years from 5 years. 11. SR 4.6.4.2 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate operability of each hydrogen recombiner system would be increased to each refueling interval from 6 months. 12. SR 4.7.1.2.1 - The allowable interval between tests of the auxiliary and startup feedwater pumps would be increased to 92 days on a staggered test basis from 31 days. 13. TS 3.8.1.1 - The ACTION statements would be changed so that when the Limiting Conditions for Operation are not met due to: a. Inoperability of one or two offsite power circuits the starting of a diesel-generator would no longer be required; b. Inoperability of one diesel-generator, starting of the remaining diesel-generator would be required within 8 hours only under certain conditions instead of within 24 hours under all conditions; c. Inoperability of a diesel-generator and an offsite power circuit, starting of the remaining diesel-generator would be required within 8 hours only under certain conditions instead of within 24 hours under all conditions. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is presented below. A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes either merely modify the allowable intervals between certain surveillance tests, delete the SR, or alter an ACTION statement with regard to required testing. The safety functions of the related structures, systems, or components are not changed in any manner nor are the reliabilities of any structure, system, or component reduced by the revised surveillance or testing requirements. The changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature, structure, system, or component. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures, and the safety functions and reliabilities of structures, systems, or components are not affected, there is no affect upon the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed. B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not change the facility or affect the manner by which the facility is operated. The proposed changes merely change certain surveillance or testing requirements. C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because they do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or change equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility. Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Thomas Dignan, Esquire, Ropes & Gray, One International Place, Boston Massachusetts 02110-2624. NRC Project Director: John F. Stolz Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50-336, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, New London County, Connecticut Date of amendment request: December 17, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment changes the action statements for the limiting conditions associated with the electrical power sources (Technical Specification 3.8.1.1). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92, NNECO has reviewed the attached proposed changes and has concluded that they do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 will decrease the wear on the EDGs [emergency diesel generators] by reducing the number of required starts. These changes will also allow adequate time for the completion of manufacturer recommended EDG engine prelube and warmup procedures. They ensure that the operability of the AC sources is demonstrated with reasonable assurance. Also, the reliability of the EDGs will be enhanced by reducing the potential for numerous unloaded EDG starts during an LCO [limiting condition for operation] period. The proposed changes could reduce the number of required unloaded EDG starts from nine to one. Therefore, these proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 do not alter the method of operating the plant, nor do they introduce any new failure modes. The proposed changes affect EDG testing frequency only, they have no impact on any accident analysis. The proposed changes provide assurance that the EDGs will be able to power their respective safety systems if required. Also, they do not involve any physical alterations to plant equipment or procedures which would introduce any new or unique operational modes or accident precursors. 3.Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 do not affect the capability of the EDGs to perform their function. The intent of the changes is to increase the overall EDG reliability, by reducing the wear resulting from excessive and unwarranted testing. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Stolz Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: June 12, 1992, as supplemented September 17, 1992, March 17, 1993, August 17, 1993, August 18, 1993, and December 29, 1993. Description of amendment request: The purpose of the proposed changes is to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to permit operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant at an uprated power of 2536 MWt. The licensee's engineering analyses and evaluations confirm that the plant can be operated at an uprated power. The increase in the rated power from 2436 MWt to 2536 MWt corresponds to a 4.8 percent increase in rated steam flow. The increase in rated power remains below the plant design power level of 2550 MWt which was the basis for the original plant safety evaluation. The changes affect the operating parameters of the reactor, operational restrictions, setpoints for safety systems, analytical results, and test requirements. There are also administrative changes. The changes in each of these categories are summarized as follows: Reactor Parameters: The effect on reactor parameters is limited. Higher power is achieved by control rod pattern adjustments to increase reactor thermal power in a more uniform (flattened) power distribution to increase steam flow without increasing core recirculation flow. This requires an increased reactor dome pressure for adequate turbine inlet pressure. Operational Limits: The increased thermal power requires a change to the limitation on operation in the high power low flow portion of the power/flow map to limit thermal hydraulic instabilities and power oscillations. Setpoints: The increased reactor pressure has a direct impact on the high pressure scram setpoint and the safety relief valve setpoint. Additionally, the bypass for the turbine stop valve closure and control valve fast closure scram will be changed in proportion to the increase in thermal power. Analysis Results: Analyses of uprated power transients and accidents requires changes to various TS and their Bases. Operational parameters and assumptions used in analyses were revised to reflect their use as initial conditions. Revised radiological analyses changed dose results. The results of the accident analyses requires revisions to properly reflect plant capabilities. Testing: A number of changes to testing requirements result from power uprate. The increase to reactor pressure has a direct effect on hydrostatic leakage testing pressure. The test pressure for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) pumps will be revised to reflect safety relief valve setpoints assumed in analyses. Administrative: Administrative changes (i.e., adding references, revising references and correcting associated errors) will also be made. No changes to the Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications were identified. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant at a thermal power of 2536 MWt will not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant was reviewed for operation at a rated power of 2550 MWt at the time of its operating license, [***]. This review was based on the original design of the plant. Since that time, a number of safety issues of a generic and plant specific nature as well as plant modifications have changed the originally reviewed design. Generic criteria, methodologies and evaluation scope required to uprate BWRs up to 5% were prepared by General Electric and submitted to the NRC in LTR-1 [NEDC-31897P-A, ``Generic Guidelines for General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate"]. This was supplemented by the submittal of generic evaluations in LTR-2 [NEDC-31984P, ``Generic Evaluations of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate'' and Supplement 1] to determine: which NRC and industry generic communications were applicable to power uprate and how they should be treated; analytical evaluations that could be generically approved; bounding evaluations of components and equipment, and; the effect of power uprate on safety margin. These generic evaluations are supplemented by plant specific evaluations. The Power Uprate Safety Analysis Report (PUSAR) describes the dependence placed on References 1 and 2, the additional analyses that were performed, the results of these additional analyses and overall conclusions on the safety impacts of power uprate. The plant systems and components will be within design limits at power uprate conditions with minor modifications. At uprated power, the power plant will not be operated in a manner that is different from current operations except for limited changes to operating parameters such as primary system pressure, steam flow and feedwater temperature. Setpoints are revised as necessary to reflect new operational conditions and analyses. The ECCS-LOCA [emergency core cooling system-loss-of-coolant accident] analysis using current practices demonstrates compliance with design and regulatory acceptance criteria at uprated power. The radiological consequences of accidents have been evaluated using more current methodologies with consistent assumptions and continue to meet acceptance criteria. Compliance with NRC dose criteria using current methodologies is discussed in Section 9.2 of the PUSAR. The effect of power uprate on dose analyses now discussed in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] were qualitatively assessed recognizing that power uprate increases doses in direct proportion to the 4.1% increase in thermal power. An increase of 4.1% to the calculated doses currently identified in FSAR Chapter 14 indicates that a reevaluation using the original methodology would have demonstrated compliance with current NRC dose criteria. A review of Table 14.4-2 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, offsite doses would be substantially less than NRC allowable values. A review of Table 14.8-1 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, control room doses would be substantially less than NRC allowables except for the main steam line break (MSLB). However, the MSLB dose would drop well below allowables once the proposed change on allowable coolant activity (reduces the limit by more than a factor of ten) is accounted for. [Thus, based on the above analysis and supplemental analyses performed by the NRC staff, the increase in power level discussed herein and associated Technical Specification changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.] 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Operation at uprated power involves no changes to the manner in which the plant is operated. There are changes to operational parameters and setpoints but analyses of these identified no new failure modes or accident scenarios. The effects of transients and accidents fall within design capabilities. Systems and components are capable of operating and performing their safety functions at uprated power. No mechanisms for creating a new or different accident were identified. 3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The power uprate will not result in significant increases to primary system temperature and pressure due to postulated operating transients or accidents. These and other margins of safety have been discussed in the PUSAR, where it is demonstrated that there will be no reductions in the margin of safety because the plant will still meet its design and regulatory acceptance criteria. For example, the core will continue to be operated with the same margin to the safety limit minimum critical power ratio. Fuel thermal limits will continue to meet NRC acceptance criteria. Plant systems and equipment are designed for uprated power conditions and have been evaluated for their capability to perform at uprated conditions. They will continue to perform within design limits. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 22, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications proposes to remove the reference to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard D 270-65 from Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i. ASTM D 270-65, which specifies procedures to draw a representative fuel oil sample, has been superseded and is no longer in effect. The FitzPatrick Surveillance Procedure currently requires sampling in accordance with ASTM D 270-65 but notes that it has been superseded by ASTM D 4057-88. The proposed change makes Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i consistent with fuel oil Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1, for the emergency diesel generators (EDGs), by adopting the current industry fuel oil sampling standard. There are no changes to the acceptance criteria for fuel oil quality which are based on ASTM D 975-81. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Plant accident analyses are not affected by the Technical Specification change. The change removes reference to ASTM D 270-65 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fuel oil from Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i. The American Society for Testing and Materials has superseded ASTM D 270-65 with ASTM D 4057. The proposed change provides improved flexibility to adopt standards as they are issued without requiring a license amendment and makes Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i consistent with both Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1 for the EDG and the STS [Standard Technical Specification]. The nature of this change will not cause any increase in the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed change involves no hardware modifications to any plant structures, systems or components. The change removes reference to ASTM D 270-65 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fuel oil from Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i. The American Society for Testing and Materials has superseded ASTM D 270-65 with ASTM D 4057. The nature of this change is such that no new or different kind of accident can be created. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change will not cause a reduction in the margin of safety. The results of the plant accident analyses continue to bound operation under the proposed changes so there is no reduction in the margin of safety. The change removes reference to ASTM D 270-65 to allow the use of ASTM D 4057-88 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fire pump fuel oil. The change will make Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i consistent with existing Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1 for the EDG and allow current standards to be used for fuel oil sampling. Revisions of this nature will not cause a reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Pratt, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 28, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TSs) revises the scope of startup and power escalation reports to reflect the guidance provided by the Standard Technical Specifications (STS). Current TS requirements state, ``The report shall address each of the tests identified in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] ....'' The list of tests provided in the FSAR includes many tests which were required for the initial plant startup but are not performed for subsequent startups. Currently, the licensee satisfies TS requirements in the startup reports by identifying tests which are not performed, their purpose, and the reason for not performing them. The inclusion of such a section in the startup reports is unnecessary. This amendment would revise the TSs to permit subsequent startup reports to address only those tests that are actually performed. Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes involve no hardware modifications, no changes to the operation of any system or component, no changes to structures, and alters future startup reports by addressing only tests that are performed. A change in reporting format will not eliminate the performance of startup tests that are necessary or required. These changes can not alter the probability or consequences of existing accident analyses as documented in the FSAR or the NRC staff SER [Safety Evaluation Report]. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The changes do not alter the testing procedures or methodologies. The changes provide a basis, in accordance with NRC guidance, for allowing future startup test reports to mention and discuss only those tests that are actually performed. These changes can not result in a new or different type of accident than those previously evaluated. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. There are no changes to tests that are performed in support of plant startup [***]. Removing a requirement for reporting on tests that are not performed will not cause a reduction in any margin of safety. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 29, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would eliminate an inconsistency between the Reactor Coolant System (RSC) leakage detection and operability requirements in Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) 3.6.D.1 and 3.6.D.4. LCO 3.6.D.1 currently requires that RCS leakage be below specified limits when there is irradiated fuel in the reactor vessel and reactor coolant temperature is greater than 212 ○F. LCO 3.6.D.4 requires the leakage monitoring systems to be operable during power operation (i.e., when the mode switch is in the Startup/Hot Standby position or the Run position with the reactor critical above 1 percent rated power, as defined per Specification 1.0.O). These two LCOs are not consistent. The proposed revision of LCO 3.6.D.4 will take the more conservative approach of requiring the leakage monitoring systems to be operable when the leakage limits of LCO 3.6.D.1 are in effect. The proposed changes also make editorial corrections which are considered administrative in nature. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and no changes to structures. It alters an LCO to require plant leakage detection systems to be operable during the same plant conditions that RCS leakage limits apply. The revised LCO requires leakage detection systems in operational modes consistent with other portions of the Technical Specifications. Additional changes include editorial corrections such as correct specification numbering, proper system identification, and clarification of a surveillance requirement cross reference. Since the change to the LCO for leakage detection will require operability under a greater range of plant conditions to be consistent with detection requirements, there is no change to previously determined accident probabilities or consequences. The editorial changes have no adverse safety implications. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and no changes to structures. It alters the Technical Specifications only to the extent of making two LCOs consistent by requiring the leakage detection system to be operable when leakage limits apply and making editorial changes. Editorial changes and increasing the plant conditions for leakage system operability can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated since the editorial changes have no safety significance and the operability changes are being made for consistency with the modes when leakage detection is required to function. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment revisions involve no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems and no changes to structures. The revised LCO criteria for RCS leakage detection system operability has increased the plant conditions when operability is required to match the plant conditions when leakage limits apply. Editorial changes and expanded operability requirements in the LCOs will not result in any change to existing safety margins. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: December 29, 1993 Description of amendment request: This proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications, Appendix B, revises Surveillance Requirement 3.1.a and Table 3.10-2. The existing Surveillance Requirement in Specification 3.1.a, which references Table 3.10-2, requires the performance of instrument checks, tests, and calibrations to assure the operability of specific gaseous effluent radiation monitors. It does not require any surveillances for the associated data recorders. However, Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.a specifically states that ''...pathways shall be monitored and recorded ....'' which requires the recorders to be operable for the gaseous effluent monitoring system to be considered operable. The proposed changes to the Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications (RETS) add the radiation monitor recorders to the Surveillance Requirement and Table 3.10-2 for the gaseous effluent monitoring system. This will provide the surveillance requirements for the data recorders. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and no changes to structures. It alters procedures by including the recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for determining the operability of the radiological monitoring/recording instrumentation. The inclusion of the data recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for checking, testing, and calibration does not reduce gaseous effluent monitoring capability while providing greater assurance that data is recorded. Adding the existing system surveillance to the Technical Specifications will not have any affect on previously evaluated accident probabilities or consequences. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and no changes to structures. It alters procedures by including the data recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for the radiation monitors. These changes do not affect the manner in which the gaseous effluent radiation monitoring system is operated or tested. The resulting changes do not pose a safety issue concern different from those analyzed previously in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] or the NRC staff SER [Safety Evaluation Report]. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems and no changes to structures. It alters procedures by including the data recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for the radiation monitors. The revised surveillance requirement increases the scope of surveillance for the gaseous effluent radiation monitoring system, for consistency with the LCO. It does not cause any reduction in any safety margins. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York Date of amendment request: January 11, 1994 Description of amendment request: This proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TS) would temporarily waive the 2-year maximum surveillance interval for the Type C test (local leak rate test) of the shutdown cooling isolation valves (10MOV-17 and 10MOV-18). The waiver would permit deferring this test until the next refueling outage, currently scheduled for the end of November 1994. TS 4.7.A.2.e(5) and 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix J require the containment isolation valves to be leak-rate tested during each refueling outage, but at intervals of not greater than 2 years. As a result of the extended 1991-1993 refueling outage, and the length of the current operating cycle, tests of all containment isolation valves are due prior to the start of the next refueling outage. Two mid-cycle outages were scheduled, in part, to accommodate the testing of these valves, except for the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The shutdown cooling isolation valves cannot be removed from service during a non-refueling outage to accommodate a leak-rate test since its associated system is needed to remove reactor decay heat. The reliability of the isolation valve design, and the very low probability that the shutdown cooling system penetration would result in a pathway for leakage to the reactor building, as discussed in the application, is provided as justification for this one-time schedular extension. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is limited to a one-time schedular extension in the shutdown cooling isolation valve Type C test. The change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation, make any physical changes, or alter any operational setpoints. Therefore, the change does not degrade the performance of any safety system assumed to function in the accident analysis. The extension will not result in a significant increase in valve leakage considering that: (1) the valves are infrequently stroked, and then only when the reactor vessel is at low pressure, (2) monitoring the normal operating status of the RHR [residual heat removal] system assures the absence of gross valve leakage, and (3) the valves were replaced with valves of an improved design which has been confirmed by past Type C tests to exhibit satisfactory leak rate performance. For these reasons, the change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident. The change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident evaluated since any leakage through the shutdown cooling penetration will not significantly increase for reasons discussed in the previous paragraph, and such leakage is negligible compared to the main steam line break accident analyzed in the FSAR [final safety analysis report]. 2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a one-time schedule extension for the shutdown cooling isolation valve Type C tests. 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. There is a very low probability of a significant increase in valve leakage considering the demonstrated reliability of the current valve design, the infrequent use of the valves, and the monitoring of the normal operating status of the RHR system. Moreover, any potential incremental benefit of performing the tests within the two year requirement would not be sufficient to offset the increased occupational radiation exposure associated with testing, and the risk to plant safety associated with the removal from service of the primary method of decay heat removal. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Capra Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: October 1, 1993 TS 93-09 Description of amendment request: The proposed changes would revise the setpoints and time delays for the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) and 6.9 kv shutdown board loss of voltage and degraded voltage instrumentation. The proposed changes would affect Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.3-3, 3.3-4, 3.3-5, 4.3-2, and the Bases for Specification 3/4.7.1.2. Table 3.3-3 would be revised: (1) to reflect the use of a two-out-of-three voltage sensor logic for loss of power detection (and one-out-of-two logic scheme for the timing relays) by adding requirements for the respective AFW, 6.9 kv shutdown board, and emergency diesel generator (EDG) voltage sensors and load shed timers; (2) by changing the description of the functional unit from ``Station Blackout'' to ``Loss of Power Start;'' (3) by adding a footnote to indicate that the new requirements apply only to the shutdown boards on the same unit; (4) by increasing the modes for which the EDG sensors and timers must be operable to include Modes 5 and 6 when the associated EDG must be operable; (5) by changing the associated Action statements to reflect the design changes and consistency; (6) to reflect consistent terminology in the Table and action statements; (7) by changing the minimum number of channels that would be required to be operable; (8) by changing the footnote to reflect the conditions when the loss-of-power instrumentation is required to be operable in Modes 5 and 6; and (9) by adding an exclusion to Specification 3.0.4. Similar changes were proposed for Tables 3.3-4, 3.3-5 and 4.3-2. The proposed change to Bases 3/4.7.1.2 would clarify AFW operability on loss of power. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed revision supports the implementation of design logic and setpoint changes to the loss-of-power relaying. This relaying is designed to ensure adequate voltage is available to safety-related loads in order to enhance their operability and support accident mitigation functions and to provide for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump starts. The design changes alter relay logic and delete unnecessary relaying, but do not change the diesel generator (D/G) start and load-shedding actuations that result from loss-of-power conditions. Therefore, no new actuations or functions have been created; and because the existing and proposed functions provide for accident mitigation considerations that are not the source of an accident, the probability of an accident is not increased. The deletion of the 6.9-kilovolt shutdown board normal-feeder undervoltage relays actually reduces the potential for inadvertent shutdown board blackouts as a result of short-duration voltage transients or instrument failures. The setpoints and time delays for loss-of-power functions have been modified based on the guidelines developed by the Electrical Distribution System Clearinghouse as evaluated and determined through detailed analysis by TVA. This design is documented in TVA Calculations SQN-EEB-MS-TI06-0008, 27DAT, and DS-1-2 and is available for NRC review at the SQN site. The assigned values are conservative settings that will ensure adequate voltage is supplied to safety-related loads for accident mitigation and safety functions under normal, degraded, and loss-of-offsite-power voltage conditions with appropriate time delays to prevent damage to electrical loads and minimize premature or unnecessary actuations. The identification of loss-of-voltage conditions is enhanced by the design changes to ensure the timely sequencing of loads onto the D/G and the initiation of AFW pump starts for accident mitigation. Because there are no reductions in safety functions resulting from the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay changes to the loss-of-power instrumentation and offsite dose levels for postulated accidents will not be increased, the consequences of an accident are not increased. The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification incorporated in the proposed change do not affect plant functions. These changes reflect the requirements that SQN has been maintaining and serve to clarify the requirements to provide consistency of application and easier understanding. The AFW footnote addition and bases revision only clarify operability conditions that are consistent with the plant design for the AFW pump and loss-of-power instrumentation. Because there are no changes to plant functions or operations, these revisions have no impact on accident probabilities or consequences. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. As described above, the loss-of-power instrumentation ensures adequate voltage to safety-related loads by initiating D/G starts and load shedding and provides for AFW pump starting, but is not considered to be the source of an accident. Although the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay actuation criteria have changed, the output functions to various plant systems that actuate for load shedding and D/G starts remain the same. Therefore, actuation criteria have been affected, but not safety functions, and the TVA evaluation has confirmed that the new design enhances the ability to maintain adequate voltage to support safety functions. Since safety functions have not changed and the new loss-of-power instrumentation design continues to support operability of safety-related equipment, no new or different accident is created. The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification, as well as the AFW operability clarifications, do not affect plant functions and will not create a new accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed loss-of-power TS changes support design logic, setpoint, and time-delay requirements that have been verified by TVA analysis to provide acceptable voltage levels for safety-related components. In determining the acceptability of these voltage levels, the minimum voltage for operation as well as detrimental component heating resulting from sustained degraded-voltage conditions were considered. This design ensures that safety-related loads will be available and operable for normal and accident plant conditions. The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, response time measurement clarification, and AFW operability clarifications provide enhancements to TS requirements and do not affect plant functions. Therefore, no safety functions are reduced by these changes and there is no reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Hebdon Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: November 18, 1993 (TS 93-17) Description of amendment request: The proposed change would delete the requirement of License Condition 2.H of the Operating License. This license condition requires reporting the violation of certain license conditions to the NRC Regional Administrator within 24 hours by phone and facsimile, and a followup report within 14 days. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is a deletion of an administrative reporting requirement that does not in any way affect a previously analyzed accident. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not affect any accident initiators for SQN. No new failure modes are introduced. 3.Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins are established through limiting conditions of operation, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified in the TSs. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will be no changes to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits. The proposed changes are administrative and do not affect the safe operation of SQN. Therefore, there will be no changes to any of the margins of safety. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 Attorney for licensee: General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 West Summit Hill Drive, ET 11H, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902 NRC Project Director: Frederick J. Hebdon Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee Date of amendment request: December 7, 1993 (TS 93-16) Description of amendment request: The proposed change would incorporate the following changes to Section 6.0, ``Administrative Controls,'' of the Technical Specifications (TS): (1) delete Section 6.1.2 that indicates that the Corporate Manager of Radiological Control has the responsibility for the radiological environmental program, dose calculations, and projections; (2) added a requirement in Section 6.5.1.6 for review of the Offsite Dose Calculations Manual (ODCM) by the Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC); (3) added implementation of the ODCM to Section 6.8.1 as an activity requiring written procedures and deleted the requirement that they be maintained by the Radiological Control Group; (4) delete the requirement in Section 6.8.4.a for Radiological Control to implement and control the ODCM; (5) changed the review authority for changes to the ODCM from the Radiological Assessment Review Committee (RARC) to the PORC and added a reference to Specification 6.5.1A in Section 6.14.1.2; (6) approval authority for deviations from the overtime guidelines in Section 6.2.2.g would be changed to show that Plant Manager designee also has the authority; (7) PORC member titles would be changed in accordance with the current organizational structure; (8) the requirements for the RARC would be deleted from Sections 6.5.2.7.i, 6.5.3, 6.10.2.k and the index; (9) move the condenser inleakage monitoring requirement from Section 6.8.5.c.(vii) to 6.8.5.c.(iii) and delete the requirement to repair, plug, or isolate leaks; (10) change the title ``Shift Supervisor'' (SS) to ``Shift Operations Supervisor'' (SOS) in various locations in Section 6 and in Operating License Items 2.C.(23).A and 2.C.(16).a for Units 1 and 2 respectively; (11) change the title of the Senior Vice President, Nuclear Group, in Section 6.2.1 to Senior Vice President, Nuclear Power; (12) change the title of the Operational Quality Assurance Program in Section 6.5.2.8.d to Nuclear Quality Assurance Program; and (13) move the requirement for implementation of the Quality Assurance Program for environmental monitoring from Section 6.8.4.b to Section 6.8.1.h. Other administrative changes related to these changes were also submitted that affect Section 6.0, the operating license, index, and definitions. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). The operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes only affect the administrative controls found in Section 6.0 of the SQN TSs and the operating license. No plant equipment or operating practices are affected by these changes. The revised administrative controls will continue to adequately implement administrative activities to support plant nuclear safety. Since there are no physical changes to the plant, there is no increase in the probability of an accident because these administrative controls are not the source of previously evaluated accidents. Similarly, with no change to plant equipment or operating requirements, the plant response to accident conditions and therefore the consequences of an accident remain unchanged. These proposed changes will not increase the consequences of an accident and offsite dose rates will not be impacted. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The administrative controls affected by the proposed changes are not considered to be the source of any accident and these changes will not alter any plant features or processes. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and the administrative controls will continue to implement the actions necessary to support plant activities and nuclear safety. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant features and setpoints remain unchanged by the proposed changes to the administrative controls. The margins of safety established by the SQN design are not affected by these changes. The proposed administrative controls will continue to maintain the actions and programs that ensure appropriate plant design, operation, and procedures to support the required margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes will not reduce the margin of safety. The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library,1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 Attorney for licensee: General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 West Summit Hill Drive, ET 11H, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902 NRC Project Director: Frederick J. Hebdon Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: September 29, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would change the test intervals from monthly to quarterly, consistent with the Inservice Test Program, for several pumps and related systems, including safety injection, residual heat removal and containment spray pumps. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of specific general considerations related to equipment surveillance requirements and their relationship to equipment operability are administrative in nature. They do not change the interpretation or intent of the Technical Specifications. These conditions are consistent with the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications (STS). The addition of the specific requirement for the Inservice Test Program to Section 15.4.2 of the Technical Specifications only reiterates the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g). This requirement does not implement any new requirements on the operation or testing of equipment. The decrease in the number of equipment operational transients due to the increase in the surveillance interval for the Safety Injection System (SI), Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System, and Containment Spray (CS) System pumps and valves will result in an increase in system availability. Reduced testing is also expected to have a positive affect on overall equipment reliability since frequent testing results in increased wear and potential for equipment failure. Other actions including a monthly verification of system lineups for the SI, CS and RHR systems provides increased assurance of system operability between surveillance tests. The potential for equipment problems to go undetected for a longer period of time is small as indicated by equipment surveillance history. Therefore, these changes will not effect the probability or consequences of previously analyzed accidents. 2. The proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. These changes only affect the equipment testing frequency. Equipment design, operation and the methods of testing will not be changed. Therefore, the proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendments will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes which implement the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g) and clarify the general considerations related to equipment surveillances are administrative in nature. They do not change the intent of any existing license or other requirement. The increase in equipment surveillance intervals will result in an improvement in equipment and system availability and reliability. Surveillance of equipment will be performed as required by the regulations and Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. These proposed changes will reduce the potential for equipment failures due to unnecessary testing. Adequate assurance is provided by testing in accordance with the ASME Code requirements and periodic verification of system lineups to ensure that the affected systems remain operable and capable of performing their design function. Therefore, a reduction in a margin of safety will not occur. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street, Two Rivers, Wisconsin 54241. Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: December 1, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by incorporating technical and administrative changes to TS 3.10, Control Rod and Power Distribution Limits. The proposed changes eliminate specifications for fuel designs no longer used at Kewaunee, specify required actions to be taken upon exceeding control bank insertion limits, and revise the limits for Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) related parameters to assure operation within the assumptions of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) analyses. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: (a) TS 3.10.b.1, 3.10.b.4 and Table TS 3.10-2 The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes eliminate the specifications for fuel that is no longer used at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant. Eliminating these specifications does not affect the probability of any accident previously evaluated. The specifications for the current fuel vendor are being retained and ensure the consequences of previously evaluated Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) related accidents are enveloped by the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) analyses. Therefore, these changes will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change deletes specifications for fuel that is no longer used at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant. The limits for the current fuel vendor are retained and are not affected by this proposed change. This does not alter the input or assumptions of the safety analysis, and therefore it will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. (b) TS 3.10.d The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change specifies the required actions to be taken when the control bank insertion limits are exceeded. The current TS requires compliance with the control bank insertion limits, but gives no corrective action for when these limits are exceeded. The new specification requires operators to initiate boration to restore shutdown margin within one hour of exceeding the control bank insertion limits and to restore the control banks to within the limits within 2 hours. If either of these requirements cannot be achieved, within 1 hour the operators must initiate actions to achieve Hot Standby within the next 6 hours and Hot Shutdown within the following 6 hours. Adding these requirements clarifies and enhances the Technical Specifications and will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed addition is conservative and ensures that proper and adequate measures are taken when the control bank exceeds the control bank insertion limits. Therefore, this addition will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change is conservative and clarifies the necessary actions to be taken when control bank insertion limits are exceeded. This proposed change is an enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety. (c) TS 3.10.k The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change decreases the maximum RCS inlet temperature limit for steady state 100% operation from 536.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 535.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The value of 539.5 degrees Fahrenheit is the assumed RCS inlet temperature for the DNB related accidents analyzed in the USAR. These accidents are the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal at Power Accident, the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal from a Subcritical Condition Accident, the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Misalignment, the Start-Up of an Inactive Reactor Coolant Loop Accident, the Excessive Heat Removal due to Feedwater System Malfunction Accident, the Excessive Load Increase Incident, the Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow Accident, the Loss of External Electrical Load, the Steam Line Break, and the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Ejection. A four degree assumed instrument error reduces the maximum allowed RCS inlet temperature to 535.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Decreasing this value to ensure consistency with the USAR analysis assumptions will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is conservative to ensure that the consequences of a previously evaluated DNB-related accident are enveloped by the USAR analysis. Therefore, this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change is conservative and is consistent with the assumptions in the USAR. This proposed change is an enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety. (d) TS 3.10.l The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change increased the minimum RCS pressure limit for steady-state 100% power operation from the currently specified 2200 psig to 2205 psig. The value of 2205 psig (30 psig below the nominal design value of 2235 psig) was the assumed initial condition for the DNB related accidents analyzed in the USAR. These accidents are the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal at Power Accident, the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal from a Subcritical Condition Accident, the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Misalignment, the Start-Up of an Inactive Reactor Coolant Loop Accident, the Excessive Heat Removal due to Feedwater System Malfunction Accident, the Excessive Load Increase Incident, the Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow Accident, the Loss of External Electrical Load, the Steam Line Break, and the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Ejection. Increasing this value to ensure consistency with the USAR analysis assumptions will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is conservative to ensure that the consequences of a previously evaluated DNB-related accident is enveloped by the USAR analysis. Therefore, this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change is conservative and is consistent with the assumptions in the USAR. This proposed change is an enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety. (e) TS 3.10.m The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. TS 3.10.m.1 provides the limits and required actions to be taken when the RCS flow rate per loop is less than the USAR analysis assumptions. Decreasing the flow limit to be consistent with the USAR assumptions will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. Compliance with the flow limit assumed in the USAR analyses ensures the consequences of previously evaluated DNB-related accidents are enveloped by the USAR analyses. Therefore, this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. The proposed revision places an additional restriction on RCS flow when less than the design flow rate of 89,000 gallons per minute per loop. The intent of specifying action in accordance with 3.10.n is to ensure that reactor power is reduced to a point at which the DNB ratio margin is restored. Compliance with this specification will not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated, nor increase the consequences of an accident. The intent of TS 3.10.m.2 is to clarify the conditions under which the reactor coolant flow rate is verified. The conditions, methodology, and uncertainties associated with this verification are not changed by this specification. Clarifying the TS by inclusion of the conditions for verifying the flow rate will not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidents previously evaluated. A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change. The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. A specification on steady-state RCS flow rate is necessary to ensure DNB ratio criteria will be met during the DNBR limiting events analyzed in the USAR. Reducing the reactor coolant flow limit to the value assumed in the USAR analyses does not result in a reduction in the margin of safety. The additional restrictions being imposed if the specified limit is not met provide additional assurance the DNBR margin will be restored. These additional restrictions do not exist in the current TS. The imposition of these restrictions results in an enhancement to the margin of safety. Clarifying the TS by inclusion of conditions under which the flow verification is to be performed will not reduce the margin of safety. Existing approved constraints, methodology, and uncertainties are not being changed by this clarification. (f) TS 3.10.n The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The intent of this new TS is to outline the actions required when the limits of TS 3.10.k (RCS temperature), TS 3.10.l (RCS pressure) and TS 3.10.m.1 (RCS flow) are exceeded. Collectively, these three specifications place limits on the DNB-related parameters to assure each is maintained within the normal steady-state envelope assumed in the USAR safety analysis. This specification is an enhancement to our existing specification to add clear guidance which does not presently exist. Providing this information for the plant staff and operators will not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of this action statement will ensure that the consequences of an analyzed accident are not increased. The proposed specification allows 2 hours to evaluate and restore parameters to within limits. If this time frame is not satisfied, then within the next 6 hours, power is reduced in order to restore a margin of safety. Following analysis, thermal power may be raised not to exceed a level analyzed to maintain a minimum DNBR of 1.30. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the current specification which does not alter input to the safety analysis. Therefore, it will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. (g) Administrative changes to Section TS 3.10 including Figure TS 3.10-2. The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore, no significant hazards exist. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Hannon Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: December 7, 1993 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 5.3.a.1 to provide flexibility in the repair of fuel assemblies containing damaged and leaking fuel rods by reconstituting the assemblies, provided that an NRC-approved methodology is used. This proposed change is consistent with guidance provided in Supplement 1 to Generic Letter (GL) 90-02, ``Alternative Requirements for Fuel Assemblies in the Design Features Section of Technical Specifications,'' dated July 21, 1992. In addition, administrative changes to KNPP TS Section 5 have been proposed. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: The proposed changes were revised in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: 1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This proposed change to the requirements for ``Fuel Assemblies'' in the ``Design Features'' section of the KNPP TS will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This proposed change will not result in modifications to fuel assemblies that would have a significant effect on safety because of the requirement to implement these changes using an NRC-approved methodology. This requirement will confirm conformance to existing design limits and confirm that safety analyses criteria are met before operation during the next fuel cycle. This license amendment request is consistent with guidance provided by the NRC and will result in flexibility for improved fuel performance. 2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The creation of new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated accident is not considered a possibility because the changes are administrative in nature and do not represent an actual modification to the plant or change its safety analyses. 3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The margin of safety is maintained by adherence to other fuel related TS limits and the USAR design bases. The changes do not directly affect any safety system or the safety limits, and thus does not affect the plant margin of safety. Accordingly, these proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

No significant hazards consideration comments received: No Local Public Document Room location: Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081 Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No significant Hazards Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances) During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a Federal Register notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By March 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
