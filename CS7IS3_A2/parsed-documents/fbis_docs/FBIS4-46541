These are the S-8 and S-13 free-flight rocket weapon systems with rockets with solid-propellant engines and various types of warheads. They are mounted on combat aircraft (helicopters) and intended for engaging enemy armored equipment, engineer works and personnel. Platforms for the S-8 80-mm free-flight air-launched weapons are Su-17M, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-23 and MiG-27 aircraft and also Mi-8, Mi-24, Mi-28 and K-252 helicopters. Its 20 rockets are accommodated in the special B-8M1 rocket pod (length 3,550 mm, diameter 410 mm, empty weight 160 kg, loaded weight 400 kg). It has a conical nose section and good aerodynamic properties. The very same number of rockets is accommodated on helicopters in the B-8V20 rocket pod (length 1,790 mm, diameter 521 mm, empty weight 100 kg, loaded weight 342 kg). The more powerful S-13 122-mm free-flight air-launched rocket weapon system is used on Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 attack aircraft. Its five rockets are located in the B-13L rocket pod (length 3,558 mm, diameter 410 mm, empty weight 160 kg, loaded weight 510 kg).
