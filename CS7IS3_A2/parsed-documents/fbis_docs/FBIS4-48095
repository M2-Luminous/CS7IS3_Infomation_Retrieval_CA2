In a report presented to the UN Security Council yesterday, Butrus Butrus-Ghali supported the idea. [passage omitted] Among the countries which are likely to send troops are Guinea, Australia, and France. The president of the latter says that France would send its troops to Rwanda if requested. However, we hope that the United Nations would not dream of sending French troops to Rwanda, as Rwandans and the world community saw for themselves what the French troops did when they were there. The lack of interest by the world community in sending international troops is mainly due to a lack of understanding. It is the clique in power which continues to ask for the international troops. This is in turn due to the pressure of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] troops on their troops. Recently, in Arusha, the so-called government thought that it was going to meet the RPF. But the RPF refused to meet that government. They [the government] asked that the international community station troops between the two warring sides believing that this could stop the war that they had themselves started through their countrywide massacres. An end to the fighting, they hope, would permit the talks between the RPF and the government which have not taken place yet, to go ahead. The RPF believes that the most urgent assistance that could be given to Rwandans is not the dispatch of troops but of relief assistance consisting of food, medicine, and other necessities.
