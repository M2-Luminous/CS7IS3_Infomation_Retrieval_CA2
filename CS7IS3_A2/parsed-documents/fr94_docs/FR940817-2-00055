FR940817-2-00055 FR940817-2-00043 [FRL&hyph;5027&hyph;1] Fuels and Fuel Additives; Waiver Decision/Circuit Court Remand AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice SUMMARY: On July 12, 1991, under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act (Act), the Ethyl Corporation (Ethyl) requested a waiver to permit the sale of its gasoline additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), an octane enhancer commercially labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, for use in unleaded gasoline. The Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's application for a waiver on January 8, 1992, based primarily on concerns regarding the potential for increases in hydrocarbon emissions resulting from MMT use. Ethyl subsequently sought judicial review of that decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Based on new emissions data developed and submitted to EPA by Ethyl, EPA requested that the Court of Appeals remand Ethyl's application to the Agency for further action. On November 30, 1993, the Administrator of EPA found that Ethyl had met its burden to demonstrate under section 211(f)(4) that approval of its remanded application would not cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. Ethyl agreed to resubmit its application at that time, thereby affording further time for the Agency to consider the issue of potential health effects associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl and EPA later agreed to further extend the deadline for final action on Ethyl's application to July 13, 1994. The Agency is today denying Ethyl's request for a waiver for HiTEC 3000 based on unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of manganese emissions resulting from MMT use on public health.

Background Section 211(f)(1)(A) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective March 31, 1977, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for use in light-duty motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the Act. An interpretive rule defining the term ``substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1)(A) was promulgated for unleaded gasoline at 46 FR 38582 (July 28, 1981), and revised at 56 FR 5352 (February 11, 1991). Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for use by any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model-year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands the prohibitions of 211(f)(1)(A), which apply only to light-duty vehicles.
