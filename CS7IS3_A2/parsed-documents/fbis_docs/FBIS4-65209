The only major new program included in the 1995-2000 military programming law, the famous "French cruise missile," for the time being known as the "APTGD" [long-range precision weapon], will not spark off a fratricidal war between Aerospatiale and Matra, the two manufacturers currently competing for it. Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois promised in Nice on Saturday [7 May] that: "We welcome the launch of the APTGD missile. It is likely that the two manufacturers concerned will be interested in this program. If Matra's Apache missile is chosen, there will be no problem (Aerospatiale has a share of a little over 40 percent in this program); if the Defense Ministry prefers Aerospatiale's ramjet solution, Matra will want to participate in it...and the question of a division will then be raised." Indeed, neither of the two French missile manufacturers can afford to be excluded from this deal, which represents 200 missiles for the domestic market alone and, in view of the new threats, should raise strong demand on foreign markets. The two proposals, which are equal in cost, are estimated at around 2 billion francs [Fr], including development and provision of missiles, whereas Fr1.4 billion has been allocated for this program over the period 1995-2000 of the programming law. A decision by the Defense Ministry in favor of Aerospatiale's ASMP [medium-range air-to-surface]-C missile or Matra's Super-Apache is expected in the next few months. Although he regrets that all the programs involving Aerospatiale have been delayed or have seen their orders cut, Louis Gallois, whose mandate is due for renewal next June, says he has a "positive judgment" on the military program drawn up by Francois Leotard. "The plan exists and we think that it is politically binding on its authors," the Aerospatiale president said, welcoming the .5-percent annual growth rate for equipment funding, and especially the continuation of all the scheduled programs. (His group has had to accept the sudden halting of four major projects in four years, the S-45, Hades, and ANS missiles in the military sphere, and the Hermes space shuttle in the civilian sphere.) Louis Gallois can only applaud the launch of the Helios-2 military observation satellite, the decision by the public authorities to maintain ballistic and ramjet competence, and the pledge on the FLA [Future Large Aircraft] transport plane. He thinks that the launch of the latter is now possible even if London does not order it and if British industry does not participate in its production. Pivotal Position in Europe "We share the objective of reducing the cost of programs because this is also necessary for us to be able to export, but it presupposes an effort by manufacturers, the DGA [General Delegation of Armaments], and the general staffs," Louis Gallois also explained. "The DGA's parameters, which are substantial, must be placed on the table, like ours." While specifying that the military programming law "must not be used to maintain outdated industrial structures," the Aerospatiale president thinks that the French firms are in a pivotal position in the reorganization of the sector in Europe thanks to the Leotard plan. This is an advantage which comes at the right time because Louis Gallois is currently negotiating two proposed alliances with its German partner DASA in missiles and satellites. "It should be possible to settle these projects before the end of the year," he said, expressing the view that "we must aim at something resembling a balance between the partners." However, "these alliances are not ends in themselves, they are not closed," the Aerospatiale president added, explaining that it will be necessary to think quickly about a possible rapprochement between the two Matra-BAe [British Aerospace] and Aerospatiale-DASA tandems in missiles and an opening of the Aerospatiale-DASA alliance to the French company Alcatel in the satellite sphere. With regard to military activities, it will then be necessary "to go and seek alliances in the United States."
