FBIS4-61284 "drsov087_a_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Republics, Regions Threatened With Gas Cutoff Republics, Regions Threatened With Gas Cutoff LD0405193594 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1819 GMT 4 May 94 LD0405193594 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom has warned several republics and regions of the Russian Federation that it would cut off gas supplies to their industrial enterprises due to their debts. In telegrams sent to the republics of Karachay-Circassia, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Bashkiria and Daghestan, to Perm, Novosibirsk, Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Rostov and Voronezh Regions, and to Stavropol Territory, Gazprom says it will suspend its gas deliveries to them between May 4 and 9 and demands that they present schedules for the payment of their arrears, totaling about three billion rubles, a sum which, according to Gazprom sources, is much higher than the overall debt for Russian gas of other former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. The sources told the Oil Information Agency that Moldova had still not presented its own schedule for the repayment of a debt which had reached 131 billion rubles by April 1. As of April 15, Gazprom slashed its supplies to Moldova by one-third. The sources said that this year the republic had transferred "not a single ruble" to Gazprom's bank account, having paid part of its arrears with food exports. The Russian-Moldovan talks on the debt problem, originally scheduled for the end of April, have been postponed until this Friday, the sources said. In an agreement signed by the two countries' governments late last year, Moldova pledged to send to Russia 145 million dollars' worth of food and consumer goods as payment for part of the 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas the republic is due to receive from Gazprom this year. Russia today charges Moldova 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas. Moldova, in turn, charges Russia 1.5 dollars per 100 kilometers for every 1,000 cubic meters of gas pipelined through Moldovan territory to Romania.
