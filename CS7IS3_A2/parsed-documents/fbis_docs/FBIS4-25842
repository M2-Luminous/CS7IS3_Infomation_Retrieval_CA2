In order to establish and refine a socialist market economic mechanism, the province will step up verification of equipment imported by foreign-funded enterprises, as well as assessment of assets owned by foreign-funded enterprises. Since last year, the province has assessed assets owned by 16 groups of foreign-funded enterprises -- including enterprises run with one of three types of capital: foreign capital, overseas Chinese capital, and with both Chinese and foreign capital -- and has verified a total of $3.076 million in assets. Owing to the province's belated asset assessment work, only 2.1 percent of the province's foreign-funded enterprises thus far have participated in the asset assessment process, while only 0.5 percent of the province's foreign funds, including those invested in enterprises run with three types of capital, have been assessed. In order to guarantee continued economic growth and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors with relevant laws, the province yesterday held a work meeting on publicizing and implementing a series of foreign investment and foreign-owned asset assessment and management measures. Lin Jingxin, provincial commercial inspection bureau chief, delivered at yesterday's meeting a speech in which he called on all units concerned to vigorously publicize and strictly implement the measures drawn up by State Commercial Inspection Bureau and Ministry of Finance. Lin urged leaders at all levels, foreign-related asset assessment offices, foreign-related accounting offices, and other departments concerned across the province to attach great importance to, actively coordinate with, and vigorously support foreign-related asset assessment work.
