The chairman of the committee, who is a member of the Socialist Party [HSP], evaluated the deputies' work of the year at a news conference. Levente Sukosd reports: [Sukosd] In the past year the committee operated as a forum for creating political consensus and with good result, said Laszlo Kovacs of the HSP, chairman of the committee. [passage omitted] In reply to a question, Laszlo Kovacs said that the committee analyzed the Russian situation not long ago, but no joint stand was formulated. The chairman said that in his view, the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon did not mean danger for Hungary at present, for a strong presidential power prevails in Russia. However, we cannot be optimistic in the long term he added, for it is not only the grave economic condition which caused the present situation but also the increasing nostalgia in the Russian army and the population for Russia's former superpower role. As for the Hungarians living beyond the border and Hungarian foreign policy in general, the committee chairman said that more Hungarian initiatives and gestures will be necessary in the future and better care will have to be taken also that statements, which could be misunderstood, should not be uttered by members of the government in connection with the Hungarian minority beyond the border. Finally, Laszlo Kovacs also considered it harmful that, according to the decision of the present legislature, the Hungarian minorities will not have direct parliamentary representation.
