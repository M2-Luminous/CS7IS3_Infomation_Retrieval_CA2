No one was on bed by 0600. There was intense movement at mediator Alioune Blondin Beye's hotel room. First, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the government negotiating team, which included General Kopelipa, special envoy of President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Gen. Kopelipa arrived here in Lusaka last evening. Then, Alioune Blondin Beye received the leadership of the negotiating team of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. No one knows what was discussed during these meetings. Then the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA went to the conference hall to discuss alone the document on swearing in UNITA members of parliament. The government presented UNITA a new document containing all guarantees. UNITA says it wants to study the document. All that is known is that the parties are near to reaching an agreement. Meanwhile, yesterday, UNITA made an official statement saying that it accepts the government offer on its participation in different levels of government. The government agrees that it received UNITA's document, but the only thing is that it was astonished when it opened the envelope. UNITA says it accepts but it has changed all the government's proposals at the level of district governments. It wants to legally possess the districts it occupied illegally. It wants Soyo and Canfunfo. The government says there is time for jokes. Its offer is not negotiable. Either UNITA should say yes to the government offer without amendments or it says no.
