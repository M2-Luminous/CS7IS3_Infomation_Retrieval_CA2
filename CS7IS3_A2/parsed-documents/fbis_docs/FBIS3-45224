Foreign investments in China also had long-term, large-scale, high-tech, and other new characteristics and indicated a new trend. According to statistics, the number of foreign investment projects in China total approximately 100,000, involving agreed-upon capital of $110 billion and actual investment of $33 billion. Of this, direct investment exceeded $20 billion, an increase of more than 100 percent over the previous year. Guangdong, which drew the largest amount of foreign investment, actually absorbed $8.5 billion in 1993, accounting for one-fourth of the country's total. Shanghai, which ranks second, absorbed $7.016 billion. Beijing, which ranks third, absorbed $6.28 billion. Foreign investment absorbed by other cities also rose by a wide margin: Shenzhen (over $5 billion), Fujian ($2.8 billion), Jiangsu ($2.2 billion), Shandong ($1.6 billion), Guangxi ($1.06 billion), and Hainan ($730 million). Even the five northwest provinces and autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu had foreign investment exceeding $5 billion. Hong Kong, which ranked first among foreign countries and regions investing in mainland China, invested HK$100 billion [Hong Kong dollars] (approximately $13 billion). For example, Hopewell, Cheung Kong, Wharf, New World, and other consortia invested billions of Hong Kong dollars in mainland China last year. In the past, most Hong Kong businessmen focused their investment in Guangdong, running small and medium size processing enterprises and real estate businesses. The scale of their investment was small, and they sought quick returns. Last year they joined long-term projects, including power plants, highway and urban construction, and development of large pieces of land in various provinces. The typical ones include: The commercial and residential housing development of Beijing Chongwen district invested by the New World Development Company Limited; the wharves, stores, and residential projects in Wuhan invested by the Wharf (Holdings) Limited; the transformation of the "Sanpofang" old district of Fuzhou invested by the Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited; the thermal power plants and Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Zhuhai expressway invested by Hopewell Holdings Limited; and the retail businesses and department stores developed by the Wing On Company International Limited in cooperation with the Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Taiwan, which ranked second, invested over $6 billion in China, exceeding the sum of the previous years. Taiwan investment in the past was focused on light industry which could bring quick returns. Last year, Taiwan businessmen focused their investment in long-term industries. For example, the Taiwan Petroleum Shareholding Company and the Mainland Offshore Oil Corporation jointly invested in exploiting oil in the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Plastic Holdings agreed to participate in projects along the Chang Jiang. U.S., Japanese, and German businessmen also poured in large amount of funds in China last year. The Esso Petroleum Company [Exxon] of the United States and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation signed a contract on exploiting oil in the Tarim basin. It is estimated that the total investment will reach billions of dollars. Meanwhile, General Motors, Exxon, AT&T, Boeing, and Anli [1344 0448] also respectively signed contracts with China on a number of projects. Germany's Seimens, Mercedes Benz, and Bayer Chemicals and British, French, Italian, and Dutch transnational companies including Texco, Suffron, and Shell also signed contracts with China on exploiting and developing oil in 640,000 square km in the East China Sea. In some of the large scale projects, there was competition among the Western consortia.
