Despite the endless attacks launched against him, Dr. Zhelev does not seem afraid and is not behaving accordingly. He by no means appears helpless either. He hardly relies solely on his popularity which, as reflected by the results of all public opinion polls on political figures, seems to be the most stable. In an interview with the Bulgarian National Radio Network yesterday, Dr. Zhelev declared that if anyone should try to jeopardize the successes achieved in settling Bulgaria's foreign debt or boycott the restored confidence of the international financial circles in our country, he would be forced to publicly declare such acts as high treason against the nation. Naturally, his statement should not be interpreted as digging up the tomahawk against his opponents. Dr. Zhelev has long since and repeatedly proposed the option of a political and parliamentary consensus as the only possible method of coping with the difficulties of the transition period and of successfully proceeding with the reform. Both parliament and the relevant political forces rejected his offer. Hence, one should not be surprised if the attacks against the Presidency should ricochet in the form of a boomerang. It was hardly false modesty that prompted Dr. Zhelev to admit that he considers himself a president for the transition period and to add that he would not run for a new term of office. Nevertheless, he will see to it that the tasks, for the sake of which he was elected by direct vote, should not remain unfinished and he will take advantage of his remaining three years of office for this purpose. This is so because he does not feel isolated from the people. Hence, Zhelev being convinced of public support for his cause, we should not be surprised if he should seek confirmation for this support through a public referendum in an attempt to find out how much the constantly quoted "people" appreciate him. In case of his defeat in such a referendum, he should blame his advisers and the sociologists.
