Rybkin was speaking Friday at a plenary sitting the Duma held to discuss President Yeltsin's address to parliament. In Rybkin's view, Yeltsin had summed up the results of two years of destruction, rash moves and sacrifice and by his words proved he had come to realize it was about time for Russia to stop seeking foreign advice and live, instead, in conformity with its national characteristics, relying on its own forces. Ivan Rybkin suggested that the lawmakers uphold Yeltsin's call for increased political responsibility for civic peace in Russia and that they sign an appropriate formal declaration to confirm this at the upcoming All-Russian Congress of Political Parties and Movements. To make the Duma's legislative moves more effective, Ivan Rybkin suggested changes in the legislative procedures. He said a number of parliamentary factions, including the Liberal Democrats, felt each and all of the Duma's committees must be turned into a kind of micro-parliament whose job it would be to discuss and coordinate, with the factions, all amendments to existing legislation. The Duma would then meet in plenary sittings only to vote but not to discuss new bills. In the speaker's view, what the factions were calling for, would, in fact, speed up the lawmaking process. And, Rybkin felt, work on concrete bills would divert the lawmakers' attention from purely political matters.
