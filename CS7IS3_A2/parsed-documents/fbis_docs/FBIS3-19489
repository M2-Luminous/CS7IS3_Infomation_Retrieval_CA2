The scheme with a budget of 307 mio [million] German marks (about 156 mECU) up to 1996 supports basic industrial research. The objective of JESSI consists in creating a know-how and research network throughout Europe, in which scientists, producer of components and systems user work together in order to ensure an European independent position regarding the basic technology of microsystems. Beneficiaries are enterprises and scientific institutions. The notified intensity of 50 percent gross for basic industrial research projects, 60 percent gross for this type of research in the former GDR, 60 percent gross for SMEs [small- and medium-size enterprises] and 65 percent gross for SMEs conducting such research in the former GDR is in accordance with the Community framework for state aids for R and D and previous decisions by the Commission. The aids for R and D given under the programme "EUREKA-Programm JESSI" can be considered to be compatible with the common market since they promote the execution of an important project of common European interest. They may therefore profit from the exemption provided for in Articles 92(3)(b) of the EC-Treaty and 61(3)(b) of the EEA-Treaty.
