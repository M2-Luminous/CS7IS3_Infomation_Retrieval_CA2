According to the U.S.-Russian Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, a center for testing and use of space equipment is to be set up on the basis of the strategic missile division near Svobodny-18, Amur region. In the division's silos, most of which have been dismantled, there were 60 NATO class SS-11 missiles. Experts believe that the first launch from the site will quite possibly take place in 1996 as projected. Nevertheless, the only work currently in progress in Svobodny-18 is aimed at maintaining the city's infrastructure and the remaining silos. Looking for ways to launch the Rokot carrier rocket from both a silo and a pad is also going on. According to the officer, Rokot may be used both for military and research purposes. The modification of the launch pad for Rokot had virtually not been started, he added. "If the order were given, it would take no longer than six months to accomplish the task," he said. The three-stage light carrier rocket Rokot was designed by the Salyut bureau on the basis of a combat missile RS-18, due to be dismantled under the START-2 treaty. Rokot is capable of taking space equipment weighing up to two tonnes to a near earth round- circle orbit with an apogee of about 1,000 kilometers and that weighing less than 300 kilograms to an elliptic orbit with an apogee of up to 40,000 kilometers above the surface. Rokot has a launch weight of 106.7 tones and is 24.6 meters long, with a maximum diameter of 2.5 meters. The Khrunichev State Space Research and Industrial Center is now developing booster stages for Rokot.
