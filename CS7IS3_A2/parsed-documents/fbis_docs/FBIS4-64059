"We must shake off the burden of totalitarianism, but do away with the destructive moods in the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSC]," he told the FCS's national conference on Thursday. To quote Yeltsin, Russia must play a worthy role in the world community and efficiently protect its independence, territorial integrity and historical traditions. He also said that new approaches must be laid to the system of Russian security. "We must have a systematic and exhaustive information about the situation in Russia and around it," he said. Yeltsin expects the Federal Counterintelligence Service to provide clear-cut estimates and ideas on ways of neutralizing and eliminating threats to Russia's security. He also said that the FCS must give forecasts and proposals on possible political decisions. The FCS has a sufficient potential for analysis and operational forecasts, said Yeltsin.
