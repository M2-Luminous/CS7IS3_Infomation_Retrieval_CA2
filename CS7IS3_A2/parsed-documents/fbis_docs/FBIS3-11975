The Sarapiqui River flows into the San Juan River, and according to treaty stipulations Costa Rica has the right of free commercial navigation. Niehaus said the government has contacted Nicaraguan authorities at that location but has yet to receive a satisfactory answer. The minister sent a note to Nicaraguan Ambassador Alfonso Robelo stating, according to information available to the government, a toll is being collected. Niehaus has said he instructed "all Costa Rican authorities at the border area to try before Nicaraguan authorities to solve this problem while ensuring full respect for Article 6 of the Canas Jerez Treaty." The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry has stated the constant problems stemming from the use of the San Juan River were discussed by the bilateral technical group of a cooperation agreement signed by the two governments during a meeting in San Jose on 14 January. The ministry has added no satisfactory answer has been received, although misunderstandings had apparently been cleared. Niehaus contacted his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal, this week to voice his concern over this problem, but Leal told him Nicaragua is charging no toll along the waters of the San Juan River, which are shared between both countries. Relations with Nicaragua have been tense this week; in fact, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has denounced the fact Costa Rica's Agrarian Development Institute (IDA) is distributing land to peasants in Nicaraguan territory.
