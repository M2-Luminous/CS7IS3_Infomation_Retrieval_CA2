The Indian leaders insisted that they believe in Venezuelan justice and that they have confidence in the actions carried out by the Executive Branch to fulfill their needs. The Indian leaders reasserted their requests to President Rafael Caldera: Pay 10 million bolivares in compensation for every Yucpa who has been assassinated and the granting of 6,000 hectares in the Perija mountain range for their status as first inhabitants in the zone. [Begin recording] [First unidentified Indian] We have always had problems, because some of our fellow Indians have no identification papers; they are always being harassed for this. They know we are pure, indigenous, native Indians, yet we have always been mistreated. [Second unidentified Indian] We must protest, because they will annihilate us if we do nothing. We are human beings and Venezuelans like all of you -- in fact, we are more Venezuelan than you. I always said you are like retread Venezuelans, no? [Indian leader chuckles, followed by laughter heard in background] Therefore, we have always been mistreated by the cattlemen and landowners, who have taken away all our land and used it to raise cattle -- and we have no land on which to raise our crops. [Third unidentified Indian] For the first time in history, and I state this as a Yucpa Indian, we have been received with so much amity and with a positive attitude. Therefore, I state that I believe in the president of the Republic and all his cabinet because I believe.... [pauses] no, I know that he has appointed the most appropriate persons to hold those posts. Therefore, positive things will occur for us from now on. [end recording] Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar de Castro later met with the president of the Republic and explained her experience in this case. The Zulia State leader said she advocates giving land to the Yucpa Indians and providing them with technical assistance for their crops. In her opinion, the problem can be solved this way. [Begin de Castro recording] I understand this solution can be reached more or less quickly, and there is no reason why further aggressions should occur in the zone. I believe we can do this without major problems so we can give the Indians what they rightfully demand and what they have been deprived of for many years. [end recording]
