More than 14,000 election monitors will be employed by the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] on the election days to report any misconduct or breaches of the code. They have the power to intervene in disputes and to mediate between disputing parties. Monitors fall under the monitoring directorate, which has wide powers to investigate alleged electoral offences. On the election days at least one monitor will be stationed at each voting station throughout the country. They will try to resolve complaints directly or to intervene in disputes to defuse conflict. While monitors are paid employees of the IEC and have legal powers of intervention, observers are volunteers who can only report findings. The role of the observers, particularly domestic observers, is fundamental to the election in order to allow civil society to observe and report upon the electoral process. There is a commitment from the side of the IEC to working closely with all observer organisations -- domestic and foreign -- in order to ensure that they are able to fulfil this crucial role in the election. There will be three kinds of observers: --domestic observers provided by local NGOs [nongovernmental organizations]. To date 26 domestic observer organisations, which include the primary umbrella body of domestic observers, --and the National Electoral Observer Network (NEON) have been registered by the IEC. A full list will be provided to the IEC by domestic observer bodies on 22 April 1994. --foreign observers from international non-governmental organisations. 77 foreign observer organisations have been accredited by the Monitoring Directorate of the IEC. Observers provided by inter-governmental organisations such as the United Nations, the Organisation for African Unity, the European Union and the Commonwealth. These observers are not registered by the IEC, but by the United Nations Observer Mission (UNOMSA). The observer organisations will be responsible for accommodation, welfare and transport, but will be supplied with observer identification and insignia by the IEC.
