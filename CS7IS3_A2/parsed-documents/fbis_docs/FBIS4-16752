Do its political leaders want the same?". Chairman of the Agrarian Union of the Novgorod Region Vladimir Yezhov is quoted as saying that "Mother-Russia and its people are sick and tired of the squabbles in the capital. Unfortunately their destructive waves reach far and wide, even in Novgorod Region. The prevailing instability hampers effective land reforms. If we succeed in forgetting hurt feelings and rally to reach a great and brilliant goal, we shall be able to restore Russia's might and greatness. The fate of the country is in the fate of its countryside". The same newspaper carries an interview with Yegor Gaydar in his capacity as the leader of the all-Russia association of privatized and private enterprises, set up a year ago. "Today the point is: Russia will have her chances of economic revival only if it develops private businesses. As soon as private enterprises begin to invest in the development of production, a realist hope will arise for the overcoming of the crisis", Gaydar said. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA interviewed the Democratic Party of Russia's economic committee chairman Vladimir Leitland, who said that "Russia will long remember Yegor Gaydar as the former government leader, because under him "only 57 percent of the country's 1990 economic potential remained intact". Leitland calls for revising priorities for the transitional period and leaving the key industries under direct state control for its duration". The newspaper highlights reports about the two-month festival devoted to the protection of the populace against ecological hazards. The festival began on April 15. One report calls Moscow one of the fifty ecologically "worst" cities, leading the country in the amount of harmful effluents in the atmosphere and liquid waste in its rivers and lakes. The newspaper publishes an appeal to the citizens of Russia from the organizing committee of the two-month action to join the ranks of fighters against ecological hazards. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA splashes the title "Russia has little time left to avert a nuclear disaster" above an article about preparations for an expedition to the Komsomolets nuclear submarine, which sank in the sea of Norway five years ago. The article warns about the possible "ejection of the nuclear load" from the ill-fated submarine. According to the newspaper, it is most important at present to launch and complete an operation to "conserve" the sunk submarine before it is too late. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, who said that the Russian state, even when it acted violently with regard to its citizens, was somehow associated in their minds with an image of "a severe and even unfair father who nonetheless was looking after his children in one way or another". Abdulatipov calls for the restoration and strengthening of the power of the state "in its new functions and new authority". "The state is as strong as its ability to protect the individual", he said. The press pays much attention to PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Moscow. He is quoted as saying that the Palestinian state favours the convocation of a second Madrid conference on the Middle East settlement, and "hopes to see Russia participate in the peace-keeping forces" deployed on the occupied territories. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA believes that 'Arafat's "meetings in Moscow are particularly useful" on the eve of Israeli Premier Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Russia. TRUD (Labour) leads with reports about spring fieldwork, which is particularly difficult this year because thousands upon thousands of hectares of land have been inundated by spring floods, and Russian farmers often find themselves lacking the essentials for coping with the task. More than 80 percent of all farmers no longer "hope for government assistance", the newspaper says. "One third of them lack fuel, seeds and equipment. Few have secured loans ahead of sowing, and those who have are awed by the crushing 200-percent interests on the loans". Specialists predict that grain production is likely to dwindle to 80 million tonnes this year, 24 million tonnes less than the 1986-1990 average. PRAVDA carries and interview with deputy head of the institute of informatics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Shota Chipashvili, who speaks about the great role played by the late academic Vladimir Semenikhin in designing and developing the country's single automated system of control over its armed forces. "Classified information that was uncovered recently makes it clear that Semenikhin ranks with such great figures in Russian Science as (nuclear researcher) Igor Kurchatov and (chief designer of space vehicles) Sergey Korolyov.
