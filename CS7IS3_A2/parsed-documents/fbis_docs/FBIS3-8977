The national minority policy of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is determined by the key words of equality in chances, positive discrimination, collective rights, and autonomy, Attila Zalan Csenger, head of the KDNP Department of International Relations, said in a lecture at the Hungarian Foreign Affairs Society on 16 March. According to the program, in formulating its foreign policy guidelines, the KDNP aimed at supporting a lasting and just peace in Europe as a long-term goal, a peace based on the infallibility of man's dignity acquired through creation, human rights, and the right of all nations to self determination. Respect for man's basic rights is one of the starting points of Christian democracy, and this is the common basis of mankind's coexistence. The autonomy of nations is one condition for this and also the need to respect the personal conviction of other communities and the members of their own community. Therefore, no country is allowed to violate the human and freedom rights by referring to sovereignty. The KDNP regards these principles as particularly important to "middle" Europe because this region will remain one of the biggest sources of danger until the end of this century and, at the same time, we must take into consideration the fact that the interest of Western Europe toward us will decrease proportionally with the instability of our region. The security policy of the KDNP aims at avoiding wars and military conflicts and preserving peace. Therefore, we must try to fully make use of the possibilities given by the Partnership for Peace and the European Stability Agreement. Of course, the final goal of the Hungarian foreign policy continues to be the obtaining of full NATO membership. According to the KDNP, Hungary does not have an outstanding border issue in the traditional sense of the word because our borders are determined by international agreements, but we still have to to a lot together with our neighbors to make our borders more open. The KDNP considers the stipulations included in the Helsinki Final Document as relevant to our borders. The Christian democrats are of the opinion that based on our common interests and values, we must become full members of the European Union, as the political, economic, and security corner stone of the new Europe. For this, we must give content to our association agreement and Hungary should submit its request for full membership as soon as possible. Regarding the national minorities, the political and social organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders have been created and have become stronger in the past two years. In connection with these minorities, Hungarian foreign policy should strive to support their principled and political goals with its moral weight.
