Synthesizes Polyester Using Lipase Catalyst 93FE0762C Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 4 Jun 93 p 7 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 93FE0762C Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] A group led by professor Shiro Kobayashi and his assistant Hiroshi Uyama, Department of Molecular and Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Tohoku University, has successfully synthesized polyester with lipase as a catalyst for the first time ever. This is a new polymerization reaction involving the opening of a &egr;-caprolactone ring, and the reaction product has an alcohol on one terminus and a carboxylic acid on the other. Its maximum molecular weight is 7700. The group will attempt to make this into an optically active polymer in the future by using group substitution. This polymerization method, which forms polyester under gentle conditions and uses simple substances abundant in nature as starting materials, is noteworthy because it is such an environmentally friendly process. This achievement by Professor Kobayashi's group at Tohoku University is a result of their research on a series of enzyme-catalyzed polymerizations. More specifically, they discovered that a polymerization reaction involving &egr;-caprolactone occurs when the hydrolytic enzyme lipase is used. In their experiments they carried out bulk polymerization of &egr;-caprolactone using commercially available lipase P derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens and lipase B derived from Candida cylindracea [Candida rugosa] as a catalyst without further purification. The amount of lipase added was 50 mg per 1 millimole of monomer. Polymerization results are shown in the accompanying table. When the temperature was 30°C, the conversion rate of the monomer was only about 8% even when polymerization was carried out for ten days, and the molecular weight was only about 1100. When the polymerization temperature was raised to 45°C, 60°C, and 75°C, both the monomer conversion rate and the molecular weight increased, and molecular weight increased with longer polymerization times. The group also learned that the molecular weight is reduced if carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc., are added.

It was also found that lipase P yields a higher molecular weight product than lipase B. The structure of the compound was analyzed by proton and <sup> 13</sup> C nuclear magnetic resonance. It was found that the main chain of the polymer has polyester linkages, and it has an alcohol group on one terminus and a carboxylic acid group on the other. Based on the study of other lactone, cyclic anhydride, and diol polymerizations, it appears that this reaction mechanism is a new type of polymerization accompanied by an opening of the ring. The group plans a more detailed study of the mechanism in the future. In any event, the group has confirmed for the first time that polyester can be synthesized under the mild conditions of 60°-70°C at normal atmospheric pressure from simple compounds, including the necessary starting ingredients. Amid increasing concern over environmental problems, biodegradable polymers have attracted a lot of attention. However, this kind of polymerization, which does not use reagents that require special disposal after the reaction, is noteworthy from the standpoint of energy efficiency as well. It appears to have a promising future.
