In a report to the standing committee for safety and security at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] near Soweto, Duarte said the creation of peace and the rebuilding of communities on the East Rand were high on her list of priorities. Other priorities included the establishment of community policing forums, car theft, rape, allegations of police torture, and gun control legislation. Duarte said the improvement of working conditions for policemen and the upgrading of police stations were also "absolute necessities". "Job satisfaction is certainly not the motivating factor for entering the SAPS [South African Police Service]. Rather, job necessity seems to be the factor motivating people." She added that solving the problem of disillusionment, without looking at a programme of affirmative action for black police personnel in particular, was not possible. Duarte said efforts to stabilise the East Rand had already begun, with the creation of an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]-ANC working group to look at the opening of "no-go areas", the resumption of train services between Kwesini and Katlehong, and the security of residents returning to their homes. She explained proposals to reorientate members of self-defence and self-protection units created to protect communities and hostels. Duarte said a programme, organised by the PWV MEC [member executive council] for education, had been established to enable members of the units between the ages of 13 and 18 to attend six- month "reintegration school programmes" to prepare them for admission to ordinary schools. Members between the ages of 19 and 24 would be put through adult literacy programmes and be assisted with job creation or entrance to tertiary institutions. And older members would be assisted in joining the police force as reservists or organised into neighbourhood watch programmes. Duarte said that according to the defence force about 20,000 illegal weapons were in circulation on the East Rand and an amnesty or gun collection campaign would retrieve only about 10 percent of the weapons. One of the problems was community scepticism about the police force and the number of weapons illegally owned by criminals, said Duarte. The "unprecedented" increase in rapes and violent crime against women had prompted the urgent need for members of the police force to be trained to deal with victims, said Duarte. She also proposed the creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate police torture.
