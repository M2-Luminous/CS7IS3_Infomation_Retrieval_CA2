Hearing was adjourned to a later date. In fact, this case is a continuation of the lawsuit brought against him in 1987 for money owed to the state and another by parties claiming damages. In an interview with CAR radio today, the former CAR emperor said the money for which he is being prosecuted was used in building the 500-room Hotel Intercontinental, a white elephant situated right in the middle of Bangui's residential district. According to CAR State Attorney Jean Ngandou, following his death sentence in 1987, Bokassa was asked to pay a fine of 6 million CFA francs to the parties claiming damages while the CAR state was authorized to confiscate his property to the tune of 3,143,473,300 CFA francs. During the same interview, the former CAR emperor talked about the running of the country, which he said has been destroyed. He said it was ruined by President David Dacko, whom he held responsible for Barthelemy Boganda's death. He also accused former President Kolingba and French Colonel Jean-Claude Masson of assassinating Boganda's son, Bertrand Salate. Bokassa thereby confirms these allegations.
