"President Kravchuk and Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr Moroz are meeting to discuss the issue and I hope the president will address the deputies today," he said. On Wednesday, Kravchuk said that if Simferopol took a decision to bring back its constitution, he would ask the Ukrainian parliament to rescind it. Mikhalchenko said that Simferopol's decision was out of line with the Ukrainian basic law and therefore, illegal. "The decision would lead to the setting up of a confederation in Ukraine which is a unitary state," he said.
