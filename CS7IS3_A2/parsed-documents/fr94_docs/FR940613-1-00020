FR940613-1-00020 FR940613-1-00003 Many appraisals that the FDIC has reviewed contain only cursory analysis of the expected future earnings of the institution. The FDIC believes that buyers of conversion stocks need to analyze institutions with much more financial sophistication than what appears in the appraisal and, therefore, appraisals should be augmented. Earnings rarely reflect a true expected use of conversion proceeds and others are understated by investments in low-rate securities. Earnings are rarely estimated in conjunction with the converting institution's future business plan_a fact that the FDIC finds inconsistent and unacceptable. During the pendency of this rulemaking and subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC will continue to review appraisal reports to ensure that converting institutions and the conversion stock are properly valued. The FDIC will continue to object to proposed conversions supported by unacceptable appraisal reports. B. Depositor Voting Requirement and Prohibition on the Use of Running Proxies The Board believes that, in order for a board of trustees of a mutual savings bank to properly exercise its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board should obtain a vote of depositors in favor of the proposed conversion before the proposed conversion is completed. Most states, but not all, require a depositor vote for mutual-to-stock conversions. The OTS also requires both federal and state savings associations to obtain a majority vote of association members as one of the pre-conditions to converting. Some states, however, require only that the board of trustees (or similar group) approve the plan of conversion and do not require a vote of members. As discussed below, several of the comments on the Interim Rule voiced opposition to ``voting rights'' for depositors in states that do not provide such rights. In preliminary response to those comments, and subject to others that the FDIC hopes to receive on this issue, the Board thinks that it is necessary and appropriate for the FDIC to require a depositor vote on proposed conversions. Such a requirement would not necessarily contradict state laws (that do not require a depositor vote), but supplement the state law by requiring the member vote. The FDIC's concern is with the board of trustees' proper exercise of its fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the bank and its depositors. Preliminarily, the Board believes that the proper exercise of such duties requires that depositors, as stakeholders of the bank, have the opportunity to approve or disapprove the proposed conversion. This requirement is, in part, rooted in the foregoing concern that bank insiders often benefit personally from bank conversions. This almost inherent conflict of interest (between self interest and the interests of the bank) may be mitigated by the existence of a depositor vote on the proposed conversion. The proposed rule, therefore, would require a depositor vote in favor of the proposed conversion of a State Savings Bank to stock form. Unless otherwise prescribed by the applicable state law, the required vote would be a majority of the bank's depositors and other stakeholders of the bank who the bank's trustees reasonably determine are entitled to vote on the conversion. In the same vein, the Board believes that a proxy specifically designed for the proposed conversion should be used to obtain a depositor vote on the conversion. In some states the management of converting banks and savings associations, subject to certain conditions, may use so-called ``running proxies'' (proxies obtained when a depositor opened his or her account with the institution) to vote in favor of the proposed conversion. The former OTS mutual-to-stock conversion regulations also permitted the use of running proxies, under certain circumstances. Running proxies are prohibited by the OTS Revisions. The FDIC believes, preliminarily, that given the material change in structure represented by the bank's conversion to stock form, it is imperative that depositors be permitted to vote separately on the proposed conversion and that the most effective manner to assure that depositors are fully informed of the proposed conversion and have an opportunity to participate fully in the conversion would be to prohibit the use of running proxies in such transactions. This is in keeping with the FDIC's concern that the management of a State Savings Bank fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities by assuring that the depositors are in agreement with the proposed conversion. Thus, the proposed rule would prohibit the use of running proxies in the mutual-to-stock conversion process.
