The summit was held a few hours after the official funeral of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who died on 7 December. According to Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, the 14 African member states and France took stock of the situation following the decision made at the 10 and 11 January Dakar summit to change the CFA exchange rate. Kablan Duncan, who was the summit's spokesman, told newsmen that France did not make any new commitments on back up measures aimed at reducing the negative effects of the devaluation on the economies of the 14 African partners within the franc zone. Mr. Duncan further said that Paris has, however, decided to continue backing them at the Bretton Woods institutions and has urged them to speed up their economic integration. Cameroonian President Paul Biya says he is encouraged by France's confirmation that it is willing to support efforts made to get Africa out of the economic crisis. He therefore called on the IMF and the World Bank to "set up the announced back up measures as soon as possible." The Cameroonian president stated that "the risk of social explosion increases with each passing day." He denied that his country intends to withdraw from the franc zone and to create its own currency. He concluded by saying that the "franc zone is a zone for solidarity and for people to wage a better struggle as a group." The summit started at 1900 and was expected to last 30 minutes but it ended nearly two hours later. Those who attended the summit included French President Mitterrand, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, heads of state of seven West African Monetary Union countries, as well as the heads of state of six countries belonging to the Bank of Central African States.
