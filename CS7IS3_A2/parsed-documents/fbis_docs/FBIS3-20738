It was stated that more than 50 Greek enterprises have been established in Albania and that concrete interest has been demonstrated in setting up many more in various sectors, mainly as joint enterprises with Albanian companies. The Banking Sector: The Albanian side said that it considers the willingness of the Greek banks to be a dynamic presence in Albania to be a positive element and it promised that it would reduce to 90 days the deadline for examining the applications presented to it. At this time, it was mentioned that the National Bank of Greece has shown interest in this matter. Projects in the Infrastructure: The two sides agreed to cooperate on pinpointing projects in the infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector, with the aim of securing financing from Community sources and, concretely, by a PHARE [Reconstruction Aid to Poland and Hungary]/INTERREG [transnational cooperation program] coordinated initiative. Importance was given to the Ioannina-Kakaviie-Vlore-Durres highway and the railroad systems of the two countries. The Agricultural Sector: It was agreed that there should be an evaluation of possibilities for cooperation in the agricultural sector by means of technical assistance by both sides in the training and specialization of cadres and technical assistance by the Greeks in the production of products of animal and plant origin, assistance in agricultural projects, in irrigation, in the mechanization of agriculture, and in research and applications in agriculture. The Energy Sector: Cooperation should be expanded in this sector, on the one hand, with the construction of a hydroelectric power plant on the Vjose River on Albanian territory on the border between the two countries (the Greek Public Electricity Enterprise is collaborating with the Albanian Electricity Corporation on this project), and, on the other hand, with general cooperation of these two organizations in the electric power sector. Technical Assistance: The Greek side stated that, in the framework of the bilateral technical assistance program, the implementation of the following projects in Greece or in Albania might be studied during 1994: technical assistance programs in the form of seminars and laboratories, the placement of Albanian experts in such sectors as public administration, the management of public service enterprises, management in enterprises, in tourism, in the banking sector, in the health field, in agriculture, in public works, in transportation, and in environmental protection, as well as cooperation between the institutions of higher education of the two countries.
