On 13 January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa denied the report, telling reporters he is "not considering" a cabinet reshuffle. Meanwhile, an influential member of the ruling parties said an early cabinet reshuffle would be a good thing. He said: "It is a fact that a cabinet reshuffle is being discussed. This is a good time to establish a full-fledged administration." As far as the prime minister is concerned, it seems he has no choice but to be cautious in his approach to the matter because he has no wish to cause a crack in the administration's foundation. He needs to tread carefully because the reason the talk of a cabinet reshuffle is the confrontation between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. It is expected, however, that talk of a cabinet reshuffle may hang around for the time being. When asked, the prime minister avoided answering questions about the timing of a cabinet reshuffle. He said: "That is far ahead. There are many mountains and rivers that we have to cross before then." However, a senior member of the ruling parties, who is reportedly close to Mr. Ozawa, admitted that "the idea of reshuffling the cabinet has been discussed since the end of the last year." He said there were two reasons why the administration had considered the issue: 1) To get positive cooperation from the Social Democratic Party of Japan by inviting its chairman Tomiichi Murayama to join the cabinet after getting State Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana to leave office; and 2) to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. It appears Prime Minister Hosokawa would find it difficult to sack Mr. Takemura because he has been a long-time friend since well before the administration took power. Mr. Hosokawa reportedly told the senior coalition official that he "could not dismiss Mr. Takemura alone." Although the prime minister has denied the possibility of an early cabinet reshuffle, the senior official said: "It is reported that the prime minister secretly met Mr. Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa at the end of last year, and indicated he intended to carry out a cabinet reshuffle." As a result of the talk, Mr. Takemura told a press conference on 13 January: "Although I think there has been some criticism of me, I have put all my trust on the issue of whether or not I leave office to the prime minister. I would like to devote myself single- mindedly to my job, though bracing myself for what may follow." Mr. Takemura denied the possibility that Mr. Yamahana would resign as political reform minister after the passage of the political reform bills. He said: "Even after the bills are passed by the Diet, there is a task of drawing electoral districts." It is believed that Mr. Takemura's remarks indicated his displeasure, seeing any cabinet reshuffle as the work of Mr. Ozawa and others. Facing confrontation within the administration, the prime minister will likely be forced to make a difficult decision.
