After that, there is no need to punish them any further for their sins because they will punish themselves anyway. In this sense, the case of Adrian Nastase [executive chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, and speaker of the Chamber of Deputies] can be very eye-opening. Ever since the [December 1989] revolution, he has been trying to portray himself as a democratic, intelligent, impartial, and so on politician. And why should we not admit that he really has all the necessary prerequisites to become what he wants to be. He can speak eloquently, he is calm, he has a good memory, good looks... However, for some reason unknown to us, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies recently lost his memory. He has forgotten, for instance, that a month ago, he told correspondents that the party he represents would never accept the blackmail of PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], which, at that time, conditioned its cooperation [with the ruling party] on being offered a number of ministerial portfolios. Nastase's indignation seemed real and worthy of our respect. However, a few days ago, the official PDSR leader changed his views. The PUNR blackmail does not concern him in the least; on the contrary, he ceremoniously announced that the PDSR and PUNR have established an alliance intending to govern the country. The portfolios, which a month ago he considered to be the motive of the blackmail, are included, of course -- at least, this is what we think. The whole thing reminds us of a great Romanian lawyer who manages to prove that the defendant is a scoundrel who should be sent to jail, after which, within a few minutes, he also manages to demonstrate that he is as innocent as an angel... In today's Romania, this is how the official leader of the ruling party turns black into white and white into black, turning the whims of a spoiled child determined to ruin the toy he has just received as a present into a political act. The toy is nothing but Romania's Government, the leadership of which is also coveted by the man who rings the bell in the hall of the Chamber of Deputies... [passage omitted]
