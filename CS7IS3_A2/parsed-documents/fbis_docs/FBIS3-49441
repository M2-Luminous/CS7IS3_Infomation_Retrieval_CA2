Reporting on the situation in Sarajevo this morning, the studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been sounded in the city. Just after 0900 the [Serb] enemy artillery shelled the city center. As we have learned from the state hospital, two lightly and two seriously wounded citizens have so far been brought in, while, according to incomplete information, a number of wounded have been brought into the Kosevo hospital. We again warn the citizens of the capital to observe all the self-protection measures envisaged by the general alarm." The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps describes the situation in central Bosnia yesterday, adding that "the fighting increased the number of killed members of the Vitez HVO so far which, according to the official information issued yesterday by the HVO operative area of central Bosnia, amounts to 1,504 killed fighters over the last six months." In his report from Zavidovici, Viktor Boban says that yesterday was a "relatively quiet day, with sporadic fire from both aggressors [the Serbs and HVO]. A convoy of the aggressor's vehicles was spotted moving last night from the direction of (Globanica) to the fronts on the left bank of the Bosna River. This morning the enemy is occasionally firing with small arms in the Smajlbasici and (Brasljevine) areas." Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night the [Serb] enemy fired with antiaircraft guns and machine guns along the entire front line. Earlier in the evening the aggressor shelled (Poderice) with 82-mm mortars, and some 10 82-mm mortars were also fired at Jagodnjak. The Lipovac defense lines were pounded all night with 120-mm mortars. The aggressor also reinforced his lines with men and equipment on this front last night."
