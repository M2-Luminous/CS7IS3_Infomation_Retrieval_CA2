He said they were greatly respected by the Somali people. However, the president said it was unfortunate that while it was agreed that no further fighting should take place in Somalia and that a conference should be held on 15 April to pave the way for the establishment of a national government on 15 May, the Somali National Alliance [SNA] had launched attacks in different parts of Somalia by massacring people and destroying much property in Marka, Baraawe, and Jilib districts, and also in Hiiraan and Galguduud regions. The president said this was opposed to the wishes of our suffering people and the agreements signed in Cairo and Nairobi. [passage omitted] Long debates and analyses were held for five and a half hours and an announcement for the Somali people was issued concerning the general situation in the country in the political, security, and social fields, as well as the implementation of the peace agreements reached, especially the Nairobi Manifesto of 24 March 1994. It became clear that the SNA had carried out disorder in Mogadishu, Galguduud, and Hiiraan; destabilization and occupation of settlements such as Marka, Jilib, Baraawe, and others. They are planning to create endless chaos with the intention of scuttling the 15 April conference to prepare for the great Somali conference of 15 May. This violates the Addis Ababa Accord and Nairobi Manifesto. These obstacles are proof of Aidid's policy of using brute force and bullets and his lack of confidence in democracy which is the basis of the Somali people's aspirations in the struggle. The 12 political organizations working for the good of the country are aware that they represent 98 percent of the Somali people and are constantly striving for peace and for resolving the problem. They are also aware of the consequences which may follow the habitual provocations and expansionism of the Somali SNA clique. Given that it is the duty of the 12 organizations to defend the wishes and work for peace and regaining national dignity they are aware of the problems all over the country perpetrated by SNA [words indistinct] to carry out its international (?agreements) in the administrative, security and political fields. The 12 organizations, in respecting the Nairobi Manifesto of 24 March, are ready to participate in the 15 April conference to be held in Mogadishu and attended by the signatories of the Addis Ababa agreement. They are completely opposed to any delay. The 12 political organizations urge the Somali people to stick by their desire for peace and for settling their affairs, and also to write and jointly confront the disruptive acts carried out by the SNA. The 12 organizations call upon the SNA to stop the war and withdraw from the areas they have forcefully and aggressively occupied.
