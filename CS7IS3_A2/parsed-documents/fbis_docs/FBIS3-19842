[passage omitted] The Geography Department of the University of Oulu has refined its [demographic] grid system and is now capable of, for example, showing how Finland has been depopulated over the past 20 years. 18,000 in One Square Km in Kallio "Rural areas were deserted at a frantic pace in the 1970's when the migration from country to town was at its peak. In the 1980's this migration slowed down. At the same time, on the other hand, people were moving from the central areas of the big cities to communities near rural areas," Professor Arvo Naukkarinen pointed out. [passage omitted] As concerns rural Finland, no more than 12 people per square kilometer live in the occupied squares of the grid. "A fifth of the inhabited area of the countryside is threatened with depopulation since no one under age 15 lives there any more," Assistant Professor Jarmo Rusanen fears. People often think that only development areas, in eastern and northern Finland, become depopulated. Researchers point out that rural areas have been vacated throughout all of central Finland. Yla-Savo and the lake country of Finland, especially Mikkeli Province, have lost a lot of people. Accurate information has surprisingly revealed that rapidly depleting rural areas are also found in southern Finland, in the Loimaa district, and in eastern Uusimaa. Privacy Protected When one pokes at a base map with a sharpened pencil point and with one's eyes closed, one obtains accurate information. If there are only a few inhabitants in a grid square, the information on them is not given to outsiders. "People's privacy is carefully protected," Asst. Prof. Jarmo Rusanen emphasized. Cows or Nothing, Wheat or Nothing "The reason for the decrease in population in Loimaa and Yla-Savo may be the fact that both areas gambled on a single strength. Loimaa is Finland's grain center, while Yla-Savo is Finland's milk center. The specialized farms are mechanized -- that eliminated jobs," director Reijo Keranen of the Yla-Savo Institute surmised. Nearly one out of every three jobs is in agriculture, that is, according to Naukkarinen, the situation is the same as it was in the 1960's throughout the country. "The usual structural change has not occurred. Sidelines like farm tourism, berry cultivation, or farm equipment contracts have not been produced at the same rate as elsewhere." Neither area has been able to industrialize or develop services either. "Young people's alternatives have been cows or nothing in Yla-Savo and wheat or nothing in the Loimaa district." One Can See Far Off in Finland's Grain Center, Like a Prairie Loimaa -- The heart of Finland's grain region, the Loimaa district, is like a prairie. Level expanses of fields stretch out in clear weather almost as far as the eye can see. "From a suitable vantage point, you can see for 7 km," farmer Jorma Maki-Punto, 57, of the town of Loimaa said. He is the 10th owner of his family's farm located on the banks of the Loimi River. Maki-Punto specializes in seed grain. He intends to plant 60 hectares with it next spring. For additional income, he has two summer cottages "that keep me pretty busy." The loose, porous fields of the clayey region customarily produce wheat, barley, and rye. Over the past few years compulsorily fallowed fields, which the eyes of the farmers at least are not used to, have increased. To them fallowing seems disagreeable and untidy. The houses of the district are on average in prosperous circumstances, in the middle of and framed by the yard, erect, and well tended. People live in them too. The eye rarely falls on an iced-up window. So far, the changes appear to be only a worsening of public services. Village stores, post offices, and banks are closed. The distances children have to be transported to get to schools have become longer. The farm sector is waiting. Farms are neither being bought nor sold. The price of an arable hectare has dropped to a third of the 60,000 markkas it was a few years back. Farmers are not investing in new equipment or buildings. "We farmers have our hackles up. We won't join the EU [European Union] under these terms but, luckily for us, we have our own advisers who know how we think."
