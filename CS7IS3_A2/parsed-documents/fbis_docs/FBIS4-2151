The reform of state ownership with private management is a product of when small state-run commercial enterprises change from the planned economic system to the market economic system and is an innovative choice for small enterprises to get themselves out of a difficult position. Second, strengthen guidance for the reform of state ownership with private management so as to standardize it. Judging from practical results, we should lead, to the best of our ability, staff and workers to choose the management form of leasing, particularly individual leasing and partnership leasing. Compared with the contract responsibility system for profits, the leasing system conforms more to the requirements of the socialist market economy and the rights and obligations of the two parties to the lease are more clearly defined. Third, thoroughly promote the method of inviting bids and choosing leaseholders and enterprise managers. Fourth, guarantee the independent decisionmaking rights of the leasing enterprise and the contracting enterprise. Fifth, improve the statistical methods of state-owned privately run enterprises. Change the statistical system in which enterprises report their management situations to higher authorities to a method in which enterprises report their management situations to taxation organs. Taxation authorities together with individual associations make appraisals of the same trade or industry and match them with verification by taxation organs to confirm the reported figures, and enterprises' management situations are summed up and reflected on by the taxation authorities. Sixth, party committees and governments at all levels should create a fine macropolicy environment for the reform of public ownership with private management.
