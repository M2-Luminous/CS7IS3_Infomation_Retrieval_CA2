In the 1993-1998 period, the gross domestic product will increase by an average 2.3 percent per year, the same rate as in the mid-eighties and thereafter, the Wifo noted. Thus, the Austrian economy would grow faster than the German (average 1.9 percent) and about as fast as that of the European members of the OECD (2.2 percent). On the labor market the forced increase in labor productivity compared to previous years will hold down employment growth to 0.6 percent per year. Since the work force is expected to grow by some 0.7 percent, the Wifo expects an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.4 percent in the next few years from the current 5.8 percent. In the Wifo's view, restructuring and streamlining by business will be successful. The increase in exports will initially only be moderate as a result of the weak German economy and speed up only in the course of the years. Exports should benefit from the quick growth in East Europe. The Wifo expects an average export growth of 5.75 percent in the 1993-98 period compared to 3.5 percent for 1988-93. Foreign exchange revenues in real terms from the tourist trade will barely grow half as quickly as in the past five years. The Wifo does not anticipate any inflationary impulses for the period up to 1998. The inflation rate is expected to decrease to 2.5 percent until 1995, while after that it could slightly increase to 3 percent. The increase in real pay of wage or salary earners is expected to remain an average 0.5 percent below the increase in productivity. According to the Wifo, equipment investment will not increase significantly until the end of 1995. All in all, gross fixed investments will increase by 3.5 percent in the 1993-98 period, and thus as fast as in the five preceding years.
