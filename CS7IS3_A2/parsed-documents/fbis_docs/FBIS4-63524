The statement from the Center group contains, in particular, proposals to support Vasyl Durdynet's candidacy for the post of first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council and to "halt the diktat of the left-wing forces" having agreed the candidacies of deputy chairmen of the parliament and heads of committees. A discussion emerged with regard to the name "committee" instead of "commission" as it was in the previous parliament and also with regard to leaders of groups and chairmen of committees becoming members of the presidium of the Supreme Council. In the view of Oleksandr Moroz the presence of 18-20 leaders of groups and the same number of chairman of committees could cause the presidium to become rudderless. Vyacheslav Chornovil, while expressing disagreement with the speaker's point of view gave assurances that since in the event of an emergence of disputed issues conciliatory commissions will nevertheless have to be formed each time, their role could be played namely by members of the presidium. Deputies were given an anonymous draft constitution of Ukraine in accordance with which it was proposed to give the president only representative functions and the Cabinet of Ministers should be led by a prime minister. In the words of Oleksandr Moroz, this draft had been agreed by Leonid Kravchuk. "We are talking not about a constitutional conspiracy, as People's Deputy Bohdan Boyko considers, but about introducing elementary order into the executive structures," assured Oleksandr Moroz. Commenting on this provision of the draft constitution, acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy told a UNIAN correspondent that in a "state with a population of 52 million, a powerful industry, a military industrial complex and an agricultural economy the government should be subordinate to the president." After this, parliamentary speaker Oleksandr Moroz proposed that all groups gather in order to agree the issues that were mentioned at the beginning of this item (minus guests and representatives of the media).
