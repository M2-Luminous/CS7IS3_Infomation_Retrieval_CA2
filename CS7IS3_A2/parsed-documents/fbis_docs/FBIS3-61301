This document was not just "functional" in that period alone. Time has shown that it has provided, simultaneously, the foundation of the new Republic constitution and opened the way to sociopolitical and socioeconomic [development] for Kazakhstan. On the third anniversary of the ratification of this declaration, reporters of YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA asked Republic of Kazakhstan Vice-President Yerik Asanbayev about the process by which this document was prepared and the role played by this declaration in Kazakhstan's achieving its independence. [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, you can speak from direct personal experience about this historic document. You took the lead in creating the declaration as the then chairman of the Republic Supreme Soviet and you reported at the session on its fundamental provisions. For that reason, we think that no one knows better than you how this document was prepared and how it was ratified. [Asanbayev] First of all, you must bear in mind the situation in the country at the time when work on the declaration was begun. The process leading to the path of sovereignty for the republics had just begun. The way had been opened for the establishment of direct, horizontal relationships by-passing the central authority. The first signs were appearing of wasting away of the Union state. This situation, as is well known now, had come about because of problems in shaping the Union budget, and due to inability to resolve international and internal Soviet conflicts. It is understandable that national movements aimed at self-government began to gain ground. However, the ruling structures of the Soviet Union had in their hands sufficient force; and they had used means to manage the nation, especially its economic system, with administrative-dictatorial methods. Powerful quick-reaction forces, above all the military and industrial complex, remained standing. How could the road to independence be without cost? The central authority continued to depend upon Kazakhstan as a raw materials base. It was not possible to change that in an instant. We were repeatedly accused openly by name of striving to overthrow the Union. There were also direct intimidations. I remember how Lukyanov called and demanded that I carry out the decisions of the central authority without deviation. He reminded me that if I did not the situation could become difficult. However, as Lord Salisbury said, "The most common error in politics is to adhere to an outdated policy." It was not possible to halt our striving for sovereignty. In the Soviet state, the real legal basis for reforming the country had been destroyed. We were near to completing work on a new Union treaty. In the end, the USSR showed its impotency. If now we forget for a minute the conditions under which the declaration came into being, and if we now try to evaluate it, we note that it had, in fact, some incomplete features. But it is well known that one cannot look at an historical document with the eyes of today. We set about preparing our Declaration of Sovereignty after similar documents had been ratified by several union republics. They began with a declaration of "sovereignty" with respect to the central authority and followed up with the undertaking of a few cautious acts leading up to specific political action. For that reason, believe what I say, working with such documents and enriching them with specific historical circumstances and with the content expected by the people was not such an easy thing. To a certain degree these were uncertain, resolute steps of heroism by the Republic president and parliament. The draft of the declaration was prepared by a working group comprised of the senior council of the Supreme Soviet drawn from the ranks of people's deputies, representatives of the executive organs, various sector specialists, including many scientist-economists, and legal specialists. I am not overstating it. They did a great deal of work. Hundreds of suggestions of various kinds coming in from the citizens of the Republic were reviewed. Drafts and suggestions of the government and of some social units were discussed. Tens of drafts were made of the declaration. The [final] draft was reviewed twice by the senior council and in an expanded session of the presidential council. Subsequently it was offered to the public for general discussion. Only after that did it reach the hands of the deputies. The ratification of the declaration in a session of parliament had a democratic quality. After heated discusses and many hours of arguments on the draft, the Supreme Soviet formed a special commission comprised of people's deputies to see to its revision. The commission was headed by member of parliament, academician, and noted legal expert Salyq Zimanov. Here too there were broad exchanges of views and various drafts were suggested. All in all, passionate creative work could not be achieved in an instant. The revised draft was again discussed in a session of parliament and there had to be a debate. Every fourth deputy participated in the debate. In the end, this document of remarkable fate for Kazakhstan was ratified by a majority in parliament. [Correspondent] It would seem to be unnecessary to take the declaration into account at the time the new constitution was ratified. How did this happen? [Asanbayev] It was in fact not easy. I will not present all the facts but limit myself to just a few. The declaration was the first document in the history of Kazakhstan which decided as a totality, and once and for all, all questions regarding the status of the Republic as a free state and confirmed it through strict legal means. If you look again at the words of the declaration, you will find there all characteristics of a sovereign nation: territory and citizenship entirely under the control of the Republic; the freedom and totality of state power within the nation; guidance based solely upon the constitution and upon laws; our own budgetary and financial system; our own armed forces; freedom in international relations. We must not denigrate the importance of the declaration by saying that through this sanctioned act of law certain individuals desired to announce who they were to a central authority. This document drew the outlines of our free country. It is the support upon which today's independent state of Kazakhstan is based. For that reason, the declaration, as is written in its text, was to be the base for the creation of a new constitution and, at the same time, it was to open the way for the ratification of various laws on citizenship, property, foreign investment, etc., by a state which had achieved its sovereign status in practice. It must be stated that many republics ratified declarations of sovereignty at that time to become the foundations of new constitutions. For example, the declaration of state sovereignty in Belarus was given status as constitutional law and its provisions have been placed above actual constitutional norms. During work after that on the draft of the new Republic constitution many provisions of the declaration found direct expression in its text. For example, if you compare the prefaces to the declaration and to the constitution, their primary aims and aspirations are very similar to one another. Also look at such areas as the indivisibility of the territory of Kazakhstan in the proclaimed declaration, Kazakhstan's territorial inviolability, the division of powers, the right of each to own property of the various kinds and equality of ownership, the guarantee of the protection [by law] of property of the various kinds, the legal equality of all nationalities and nations and of all nationalities and nations in all sectors of their social life, etc. All of these things were later put into the constitution and some were even taken as the basis of the constitutional structure. That is to say that certain fruitful thoughts within the principles of the declaration found their complete reflection in the constitution. [Correspondent] To be sure, the constitution is an honored document for all citizens. This is the way that constitutions are evaluated in every civilized country. Surely this idea was always dominant in the sessions of the Supreme Soviet? This being the case, how did you get into an argument with parliament. [Asanbayev] It was not that way at all. In general, I am against hasty categorical statements. However, I should offer some specific examples in this connection. For example, it was proclaimed in section seven of the declaration that the government of the state would be carried out according to the principle of a division between legislative, executive, and judicial powers. As is generally known to the people, this does not make clear the advantage and usefulness of the representational division between those holding the mentioned powers; but, at the same time, it foresees the creation of an entire system. Under such circumstances, if we may quote the words of Thomas Jefferson, one of the fathers of the American constitution: "Those in power must make government uniform so that it encounters no powerful stops or counter actions from other quarters; or that the institutions of governmental power do not go beyond the bounds of their legal powers." Unfortunately, there are only parts of this in the new constitution and we have been unable to create the systems, the complete mechanism of government. For example, if there should be unending disagreement within the membership of parliament endangering the regular flow of work, or if parliament were to enact one resolution after the other contrary to the constitution, the head of state does not have the right to dissolve it. Likewise, there is also no right, by way of a parliamentary balance, to remove the president from office if he acts contrary to the constitution, if the country has been betrayed, or for committing other malicious and serious crimes. However, the president, relying on experiences which have withstood the test of time of a number of civilized countries, was successful in a major effort to have these norms included in the draft of the constitution. However, these ideas were not ratified at meetings of the constitutional Commission. In the parliamentary session during the process of ratification, many deputies did not take note of the urgency of these questions. However, complications arising from a lack of a complete understanding of the motive forces of the constitution, and what has resulted from the lack of legal means to regulate difficult circumstances of the sort that exist now, are viewed differently today. You cannot find in the text of the new constitution even the slightest possibility for the head of state to have the most limited, I repeat, the most limited influence on the courts. However, the court system as it operates today operates altogether independently of anything and anyone. This has resulted in the development of criminality in the Republic. Such circumstances very much alarm me as a member of the Republic's Security Council. Moreover, it was suggested not once but repeatedly to the Constitutional Commission that they resolve this problem in a quiet manner. We said that the head of state must appoint [officers of] the courts. In addition, it was suggested that court appointments be by democratic means, utilizing a structure such as the Supreme Court Council under the president. It is comprised of the senior justices of the Republic's Supreme Court, specialists from the Ministry of Justice and the chief procurator's office, advocates and other specialists in the legal sector, and three deputies sent by parliament. Looking carefully at the question of organizing the work of courts of justice, advice should be given about questions such as appointment of [the officers of the] courts by the president, removal and overruling of judges, and the application of rewards and punishments. The courts are organs which have such broad powers and which, at the same time, require very knowledgeable people to serve on them. However this idea has still not been carried out. [Correspondent] How do you evaluate the constitution. [Asanbayev] I evaluate it very highly. Its stabilizing role in our society is very great. However, there is no need to say that it was a complex and difficult task to draw up properly, in a very compact and complete manner, such a broad, great document in a short time in view of the varied state of our views in an era of transition and our lack of experience in establishing our statehood. However, there are various quite disparate views about the character of the constitution. While some think of it as the constitution of a presidential Republic, others say that it is the constitution of a state of the parliamentary model. While some say that the constitution looks forward to the distant future, others think that it is a purely conservative document. In the view of one expert, our constitution is rather far from freedom. In truth, the constitution has come into being through the reconciliation of yesterday and today; the old and the new. This is because our society is today in transition and that is the reality of the present. In addition, the constitution has come into being as a result of a mutual agreement between united forces; between all the various groups living in society. We should mention here that for that reason no one has the right to appropriate the authority of the constitution and to attach any kind of special rights to it. Let us now consider the most important question. We, as you yourselves know, live in a time of transition. The entire system of economic relationships and of our social development is being refined to advance society. This, to be sure, demands a deep understanding of the questions of legislative work and consideration of many phenomena in this sector. We think that the new parliament to be chosen in the future will know how to find a profitable and reliable mechanism for this activity, moving away from the decrepit older system. The honorable thought must take shape in our society that our constitution answers all the requirements of law and for that reason it is the duty of all citizens to carry out [its provisions]. It, like the constitutions of other peoples, is the collective state ideology of development in this era. We must forbid, whether it is on the part of members of parliament which ratified the document, or individual scientists or social activists, the casting of stones at the honor of the constitution, on the one hand, and, on the other, raising a storm of incomprehensible and false criticism . We must encourage instead feelings of high honor in our society for this highly esteemed law of the state. Knowing how to show respect for the constitution has, whatever the time or whatever the place, been a sign of pure citizenship, of culture, and of patriotism. To exchange views and share ideas, we should discuss some of the ideas which find expression in the constitution from a theoretical point of view. [Correspondent] Could you not touch on this area in more detail? [Asanbayev] Let me settle one of the things which has been much disputed. That is the question of the establishment of a two house executive organ, with the higher powers called the National Executive Mazhilis. Such a structure has been characteristic of parliamentary democracy since early times and is properly used in many countries of the world. What is special about it? It would be beneficial in that it would be a regularly-functioning professional parliament and superior to our Supreme Kenges in that respect. Thereby there would be the possibility of creating a legislative policy that would be carefully filtered and carefully considered. Matters extraneous to legislating on a given occasion could be kept at a distance or, otherwise, they could be dealt with through supplementary legal acts. Still, it would be possible to improve considerably the preparation of drafts of law and their qualitative levels. We have nothing to be proud about presently in this question. Laws would be passed twice before the deputies [for review]. Not only would each house state its views regarding whether it approves or disapproves a draft of a law, but it is important that laws would be ratified in fact. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the responsibility of parliament and of its members would increase. A two-house structure would contribute to the development of collegiality in the work of the deputies, and within the chambers as a whole would increase knowledge and the pace of parliamentary work. In many countries it is not easy to solve the problem of the inequality of delegations of deputies from various territorial units. (If, for example, one compares the present number of Qaraghandy and Qyzylorda deputies, what this problem means for Kazakhstan emerges very clearly.) Through the two-house structure it would be possible to reduce the negative effects of the narrow thinking of so-called "parliamentary game players" that results from the clash of class interests or "looking out for the village" in making territorial or sector laws. There would be uniformity in central and regional forces. Parliament would become an organ where the interests of the entire country and of the regions would meet; where compromises would be made. The role of the regions has increased over what it was before. This is because the true economic and social life is not in the "corridors of power" of the capital but has passed over to local areas where the fate of reform is decided in fact. It would be beneficial for parliament to be well versed in the problems coming from these areas and to seek for ways of resolving them through law. It is well known that the executive authority is critical of parliament and prepares its decisions, to be heard twice by parliament, with extreme care. The influence of this cannot but reach the president. The possibility for supervision in a session would be expanded [by having two houses.] Exactly how, at this time, can we make clear just what a two-house parliament would be in Kazakhstan? The parliament would be comprised of two chambers: the upper--a senate, and the lower--a house of deputies. The senate would be comprised of two deputies chosen by an electorate comprised of all the local Kenges deputies from every oblast, the capital, and Leninsk City. Ten members of the Senate would be named by the president. They would be persons with special knowledge or who had acquired a great deal of experience in social service. Let me say, among other things, that the upper house of France's parliament is comprised of those elected indirectly and [having] one group of deputies chosen by the president is a system employed in India, Italy, and Pakistan. The house of deputies would be comprised of 135 deputies elected by majority votes from equal electoral districts. Each chamber would have its specific duties. Each would be given their own appropriate and varied powers, according to provision. The lower house, that is, those deputies directly elected by the people, would play the deciding and initiating role in legislation and in cadre questions (this is because the right to initiate legislation would be exercised only there). On the other hand, the upper chamber, with representative numbers equal by region, would be the main force in resolving international and republic-regional questions. Such differences in function would assist in raising the capacities for service [of each chamber], their knowledge, and the degree to which they would be well informed. There would be activities involving extremely broad questions that would have to be resolved by the two houses jointly. The legislative process would be as simple as possible and, at the same time, as effective as possible. Drafts of proposed laws would be reviewed by the lower chamber, provision by provision, and approved as a whole. A draft of a law approved by the members of the lower house by a majority vote would be sent for review to the upper house. The Senate, if necessary, would enter changes and additions and return it to the house of deputies. If the lower house is not opposed to the changes, the law would be considered ratified. Disagreements between the two houses would be resolved through compromise procedures. If a compromise is not possible, the original decision could be approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of the lower house. To be sure, there would be drafts of laws that would have to be considered by both houses. Under such circumstances, a joint Mazhilis of the senate and house of deputies would be called. If a majority of deputies voted in favor in a joint Mazhilis, a law could be considered ratified. According to American conceptions of the executive, a draft of a law is passed through the two houses of congress and openly and fully discussed. It [either] encounters major changes through corrections before it become law or it ends up being dropped as nothing more than an idle suggestion. This idea would never find use with us. Against it would be such traditions as "the single house parliament has still not exhausted itself," or "we are still not ready to do this kind of thing." The following argument has also been advanced in addition to evidence easy to refute: Kazakhstan is a unitary state. However, whether one chooses a two-house parliament or not, the nation will not be moved towards federalism. However, a two-house parliament has never been a sign of a federal state anywhere. There are many examples. We note that the parliaments of Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, and Japan, all considered unitary states, are comprised of two houses. Those countries did not choose a two-house system for more convenient solution of problems arising within their state territories, but to refine the legislative process. I think that sooner or later this beneficial system will be put into effect. This is because we cannot continue to be limited and cannot be repressed by the coming and going of completely new people [elected as deputies]. Events progress at their own speed but it is clear, at the very root of things, that we will find the most proper way. We must know how to be opposed to such things as getting puffed up about tireless work, old boy networks, accomplishing nothing; about creating problems, burnout, and excessive politicking. In order for me to make this thought clear, let me offer an historical example. As you know, Charles de Gaulle put into the constitution of the Fifth Republic the basic elements of presidential authority and guaranteed its stability. Socialist F. Mitterand later said about this version of the constitution. "When he was president, we did not like the constitution but now, when we ourselves are in power, it seems to support our own position." During the first period of the writing of the draft of the constitution, the members of the commission were caught up by broad national interests. This made it possible for us, in the Autumn of 1991, to lay down the foundations of the future constitution in a very short time: the structure was made clear, a clearly systematized ideology was chosen (that the state was for people, not the reverse), and the basic problems of content were solved. Various versions were prepared. Plans were made to organize the assembling of the draft broadly among native and foreign experts and specialists and we began to carry them out. Our country's achieving its independence demanded that we speed up work on the draft, since a constitution is a sign of independence. For that treason, from the beginning of 1992, the work of the constitutional Commission was managed by the president of the republic. The final polishing of the draft of the constitution was able to go forward in a systematic manner, with N.A. Nazarbayev chairing the meetings of the constitutional Commission. However, in addition to speeding up the process, the influence of various groups and individual factors began to be recognized in the work on the constitution. At that time the Constitutional Commission became, in terms of its membership, in fact an enlarged senior council of the Supreme Kenges. When, during December of the previous year, the membership of the commission had been expanded by a further 14 people's deputies, their clear power became conspicuous. I think that all of this was only favorable to the task at hand. [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, let us return to the declaration. Its ratification was no ordinary event. It exhibited the peculiarities of the time in which it was prepared and written: the president of the Republic had begun to consolidate power, a new parliamentary system had come into being, there was a previously unheard of flow of legislation, there was a rise in the number of political demonstrations, and signs were being seen of the beginning of democratic maturity in society and in the state. [Asanbayev] You are right. It was as if our whole lives were confined to a week. We worked day and night. The times were full, to the greatest degree, of important events. That time was the most interesting time I remember in my life. Think about it. After I was elected first chairman of the Supreme Kenges from among several alternative candidates, we began to master the knowledge and experience of a secret and for us hitherto unknown parlamentarianism, together with my colleagues in a body of deputies that was "on fire." This was in order that we should enter upon the difficult road whereby I would shape the work of the first democratically elected Supreme Kenges. For the first time we were in fact organizing the legislative activities of the Supreme Kenges. It is no secret that hitherto all questions of legislation were decided by the Union and that the overwhelming majority of all legal documents from the republics were confined to the reproduction of Union legal norms. Leaving aside questions of organization, all in all there was no true legislative action in Kazakhstan. Questions such as legislative strategy, planning legislative activities, and carrying out parliamentary supervision over the work of organizations exercising control over the way laws were being carried out and reporting to the Kenges, even the simple technical equipment guaranteeing the voting process of deputies, had hitherto not existed. We devoted a great deal of our efforts to mastering the work methods needed to draft laws, just to get used to them in large quantities. Hitherto the laws were "cooked in the pot" of the central authority and the republics fulfilled them. For that reason we kept our executive authority, as in the system of all developed states of the world, in a purely legislative parliament, and it was not ready at that time to take all the difficulties of drafting laws upon its own neck. For that reason, drafts of some laws of considerable importance for regulating every area of social relationships, and [in any case] always of the highest priority, were prepared within parliamentary committees and commissions. We began to master for ourselves the entire science of legislation, from the basics up to how a draft was prepared, and how to divide a law into parts. To tell the truth, I remembered several times Bismarck's caustic remark: "If you love sausages and laws, do not go see how they are made." I would like to mention in passing in this context the important and fruitful work of deputy speaker of the parliament, Z. Fedotova, in taking upon her neck the basic difficulties of organizing parliamentary legislative activities during this period. She greatly aided the chief of parliament, myself, in learning the secrets of many legal questions. At that time there were many important questions to be resolved, other than purely legislative problems. For example, one of them was the Semey Testing Area. During its very first session, the parliament demanded the closing of the testing area from the Union government. When this demand was not met, a resolution of the Supreme Kenges was ratified in the second session prohibiting nuclear explosions and testing of all forms of weapons of mass destruction in the territories of the Republic. I think that this was one of the primary victories gained by the present body of deputies. Nonetheless, all the leaders of the Union forthwith looked askance at our resolution and I suffered a certain amount of pressure as chairman of the Kenges. The deputies encountered considerable opposition, especially from the military-industrial complex. However time smoothes everything. The testing area has been closed forever. The parliament set about solving important state and economic problems, such as specifying local powers and local systems of self-government and regulating property relationships. For a long time, various versions of legal provisions were discussed, and to "bake" the innovations suggested for legislation many meetings were held with scientists and specialists, with deputies of local Kenges, and with heads of industry. There were repeated reviews of questions which had been decided. Such were the characteristics of the way parliament worked with such fundamental questions. We began efforts to refine the work of the Supreme Kenges to be more realistic and more systematic. It must be stated that much of what has become accepted practice in parliament operations and organization was specified during the fourth session, at the time that the Supreme Kenges ratified a resolution on refining its own operations. The urgency of many questions such as expanding the powers of the chairman of the Supreme Kenges, establishing a committee for external relations and parliamentary connections, the hiring of available consultants by committees, establishment of an office of control, etc., found expression in that document for the first time. Working in parliament became very interesting. My willingness to work together with the president in solving, by me in my capacity of specialist, problems such as immediate economic reform , market systemization, and formation of a presidential administrative model, became an incentive for me to accept election to the office of vice president. However, the declaration of Sovereignty occupied a special place during that complex half a year full of memorable events when I worked as head of the parliament. This is because our turn towards state independence in truth, with intelligence, and with purpose, began with it. The declaration became an unshakable foundation for the solving of political and legal problems of extremely great scope in direct connection with our formation of a state.
