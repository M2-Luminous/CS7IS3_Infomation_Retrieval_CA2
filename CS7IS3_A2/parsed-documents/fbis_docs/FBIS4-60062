Announcing this to AL-THAWRAH, a source in the Ministry explained that the new guidelines oblige owners of harvesters to operate 18 hours daily. The guidelines also call on the central committees in the governorates to ensure the appropriate number of harvester drivers in order to maintain the continuity of work during the set daily hours, and to also provide the necessary repair and maintenance work. The source explained that daily payments for campaign workers will stop on the set deadline and that any further delay in the harvest will be without pay. The performance of campaign workers will be assessed on the basis of meeting the deadlines. The guidelines also oblige those concerned to ensure the necessary means for transporting crops, such as vehicles, and to avoid using harvesters for loading purposes since this will waste time and affect the efficiency of the harvester.
