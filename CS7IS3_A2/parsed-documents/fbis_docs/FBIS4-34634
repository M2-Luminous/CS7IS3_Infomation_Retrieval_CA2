Balaguer met with Caputo the night of 20 June, without prior notice, at his office at the Government Palace. This is Caputo's third visit with the Dominican president for discussions on the Haitian crisis with the goal of reinforcing control of the 300-km border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, two nations that share the Caribbean island of Hispanolia. Caputo stated a copy of the list delivered to Balguer was sent approximately 10 days ago to the Dominican Foreign Ministry. Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral stated Caputo had not sent the list within the timeframe that was agreed with Balaguer during a prior meeting at which Ambassador William Gray, President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Haitian crisis, had been present. During this meeting, Balaguer accepted the sending of U.S. advisers and equipment to reinforce the embargo along the Dominican-Haitian border. Trade between the two nations since then has been semiparalyzed and is only allowed twice a week for four hours across the most transited border crossing. "We have delivered what we promised," Caputo said this Tuesday, referring to the document which contains, according to what he pointed out, "the basic explanation of the (UN) resolution to enforce a total embargo against the neighboring nation." Concerning the United Nations sending advisers and equipment to verify the compliance of the border embargo, Caputo said, "by the way, I held conversations last night (...) and logistic support and equipment coordination are being implemented." The Argentine diplomat said: "We are very concerned with the Haitian situation, and we are doing everything possible within our power" to speed up the resolution to the crisis. After meeting with Balaguer, Caputo traveled to the Dominican-Haitian border without giving an explanation as to how long he would remain there. "We will see," he told reporters when questioned. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer openly opposes the embargo against the Port-au-Prince military; nevertheless, he agreed to send soldiers to the border to prevent gasoline smuggling after meeting with Ambassador Gray.
