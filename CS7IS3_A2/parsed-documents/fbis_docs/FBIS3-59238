Before dinner, Demirel made a statement to the directors and chairmen of the executive committees of the public and private banks. He recalled the argument that the invitation was linked with the monetary crisis last week and said: "An effort has been made to create the impression that I invited you because of the monetary crisis. But I invited you before the crisis began." I Am Hinting Demirel created interest by emphasizing the importance of macro analyses, as former President Turgut Ozal did in the past. Stressing that his views should create no "anxiety," but should be taken as a "hint," Demirel asserted: "Everyone must fulfill his obligations without anxiety. No one must panic. Monetary issues are very sensitive. You may ask me: `How can we not panic?' I reiterate that you should not panic. You should not be carried away by anxiety. I wish you success, because you will be confronted with many problems. I expect you to show understanding toward the country's problem and help the government solve them." On the Country's Agenda Stressing that issues relating to the effort to control inflation, establish a balance in public financing, reduce the need for borrowing, and resolve the issues of parity, interest, and prices are on the country's agenda, Demirel asserted: "I have not said that they are on the political administration's agenda. They are on the country's agenda. They will remain on the country's agenda, regardless of the administration that is in power. Turkey must not ignore the measures that can prevent instability from being created in the country." Demirel stressed that a liberal democracy and a liberal economy cannot be separated. He also said that achieving the two together will be difficult. He noted: "Turkey has problems in both cases. But what is important is how determined we are to surmount the problems. Turkey is determined to solve its problems. It will solve all its problems." I Reiterate My Call Journalists were not allowed into the dining hall. Demirel's statement during the dinner created interest: "I am an impartial president. I do not wish to interfere in the executive organ's work. But I will intervene to express my opinion on issues that concern the country, issues that must be resolved. I don't want to do so now. But that does not mean I will not summon you to discuss issues relating to the economy and banking procedure in future. I will invite you in smaller groups, that is, if necessary."
