The draft was drawn up in execution of the government plan of action for 1993-1994 for implementation of the first stage of the program "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian Economy." The draft was developed in order to organize constructive interaction among organs of state power at all levels, local self-government, entrepreneurs, and public associations for comprehensive solutions to problems of economic development and provision of ecological safety. It was prepared taking into account the article of the new Russian Federation Constitution which proclaimed the right of each citizen to a healthy environment and also the principles of stable development presented in documents of the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (1992), to which our state was a signatory. The model for stable development presupposes: -- a balanced approach to solving problems of socioeconomic development and preservation of a favorable condition of the environment and natural resource potential; -- both the restriction and elimination of unviable models of production and consumption and the surmounting of obstacles on the path to the development of entrepreneurship; -- the elimination of distortions in state expenditures and the organization of efficient control, which should link an effective system of state administration to individual rules and capabilities of economic activity in the area of self-government as well. But, getting away from official language and shifting to one that is generally comprehensible, in brief, the provision of ecological safety of stable development may be defined as the encouragement of environmental protection activity, that is, implementation of a favorable policy in the tax and financial spheres under conditions of development of market relations. In other words, economic activity (new economic policy) should ideally be oriented toward the achievement of economic well-being in combination with Russia's ecological safety. The main directions of the ecological policy are formed from four sections which encompass, in the first place, problems of justified (that is, without damage to nature or the environment) distribution of productive forces and, correspondingly, everything related to the extraction of resources and salvaging and decontamination of production wastes. Second, the creation of the healthiest possible living environment for man in cities and rural areas. Third, the restoration of disturbed ecosystems in ecologically unfavorable regions, of which there are many. This includes also problems of protecting the Volga, Baykal, the Black and Caspian Seas, Lakes Onega and Ladoga, the Neva inlet, regions of the Far North, and also the Kavkazskiye Mineralnyye Vody health complex. And, finally, there are global problems of the planet, particularly protection of the ozone layer and prevention of climatic changes, protection and restoration of forests, solutions to problems of the World Ocean, and so forth and so on...
