FR940919-1-00004 FR940919-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Cessna Aircraft Company Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03, which currently requires repetitively inspecting each fuel inlet float valve in accordance with certain test procedures on Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna) Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, and replacing any valve that does not pass this test. The manufacturer has developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the improved valves should be installed to reduce the number of repetitive tests currently required by AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03. The proposed action would require installing these fuel inlet float valves of improved design. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from the Cessna Aircraft Company, Customer Services, P.O. Box 1521, Wichita, Kansas 67201. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Charles D. Riddle, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4144; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion On March 4, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8508 (58 FR 13406, March 11, 1993), in order to require a certain fuel inlet float valve test on Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, and replacement of any valve that does not pass this test. An accident involving a Model 402C airplane where the fuel inlet valve failed in the open position prompted that action. Since AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03 became effective, Cessna has developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design, and the FAA has determined that installation of these improved valves serves as a basis for reducing the number of repetitive tests currently required by AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03. In addition, Cessna has issued Service Bulletin (SB) MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993, which specifies procedures for replacing fuel inlet float valves; and (2) accomplishing an installation test. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that the fuel inlet float valves of improved design should be incorporated on the referenced airplanes to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03 with a new AD that would require replacing the fuel inlet float valves with parts of improved design or modifying the existing part and periodically accomplishing functional tests to assure proper operation. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna SB MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993.
