Commenting on the report, Gen Mellet said State President F.W. de Klerk had lost a lot of white support and was doing something dramatic to gain black support. Gen Mellet said the matter was unsettling, because it was being done unfairly. "I am upset about the way it was made public." Mr Kriel said on Tuesday Gen Mellet did not possess relevant information on the matters he commented on. "The comments attributed to him are completely inappropriate for a serving SAP [South African Police] general and do not reflect my views or those of the SA Police as an institution."
