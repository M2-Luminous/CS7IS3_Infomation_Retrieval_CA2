The popular and trade union organizations also continued to condemn this massacre. The Nasirite Arab Democratic Party staged a peaceful demonstration at noon today and issued a statement condemning the barbaric massacre and savage acts by gangs of Jewish settlers against the Palestinian people. The Party addressed a statement to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, calling for an emergency Arab summit to take a firm stand and confront the Zionist (?aggression) against the Palestinian Arab people in Palestine. The statement stressed the need for all Arab countries to adhere to the resolutions of the Arab boycott of Israel. It called on the Arab League to pass a resolution demanding that the current peace talks, which have become a cover for criminal actions, be stopped. It called on the Arab League to declare practical and binding measures to bolster the Palestinian people's steadfastness in the occupied territories and to support their valiant intifadah for the liberation of all Palestinian territories. The statement emphasized the need for the Arab League to exert efforts to restore Arab solidarity, unify the nation's efforts, and lift the blockade on Iraq and Libya. It called for putting all forms of pressure on the Security Council to pass a resolution providing for international protection of the Palestinian people, explicit condemnation of the massacre, dismantling the settlements, and disarming the settlers. In Alexandria, the lawyers syndicate freedoms committee condemned the heinous crime and massacre committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In a statement it released, the committee said that the Jewish settlers committing this crime and the killing and injuring of dozens of Muslims praying during the holy month of Ramadan demonstrate that Arab blood has become [words indistinct] for experts in genocide who have committed the massacres of Dayr Yasin, Sabra, and Shatila. The social arts and science committee in Alexandria condemned the massacre, saying that it was carried out under the slogan of arms. It said that Israel let its settlers behave crazily, foolishly, and conceitedly. Israel, the statement said, refuses to disarm the settlers, which makes us unsure about the security of the Palestinian people and discredits Israeli claims. It stressed that this incident robs the peace process of its credibility. In the meantime, the Alexandria University campus was the scene of student demonstrations. The students shouted slogans hostile to Israel and condemned the horrific massacre committed against the Palestinian people. The lawyers, doctors, and engineers trade unions staged a huge march in Alexandria yesterday evening to condemn the massacre. The al-Mansurah University board issued a statement condemning the bestial crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque, saying it shows savagery, barbarism, and violation of the sanctity of a divine religion. It called on the international community to take action quickly to ensure security and peace in this vital part of the world. It appealed to world public opinion to put an end to double standards in the application of international law.
