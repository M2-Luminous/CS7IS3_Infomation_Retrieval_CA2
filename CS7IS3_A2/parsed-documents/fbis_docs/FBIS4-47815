However, Gen. Viljoen said that he would have to discuss the issue with Mr. Nelson Mandela before deciding finally. Last night, Mr. Mandela praised Gen. Viljoen, describing him as a worthy South African who would make a contribution to the government of national unity. It was later rumored that he could even be appointed Minister of Defense. Projections for the National Assembly at this stage show the Freedom Front taking 13 seats, seven short of the 20 required for a cabinet post.
