Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA--No aspect of the African National Congress [ANC] could be described as communist in spite of the ANC's alliance with the South African Communist Party [SACP], ANC national Chairman Thabo Mbeki told a Davis Borkhum Hare breakfast at the Transvaal Automobile Club in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The proceedings, broadcast live on M-Net [Media Network], were attended by leading businessmen, diplomats and politicians. Asked to outline the ANC's stance on nationalisation, Mr Mbeki said the ANC did not have a policy of nationalisation but would consider state control if it achieved a particular policy objective. "The ANC has no policy to nationalise any bank or industry or mine. What we are saying is that these are instruments of policy. One may decide to privatise a company but the matter is not approached as an ideology or a policy. "If in the pursuit of a particular policy objective it can be shown that the objective can be achieved by putting company x in state hands, then of course we would consider it." He said the ANC intended to bring an end to the violence because this was crucial in attracting foreign investment that was necessary for job creation. Constitutional concessions offered the Freedom Alliance should be sufficient to ensure its participation in the elections. The changes had been painful to the ANC but were necessary to achieve stability. Economic growth would be central to an anc government. A democratic settlement had to be underwritten by a programme that improved the lives of the poor. "Something has to happen to guarantee the permanance of the democratic settlement." The ANC would initiate a public works programme and restructure the budget to realise its objectives within current state revenue projections. In reply to another question, Mr Mbeki said it was not inevitable that South Africa would decline in the way some African countries had done. It would be foolish not to learn from the mistakes of other African countries, he said.
