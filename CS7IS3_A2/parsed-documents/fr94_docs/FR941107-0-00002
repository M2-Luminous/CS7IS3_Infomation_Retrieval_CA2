FR941107-0-00002 FR941107-0-00001 FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD 5 CFR Part 1600 Employee Elections To Contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan AGENCY: Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is amending its regulations that describe the periods within which employees may make certain elections in regard to contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). This amendment will establish a permanent schedule of TSP open seasons, thereby eliminating the regulatory requirement that the Board publish an advance notice in the Federal Register announcing the beginning and ending dates of each open season. DATES: This amendment is effective December 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David L. Hutner at (202) 942&hyph;1661. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 41990). No comments were received. After further review the Board has decided that no changes in the proposed rule are necessary. Accordingly, the proposed rule is published as a final rule. Each year, there are two open seasons during which participants may elect to commence contributions to the TSP, change the amount of their contributions or the allocation of their contributions among the TSP investment funds, or terminate contributions without forfeiting the ability to resume contributing during the next open season. The regulatory notice requirement for open seasons was established by the Board in 1987 shortly after the Thrift Savings Plan came into existence. At that time, it was not clear whether open seasons would occur at the same time and for the same duration each year. However, since then there have been two open seasons each year: May 15&hyph;July 31 and November 15&hyph;January 31. The last month of each open season has been designated the ``election period'', which is defined in 5 CFR ยง1600.1. Since the open seasons have not varied since 1988, the Board is now amending its regulations to establish a permanent schedule for the beginning and ending dates and to eliminate the requirement that an advance notice of each open season be published in the Federal Register . Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. They will affect Board procedures relating to the requirement to publish advance notice of each open season. EO 12291 I certify that this is not a major rule. Paperwork Reduction Act I certify that these regulations do not require additional reporting under the criteria of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
