Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the Japanese Government hails Pyongyang's decision on Tuesday as a move that enables the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to confirm North Korea is not using its nuclear sites for military purposes. "We believe it is important that the IAEA's inspection will be implemented in line with the latest accord" between Pyongyang and the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, the top government spokesman said at a news conference. Takemura also expressed hope North Korea will take positive steps in clearing itself of allegations that Pyongyang has been secretly developing nuclear weapons at its facilities in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital. Tokyo wants Pyongyang to open a dialogue with Seoul and resume talks with Washington on the matter, according to the chief cabinet secretary. North Korea agreed Tuesday to open seven of its nuclear facilities to inspections by the IAEA in a move to avert possible economic sanctions by the United Nations Security Council. The accord, however, does not allow the IAEA access to two sites at Yongbyon where North Korea is suspected of developing nuclear weapons. Takemura spoke of the need for North Korea to open the two facilities to international inspectors. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed a qualified appreciation for North Korea's decision, saying it was fine for the moment. But Hosokawa said there remain two more nuclear sites that must undergo checks. A Foreign Ministry source said, however, it will not be clear whether North Korea will really accept IAEA inspections until they are implemented. Japan must cautiously watch the development of the issue as Pyongyang may have agreed to open its nuclear facilities in an effort to buy time before the possible imposition of economic sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, the source said.
