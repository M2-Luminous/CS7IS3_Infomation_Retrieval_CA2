"It is none other than the pro-American traitor Kim Yong-sam wearing a `civilian' veil that has brought a disaster to the nation," it said, and went on: "The nation has to decide on whether it will undergo a war disaster with Kim Yong-sam left alone or will win peace with him removed." The declaration called on all the patriotic people who love the country and the nation to staunchly join in the nationwide struggle for overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique. It further said: "The nuclear racket kicked up by the United States is a plot to stifle socialism on the globe from the ideological point of view, a trick to manage third world countries like slaves with a whip of the nuclear power from the political point of view and a scheme to realise its new idea of putting priority to Asia and `neoglobalism' with our nation as the hostage of a nuclear war from the strategic point of view." It called on all the fellow countrymen to rise up in the nationwide struggle for thwarting the U.S. nuclear racket and war provocation moves against the North.
