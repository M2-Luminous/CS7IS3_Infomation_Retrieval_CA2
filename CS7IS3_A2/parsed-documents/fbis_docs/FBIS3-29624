Japan is deeply concerned about escalating armed hostilities that have caused a large number of civilian casualties in various regions of Afghanistan since January, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement. Japan strongly calls on all concerned parties in Afghanistan not to use force to obstruct humanitarian aid activities, Terada said. He was referring to reports that some armed groups have blocked aid efforts by groups such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Last week, a UN official said that hundreds of thousands of internally displaced refugees could die of cold and lack of food, and estimated that 200,000 citizens are trapped in fighting in Kabul. Terada said the Japanese Government is also concerned about the effect of the hostilities on the repatriation of Afghan refugees. Some 5.2 million Afghan refugees are waiting to return home from Pakistan and Iran, Terada said. From 1979 to 1993, Tokyo extended 420 million dollars worth of aid to Afghan refugees through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP). Japan has not yet recognized the Afghan Government, which was established after the fall of communist President Najibullah in April 1992. In January, hostilities intensified between the rival forces of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and loyalists of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar.
