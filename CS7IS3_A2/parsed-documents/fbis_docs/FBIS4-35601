FBIS4-35601 "drnes106_c_94002" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 EGYPT Muslim Brotherhood Denies Link With Lawyers Demonstration Muslim Brotherhood Denies Link With Lawyers Demonstration NC0106200694 Cairo AL-'ARABI in Arabic 30 May 94 pp 1, 4 NC0106200694 Cairo AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Report by Khalid Salah and 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im] [Excerpts] Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party and People's Assembly member, on Sunday presented an urgent enquiry to the prime minister and the interior minister on the recent incidents in the Lawyers Association and the circumstances surrounding the mysterious death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. [passage omitted] The incidents at the Lawyers Association continue to draw political reactions. Within the attempts of the Muslim Brotherhood to avoid a clash with the government--a clash that appeared increasingly likely in the past weeks--Muslim Brotherhood General Guide Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr has denied any responsibility for his group in stirring up and leading the demonstration that was staged by the lawyers a few weeks ago to protest the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani hours after his arrest late last month. In statements to AL-'ARABI, Abu-al-Nasr said the Muslim Brotherhood was falsely blamed for the Lawyers Association incidents. He said the Muslim Brotherhood "has nothing to do with the associations and does not interfere in their affairs!" He explained the attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood in the government media as a continuation of statements President Mubarak made to the German magazine DER SPIEGEL, in which he accused the banned Muslim Brotherhood of supporting terrorism. Following those statements by the president, Abu-al-Nasr said, the official media "rushed to launch a strong attack against us, and even blamed us for the Lawyers Association incidents!" Security forces yesterday arrested five Muslim Brotherhood members. They were referred to the prosecution, which decided to remand them for two weeks for interrogation.
