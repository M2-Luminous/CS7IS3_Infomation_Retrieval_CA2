In a statement he made this evening, Kanafani said in answer to Peres' statements that it is very strange to hear such a request from the Israeli foreign minister--neither he nor Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin expressed any kind of regret or condemnation when the Israeli army and intelligence deliberately killed six prominent youths from Fatah recently in Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian official added that the contrary was true since the Israeli housing minister expressed his and the Israeli Government's appreciation for such terrorist acts when he emerged from the Israeli cabinet's weekly session to declare the cabinet's stance on the incident.
