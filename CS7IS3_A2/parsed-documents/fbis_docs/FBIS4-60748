The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. Al-'Attas stated after the meeting that they discussed the situation in Yemen. He said: We thank Egypt and President Mubarak for all the efforts that have been made and are being made to end the war in Yemen and to deal with the situation in a way that would ensure stability in the country. He said that he will continue his consultations with the officials in Egypt, the other Arab states, and the friendly states. Asked whether the purpose of his tour is to seek recognition for Democratic Yemen, he said: What we are interested in right now is to stop the war. He noted that the continuation of the war is a loss not only for Yemen but also for all the Arab countries. Al-'Attas said: We are demanding an end to this war and the withdrawal of the forces to the positions they held before 22 May 1990, that is before the unity. Then it would be possible to conduct a dialogue on all the issues and on the ways to resolve them. This includes the effects of the war and the future of Yemen. Asked about the statement of Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani that contacts are taking place between Sanaa and members of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], al-'Attas said: There are no members in the YSP conducting mediation independently from the party leadership. But there are other national figures, led by Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-al-Shawarib, a principal member of the Dialogue Committee of the national and political forces who earlier held consultations with a number of figures outside the country. When some ideas began to take shape, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih contacted these figures and dissuaded them from continuing these efforts. Whereas, we welcome any Yemeni or other efforts. He said that these ideas have now been resurrected. He noted that they are ready to consider any form of dialogue through the leadership in southern Yemen. Answering a question about the aid that Saudi Arabia is providing to South Yemen, al-'Attas said: There are many claims in this regard that aim at extortion. But we have confidence in the capabilities of our people, all our brothers, and all our friends who help us. Asked how the military operations are proceeding now, al-'Attas said that there are many victims because the leadership in the north is involving thousands of our Yemeni people in the war with no consideration for the number of victims. We are sorry for this loss. He added: War is bound to break any ties of love among the Yemeni people. It will also create hatred, problems, and acts of revenge among the people. This war was the first blow to Yemeni unity. Asked South Yemen's response if the issue were raised in the UN Security Council, al-'Attas said: We indeed prefer raising the issue at the Security Council, which can help stop the war. He explained that when South Yemen made the decision to restore the situation to what it was before 22 May 1990, it sought to protect the disintegration of Yemen into several states. When the situation returns to what it was before 22 May, there will be a time to think and proceed toward the future with complete clarity. He said that in the light of the current situation, the existence of two states in Yemen would be better for all concerned. Answering a question about al-Iryani's statement yesterday that the northern forces have decided not to enter Aden, al-'Attas said: They are unable to enter Aden. Had they been able to enter Aden by force, they would have done so. They have often declared that they will end the war within 48 hours, and here we are in the fourth week of fighting. Answering a question about what was discussed during his meeting with President Mubarak, al-'Attas said: I briefed President Mubarak on the situation in Yemen and the president's reaction was positive regarding the need to end the problems in Yemen. He noted that he is currently making a tour of the area, and that he will leave for Syria after his visit to Egypt. Al-'Attas denied Aden's responsibility for the outbreak of fighting, emphasizing that Sanaa started the war. Al-'Attas then reviewed the developments that took place following the signing of the Pledge and Agreement Document in Jordan and the cabinet meetings held in Aden and Ta'izz to implement the document.
