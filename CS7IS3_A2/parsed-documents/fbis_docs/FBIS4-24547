The confrontation came after a three-hour march in which protesters demanded redress for the suffering of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, labelled a "counter-revolutionary riot" by mainland authorities. More than 3,000 people -- about half last year's number -- gathered outside Chater Garden and walked along Queensway and Hennessy Road to Causeway Bay, then to the Xinhua offices in Happy Valley. A core member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Cheung Man-kwong, said he believed people still had a strong passion for the movement. Accompanied by alliance leader Szeto Wah and other key members including Mak Hoi-wah and Yeung Sum, Mr Cheung led the group in calling for the release of political dissidents in China and singing patriotic songs. When the group reached the Queen Elizabeth Stadium opposite the Xinhua office, the police allowed 20 representatives to cross Queen's Road East to hand in a petition. Barricades kept people back about 1.5 metres from the main entrance. Alliance representatives were allowed to send only one person beyond the barricades to place the petition at the main gate. They were not allowed to place a wreath and black banner on the doorstep. Alliance leaders decided to stage a sit-in until the police yielded. However, scuffles broke out when another demonstrator, Wong Kin, rushed the police line in the middle of Queen's Road East, attempting to join the alliance members. He and a second protester were restrained and some photographers were pulled away by policemen. The incident sparked allegations that human rights had been violated and that the Government might be bowing to Chinese pressure to suppress the demonstration. Mr Cheung, also a legislator, said it was ridiculous for the police to insist that only the articles specified in the petition licence could be placed at the Xinhua entrance. He questioned the legal basis on which the police had barred them from placing the flowers and banner on the footpath. But Wan Chai District Commander Harold Bludd said the police were right in imposing the restriction. "They do not have a permit to do it. That's why. They have a permit to hand in a petition. That's all," he said. "It was not agreed that they would bring a flower cart, it was not agreed that they would bring their banners. There was no agreement that they would put them in front of the NCNA (New China News Agency) main entrance," Mr Bludd said.
