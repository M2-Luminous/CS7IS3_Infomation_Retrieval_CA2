Japanese automakers are expected to announce their programs to expand their purchases of foreign-made automobile and auto parts later this month. Following these announcements, the abolishment of restrictions on auto exports will be formally declared. The control of auto exports, which has been being criticized as a symbol of managed trade between Japan and the United States since its implementation in 1981, is about to end. The decision to abolish voluntary restrictions was reached mainly for the following reasons: 1) Japan's auto exports to the United States are unlikely to grow drastically because Japanese automakers already have a considerable amount of production in the United States; and 2) according to the agreement at the GATT Uruguay Round last year, the voluntary restriction of exports is not a clear violation of GATT rules, but as it is considered a questionable practice, it should be discontinued. Both the U.S. Government and the Big Three automakers have informally conveyed to the Japanese Government their position not to "welcome further renewals of voluntary export restrictions," noting that Japan's controls on auto exports have already lost their significance. The restrictions on auto exports to the United States have been voluntarily determined by Japan at the end of every fiscal year. The policy began in fiscal year 1981, when a rapid increase in the Japanese share of the U.S. auto market became the focal point of trade disputes between the two nations. The annual export quota was set at 1.68 million units in the beginning, but was expanded to 2.3 million in 1985. After this, however, Japanese automakers began to expand their production in the United States to cope with the drastic appreciation of the yen. Since 1987, Japan's auto exports to the United States have not reached the annual export ceilings. The government lowered the quota to 1.65 million in fiscal 1992, but actual exports were even lower for that year. The export level for fiscal 1993 is estimated to be about 1.5 million units. In addition, the Uruguay Round accord is urging abolishment of questionable export control measures for a four-year period starting in 1995. Under such circumstances, Japan has been clarifying its intention to discontinue some export control measures following the expiration of such measures.
