He said: An agreement was reached on the scope of inspection for the continuity of the safeguards at the negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA in Vienna on February 15. The agreed inspection is not a routine or an ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement but an inspection proper to the specific status of the DPRK after the temporary suspension of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Its main purpose is to confirm the non-use of nuclear materials for other purpose after the last inspection and thereby ensure the continuity of the safeguards. His accords with the spirit agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York on December 29 last year. At the contact the two sides agreed on immediate measures aimed at a package solution to the nuclear issue, whereby the DPRK would accept an inspection required for the continuity of the safeguards and affirmatively examine a possible proposal of the South Korean side for a working-level contact for an exchange of special envoys, while the United States would declare the cancellation of its "Team Spirit" joint military exercises in 1994, and the two sides would jointly announce the date of the third round of bilateral talks. What was specially mentioned there was that the inspection of the DPRK by the agency should strictly be limited to one for the continuity of the safeguards. However, the scope of inspection had not been decided upon so far because the IAEA Secretariat tried to force upon the DPRK full routine and ad hoc inspections, totally ignoring the DPRK-U.S. agreement and the United States unreasonably defended the Secretariat of the agency, breaking faith. Under this situation, the DPRK could no longer count on the talks with the United States but was compelled to express its official position that it could not but make a necessary choice. Such being the case, the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat voluntarily withdraw their demand for routine and ad hoc inspections and said they would seek an inspection exclusively for the continuity of the safeguards, and this made it possible to decide upon the inspection scope. We welcome that the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat have agreed to the definition of the scope of inspection for the continuity of the safeguards, turning to a stance for the solution of the issue. What remains to be seen is what attitude the United States will take in the practical stage of the fulfilment of the agreement between the DPRK and the agency. If an agreement on the follow-up steps of simultaneous action is reached as promised between the DPRK and the United States, it will open a phase for the agency's early inspection for the continuity of the safeguards and, furthermore, for the opening of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and a package solution to the nuclear issue. The world is now welcoming the recent agreement. However, the U.S. right-wing conservative forces and the Japanese and South Korean authorities alone are crying that full-routine and ad hoc inspections must be made and even openly demanding a "special inspection", arguing the inspection scope agreed upon between the DPRK and the IAEA is insufficient for verifying the transparency of the nuclear activities of the DPRK. This is a very ill-boding act. This cannot be construed otherwise than a claim motivated by an intention to block the progress of the solution of the nuclear issue and lead the situation again to an extreme phase, not by their ignorance of how the issue stands on the Korean peninsula. The "special inspection" is one of the main reasons that compelled the DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and so the persistent demand for it is, in the final analysis, tantamount to an attempt to drive the DPRK out of the treaty. The routine and ad hoc inspections are a matter which should be discussed within the framework of a package solution of the nuclear issue if the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks open. This matter will never be solved, even though they demand them now. The United States should fully discharge its responsibility and obligations at this crucial moment which has been brought about with much trouble, thus checking the reverse of the present positive development of the situation and contributing to the final solution of the nuclear issue. If the United States again put the brakes on a solution to the nuclear issue, attaching an unreasonable condition to an agreement on the steps for simultaneous action, or resorting to pressure, it would be impossible to implement the points already agreed upon between the DPRK and the IAEA and there would be no more chance as now. We consistently follow a policy of independence. We will counter whatever possible cases. We will continue to watch the future developments.
