At a press conference in Belgrade, Chairwoman Natasha Kandich urged that all allegations of inhuman behaviour be impartially investigated by parliamentary bodies, and members of the police found responsible sent before the courts. In particular, the responsibility of members of an investigatory commission of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs should be established for their participation in a cover-up of police misconduct, fund representatives said. The situation in the Sandzak, a region covering parts of Serbia and Montenegro, is now dangerously similar to that in Kosovo, where almost 2 million Kosovo Albanians live in severe repression by the Serbian authorities, Kandich said. The main difference is that Albanian Muslims frequently die in prison, whereas no deaths in detention have as yet taken place in the Sandzak, she added. Between January 27 and February 22, the discriminatory arrest of members of the Party for Democratic Action (SDA), which rallies Muslims was carried out by the Serbian-Montenegrin authorities. Investigating individual cases of brutality, the fund established that torture of Muslims is systematically applied, in contravention of the constitution and international covenants. Detainees were forced to testify against themselves by beatings, sometimes with heavy metal bars, electric shocks, beating on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the use of truncheons on the testicles, strangulation, strong light and deprivation of food and water. Police make no effort to hide their Serbian extremist allegiance, Kandich said, and threaten prisoners with the names of Serbian terrorists such as Vladislav Seselj and Arkan, a well-known criminal. Both names are linked to atrocities against the non-Serb populations in Croatia and Bosnia. Some of the prisoners were blind-folded and taken to places in Bosnia, the fund stated. Prisoners were kept in excess of the 72 hour legal limit and their families were not informed of their whereabouts. The arrested were charged with illegal possession of arms, but charges were exaggerated in order to point to a conspiracy to secede from Serbia Montenegro, lawyers said. The true reason, in the fund's opinion, is twofold: One, to prevent the functioning of a legal political party (the SDA) and secondly to terrorize the Muslim population in order to carry out "ethnic cleansing" of the region. No action has been taken against Serbs, Montenegrins or other nationalities in the area, who openly boast of being armed, representatives said. According to the fund, most of the arms were acquired in a wave of fear in 1991 when war broke out between Croats and Serbs. "The only difference," a spokesman said, "is that Serbs acquire their weapons from their army in Bosnia, while Muslims buy them." The present trial of 25 Muslims in Novi Pazar is a rigged political process, representatives said, where all legal rights of defence have been set aside. Admissions extracted under torture are being used in evidence against them, while the accused have already been condemned in the press without trial.
