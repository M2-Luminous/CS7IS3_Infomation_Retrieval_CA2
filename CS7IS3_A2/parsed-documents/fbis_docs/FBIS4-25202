What do you predict? [Qian Qichen] "If the United States does not want to cut off its economic relations with China, then problems should be settled. There is a very strong view supporting an extension of the MFN status among American business leaders." [Kato] Hopes are placed on China's role in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. How does China view the situation, and what is China's role? [Qian Qichen] "China does not want to see the issue discussed at the UN Security Council [UNSC]. We have been stressing that the issue should be settled thorough negotiations in three channels involving four countries -- between North Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea, and between North Korea and the IAEA. I am sure some progress will be made if they patiently continue to hold negotiations within this framework. There is the possibility that if resolutions should be adopted at the UNSC at the present stage, the current framework for dialogue will be broken, and that mutual contradiction will further deepen. China has maintained its position that the UNSC should announce a non-binding statement by the UNSC president." [Kato] North Korea has rejected the statement. What do you think of it? [Qian Qichen] "North Korea's rejection of the statement is understandable because it opposes the UNSC taking up the issue. It appears the situation is gradually moving in the right direction after the announcement of the presidential statement." [Kato] Is it correct that underlying China's emphasis on patient persuasive efforts is its conclusion -- based on its own information -- that North Korea's nuclear development is not imminent or that China bases its position, while judging that North Korea's nuclear development is in progress, on its fears that there is the possibility that North Korea will take unexpected action if pressure is applied to North Korea? [Qian Qichen] "(Concerning progress in North Korea's nuclear development) it is difficult to make a clear judgment. The IAEA says that North Korea already has a five-megawatt reactor, and that a larger reactor is under construction. But at present, there is no evidence that proves the transfer of radioactive materials. China has no right to check North Korea's nuclear facilities. China, for its part, insists that the Korean peninsula should be denuclearized. If a military conflict should break out there, it will greatly affect China and Japan, as well as the surrounding nations. But the United States is over 10,000 kilometers away." [Kato] Is there any schedule for mutual visits by top leaders of both China and North Korea? [Qian Qichen] "Absolutely not." [Kato] If the United States decides on an extension of the MFN trade status to China, will it be easier for China to persuade North Korea? [Qian Qichen] "The two problems are completely different." [Kato] Japan, while facing trade friction with the United States, has indicated its intention to obtain a permanent seat in the UNSC. What do you think of this? [Qian Qichen] "Japan-U.S. trade friction has long existed and is an unavoidable issue. China also has a similar trade issue with the United States. I think the issue will be solved through thorough negotiations. Regarding Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UNSC, there is a difference in views among members of the United Nations, and the issue has not officially come up on the agenda of the UN session."
