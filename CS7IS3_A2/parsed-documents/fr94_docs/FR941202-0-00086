FR941202-0-00086 FR941202-0-00010 (4) The owner or operator shall report all exceedances and all corrections and adjustments made to avoid an exceedance as specified in §63.468(h). (f) Each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying with the idling emission limit standards in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section. (1) Conduct an initial performance test to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(1)(ii) of this section. (i) Demonstrate compliance with the applicable idling emission limit. (ii) Establish parameters that will be monitored to demonstrate compliance. If a control device is used that is listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, then the requirements for that control device as listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be used unless the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that an alternative strategy is equally effective. (2) Conduct the periodic monitoring of the parameters used to demonstrate compliance as described in §63.466(f). (3) Operate the solvent cleaning machine within parameters identified in the initial performance test. (4) If any of the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section are not met, determine whether an exceedance has occurred using the criteria in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (f)(4)(ii) of this section. (i) If using a control listed in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the appropriate parameter values in paragraph (e)(2) and the exceedance delineations in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section. (ii) If using a control not listed in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall indicate whether the exceedance of the parameters that are monitored to determine the proper functioning of this control would be classified as an immediate exceedance or whether a 15 day repair period would be allowed. This information must be submitted to the Administrator for approval. (5) The owner or operator shall report all exceedances and all corrections and adjustments made to avoid an exceedance as specified in §63.468(h). §63.464 Alternative standards. (a) As an alternative to meeting the requirements in §63.463, each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine can elect to comply with the requirements of §63.464. An owner or operator of a solvent cleaning machine who elects to comply with §63.464 shall comply with the requirements specified in either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. (1) If the cleaning machine has a solvent/air interface, as defined in §63.461, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. (i) Maintain a log of solvent additions and deletions for each solvent cleaning machine. (ii) Ensure that the emissions from each solvent cleaning machine are equal to or less than the applicable emission limit presented in table 5 of this subpart as determined using the procedures in §63.465(b) and (c).
