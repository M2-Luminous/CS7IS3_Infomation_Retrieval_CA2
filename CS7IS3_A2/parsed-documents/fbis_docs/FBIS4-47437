Kochnev, prof. (dec.), S.G. Izmailov and R.V. Fedorov, Chair of General and Emergency Surgery and Microbiology, Kazan GIDUV [expansion unknown] ] [Abstract] Zone inhibition studies were conducted on Micrococcus lysodeicticus to test wound discharges for antimicrobial activity and to ascertain whether such activity provides an indication of wound healing. The technical details involved preparation of 5 mm diameter discs from filter paper for saturation with the discharge material and assessment of growth inhibition on solid medium. Studies on 70 male and female patients, 18 to 70 years old, with postsurgical abdominal infections demonstrated a positive correlation between the degree of inhibition and abatement of the infectious process. Thus, a high degree of antibacterial activity of the discharge can be used to monitor the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy and the proper time for application of secondary sutures.
