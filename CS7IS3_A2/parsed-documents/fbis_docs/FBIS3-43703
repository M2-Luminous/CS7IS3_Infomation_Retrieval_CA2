In a statement, IFP Political Director Dr. Ziba Jiyane said: "The IFP disassociates itself from the statements by certain IFP members implying that the IFP has called for a worker stay-away on Monday, January 17. "Since the January 17 event is being organised by the Zulu king and not the IFP, the IFP could not have made any such decision. We wish to emphasise the meeting on Monday between his majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini and State President F W de Klerk has absolutely nothing to do with the IFP," Dr. Jiyane said. Mr Ndlovu made the initial stay-away call in a statement on Wednesday night. He declined to elaborate. IFP Transvaal leader and Central Committee member Themba Khoza confirmed on Wednesday night the party would call on Zulus to stay away from work on Monday. He said the official call would be made in a statement on Thursday. Mr Khoza said IFP supporters in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region were expected to mass outside the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Monday when the Zulu monarch met Mr de Klerk. The IFP has called a press conference in Johannesburg later on Thursday to clarify the IFP's position on the stay-away call. The confusion comes amid persistent claims by IFP rivals that the party is using King Zwelithini for political gain.
