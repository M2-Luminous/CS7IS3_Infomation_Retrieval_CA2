Yasir 'Arafat, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen: In the life of nations, there are historic moments that cannot be deleted by time or shrouded in obscurity. These moments always remain, handed down from one generation to another. The major developments witnessed by these moments have a deep and radical impact on the strategic interests and the basic rights of peoples. In the life of the Middle East peoples in particular, there are unforgettable historic moments, moments that brought much hope and many dreams after much pain and suffering. They allowed the peoples of the region to continue their march toward peace and along the road of prophets, may God's peace and prayers be upon them, the prophets sent by God to spread virtue and right in the world and to cleanse hearts of hatred, vice, and rancor. God Almighty created man on earth to entrench the foundations of peace, to build and reconstruct, not to burn or destroy. Man was created to fill the universe with light, knowledge, and happiness and to eliminate coercion, fear, and darkness. Today we are experiencing one of those historic moments as we see the signing of the agreement on the establishment of the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho as part of the first phase of the Palestinian-Israeli peace. This proceeds from the Declaration of Principles that was signed in Washington. This step, therefore, is a culmination of hard and strenuous efforts. Many sides did all they could to turn general rules and principles into detailed, precise provisions that can be urgently implemented and can effect a revolutionary transformation in the reality of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. The Palestinian problem proved difficult to solve for 45 years. Time only added more complications, hatred, and suffering. Many thought it had turned into a chronic problem from which there was no way out and that its obstacles could not be overcome. Calls of despair and despondency spread against the peacemakers and the instigators of hope. Many people thought peace was an unattainable objective. But God Almighty provided the peoples of the region with a group of people who believed in their God and their mission on this blessed earth. They remained steadfast in their call for peace and sincere in their endeavor to achieve a just and honorable settlement that preserves a party's dignity and right to a secure life and protects its legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the laws accepted by the international community after centuries of experiments, successes, and failures. It was not strange to see this march on the course of peace led by great men and noble strugglers who have experienced war, lived through its horrors and atrocities, and witnessed the killing, the dismemberment, the burning of land and crops, and the spreading of ruin as far as the eye could see. These things were the result of war. It was natural for these heroes to turn their minds and beliefs from the war and its horrors and evils to peace with its hopes and broader horizons that would heal the wounds, resist annihilation, end the suffering and pain, and allow man to continue his noble mission worldwide. This faithful group of heroic men undertook the task of working for peace to their last heart beat and of devoting their lives and hearts to turning the dream into a reality regardless of the sacrifices. They realized with their sound vision and deep wisdom that peace was the sublime objective of all peoples and that war was futile even if it brought a temporary victory, achieved an illusionary security, or changed balances. Ultimately it incites revenge and motives for retribution. But a just and honorable peace alone is the right course according to which everybody can live in security and safety. The Arab people in Egypt were among the first to believe in peace as a goal and a course and as a moral commitment unparalleled by any other commitment. The Egyptian people have never been reluctant to sacrifice their lives, blood, and livelihood for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace that all the peoples of the area can enjoy and through which they can break the terrible vicious circle of bloodshed and the loss of sons and fathers. This was reflected in this people's steadfastness after the glorious October War and their firm decision to stand by peace when the late President Muhammad Anwar al-Sadat called for peace [applause] in Jerusalem in decisive terms that entered and touched every heart when he said: I did not come to you to conclude a separate agreement between Egypt and Israel. This is not part of Egypt's policy. The problem is not Egypt and Israel. Any separate peace between Egypt and Israel or between any one of the confrontation states and Israel will not establish a permanent and just peace in the entire region. Even if peace is achieved between every confrontation state and Israel without a just solution to the Palestinian problem, this will never establish the permanent and just peace demanded by the entire world today. This, gentlemen, was Egypt's view of the problem and the way to solve it at that time. This policy continued to constitute its people's commitment throughout the years, even after it regained its territory and completed its freedom. The effect of all this made Egypt more capable of directing its attention to supporting its other brothers in their efforts to realize their hopes for a just and honorable peace, the peace of the heroes and the bold who can overcome the past and present barriers and move on to the future. Egypt has never felt that it was alone on this path, although it was lonely and often faced many difficulties. Egypt's faith that justice will triumph has never been shaken. It believes that ultimately the voice of peace and reconciliation will surge with a roaring force throughout the Arab world and in Israel. The world's advocates of peace will support the peoples of the region in these hard years. They will back them and their right to look forward to a new era in which the peoples of the region get rid of fear, hatred, and suffering. If other steps remain to be taken to achieve the comprehensive peace to which we have committed ourselves, this does not belittle the importance of this step and achievement. Each step consolidates the ones taken before it and paves the way for those to follow. The success scored by the peaceloving forces through the agreement we are signing and documenting today must encourage us to implement it honestly and in good faith despite all the difficulties we expect to find along the way, difficulties that we consider only natural. The step should also prompt us to redouble our efforts to achieve tangible progress and without delay on the other negotiating track. By doing this, we will be fulfilling our commitment to our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and we will be performing our responsibilities toward ourselves and our neighbors in the region in which we live. Guests and friends, our belief in the victory of peace has never been shaken for a moment. And it will not be shaken. Our struggle for peace has never stopped for a single day. It didn't take place one year and then not take place the next. It has been a continuous commitment and sharp observers can see that at no time in the past 10 years has it lacked a tangible addition that would help us to mark this achievement, which will continue to inspire our moves for other courageous steps soon. It remains for me to point out that some of those events left greater impact than others along the road of peace. One of those developments was the convening of the Madrid peace conference through the commendable initiative of the United States and Russia, which volunteered to sponsor the conference and found broad response from all the parties to the conflict and from all the peaceloving forces in the world. The conference laid the foundation stone on a long road that was full of thorns and roses at the same time. I believe that it behooves me to express the sincerest thanks and gratitude to U.S. President Bill Clinton and his efficient aides led by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. [applause] President Clinton kept the problem at the forefront of his attentions and priorities despite the urgency of other problems and their daily pressures. This undoubtedly stemmed from his belief that peace in the land of peace and the cradle of religions is the cornerstone of world peace and stability. The Russian Federation under President Boris Yeltsin and his aides [applause], and we particularly mention Foreign Minister Kozyrev [applause], played a tangible role in supporting the peace efforts and in contacting the concerned parties at the critical times. The EC played a role that cannot be belittled. Members exerted every effort to boost the peace process. They acted separately and collectively in the direction that led to completing the steps for the comprehensive and just settlement. This EC policy and concept was not unusual because they realized the mutual links between security and peace in the Middle East and stability and prosperity in Europe. I do not need to express our thanks and gratitude for the Arab brothers who came to participate in this historic celebration, which we do not regard as a mere ceremonial and formal occasion, but as a living symbol of the entire Arab nation's choice of the peace course and its commitment to achieving it. [applause] Due thanks also go to all the other friends who came to join this bright occasion appreciating its importance and expressing their support for its objectives and significance. Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that all of you join me in addressing the sincerest expressions of appreciation and pride to President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. [applause] They have shown much courage and feelings of responsibility and proved that they have a far-sighted view around which has crystallized their determination to attain the goal amid strong challenges and pressures that are no secret to anyone. This is the essence of patriotic and moral commitment. I salute with them this group of men who stood with them all along the course. These men enriched the process and added to it with their sound thinking, sincere work, and creative minds. I mention specifically Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and President Yasir 'Arafat's companions [applause] who shouldered the responsibility with him and performed it perfectly. [applause] Now, my friends, we can cast our eyes on the far horizon and look toward a secure and happy future where the dream turns into a reality and the hope that has thrived in hearts becomes a tangible reality. Doors have been opened, convoys have been set off, and the historic march toward peace in the land of peace has begun. Palestinians and Arabs everywhere, Israeli supporters of right, justice, and life, march forward together. Do not be afraid. Get together. Do not be divided, so that your efforts will not be wasted. It is time to shake hands, cleanse hearts, reassure souls, bring interests closer, and to remove enmity, which spread in the region when time turned its back. It is time for us to direct our human and natural resources to what God has legitimized for us. It is time to reclaim land, mend what wars spoiled, build bridges, and spread development and progress in fields, farms, and factories. It is time to redress wounds, uproot hatred from souls, replace the tendencies of evil and revenge with love and fraternity, and plant roses instead of barbed wire. This is not the choice of an individual or a limited group. It is the option and indisputable, unanimous decision of peoples. It is not the choice of one people to the exclusion of others. It is the choice of all peoples and all those who care for their present and future and realize the challenges. If a people decides to have life, fate will inevitably respond; dark will inevitably vanish and shackles will inevitably break [Arab proverb]. Let us proceed with God's blessing on the road of peace and good neighborliness. May Gad guide us and protect our march. Peace be upon you.
