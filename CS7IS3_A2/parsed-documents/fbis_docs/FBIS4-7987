A statement said the UNPROFOR members "thought they were on Macedonian territory" and were taken to the Yugoslav border watchtower of Slavujevac "before they realized they were on FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] territory." The statement says the blue helmets were allowed to return to Macedonia on the same day after several hours of questioning. UNPROFOR sees this incident as a "minor" one, and believes that its members crossed into Yugoslav territory because of "the confusion over the exact location of the border line."
