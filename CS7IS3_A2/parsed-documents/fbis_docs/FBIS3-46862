Mr Charat said the offer had been confirmed during his visit to Vientiane about three weeks ago by Laotian PM's [Prime Minister's] Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon and the deputy labour and foreign ministers. Concrete pipes could be built to carry the water from rivers across the Mekong River to northern and northeastern river networks in Thailand, he said. Each pipe will cost about 1,000 million baht and could be completed within two years at a length of over 1,000 metres. The 1,000-million-baht cost excludes funding for technology to raise the water so it flows into Thailand to solve the drought problem, he said. Mr Charat said the project would be easier than taking water direct from the Mekong River as this would require permission from Cambodia and Vietnam. The deputy minister cited possible routes for the waterways: -- From the Tha River to the Ing River in Chiang Khong District, Chiang Rai Province which links with the Nan River in Uttaradit Province; -- From the Ngum and Paksan rivers to the branches of the Chi River in either Loei or Nong Khai provinces; -- From the Ngum River to the source of the Phasak River in Phetchabun Province (according to Mr Charat, the Phasak River could feed the water network for the Central Plains) -- From the Thoen River to a branch of the Mun River in Nakhon Phanom Province, and -- From the Se River to the Mun River in Ubon Ratchathani Province. If the proposal is supported by the Thai Government, Laos has agreed to sell the water to Thailand at a per cubic metre rate, he said. Mr Charat said the drought is a problem needing urgent action and Laos wants money to implement projects to develop the country.
