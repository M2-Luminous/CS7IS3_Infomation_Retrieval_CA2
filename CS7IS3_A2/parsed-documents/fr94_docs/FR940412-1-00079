FR940412-1-00079 FR940412-1-00012 Hazard classes used in this part are defined in the following sections of 49 CFR: Hazard Class Definitions 1Class No._description 1Reference Class 1, 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_Explosives §173.50 Class 2_Compressed gas §173.115 Class 3_Flammable liquid §173.120 Class 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_Flammable solid, spontaneously combustible material, dangerous when wet material §173.120 Class 5, 5.1_Oxidizer and organic peroxide §173.127 Class 6.1_Poisonous material §173.132 Class 7_Radioactive material §173.2 §173.403 Class 8_Corrosive material §173.136 Class 9_ Miscellaneous hazardous material §173.140 Hazardous substance is a substance as defined in 49 CFR 171.8. Hold means a space below deck that is used exclusively for the stowage of cargo and that is enclosed by the vessel's decks and sides or permanent steel bulkheads. Hot-molded briquets are briquets of DRI that have been molded at a temperature of 650 ○C (1495 ○F) or higher, or that have a density of 5.0 g/cm3 (312 lb/ft3) or greater. LFL means lower flammable limit. Master includes an authorized representative of the master. Material Safety Data Sheet is as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1200. Potentially Dangerous Material (``PDM'') means a material which, although not specifically falling into a particular hazard class, when carried as a bulk cargo on board a vessel presents sufficient likelihood of developing dangerous conditions which require specific precautions. Materials in this class include those which may cause oxygen depletion in the cargo hold, and those liable to self-heating. Materials which present a potential danger associated solely with their tendency to shift in the cargo hold are not included in this class of material. Readily Combustible Material is as defined in 49 CFR 176.3. Reportable Quantity (RQ) is as defined in 49 CFR 171.8.9 Seed cake means the residue remaining after the vegetable oil has been extracted by a solvent process or mechanically expelled from oil-bearing seeds such as coconuts, cotton seed, peanuts, linseed, etc. Separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from means either a vertical or horizontal separation. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, only horizontal separation, i.e. by a complete cargo compartment or hold, is acceptable. Separated from means in different cargo compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening deck is resistant to fire and liquid, a vertical separation, i.e. in different cargo compartments, is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation. Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from means that vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement. Shipper includes an authorized representative of the shipper. Stowage factor means the number of cubic meters that 1000 kilograms (0.984 long ton) of a bulk solid material will occupy. Surface ventilation means ventilation which is sufficient to remove accumulated gases from the void space above the cargo, but which does not direct air into the body of the cargo.
