According to him, important agreements have been reached. [Churkin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] "I had two main tasks today. First, to make sure that all sides are ready for the very important meeting in Geneva on Thursday. Second, I was trying to find a way out of the deadlock in the talks on economic cooperation between Zagreb and Knin." [Announcer] Churkin expects that all negotiating parties will turn up in Geneva, for -- as he puts it -- the negotiators have an obligation to the world community. [Churkin] "On the second subject, I have an impression that the deadlock in the economic talks has been resolved. I am encouraged that we will soon see the beginning of the talks on economic cooperation, which will immediately come up with concrete economic measures, which will in turn enable further important steps to normalize relations between Zagreb and Knin." [Announcer] Although Churkin announced further talks, the question of the venue and the date for the talks still remains open. [Churkin] "I am not in a position at this point to make an announcement, but I believe that a venue will be found to their mutual satisfaction. As I said, the most important thing is that the deadlock has been resolved." [Announcer] Churkin expects a great deal from the Geneva talks. He believes that the world community is at this point offering the greatest chances for peace, and it is up to the negotiators to accept it. To use his full influence on all parties in the Geneva negotiations, he is to travel to Sarajevo tomorrow for talks with Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak.
