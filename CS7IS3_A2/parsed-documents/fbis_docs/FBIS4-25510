"China always stands for complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and, within this context, the realization of a comprehensive nuclear test ban," the spokesman said. Proceeding from this fundamental position, China has all along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely limited, he said. China fully respects and understands the position and concern of many non-nuclear weapon states on the question of nuclear testing, he said. Right now, the spokesman said, China is actively participating in negotiations on a "comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty", and supports the conclusion of such a treaty no later than 1996 after negotiations. He said the treaty should be a step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. "We call on other nuclear weapon states to give up their policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he said. "We are ready to make continued unremitting efforts with the international community for an early realization of this ultimate goal," the spokesman said.
