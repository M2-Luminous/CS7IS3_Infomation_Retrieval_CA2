First, consigning the issue of the name to the future, and second, settling existing practical problems with Skopje on condition that the irredentist demands in that state's constitutional preamble be taken out and the Veryina star be expunged from its flag. If the conditions on the irredentist terms are fulfilled, Mr. Papandreou is willing to negotiate with K. Gligorov, even if in the past, when he was in the opposition, he had adopted an essentially different position. The needs of the government's tactics in the Balkans are one of the reasons for the readjustment of the country's international alliances. Athens' "Atlantic shift" was obvious from the very first days of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government's accession to power. While since then the conviction that Greek interests are generally served by Washington's policy has remained strong, public statements have been toned down on account of the European reaction and the recognition of the level of dependence of the Greek economy from the EU [European Union]. However, first indications from the other side of the Atlantic raise some questions on the profit-loss relationship resulting from the reorientation of Athens' policy. The "Macedonian" issue is a first criterion. It is expected that the State Department, within the context of the periodic policy review at the beginning of March, will propose to the U.S. Government the establishment of diplomatic relations with Skopje. Additionally, there has been reaction on the part of the United States to the European initiative to establish embassies in the new state. A harbinger of future moves is the decision to create a "liaison office" in Skopje, even if it lacks a diplomatic identity. Be that as it may, Greek credibility diminished after Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou brought certain messages to Washington during his visit there, only to suffer a loss of prestige as soon as he mentioned their content publicly. The questions formulated by the U.S. side were many and have not all been answered. U.S. support was also one of the most significant factors, which was seriously taken into account by the government's diplomatic officials in their efforts to build a "Balkan" role for Greece. The U.S. diplomats who visited Athens recently provoked some disappointment when they characteristically repeated their traditional stance on the very important geopolitical role of Turkey. For itself, Athens maintains its expectations because of Ankara's impossibility to efficiently manage the "fronts" it keeps open around its periphery. However, even today the Greek side has a clear difficulty in describing the "role" that Athens expects to undertake in the Balkans. Of course, certain answers have already been provided: Greek diplomacy now clearly moves within the framework of a general attempt at appeasement and "lower tones." The development of economic relations with neighboring countries acquires higher priority and is seen as the cornerstone of any political influence in the region. At the same time that the logic of the establishment of an axis in the area is being rejected, a more "systemic" approach to intra-Balkan relations is being drawn up, within which is integrated the strategically important relationship with Belgrade, while communications with Croatia and Slovenia are becoming normalized. While these measures constitute the necessary steps to leave the multiconflict period Athens has recently created in the Balkans behind, they are far from representing the description of a "role." The necessary system of goals of Greek foreign policy, the ways and means of implementing them, the acceptable obligations, and the expected competences remain subjects for which answers remains pending....
