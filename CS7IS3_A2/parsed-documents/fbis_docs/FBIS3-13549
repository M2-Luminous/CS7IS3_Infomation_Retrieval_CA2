Hence, issuance of a resolution condemning Israel, too, has been postponed another time. The negligence on the part of the Security Council, in its capacity as an international legislative body, in issuing a condemnation on the tragedy, involving the massacre of scores of innocent human beings, undoubtedly points to a bitter event. This shows the influence and intervention of the United States in this international forum, which is supposed to redress the wrongdoings against world masses. Over the past fortnight, the United States has embarked on a widespread effort to pressure the PLO leaders in a bid to restart the stalemated talks between the PLO and Tel Aviv. Also, by pressuring the Security Council, America has prevented the issuance of even a ceremonial resolution in condemnation of the Zionist regime. Following the massacre in the mosque of prophet Abraham, the PLO, by withdrawing from the talks with Israel, has made resumption of the negotiations subject to fulfilment of a number of conditions. The PLO conditions for returning to the talks call for the presence of armed international observers in the occupied regions, disarmament of the Jews resident in settlements, and guarantee of the Palestinians' security. In the opinion of political observers, these conditions have been set forth for securing the concession from Israel rather than blocking the already stalemated talks process on Gaza and Jerico. However these conditions have come to face an ultimatum from the Washington-Tel Aviv axis. This is why the United States has said that issuance of any resolution in condemnation of Israel will be subject to withdrawal of the conditions set by the PLO leaders. In fact, one has doubts about the U.S. warning given to the PLO leaders that in the event of nonwithdrawal of their conditions, Washington will veto the Security Council resolution. In the opinion of political analysts, efforts are being made so that no concession may be taken from Israel and no mention made in the Security Council resolution of Israeli crimes and breach of human rights in the occupied lands; the subject of Beyt ol-Moqqadas will also be ignored. These are the matters which can well be observed in the Israeli lobby and in its influence in the White House. Irrespective of the type of U.S.-Israel ties, what is regretted by the world public opinion is the UN role in its capacity as the highest authority and as a shelter for the world nations. Regrettably this role, on account of U.S. interventions, aimed at giving a specific direction to it, has been turned into an ineffective one, making the UN a tool of the United States.
