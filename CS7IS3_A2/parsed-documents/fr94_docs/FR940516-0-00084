FR940516-0-00084 FR940516-0-00027 §15.115 TV interface devices, including cable system terminal devices. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* ( i ) For a cable system terminal device or a TV interface device equipped for use with a cable system or a master antenna, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the isolation between the antenna and cable input terminals shall be at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a transfer switch requiring a power source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The provisions of this paragraph regarding frequencies in the range 550 MHz to 806 MHz are applicable as of June 30, 1997. * * * * * (h) Stand-alone switches used to alternate between cable service and an antenna shall provide isolation between the antenna and cable input terminals that is at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz.The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. In the case of stand-alone switches requiring a power source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable as of June 30, 1997. (i) Switches and other devices intended to be used to by-pass the processing circuitry of a cable system terminal device, whether internal to such a terminal device or a stand-alone unit, shall not attenuate the input signal more than 6 dB from 54 MHz to 550 MHz, or more than 8 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable as of June 30, 1997. 5. Section 15.117 is amended by revising paragraph (h) to read as follows: §15.117 TV broadcast receivers. * * * * * (h) For a TV broadcast receiver equipped with a cable input selector switch, the selector switch shall provide, in any of its set positions, isolation between the antenna and cable input terminals of at least 80 dB from 54 MHz to 216 MHz, at least 60 dB from 216 MHz to 550 MHz and at least 55 dB from 550 MHz to 806 MHz. The 80 dB standard applies at 216 MHz and the 60 dB standard applies at 550 MHz. In the case of a selector switch requiring a power source, the required isolation shall be maintained in the event the device is not connected to a power source or power is interrupted. An actual switch that can alternate between reception of cable television service and an antenna is not required for a TV broadcast receiver, provided compliance with the isolation requirement specified in this paragraph can be demonstrated and the circuitry following the antenna input terminal(s) has sufficient band-width to allow the reception of all TV broadcast channels authorized under this chapter. The provisions of this paragraph regarding frequencies in the range 550 MHz to 806 MHz are applicable as of June 30, 1997. 6. New §15.118 is added to read as follows: §15.118 Cable ready consumer electronics equipment. (a) All consumer electronics TV receiving equipment marketed in the United States as cable ready or cable compatible shall comply with the provisions of this section. Consumer electronics TV receiving equipment that includes features intended for use with cable service but does not fully comply with the provisions of this section are subject to the labelling requirements of §15.19(d). (b) Cable ready consumer electronics equipment shall be capable of receiving all NTSC or similar video channels in the frequency range 54 MHz to 804 MHz in accordance with the channel allocation plan set forth in the Electronic Industries Association's ``Cable Television Channel Identification Plan, EIA IS&hyph;132, May 1994'' (EIA IS&hyph;132). This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of EIA IS&hyph;132 may be obtained from: Global Engineering Documents, 2805 McGraw Ave., Irvine CA 92714. copies of EIA IS&hyph;132 may be inspected during normal business hours at the following locations: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Dockets Branch (Room 239), Washington, DC, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (c) Cable ready consumer electronics equipment must meet the following technical performance requirements. Compliance with these requirements shall be determined by performing measurements at the unfiltered IF output port. Where appropriate, the Commission will consider allowing alternative measurement methods. (1) Adjacent channel interference. In the presence of a lower adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual carrier in frequency and 10 dB below the desired visual carrier in amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field and the aural carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be performed for input signal levels of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced channels specified in the EIA IS&hyph;132 channel plan. (2) Image channel interference. Image channel interference within the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the desired channel by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 806 MHz. In testing for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field and the aural carrier should be unmodulated. The undesired test signal shall be a CW signal equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz above the visual carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced channels specified in the EIA IS&hyph;132 channel plan.
