The draft, which consists of three typewritten pages, basically includes a passage saying that the "president exercises general command in the spheres of internal and external security of the state" (Article 34). It provides for the establishment of a new National Security Council, RBN, whose composition and principle activities would be determined by the president (Article 37a, Item 5). The RBN would be "an institution in charge of the state's internal and external security, making decisions on all matters that the Constitution or other law did not delegate to the president's competence or that of other state institutions, or local governments." According to the proposed law, the RBN would decide about: "1. General principles of internal and external security of the state, including those concerning the defense of the Polish Republic. ``2. Basic organizational principles of the Armed Forces and their size, as well as those of civil defense and paramilitary units and other elements of the state's defense system. ``3. Measures intended to heighten combat readiness; it could also come up with proposals to introduce a state of emergency or martial law, and order a mobilization or declare war." The RBN would also be responsible for controlling and supervising the implementation of objectives in the sphere of the general duty of protection. According to the Belvedere's proposals, the RBN's decisions would be "binding for institutions and organizational units to which they were dispatched."
