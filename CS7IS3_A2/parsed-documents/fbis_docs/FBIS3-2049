The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of Educational Development [RCED] of the State Education Commission, is aimed at studying and understanding Comrade Deng Xiaoping thought on education [deng xiao ping tong zhi de jiao yu si xiang 6772 1420 1627 0681 1807 4104 2403 5148 1835 1927], and discussing how to implement the "Outlines of Educational Reform and Development in China". In his speech Li Lanqing said: Education makes up a very important part of the treasure-house and overall strategy of Deng Xiaoping's theory [deng xiao ping li lun bao ku 6772 1420 1627 3810 6158 1405 1655]. In probing ways -- and finding an answer on how to -- solidify, develop, and build socialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always treated education as one of the strategic issues which is of vital importance to the overall situation of China's socialist construction and the historical fate of socialism. He personally took charge of educational work, published a series of brilliant writings and statements, and formed well-developed educational theories with Chinese characteristics and the features of the times, which developed into a scientific theoretical basis and powerful ideological weapon for guiding China's educational reform and development. Li Lanqing said: To lay a solid foundation for the modernization drive, we must make the study of Deng Xiaoping thought on education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang] the component part of the study and implementation of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Leadership at all levels should take the lead and inspire popular enthusiasm for such a study so that education will truly be carried out as a strategic priority of socialist modernization; will serve socialist construction better; and education and socialist construction will -- as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said -- complement one another and advance in harmony. Li Lanqing pointed out: In studying Deng Xiaoping thought on education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang], we should, first of all, study his far-sighted strategic perspective encompassing the overall situation and his approach of stressing, reforming, and developing education from the high plane of socialist construction. On these fundamental issues in particular -- on which the destiny of the state and nations hinges -- Comrade Deng Xiaoping established education as a strategic priority in socialist modernization. He held that we should exercise patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some speed, in order to make a success of educational work. His theses represent not only a major breakthrough in educational theory but also in the theory of socialist construction. Li Lanqing pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's approach to China's educational problems is one that tackles, from the high plane of ideology, theory, and strategy, the issues in terms of direction, course, and general policy; and, at the same time, lays special emphasis on increasing input into education, improving the material benefits and political treatment of intellectuals, and helping solve practical problems like housing shortages faced by teachers. He also proposed that he himself be assigned the job of providing logistics support for the development of education, science and technology, a fact that testifies to his determination as a party leader to solve the numerous practical problems facing education. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has set a glorious example for us. He has taught us by his own actions how to exercise leadership over education and how to make China's education a success. Li Lanqing stressed: We are running the world's largest education enterprise in a poor, economically undeveloped country. We are faced with numerous practical problems. Only by solving these problems one by one in a down-to-earth manner and with perseverance will we be able to ensure quick, sound development of our educational undertakings. Lei Jieqiong and Wang Guangying, vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and leaders of relevant departments including Zhu Kaixuan, Pang Xianzhi, Liu Ji, Li Qi, and Hu Zhaoguang attended the symposium held in the Great Hall of the People. Officials from the Central Party Literature Research Center, the RCED, the Academy of Social Sciences, and Central Party School; scholars and experts from the educational community; and officials from Dalian's Huada Corporation conducted academic exchanges at the symposium.
