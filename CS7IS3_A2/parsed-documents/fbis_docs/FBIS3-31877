For the potentates of this world have been silent, silent in deed, while Vukovar was dying, Dubrovnik bleeding, and no one did anything to save Nustar and Dalj, Skrabrnja and Bjeljina, Mostar and Zadar, Karlovac and Gospic. Belgrade fascists -- who call upon us on the occasion of "normalization" of relations, while their mines and chetniks still kill our people -- have done so much evil and aroused so much hatred, soaked our land with so much blood and suffering. They had a free hand to "calm" former Yugoslavia and tailor-make it for values of the outdated world system, whether a "new" one or suddenly an "old" one, and since they cannot stop, as with every other fascism, for their evil is their sustenance, their evil that lives on other people's happiness and lives, perhaps, only perhaps, the time has come to stop them. [sentence as published] And that is why this "ultimatum" to the Serbs, in spite of all the diplomatic negotiations, games, and child's play of the poor world politics that never had an ounce of morality, is an attempt to stop the horror that brings unease through television to happier homes all over the world. And since it is clear to everybody that we cannot even dream of procedures like putting Great Britain on trial for assisting the genocide (Bosnia-Herzegovina accused Britain on those grounds), and we can therefore not expect to see potentates "of the big world" put on trial, those who only brought shame upon themselves and their countries by talking much without saying anything, while hundreds of thousands of innocent people were injured or killed throughout former Yugoslavia (except in Serbia, of course), but ONE MUST insist on putting on trial, in a new Nuremberg or Tokyo, those who are directly responsible for the war and the horror they arranged. The Mud of Common Destruction If this world wants a future in which, for example, Zhirinovskiy will not be a threat, in contrast to a future that, for the time being, seems to be controlled by people like Milosevic, Husayn, Karadzic, al-Qadhdhafi... then we must do everything to radically change the relations that rule the world today. The victims of the new fascism in the middle of Europe, and Croatia was the first, must provide the nucleus from which a new understanding of the future will originate. We will never be able to arbitrate like a Bill Clinton or a Butrus Butrus-Ghali and really influence global relations. But small as we are, we have an enormous strength as a VICTIM (never mind the fact that, due to Tudjman's politics, we have almost been put in the same basket with the aggressor and gambled away our victim status like a dumb gambler playing roulette) and the strength of justice that is on our side. Fascists like Slobodan Milosevic, madmen like Radovan Karadzic, or mass murderers like Ratko Mladic must not be put in a position where other people will listen to what they have to say. Except in the dock during a fair trial -- that incredible advantage that not a single inhabitant of Vukovar, Sarajevo, or any other miserable person from Josip Jovic onward, did not have. The future of the world, with its interdependence that gives us the chance to snicker at the black U.S. soldier who "took a spill" when disembarking in Somalia and a chance for the French political public to again "shudder with indignation" at the latest massacre in Sarajevo, is not a future that can guarantee peace and progress if fascists go unpunished. The appearance of Zhirinovskiy, the voracity of Belgrade's greater Serbian madness, the possible blood-lust of "mother Russia" for Belarus and other parts of the former Soviet Union (even the "democratic" favorite of the West, Boris Yeltsin, used tanks to destroy his parliament in the name of that very same "democracy"), the starvation in Africa, the silence of China, and the latent Latin-American timebomb -- are a part of the same evil potential that can crush us down into the mud of common destruction. Serbia -- Infectious Patient Croatia must be changed (both its political map and the people who created it, with a shame that should not be shared) and the time has come when it is perhaps discernible that the brutal killing and exile of people who have no way to protect themselves will not be tolerated indefinitely; Croatia must be the part of the "crisis" on the territory of former Yugoslavia that, as an active factor, will stand on firm foundations defending human dignity! Human rights, freedom, the immutability of borders, not permitting the legalization of "ethnic cleansing" (the most horrible conceivable genocide in which the euphemism "cleansing" is no less horrible, as if it were "Dash" or "Ariel" [laundry detergents] and not slaughter and destruction), and punishing the guilty are principles one MUST insist on if we want to break a deadlock that permits the killing of civilians. The road is clear. Serbia must be further and fully isolated, as every infectious patient is. NATO or some other force should be deployed along its borders (even the token contingent of 300 U.S. soldiers have been an effective protection for Macedonia; the Seseljs and Arkans of the Serbian madness can enjoy themselves destroying defenseless towns and civilians, just as every other coward does, but it is unlikely that they would dare to attack the representatives of the world's only real military force), its military potential must be destroyed, its exports and weapons production must be banned for at least another century, a protectorate over Serbia must be introduced, Milosevic (and Cosic, and the members of SANU [Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts], and Karadzic, and Arkan, and their ilk -- there are masses of them...) must be put on trial, and only then, by opening up the media and "normalizing" its inner life, making space for a germ of democracy, we can help that country. It must first repent and pay for its sins and then be given the opportunity to change. And to become democratic. To sober up from its Serbian-ness, from our sea, from Zadar, Plitivice, Vukovar, from all those "Serbian republics" and to start living a dignified life. Resembling Its Enemy Until then, there will be no happiness. The present Serbia, the fascist monster made of crime, the chetnik movement, and the plunderers, will do everything to survive, and in that -- in addition to some ambiguous statements, to say the least, of some minor Russian personalities -- it is helped by this kind of Croatian politics. THERE IS NO "normalization" of relations with fascism, and THERE SHOULD BE NO "normalization" when the rope around the neck of that fascism is tightening still. For, no matter what the "big world" is doing and regardless of the extent of vested interests at stake, interests that tacitly support Serbian crimes, those crimes will not stop. Too much blood has spilt across the borders of Europe and the world, and there is too much blood on the hands of all those Milosevics to be able to tighten the rope without getting blood on our hands too -- whether we "normalize" relations or not. While Serbia is breaking down in misery and moral decay, and while its only strength is the strength of its weapons (which it keeps using against us, taking the whole world for a ride, the world that swore "Never again!" when it was punishing fascists), while there are sanctions and while, for the first time, it is being seriously threatened, Serbia does not deserve anything else but for us to work for its final defeat. That country lost this war long time ago. On human, moral, ethical, military grounds, if you will. And all it has "conquered" are charred remnants of bloodshed and houses and they mirror its chetnik fascism perfectly. Croatia, as its first victim, and therefore historically responsible for the outcome of our "crisis," must not look in that mirror and see that it resembles its enemy. Croatia must regain its allies, be it the Bosnians, the Albanians, the Germans, it does not matter, by re-establishing just relations on which future good neighborly relations with Serbia will be founded. There will be no justice and happiness if we contribute to Milosevic's "conference-making" in Geneva, etc., instead of in Nuremberg, and, to save the best for last, round off the journey Milosevic, the high representative of the occupier, began a long time ago in Split, on the island of Brijuni talking to Mr. Tudjman, with a possible visit to Zagreb, on the same road of "normalization" Zeljko Simic, FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] deputy prime minister, paved on our wounded land, as a guest of the Republic of Croatia.
