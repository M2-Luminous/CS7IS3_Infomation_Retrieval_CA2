Carter is set to visit Pyongyang Wednesday morning through Panmunjom to discuss the nuclear issue with the North Korean leadership. During the talks over dinner that lasted two and half an hours, President Kim pointed out that the nuclear question has arrived at a critical stage because of Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A source said the president explained to Carter about the Seoul government's firm stance toward the nuclear situation. President Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear development should be thwarted by all means and that if Pyongyang presses ahead with nuclear development, sanctions through the United Nations would be unavoidable, he said. The source said that President Kim asked the former U.S. President to convey Seoul's concern and position with regard to North Korea's announced withdrawal from the IAEA, and to successfully persuade the North Koreans to respond affirmatively to international demands. Former President Carter was learned to have explained about the purpose of his visit to Pyongyang and promised to relay Seoul's position to Pyongyang correctly. After the meeting, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the meeting was held in an amicable atmosphere, adding, however, that Kim and Carter decided not to disclose the contents of their talks. According to Chu, Carter said he would not discuss his mission prior to his visit to Pyongyang, but would explain about the feelings he would have during his talks with North Korean leaders when he returns to Seoul from the North. On Wednesday morning, Carter would meet Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku before leaving for Pyongyang via Panmunjom. He would return to Seoul Saturday morning and meet with President Kim.
