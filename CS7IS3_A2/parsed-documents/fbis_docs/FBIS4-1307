FBIS4-1307 "drafr080_cs94005" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Stations Under 24-Hour Watch Stations Under 24-Hour Watch MB2604070994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2139 GMT 25 Apr 94 MB2604070994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Marianne Merten] [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- An average of five security force personnel will be deployed at each of about 9,000 voting stations in this week's elections, Electoral Commissioner Zac Yacoob said on Monday [25 April]. He told a press briefing at the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] Midrand nerve centre 10 to 15 people would be deployed at voting stations in some areas, including the Western Transvaal. On average, two people would guard each voting station at night. Security force members might "not be apparent" at the stations, he said. A total of 65,000 security force members would be deployed. South African Defence Force [SADF] Communications Chief Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said the response to a Citizen Force call-up had not been as good as expected. On the reporting dates of April 15 and 22, only about 43 per cent of those expected turned up. This meant those who reported would have to serve 60 days instead of the planned 30 days. "We are thinly stretched," Gen Opperman said. However, about 80 SADF companies would be deployed to support police, he added. Mr Yacoob said bomb blasts since Sunday would not prevent the elections. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said the blasts would not prevent the elections being free and fair, although they might cause a low turn-out at the polls. The IEC would declare the elections substantially free and fair on the basis of franchise provisions. These included the percentage of the electorate who voted, the percentage of spoiled papers showing an inability of voters to understand the procedure and the question of "gross societal intimidation". Other factors were the extent of free and fair electioneering and "how no-go the no-go areas were". Gen Opperman said the security forces appreciated the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the elections. Mr Justice Kriegler said the IFP's decision had minimised opportunities for violence.
