A generation after the communists captured Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, refugee camps dot Southeast Asia. The existence of these camps, and the people in them, sorely test the very concept of refugees. When the first Indochinese fled in 1975, they were fleeing violence, and either the real or perceived oppression they felt would occur from new regimes. In short, they left their countries because of fear. They were welcomed, or at least accepted, in neighbouring countries such as Thailand. The sympathy for refugees was clear, and it was warranted. Today, it is a far different story. The three Indochina countries-- especially Vietnam and Laos -- are settled. All of these nations and their regimes have rejoined the world community. They deal with day-to-day problems like any other nation. Small battles still erupt in Cambodia, and when these occur at a border, it is natural that the innocent flee across the frontier to safety. But none of the three countries is embroiled in war. No large segments of the Indochina populations are singled out for oppression by any of the three governments. It is, therefore, possible to understand the Hmong, Lao, Vietnamese and Khmer refugees in Thailand and elsewhere who are reluctant to return home. The lands they left were in turmoil, and many of the refugees feared for their lives. The dread of jail, "reeducation," forced separation of families and even worse caused the refugees to pack up and move. Since then, they have effectively lived in a closed society. Rumour and hearsay about their homelands have been the predominant form of information. It is impossible, however, to sympathize with their claims to remain in their refugee camps or emigrate elsewhere. Their times of trouble have ended. The refugees are mistaking the warmhearted and compassionate asylum they once received with some sort of worldwide social welfare programme. There is little doubt that many would have been victims of vengeful regimes at home in the past. But 19 years after the fall of Saigon, there is clearly no such danger. It is past time for the Indochina refugees to pick up their lives again, in their own countries. This task must be handled gently, but it must be handled. The few violent and militant refugees aside, humane officials must convince the Indochinese it is in their own interest to resume normal lives. It is to be expected that a tiny minority of the refugee camps will react angrily to repatriation. In the Vietnamese refugee camps of Galang, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, fighting, fasting and self-immolation has occurred. This is regrettable, and such acts must be carefully regulated. Outsiders have manipulated Hmong refugees in Thai camps with baseless rumours of actions both by the Thai and Laotian governments. Such actions must be overcome with information and truth, rather than force. At the same time, it is vital for the refugees as well as neighbouring nations that these problems are, indeed, overcome. It is a mistake for the former refugees to believe they can continue to receive special treatment. Only true victims of great political or natural upheavals should expect such attention from others. The continuing claims of the Indochinese upon the limited resources of their neighbours and the world cheapens the true meaning of "refuge" as a reliable haven from such misfortunes. Thailand continues to award refugee status to both Burmese and Khmers who flee any current fighting in their homeland. The Indochinese who have been "refugees" for so many years effectively endanger even such logical aid to innocent people. Voluntary repatriation of Indochinese should be pressed vigorously. The men and women in Southeast Asian camps may apply for emigration to other countries. But if this fails, they must accept -- as all other world citizens -- that returning to their homeland is the only possible option. Their dislike of their own regime should drive them to try to change it, if they wish. That is what dissatisfied citizens of all countries must do. The claim to special status by the Indochinese is unwarranted, in the end. Their great wars and political shocks have ended. It is time for both the refugees and those who have given them refuge in their time of turmoil and need to get on with their normal lives.
