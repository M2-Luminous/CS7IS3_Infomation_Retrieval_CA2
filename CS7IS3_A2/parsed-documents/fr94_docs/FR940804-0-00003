FR940804-0-00003 FR940804-0-00001 As noted, section 106 contains an exception permitting a bank to tie a product to a traditional bank product offered by that same bank. The Senate Report accompanying section 106 states that the traditional bank product exception was intended to preserve a customer's ability to negotiate the price of multiple banking services with the bank on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with the bank. S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 16&hyph;17 (1970). The Board believes that it is consistent with this stated statutory purpose for a bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on packages of traditional bank products when one of the component products in the package is offered by an affiliate. Since 1970 and 1971, there has been a substantial increase in the number of affiliates in bank holding company organizations and the extent of specialization of these affiliates, which has led to customers obtaining traditional bank products from multiple affiliates, both bank and nonbank. Adoption of the proposed rule will be consistent with the purposes of section 106 by allowing a customer to negotiate the price of multiple traditional banking services on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with a bank holding company organization, as opposed to just a single bank within such an organization. By allowing bank holding companies to package traditional bank products offered by multiple subsidiaries, the exception also will increase the efficiency with which bank holding companies can deliver those products. Several commenters explained that the existing rule had created a disincentive for bank holding companies to consolidate a given traditional bank product in one affiliate (and thereby lose the exemption for that activity), as opposed to offering the product through all its subsidiary banks (retaining the exemption at each bank but forfeiting efficiency gains). Adoption of the proposed exception to section 106 will not only permit bank holding companies to offer products more efficiently but also will allow their customers to benefit. Customers will be able to realize cost savings when they obtain traditional bank products from two or more subsidiaries of a bank holding company instead of just one. Because the inter-affiliate traditional bank product exception will allow bank holding company affiliates to offer customers a more favorable price on packages of banking products, thereby relieving bank holding companies of a competitive disadvantage and benefitting their customers, the Board has concluded that the amendment is consistent with the purposes of section 106 and should be adopted. Several commenters requested an expansion of the proposed exception to include inter-affiliate arrangements in which the tying product is a non-traditional bank product and the tied product is a traditional bank product. The Board has decided not to extend the statutory traditional bank product exception to inter-affiliate tying involving non-traditional bank products at this time. However, in a separate notice, the Board is proposing to amend the tying restrictions of Regulation Y to permit any discount arrangement that involves only nonbank affiliates. Discounts on Securities Brokerage Services In December 1993, the Board approved an exemption for a brokerage subsidiary of a bank to offer a discount on brokerage services to its customers who maintain a minimum balance in an account at the bank or any affiliated bank. First Union Corporation, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 166 (1994). The Board concluded that the requested exemption was consistent with the legislative purpose of section 106 (to prevent banks from using their economic power to engage in anticompetitive practices) and the legislative purpose of the Board's exemptive authority (to allow appropriate traditional banking practices based on sound economic analysis). In its order, the Board found that the market for retail brokerage services was national in scope and highly competitive, making it unlikely that any of these banks_or any other provider of brokerage services_could exercise sufficient market power in brokerage services to impair competition in the market for traditional banking services. As part of the order, the Board required that the two products in the arrangement be separately available for purchase by the customer, noting that under antitrust precedent, concerns about tying are substantially reduced when the buyer is free to take either product by itself. The Board is adopting substantially as proposed an amendment to Regulation Y making this exemption available to all bank holding companies. This amendment will permit any bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on brokerage services if a customer obtains a traditional bank product from any affiliate. The regulatory exception is conditioned on the brokerage services and traditional bank products offered in the arrangement being separately available for purchase by the customer. Commenters overwhelmingly favored the proposed amendment. Commenters stated that the regulatory exception would promote fair competition with nonbank competitors and would result in cost savings and other benefits to customers. A securities industry association opposed the proposed exception because it believed that the exception would increase customer confusion by reinforcing the false impression that brokerage services offered by banks are insured by the federal government. However, the recent inter-agency statement on retail sales of non-deposit investment products specifies steps that banks should take to prevent confusion, including informing customers in writing that the products are not federally insured, are not deposits or other obligations of the institution and are not guaranteed by the institution, and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal. In addition, the statement restricts where an institution may offer non-deposit investment products. The Board believes that this statement satisfactorily addresses any possibility of an increase in customer confusion about coverage of federal deposit insurance where banks offer brokerage services as part of a package arrangement. A few commenters requested that the Board clarify that ``brokerage services'' refers to ``securities brokerage services'' and that securities brokerage services include related incidental services as authorized by Regulation Y. These technical changes are consistent with the intent of the proposed rule, and will be included in the final rule. Some commenters requested that the Board grant an exception permitting a bank or a bank holding company to vary the consideration charged for a traditional bank product, such as a deposit service, based on a customer's purchase of brokerage services_the converse of the proposed exception. The Board believes that this proposal should be evaluated in the context of a specific exemption request. One such request has been published for comment. Fleet Financial Group, Inc., 59 FR 9,216 (February 25, 1994). A few commenters sought an interpretation that ties involving mutual funds were either wholly or partially exempt from section 106, either because mutual funds are not bank holding company subsidiaries or because mutual fund products constitute trust services and therefore qualify as traditional bank products. The Board intends to address this issue separately.
