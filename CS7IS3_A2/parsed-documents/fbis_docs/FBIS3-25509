The paper last week published a story revealing how Muluzi, favoured to win May 17 presidential race, was jailed for six months for stealing government funds 25 years ago while working as a civil servant. The newspaper is a mouthpiece of the opposition Alliance for Democracy Party, while Muluzi is leader of the United Democratic Front Party. "Since the story was published, we have received more than 15 serious death threats through telephones and written messages," editor Charles Simango told AFP Friday. He said he was not surprised with the threats, but added "we had overwhelming evidence" to back up the story. "The paper remains unshaken as long as we report the truth," Simango said. Muluzi, former right-hand man of President Kamuzu Banda, told another newspaper THE NATION that the MALAWI DEMOCRATIC had "sinister intentions to make the people of Malawi discredit me." Muluzi, who comes from the majority south, said: "It is upon the people of Malawi to decide whether they want me as a leader or not." Observers say the newspaper revelations have damaged his standing. A two-day constitutional conference beginning February 21 is likely to recommend that presidential candidates must not criminal records of dishonesty, a source in the national consultative council told AFP. [sentence as received] The council, which includes representatives from all political parties and manages Malawi's transition to democratic pluralism, has been writing a new constitution which will adopted during the conference.
