Cf. early brief report in JPRS-CST-94-001, 24 Jan 94 p 31] [Abstract] The first domestic development of a utilitarian Er-doped fiber optical amplifier (EDFA) module prototype using a 40-mW, 980-nm-wavelength laser diode (LD) as the pump source and a parametrically optimized Er[.sup]3+[/]/Al[.sup]3+[/] co-doped optical fiber is reported. Module net gain at 1550 nm is 25 dB, saturated output power is 0 dBm, maximum output power is 8 dBm, noise figure is less than 5 dB, and optical bandwidth is greater than 40 nm--values comparable to early-90s international standards as reported in references 3-5. These modules were jointly developed by Qinghua University, the CAS Institute of Semiconductors, the 863 Optoelectronics Fabrication Center, and MEI's Institute 46, and are designed for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) fiber optic transmission systems and optical soliton transmission systems. Figures 1-4, not reproduced, show the following: a schematic of the EDFA module, consisting of a fiber coupler, an isolator, the LD, a WDM coupler, a control unit, a power supply, a fiber splice, the Er-doped fiber, and another fiber coupler; a graph of EDFA module gain vs signal output power; a graph of EDFA module output power vs input power; and a graph of EDFA module bandwidth (net gain vs signal wavelength), respectively. There are no tables. References: 1. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN [HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS], 1991,(10):1. 2. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN, 1992, 2(12):l0. 3.
