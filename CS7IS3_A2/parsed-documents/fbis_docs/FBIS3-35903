The ministry is particularly concerned since Mr. Churkin's statement and responses to questions are but the latest in a series of appearances and articles by high-level Russian officials. Estonia hopes that Mr. Churkin's statements do not represent a new, even more confrontational and threatening line in Russian foreign policy vis-a-vis the Baltic States. The ministry agrees with Mr. Churkin statement that "the Baltic states have a vital stake in the successful completion and final victory of democracy and implementation of market and economic reforms in Russia." There is nothing the Baltic states wish more than good neighbourly relations with their big neighbour to the east, peaceful relations which ensure the security, sovereignty and prosperity of all parties and, indeed, of all of Europe, the ministry said. Estonia would like to view Russia as a normal state which meets normal international requirements and criteria. One obvious requirement is that Russia being a large country refrained from making statements which make its smaller neighbors nervous about Russia's true geo-political intentions. Other obvious criteria, such as the unconditional withdrawal of troops stationed on the territory of other nations against their will, should be met. Moscow's policy of seeking and creating special zones of interest and thereby, in practical terms, denying full sovereignty to its neighbors must stop. Russia should also stop denying basic human rights to Estonian citizens living under its jurisdiction. While Estonia welcomes Mr. Churkin's "disapproval" of the events of 1940, the fact that he does not consider the Soviet take-over of the Baltic states "annexation or aggression or occupation" leaves out the most important legal and historical dimension of those events. Mr. Churkin's statement and responses to questions contain numerous misstatements and errors of fact to which the ministry intends to respond in more detail. For a small nation, in the face of constant imperialistic-sounding threats and the continued presence of foreign occupation troops on its soil, to protect its sovereignty through all legal and peaceful means available cannot be viewed as "confrontational" in any sense of the word. Estonia has shown patience and good will and made many concessions in order to solve the problems it inherited from fifty years of Soviet occupation. The fact that Russian officials completely disregard Estonian efforts and instead keep up a barrage of propagandistic attacks and thinly veiled threats of military action does not help to build confidence or to ensure stability.
