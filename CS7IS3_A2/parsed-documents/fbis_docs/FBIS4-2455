"The police investigations of Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng continue," a ministry spokesman told AFP. An investigation of Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, is also underway, he added. The spokesman did not indicate why the three dissidents were being held or where they were. But the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said Monday that Xu had been detained by police for having "violated the terms of his parole." Xu, 49, leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing, was released on parole in May 1993 after 12 years in prison. The dissident was initially picked up on Thursday, on the arrival of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in Beijing. He was released, but was again arrested Friday, his wife, Kang Tong, said. His arrest comes a week after his friend and another leading dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was detained on accusations of having "committed new crimes." Wei received a 14-year sentence for his role in the Democracy Wall movement. Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, was detained Monday in Beijing. "China public security organs summoned Xu Wenli according to law for he has violated relevant regulations on parole," a spokesman from the ministry told AFP. "This entirely falls within China's sovereignty and has nothing to do with China's relations with other countries," the spokesman said. The arrest attracted considerable international attention, coming as it did during Balladur's visit to China, which ended in Shanghai on Sunday.
