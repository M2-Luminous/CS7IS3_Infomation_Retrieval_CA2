He said if all Aids patients were to be admitted to hospitals, then it would mean that patients suffering from curable diseases would not get hospital beds. He said Aids patients in the country were 35,000 while HIV positive cases had reached 800,000. The Minister, who was moving a motion seeking the Â£109,986.945 for the year 1993/94 said if the Government continued admitting Aids patients in hospitals, then it meant that those suffering from the common diseases would have to die in their homes. Mr Angatia, who is also the Malava MP, said health care programmes had been introduced and that district health management boards will now be allowed to use 75 per cent of money collected in the cost- sharing to purchase medicines. He said the Government was advising the Nairobi City Council on step to take to run its clinics on a 24-hour basis, to avoid congestion at Kenyatta National Hospital. He disclosed that Pumwani Nyayo Wards will be opened soon and that the Infectious Diseases Hospital commonly known as IDH will be converted into a district hospital. Seconding the motion, the Minister for Labour, Mr Philip Masinde, said too much money was being used in maintaining ambulance vehicles. He cited cases where a battery could go down in a car leading to its grounding. He said the cost of medical attention had shot up and that Kenyans could no longer afford to get sick. He said some hospitals were demanding as high as Sh16,000 admission fee.
