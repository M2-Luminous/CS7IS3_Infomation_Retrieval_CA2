The pickets that are held now are a form of struggle against a colonial empire, said Juri Adams, deputy leader of the Estonian National Independence Party faction in the parliament. MP [member of parliament] K. Jaak Roosaare called on the Russian military to come out of the house and speak before the picketers. The Estonian MP's appeal met with no response, however. The Estonian National Independence Party has said the Monday pickets in front of the house that is situated just on the foot of the Toompea Hill, some 200 meters from the residence of the Estonian Government and the parliament, will continue until the last Russian soldier has left the country.
