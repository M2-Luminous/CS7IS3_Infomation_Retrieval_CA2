FR940603-0-00129 FR940603-0-00029 The NCUA Board agrees that in the vast majority of cases regional staff have sufficient financial information available to make a determination as to the economic advisability of the proposed charter change. Therefore, the requirement to submit financial statements with a charter change request has been deleted. If a regional office needs additional information, it may ask for it. The NCUA Board also agrees that the requirement for letterhead stationery can be relaxed. With regard to the requirement that an ``official representative'' of the group sign the letter requesting service, the Board does not believe a change in the wording is needed, but will ensure that the regional offices are instructed to be more flexible in applying the term to specific situations. X. The Proposed ``File and Serve'' Procedure A. Comments The proposal requested comment on a ``File and Serve'' select group expansion procedure. It was envisioned that the procedure would permit CAMEL code 1 and 2 credit unions to begin providing service to small groups_50 persons or fewer was suggested_prior to formal NCUA approval of the expansion. Thirty-six commenters favored the procedure. These commenters believed it would allow credit unions to timely serve new groups. However, some commenters suggested an increase in the number of potential members that could be added using the procedure. One commenter inquired whether the number included family members. Four commenters recommended NCUA issue guidelines on what to do if the expansion is subsequently denied by the Region. Eighteen commenters objected to the ``File and Serve'' proposal. The reasons were varied. Nine commenters stated there were no procedures for what would happen if the expansion was denied by the Region and that it would be an administrative nightmare if a denial occurred. Eight commenters believed this proposal was not justified since regulatory delay in approving expansion requests was not a problem. Six commenters believed that there would be more conflicts arising from both intentional and unintentional overlaps. Five commenters stated that regulatory approval distinguishes credit unions from banks. Three commenters suggested any CAMEL code 1, 2 and 3 credit unions be permitted to use the file and serve procedure. One commenter suggested that NCUA implement an alternative procedure by which CAMEL code 1 and 2 credit unions should be given preference by NCUA in reviewing field of membership expansions. Two commenters specifically objected to the procedure's being tied to a CAMEL rating. Four commenters recommended that all credit unions should be able to use the file and serve procedure. One of these commenters suggested NCUA could then restrict the file and serve authority on a case-by-case basis for any credit union it had concerns about. One commenter recommended adding a requirement that the filing credit union have to state that there was no overlap or existing eligibility for membership in another credit union for the group to be served. B. NCUA Board Decision Many of the commenters' suggestions have been incorporated into the final IRPS. The new policy will permit well operated federal credit unions in good standing with NCUA to apply for charter amendments which authorize the credit unions to make use of a streamlined process for adding small occupational groups currently without credit union service. The initial maximum number of persons in a group to be added under this procedure has been set initially by the NCUA Board at 100. The Board may be resolution adjust that number from time to time as appropriate. XI. Other Procedures for Reviewing Field of Membership Addition Requests A. Comments The proposal sought to clarify the mechanics of requesting additions to a federal credit union's field of membership. Four commenters believed that the approval time on select employee group additions was excessive. Another commenter stated that the field of membership expansion procedure was burdensome and should be streamlined. Two commenters supported NCUA's goal of approving or denying field of membership expansion requests within the ``10 business day or less'' time frame. One commenter stated that, in regard to charter amendments, once NCUA approves one, the board of directors of the credit union should not subsequently have to adopt it to make it effective. Two commenters stated that pre-notification of a proposed field of membership expansion in another credit union's operating area should be a common courtesy. Three commenters believed the final IRPS should provide at a minimum for some form of publication and hearings or period of comment relative to an expansion of any credit union's field of membership. B. NCUA Board Decision The NCUA Board believes that a ten-business-day turnaround for field of membership amendment requests is reasonable. All regions have automated the review process so that this time frame should be exceeded only in extraordinary cases. The Board strongly believes, however, that a federal credit union's board needs to be involved in the process_after all, the board is responsible for the institution's overall direction and control. There are adequate procedures a federal credit union can put in place to ensure that needed board oversight can be maintained without delaying initiation of service to a group.
