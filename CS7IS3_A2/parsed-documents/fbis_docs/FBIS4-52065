To provide our people with a more wonderful and cultural living condition, the supreme commander General Kim Chong-il has himself initiated the building of the Nungna suspension bridge. He has shown a great trust by entrusting this honorable task to the soldiers of the Korean People's Army unit to which Comrade (Kang Chin-sop) belongs. All the soldiers, boundlessly encouraged by supreme commander General Kim Chong-il's great trust and warm affection, have been registering new upsurges day in and day out in the building of the bridge . The soldiers have already finished within a short period of time the large-scale construction, including setting up the bridge's piers and (?erecting beams). They have set a goal to build several crane units on their own by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to resolve everything with one's own strength even if the higher echelons do not supply the necessities, although it would be better if the higher echelons did supply them. They have achieved a breakthrough in the construction by finally building the cranes, while actively seeking out inner reserves, putting together strength and wisdom, and successfully solving pending technical problems. At the present moment, the soldiers are markedly increasing the speed of the construction with a high conviction of victory.
