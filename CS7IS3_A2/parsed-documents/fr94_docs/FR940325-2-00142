FR940325-2-00142 FR940325-2-00057 B. Scope of the Proposed Final Judgments The Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment applies to the hospital defendants, as well as to each of their trustees, officers, directors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns, and to all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who shall have received actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Final Judgment, any person who becomes a trustee, officer, director, administrator, chief financial officer, non-clerical human resources and compensation staff member, director of nursing, or nurse recruiter within 5 years after the entry of the Final Judgment shall be furnished a copy of the Final Judgment. The USHHRA and UHA Final Judgments have applicability and notification provisions similar to those of the Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment. C. Effect of the Proposed Final Judgments on Competition The relief in the proposed Final Judgments is designed to ensure that hospitals in Salt Lake County establish their registered-nurse wages independently and that registered nurses receive competitive wages. Specifically, the injunction against exchanges of current and prospective wages and budget information and the reporting requirements of Section IV and Section VI of the Hospital Defendants' Final Judgment are designed to eliminate restraints on wage competition among hospitals in Salt Lake County. The injunction against conducting or facilitating the exchange of information concerning the compensation paid to nurses and the reporting requirements of Sections IV and VI of both the USHHRA and UHA Final Judgments are designed to preclude those organizations from being forums or means for hospitals to exchange nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about registered nursing wages. The Department of Justice believes that these proposed Final Judgments contain adequate provisions to prevent further violations of the type described in the Complaint and to remedy the effects of the alleged conspiracy. IV Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgments will neither impair nor assist the bringing of such actions. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the Judgments have no prima facie effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against the defendants in this matter. V Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Judgments As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person beliving that the proposed Final Judgments should be modified may submit written comments to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., room 9903, Washington, DC 20001, within the 60-day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and published in the Federal Register . All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed judgment at any time prior to entry. Section I of each of the proposed Final Judgments provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Final Judgments. VI Alternative to the Proposed Final Judgments The alternative to the proposed Final Judgments would be a full trial of the case against the defendants. The Department of Justice believes that such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted since the proposed Final Judgments provide the relief that the United States seeks in its Complaint. VII Determinative Materials and Documents No materials and documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Judgments. Dated: Respectfully submitted, Edward D. Eliasberg, Jr. Karen L. Gable Jesse M. Caplan Kenneth M. Dintzer Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, 555 4th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001, 202/307&hyph;0808.
