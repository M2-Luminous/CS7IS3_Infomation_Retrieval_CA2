During his talks with visiting Congolese President Pascal Lissouba this afternoon, Jiang said that the current visit of Lissouba witnessed the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Congolese diplomatic ties, and as prime minister, Lissouba made efforts in this regard 30 years ago. Jiang said that he was convinced that the visit would further Sino-Congolese bilateral understanding, and push their relations to a high level. He spoke highly of the efforts the Congolese people had made under the leadership of the president to find the political and economic structures conforming to the country's domestic situation. The Chinese Government appreciated Lissouba's view that democracy must go along with the Congo's traditional culture, and that the country's development needs stability, Jiang said. He also expressed his satisfaction with the effective cooperation between China and The Congo, adding that China attached great importance to the bilateral ties. "The Chinese people, along with Congolese people, would strengthen the bilateral cooperation in different fields on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," he added. Jiang also expressed his appreciation for The Congo's "one China" stand, and support for China's re-entry to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. There was great potential in China-Congo two-way trade, he said. Lissouba said that social stability and peace were both important to economic development. He said that one purpose of his visit was to learn how the Chinese people had made their economic achievement. "The Congo, with rich resources to be developed, welcomes Chinese enterprises to cooperate with Congolese counterparts," he said. After the talks, Jiang and Lissouba were present at the signing of an agreement under which the Chinese Government will provide credit to The Congo. It was signed by Yang Wensheng, Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and Clement Mouamba, Congolese minister of planning and economy. Before the talks, Jiang held a greeting ceremony for Lissouba. Among those present at the greeting ceremony were Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of the state commission for restructuring the economy, Lu Jiaxi, vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, Lu Min, vice-chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Huang Qitao, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission.
