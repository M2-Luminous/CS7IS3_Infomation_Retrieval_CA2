FBIS4-18280 "drweu063_i_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 FRANCE Deputies Call For Giraud's Dismissal Deputies Call For Giraud's Dismissal BR0104132794 Paris LE FIGARO in French 31 Mar 94 p 7 BR0104132794 Paris LE FIGARO French BFN [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Rally for the Republic Calls For Giraud's Head"] [Excerpt] [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur yesterday decided purely and simply to withdraw the "youth job training contract" [CIP] and to replace it with a scheme giving aid to companies providing young people with their first job. Moreover, he announced that an interministerial committee on youth would be held on 26 April. The withdrawal of the CIP is aimed at calming social unrest -- a demonstration will be held this afternoon in Paris in response to a call made by all the trade union organizations -- and also at placating the anger being manifested by the majority. While in principle you do not change a winning team, it is nonetheless necessary, for reasons of appeasement, to change one that is losing. What is true in sport is also true in politics. On the eve of the Paris demonstration against the CIP, the deputies of the majority, and in particular those of the RPR, brandished pitchforks and pickaxes to pillory the ministers they hold responsible for the street demonstrations and the increasing ill-humor of the French people. As they see it, at least one head must roll: that of Labor Minister Michel Giraud, who stands accused of having inflamed the universities and the suburbs with his "controversial" decrees instituting the CIP.
