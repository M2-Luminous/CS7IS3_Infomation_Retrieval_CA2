FR941130-1-00010 FR941130-1-00001 This section should also be amended by adding a paragraph (e) to provide authority for the committee to accept advance assessment payments from handlers. Although handlers could make advance payments of assessments at any time, the provision would be most needed by the committee when its funds were short. The committee could send a request to handlers for voluntary advance assessment payments. Prepayments would be credited toward assessments levied against that handler during that fiscal period. A question raised at the hearing was whether the committee should have authority to offer a small discount, such as one percent, to any handler who made advance assessment payments. The witness testifying on the proposal to authorize advance payments declined to answer the question. No witness offered evidence that supported such a discount as a routine procedure. The committee manager testified that he would support a discount in case of emergency. Therefore, due to the lack of record evidence and because such discounted assessment rate is contrary to both ยง945.42 Assessments language and the providing of one uniform assessment rate on all first handlers (which shall be such handler's pro rata share of the committee's approved expenses), it is determined that such discount should not be authorized. The committee should be authorized to borrow money on a short term basis in case of an extreme emergency, such as a disastrous year regarding potato production, to continue normal operations. The authority to borrow money is not intended to permit the committee to obligate itself to borrow large sums of money over an extended period of time. Such borrowing should only be used when necessary to meet financial obligations when operating reserve funds are inadequate and until sufficient assessment revenue could be generated to repay the loan and meet other financial obligations necessary to insure continued operation of the order. The loan should be repaid by the end of the next fiscal period. Any such borrowed money would only be used to meet the committee's current financial obligations. It is hereby recommended that ยง945.42 of the order be amended to include the above provisions. (7) Section 945.52 Issuance of regulations should be amended by revising paragraph (a)(3) to add authority to require accurate and uniform marking and labeling of the containers in which production area potatoes are shipped. Such authority would help interested persons more readily identify such shipments and help buyers in managing inventory and marketing the potatoes. These advantages can foster buyer satisfaction. The industry has had problems of confusion from count cartons being sold without the size being marked on the container. Section 945.341 (c) Pack specifies the size, count (number of potatoes needed to fill a 50-pound container), and allowable weight range of each potato therein. Information was provided that such unmarked cartons have been sold at inflated prices by wholesalers who misrepresented the contents as larger and more valuable potatoes. An example is unmarked cartons of 100 count potatoes which were sold by the wholesaler as larger 90 count because 90 count was what the end user had requested. The end users complained because they did not receive the larger potatoes and were overcharged for the smaller ones. Thus, wholesalers were getting paid a higher price by misrepresenting potatoes as a larger size. This practice has damaged the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry in three ways_it deprives the handler of the higher price that should be paid him/her by the wholesaler for the larger potatoes, it harms the industry's high quality reputation and it creates a dissatisfied end user. Such confusion and damage to the industry and consumers would be eliminated by authorizing requirements for accurate markings on containers.
