The Kazakhstan President Wants To Remember Only the Good Things" -- place, date not given] [Excerpts] [Portnikov] Nursultan Abishevich, the full text of your project on creating a Eurasian union has been published. Has there been any initial response to this document, and, generally, what sort of response do you expect knowing the reaction that your initiative has provoked? [Nazarbayev] There has been some reaction from the international democratic movement in Russia. Mr. Smirnov, organizing committee chairman, sent a cable advising that on 18 June a special forum will be held in support of this undertaking. Today there was a phone call from Sergey Shakhray who congratulated me, saying that he had read the full text in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Thanks to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for that. He fully approves of the text of this project and proposes to hold a special conference on the 14th that will be attended by leading politicians of Russia, including leaders of the Federal Assembly. My deputy chief of staff and the deputy premier in charge of these matters will go there. Prior to this there was a conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, to whom I had earlier sent the document, and he stated his support. This seems to be all so far but still not much time has passed; some people thought that I just made an impromptu statement in Moscow speaking before chief editors in Moscow University. But in fact, this is an idea I have been contemplating for a long time. No one can be content with the CIS that we have today. Some 400 documents that are not being implemented. I am not saying that the CIS is not serving its purpose and that it must be disbanded. It must be good to have something rather than nothing. But the CIS is moving in one direction, and life in another. Now there are 65 posts on the border between Russia and Kazakhstan which look very much like border checkpoints, not customs houses, and I want to issue an edict unilaterally removing all customs barriers in the direction of Russia. I propose to put in place normal supra-national coordinating bodies. There should be no fear that sovereignty will be lost, and so forth. It is generally believed that common sovereignty is superior to each separate sovereignty of a particular state, and that it is more useful. If there is a Eurasian Union Executive Committee empowered to oversee the implementation of our documents; if there is a body empowered to apply sanctions for failure to observe an accord; if there is a real common economic space; and if we lift customs barriers, multinational companies and joint ventures will emerge, and producers will find their own way around. It is only essential not to choke off this way to them. [passage omitted] [Portnikov] After your meeting in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and then after your official visit to Kiev; following your meeting in Ashkhabad with Eduard Shevardnadze, and then after your contacts with him in Moscow, some observers and politicians got the impression that a new axis of states, as it were, is being created, setting themselves somewhat against the growing influence and pressure from Russia. On the other hand, there are your contacts with your Central Asian colleagues. Regional integration here is also perceived in Russia as an alternative to the processes under way in the CIS and around Russia. To what extent do you think this perception is correct? [Nazarbayev] I know about such talk. Some time ago the question of a Baltic-Black Sea belt was aired very broadly. I would like to say that Kazakhstan must never, and will never, engage in any intrigues against Russia. This does not respond to its historic or strategic interests. These interests are that Kazakhstan should have a friendly, close relationship with Russia, based on mutual trust. This is a strategic goal. None of us here has any objection when, say, Boris Yeltsin begins to work with Poland and Germany and a certain belt is being created there. As far as concerns our efforts, jointly with Uzbekistan and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], to create a single market space, lifting all customs barriers (people are only grateful to us for that), we are thus setting a good example. And, to avert any talk to the effect that we are forming a certain belt, let us form a Eurasian union. This is an open and fair proposition. [Portnikov] You seem to have pretty good contacts with Ukraine, and still it is obviously not a candidate for the Eurasian Union.... [Nazarbayev] If someone does not get into the Eurasian Union, this does not mean that we should not have a good relationship with that party. We have extensive economic contacts with Ukraine. We have an extensive economic interest there. And they too have a big interest in Kazakhstan. There is a similar interest on the part of other countries, and we are developing trade relations with Iran; our trade with Turkey is growing fast; and our trade with China has grown 250 times in two and a half years. Therefore I want to state quite unequivocally: It is wrong to suppose that Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan, seeks to create some bloc, one not very friendly toward Russia. This will not happen; one should not look for what is not there. [passage omitted]
