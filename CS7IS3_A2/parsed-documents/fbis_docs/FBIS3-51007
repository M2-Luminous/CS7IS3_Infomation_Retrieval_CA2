Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the Senate and of the National Assembly, left his seat under police protection after he was manhandled by hostile parliamentarians because he wanted to end the session. During these incidents, Mr. Jean-Louis was protected by several parliamentarians, including Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, who physically intervened. The diplomatic corps quickly left the Parliament under the protection of their bodyguards. We still do not know if a new session will be held today. Mr. Frantz Robert Monde, an independent who votes with the Socialist bloc, solemnly warned his colleagues about the threats of anti-parliamentarism by the left and by the right. In a brief statement to AFP, he said that there was a real danger that the extreme right would take advantage of a parliamentary vacuum if the Parliament did not agree to find a Haitian solution to the crisis. The neo-Duvalierists of the Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress, FRAPH, threatened the Parliament with a mob dissolution if its members did not find a solution quickly. The incidents were triggered by the presence of the parliamentarians elected during the controversial partial elections of January 1993, held by a government not recognized by the international community. The Parliament was going to open debates aimed at reaching a final vote on the problem caused by the election of those parliamentarians, but two senators favoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, namely Eudrice Raymond and Judenel Jean, wanted to leave their seats. Their adversaries, who reproached them for invalidating the quorum and for thus making the continuation of the session impossible, physically prevented them from leaving the Parliament before things degenerated. After several hours of procrastination, the National Assembly scheduled for 10 January at 0100 eventually took place at about 0405 at the Haitian Parliament, with the question of the 18 January parliamentarians at the heart of the debates because they were present at the session to have their voices heard, although their names were not cited during the roll call. The tension was rising, and in the area surrounding the Parliament demonstrators called for the dissolution of the 45th legislature due to ineffectivenss and called for the transfer of power to the Court of Cassation so new general elections can be held in the country. To realize all that, they demanded the intervention of the Army. Meanwhile, inside the Legislative Palace, with a very fragile quorum at the Senate -- with 11 senators present -- the parliamentarians met in National Assembly in the presence of political and diplomatic personalities. Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the National Assembly, pointed out the needs of the time and hoped that a solution could be found to the problem of the 18 January 1993 parliamentarians. [passage omitted] Everything was going to fly to pieces when -- after the departure of the National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD] deputies [as heard] -- Sen. Eudrice wanted to leave as well to protest the insertion into the agenda the question of the 18 January parliamentarians. He stressed the reasons that had prompted him to decide to leave the room. [Begin Raymond recording, in Creole] The assembly is not supposed to have other elements than [words indistinct] of the day of the National Assembly, opening of the assembly, and closing the agenda. Once the assembly has taken upon itself the right to add another element to the agenda, personally (?I have lost) the obligation I had to be present today. It is a fact that I have met my obligation as I am present within the scope of the assembly; I participated in the opening. As far as I am concerned, I do not have to be present when other elements are added to the agenda. [end recording] It was finally chaos when Judenel Jean decided to leave as well. The 18 January parliamentarians, notably Gabriel Ancion, Margareth Martin, Pierre Romel Manigat, and Rousseau, hindered the departure of this parliamentarian. [Passage indistinct] This was the situation at the time when the 18 January parliamentarians were trying to hinder the departure of Senators Judenel Jean and Eudrice Raymond. Those scenes unfolded in the presence of foreign diplomats who came to attend the session. It should be pointed out that three out of four ministers of the resigning government departed even before the beginning of the session. They wanted to protest because the protocol official of the Haitian Parliament asked them to let the representatives of the Army, the Port-au-Prince bar, and the governor of the Central Bank take the first seats.
