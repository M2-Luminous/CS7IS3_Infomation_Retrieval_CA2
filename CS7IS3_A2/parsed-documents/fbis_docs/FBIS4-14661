The parties agreed to hold a meeting between North Ossetian and Ingush presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev on April 2 in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino Balkaria. The issue relating to the implementation of the Russian president's decree on the return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia's Prigorodny region is to become the central one at forthcoming negotiations between the leaders of two neighboring republics. Meanwhile, during the meeting the experts demonstrated different approaches of the Ossetian and Ingush parties towards this problem. As a result, two drafts of the agenda of Galazov's and Aushev's meeting were fixed in the final document. The first draft presented by North Ossetia says that the meeting in Nalchik should consider the issues on principles and measures to implement Boris Yeltsin's decree stipulating the order of refugees and forced settlers return from North Ossetia and Ingushetia to the places of their permanent residence. The second draft which was presented by the Ingush party stipulates that the meeting should consider the issue related to the fulfillment of the Russian president's decree and the complete return of refugees and all settlers from North Ossetia to the places of their permanent residence. On April 2 Galazov and Aushev are to choose what draft will become the subject of their discussion. In his interview with Interfax Lozovoy expressed hopes that the negotiations of the working groups held April 1 have given an impulse to the implementation of Russian president's decree on the return of refugees and forced settlers. Leader of the Russian president's administration Sergey Filatov and Kabardino Balkarian President Valeriy Kokov are expected to attend the meeting in Nalchik.
