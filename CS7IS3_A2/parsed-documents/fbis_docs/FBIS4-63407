About the same number had a good opinion of local authorities as well, according to a survey conducted by the "Public Opinion" fund among the country's urban and rural residents. Answers to sociologists' questions concerning the future presidential elections revealed two tendencies. The first shows that, no matter who the presidential candidates are, from one fifth to one quarter of the respondents do not intend to vote. The second trend shows that President Yeltsin still has the highest rating among possible candidates for the presidency. When asked to imagine that Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy were the only candidates to pass the first round, 27 per cent of respondents said they would vote for Yeltsin, while 11 per cent favored the Liberal Democratic leader. In the same situation Yeltsin came out on top of former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy 21 to 11 per cent, and proved more popular than his current prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 15 to 8 per cent. The sociologists' inquiry was answered by, with differences according to the particular question, from 1139 to 2468 respondents.
