The investigators say: "It has now become a single entity with the Sicilian families and has reached international proportions." Connections with the Masonic lodges. Rome--According to the repeated testimony of informers over a number of months, Cosa Nostra has almost completely absorbed the Calabrian Mafia, in the sense that they "have become one and the same thing." This is not a new phenomenon. Just think back to the late 1970's. When boss Gaetano Badalamenti started to fear his life was in danger, he went to Aspromonte to find "anonymous killers" to fight the mob families from Corleone. So, even though this revival of 'Ndrangheta infamy represents nothing new, it is still very worrisome to government investigators. The Calabrian alarm was sounded in the biannual report the DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate] presented by Minister Mancino to Parliament. It took 39 pages chock-full of numbers, analyses, forecasts, and warnings to say that the menace of this criminal connection--which has perhaps been slightly underestimated because it was subconsciously relegated to the background by the more sensational acts of Cosa Nostra--has reached "international proportions." 'Ndrangheta can count on 155 clans, which means about 5,000 men spread throughout the territory with powerful branches in some Italian regions, primarily Lombardy and Piedmont, and even in Europe, the United States, and Australia. For years, the "Santa" [something holy] (which is what they call the Mafia in Calabria) has been able to extend itself, branch out, and fortify itself until it was able to infiltrate politics and the economy. How? By making good use of the formidable vehicle of Freemasonry. According to the report of Gianni De Gennaro, DIA director, the Masonic lodges are allegedly "an important loop in connecting the Mafia with politics." It is significant that one-third of all Southern Masons come from Calabria. "There are twice as many Masons in Calabria as there are in Sicily and six times as many as in Campania." How does the 'Ndrangheta support itself? Its main line of business is extortions and the trafficking of narcotics. Then comes kidnaping which, although it is still practiced, seems to have been "delegated" to the mob gangs of the hinterland, the bosses in the "Aspromonte mountains, which are used as a huge prison for kidnaped victims." Protection money has become such an integral part of the "normal conduct of business" that it is no longer reported. And the victims are often hit twice--first by the Mafia and then by the usurers who always operate under the protection of the godfathers. But drugs are the inexhaustible lifeline. Cocaine traffic seems to have become the prerogative of the Calabrians who also have substantial bases of operations to control its use in the large cities in the North. The DIA carried out two missions (called "Siderno Group" and "North-South") that provided an exact picture of the extent to which the Calabrian Mafia has taken root in Piedmont and Lombardy as well as in Romagna, Lazio, and Liguria. It is from Liguria that they control the activities of important gambling casinos like those in Nice and Menton. According to the DIA, some of the major bases of operations include those in Susa, Bardonecchia, Volpiano, Rivarolo, and Cirie--which are near Turin--while the city itself is controlled by the Belfiore gang. Not even the Valle d'Aosta, with its Nirta gang, is immune to the epidemic. The synergy between 'Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra is especially alarming. It has been shown that the Calabrian bosses have been practically absorbed into the Sicilian "cupola," or dome of leadership, as true Mafia men of honor. The most obvious proof of this is the assassination of Cassation Court Judge Antonino Scopelliti. It was an assassination that was ordered by Toto Riina and carried out by Calabrian "soldiers" in their own territory. The death of the attorney general who had been assigned to argue the state's case in the first maxi-trial of Palermo was meant to slow everything down and cause the deadlines for precautionary custody to elapse for the Sicilian bosses who had been sentenced to jail in the first trial and on appeal. The informers say the exchange of favors took place.
