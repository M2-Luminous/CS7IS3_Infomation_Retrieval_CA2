FR940414-1-00039 FR940414-1-00010 The questionnaire was divided into four sections. An introductory section asked for information on the facility as a whole and whether it was involved in formulating, packaging or repackaging any of the 272 active ingredients in 1988. If the facility did not formulate, package or repackage pesticide products containing any of the 272 active ingredients then no further information was required. If the facility did formulate, package or repackage pesticide products containing the 272 active ingredients in 1988, then questions were asked regarding water use. If the facility used no water in their process and thus, the response to all water use questions were negative, then a minimal of additional financial information was requested and no further information was required. Facilities were also excused from responding to the other sections of the questionnaire if 1988 was the last year that they formulated, packaged or repackaged pesticide products containing the 272 active ingredients. The remaining sections were as follows: (1) A technical section which requested details on production and water use practices, volumes, and disposition, and wastewater treatment and characteristics; (2) an economic section that asked for detailed information on assets, debts, costs and revenues on the facility level as well as firm level data; and (3) the last section of the questionnaire that requested the names of contacts should EPA need to follow-up on the data provided and that requested a certification that the information was accurate. EPA also requested that pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities submit wastewater self-monitoring data. Fifty facilities submitted some form of self-monitoring data. Six facilities submitted data only for conventional pollutants, while ten of the 50 facilities submitted priority pollutant and/or nonconventional pollutant data (including the active ingredients). However, most of these data were not useful in characterizing pesticide process wastewaters. In many cases, only one detection was reported for a specific pollutant, or the sampling locations represented commingled wastewaters containing pollutant discharges from other industrial processes, such as pesticide manufacturing, organic chemical manufacturing or formulating, packaging or repackaging other products including pesticide products containing active ingredients not included in the list of 272 active ingredients. Often the data represented sampling results only at the end-of-pipe plant discharge. Self-monitoring data from only 10 facilities included priority pollutant discharges in raw pesticide process wastewaters. The questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of U.S. pesticide formulating and packaging facilities with stratification done according to pesticide production amount (large, medium, small, and tiny) and pesticide type (fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, other and combinations of these types for facilities that formulate and/or package more than one type). The survey was also distributed to a census of pesticide manufacturers that also formulate, package or repackage pesticides. Based on sample results from the survey, quantitative estimates of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging activities were computed for the entire U.S. population of such facilities. The results of these computations will be referred to as national stratified estimates. The national stratified estimates generated, include point estimates of totals, means (i.e., averages) and medians (i.e., the point at which an equal number of responses are above and below the value) and their associated standard errors. In the 1988 survey, the facilities were originally classified into strata based on each facility's projected 1989 pesticide product type and 1989 projected production volume, and not based on actual reported 1988 product types and production volume, as intended. As such, the sample facilities were selected at random from strata based on 1989 projected production characteristics when the ultimate goal was to report production characteristics for strata based on 1988 production levels and product types. In statistical terms, some of the facilities classified using the original scheme were misclassified under the derived scheme for stratification based on 1988 production only (e.g., a facility classified as ``large'' based on its estimated 1989 production level might instead be classified as ``medium'' when the 1988 production level is used). Because of instances of misclassification the sample had to be post-stratified into correct 1988 based strata. Also, the typical formulas used to generate national estimates of totals and standard errors of these totals are not wholly correct. Instead alternate formulas have been used based on methods for estimating totals on subpopulations as described in Sampling Techniques, 3rd Edition by Cochran (1977, p. 143&hyph;144). In general, misclassification of members in the final strata can impact the estimated standard error. Most often, a larger variance will be estimated than what would be obtained using the typical formulas for stratified random samples. However, for the pesticides survey data, the degree of misclassification is small enough that a large change in the estimated standard errors was not expected. To test this expectation, one would ideally rechoose sample facilities based on the actual 1988 production-levels and product type and re-estimate standard errors using the typical formulas for a stratified random sample with no misclassification. Since that is not feasible, a reasonable comparison can still be made by examining the standard errors obtained by applying the usual formulas to the original stratification scheme based on 1989 projected production levels. Because the same algorithm would be used for selecting the number of facilities within each stratum, regardless of the stratification scheme employed, it can be assumed that the estimated standard errors from the original stratification will be representative of the results that would have been computed had the actual 1988 production characteristics been used to stratify the target population initially. Comparison of the estimates for selected survey questions, including the distribution of facility revenues and the distribution of facilities ownership and operation type, indicates that, as expected, the estimated standard errors on the national totals are generally larger after using Cochran's formulas to account for the misclassification than those computed assuming no misclassification. The magnitude of the differences was quite small (usually no more than one or two percent) for the standard errors on the overall totals, but was in a few cases 20 percent or more for very small strata. Though restratification of the survey facilities often increases the estimated standard errors, the national totals themselves will be exactly the same mathematically, as long as the same set of facilities is used to compute the estimates. In the PFPR project, a small number of the facilities which were included in the sample because of projected 1989 production figures did not have any actual production in 1988. These facilities were therefore not a part of the targeted facility universe and so were excluded from the restratified calculations. Even so, the overall national totals showed very minor changes (on the order of at most four to five percent) when the restratified estimates were compared with totals based on the original stratification.
