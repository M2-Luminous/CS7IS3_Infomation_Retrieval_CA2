FBIS4-10453 "drlat071_m_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Brazil Lula Faction Controls Sao Paulo PT Platform Lula Faction Controls Sao Paulo PT Platform PY1204131594 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 11 Apr 94 p A6 PY1204131594 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [By Regina Terraz] [Text] The faction led by PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva emerged as the winner in the 10th Sao Paulo State meeting that concluded yesterday in the city of Sao Paulo. Lula's Coordination/Unity [Articulacao/Unidade] faction obtained the largest number of votes among the Sao Paulo delegates, and managed to make its proposals prevail in the PT platform. Deputy Jose Dirceu, PT candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State, said: "The meeting showed that Lula's majority has prevailed." He added: "It is not true that Lula does not have the support of the majority within the PT." The vote outcome was, however, close. The victory of Lula's faction over Time for Truth [Hora da Verdade], a more radical group, signifies that Lula's government plan will be more moderate. The PT decisions in Sao Paulo State, the stronghold of the party, will weigh heavily in the drafting of the final document, which is to be approved at a national PT meeting to be held from 29 April to 1 May. For instance, on the subject of the foreign debt -- one of the most controversial topics in the PT program -- the Sao Paulo members decided to reject the proposal to immediately suspend payments and to support the PT executive board's original proposal, which is less radical on this point. In the final document, the suspension of foreign debt payments may appear as a measure that could be adopted by the government after a detailed analysis of the debt. The PT proposal may also endorse open debt negotiations. On the subject of privatization, Sao Paulo will also support the original document, which proposes the suspension of the privatization process and an assessment of those companies that have been privatized thus far. The PT delegates declined to support the idea of bringing back to the government fold those companies that had already been privatized. In the opinion of Jose Dirceu, who attended the meeting, the main PT adversary in the 3 October elections will be the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Dirceu said: "It will be Lula against Fernando Henrique Cardoso; and Jose Dirceu against Mario Covas in Sao Paulo." He noted that the opposition by Covas -- PSDB candidate for the Sao Paulo gubernatorial seat -- to the PSDB alliance with the Liberal Front Party [PFL] "is just a publicity stunt." He added: "In Sao Paulo, Covas is promoting an alliance with the Liberal Party and with the Brazilian Labor Party. Hence, he could not possibly claim that he is against the PSDB-PFL alliance." He said: "What the PSDB members want is to seize power; they do not care with whom."
