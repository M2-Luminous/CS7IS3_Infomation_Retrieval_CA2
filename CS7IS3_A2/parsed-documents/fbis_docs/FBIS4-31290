The past week was noisy with the speculations and explanations of politicians and political analysts. However, after a few days, what is society's view on its own decision and what does it expect from the winners? The Median Public Opinion and Market Research Institute sought the answer to these question in a public opinion survey carried out on 1 June, which showed expectations in connection with the MSZP and an immense desire for a coalition. Three days after the second round, a sweeping majority (95 percent) of electors was aware that the MSZP had won the elections. The majority of people were also familiar with the size of the victory: Nearly one-third (30 percent) of the electors precisely named the proportion of mandates at 54 percent, and one-fifth (22 percent) was almost exactly aware of the proportion (51-53 percent). Only 12 percent estimated the MSZP's result below the absolute majority, and 16 percent presumed a bigger majority than the actual result. The absolute majority of the public was surprised by the final result of the elections. A significant majority of only the MSZP's voters (who had voted for the MSZP list on 8 May) claimed that they had expected such a large victory, but even among them, every third person admitted that he was surprised by the result. A similar division can also be seen in qualifying the MSZP's victory: As opposed to three-quarters of the MSZP voters, only one-quarter of the other parties' supporters believed that the result was "good for the country." A significant section of society has great expectations, almost illusions, toward the MSZP government. Almost two-thirds of citizens expect that the Socialists will sooner or later increase pensions, and almost half expect wage increases, price reductions, and relatively quick results in solving other social and economic problems. Among the MSZP's voters, the proportion of optimists reaches the absolute majority in the case of all tasks. At the same time, the majority of the public is thinking in terms of a coalition, rather than a one-party MSZP government: Three out of four people would like a multiparty government. Some 82 percent of the latter named the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as a desirable coalition partner, and 25 percent would also welcome the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and 14 percent the Independent Smallholders Party in the new government. Regardless of their party affiliations, the majority of people are in favor of coalition, a small difference only exists in the proportions: "Only" 70 percent of the MSZP voters "wish for a partner," while 91 percent of the SZDSZ voters believe that their party should be in government. While society is almost united in supporting the idea of a coalition, it is much more divided about the most suitable person to become prime minister. It might not be surprising that, after the decline preceding the elections, [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn again enjoys the support of a relative majority, however, it is noteworthy that two "candidates" approach his popularity. It is especially interesting that [former Prime Minister] Miklos Nemeth still has significant support and he even has a slight lead over [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate] Gabor Kuncze. Apart from "nostalgia," this, of course, has other reasons, too: According to 77 percent of the people questioned, "it is important for the prime minister virtually to be an economic expert," and only 23 percent saw this as a negligible factor.
