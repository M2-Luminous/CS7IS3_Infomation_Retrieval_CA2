Mr. Arbnori told the Danish delegation about the composition and work of the new pluralistic parliament for the realisation of the reform both in the legislative and economic fields. We are convinced that we may have mistakes during the economic reform we are carrying out but some of them are artificially created by the opposition, Mr. Arbnori said. He illustrated his statement with the hindrances that the parliamentary commission charged with the preparation of the draft of the constitution ins encountering. Through these hindrances, the opposition aims at bringing Albania back where it was, in a neocommunist dictatorship, as it is happening somewhere in Eastern Europe, Mr. Arbnori said. Mr. Petersen asked further information about the law on the distribution of the land in the countryside, the efforts for the new constitution, the resources of Albania and the system of taxes applied in this country. Mr. Petersen said that in the context of a three year plan for the Eastern and Central European countries, Denmark has accorded Albania a considerable financial aid.
