But that, as they say, is small stuff. Having proclaimed that "a person who is not a part of the Russian community is not a Russian," nationalists from all regions of the former USSR agreed on the creation of a political organization that is "Russian in spirit and in deed." It will bring to power a "Russian government" which, as Rogozin stated, will not recognize "as full-fledged state borders" those borders with neighboring states that have now become independent--the "zone of vital interests" of Russia. The distant geopolitical future was sketched by the representative of an offshoot of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] (Zhirinovskiy was too liberal), the legal radical party: The Russian people in alliance with those same Aryan people, the Germans, are destined to become the "policemen of Europe." The "new right," as they call themselves, when they come to power will deny Russian citizenship to all who have "pursued an anti-Russian policy." Above all, as was revealed at the congress, citizenship will be denied to members of the country's current leadership. Perhaps for the first time the solid Hall of Columns in the House of Unions resounded with whistles and catcalls. That is how the patriots greeted the appearance at the podium of the deputy minister of nationalities and regional policy, who read an invitation for cooperation sent by Sergey Shakhray and a representative of the Ministry of Defense. While in the corridors of the House of Unions, where the congress took place, there was a whole sea of anti-Jewish printed products, in the Hall of Columns itself there were calls to learn to survive precisely from the Jewish people. Russians, in the words of the deputy editor of NASH SOVREMENNIK, Kaznitsev, must also provide themselves with a ministry of reunification and wise men who "think about the fate of the nation." To fulfill the role of the latter, they suggested the writer Rasputin and the mathematician Shafarevich (Solzhenitsyn was rejected). But, as a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent managed to establish, the community members hold somebody altogether different in highest esteem. The merchant selling photographic portraits of numerous opposition leaders who had set up in the foyer of the House of Unions sold the most portraits--for 130 rubles each--of the leader of the Russian Nazis, who is now being held under guard, Aleksandr Barkashov.
