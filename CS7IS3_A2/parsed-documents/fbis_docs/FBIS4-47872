This week he may have a presidential palace at his disposal -- the official residence of former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. Sentenced to life for sabotage, the grey-haired Mhlaba is now the ANC's premier-designate for the Eastern Cape. He was born in Mazoka Village in the Fort Beaufort District in 1920, and initially worked in a laundry in Port Elizabeth after leaving school. An active trade unionist during the 1940s, he was one of the ANC leaders arrested during the transport boycott of 1952. After the ANC was banned he joined other exiles doing military training. Returning to South Africa in 1962, he commanded Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] until 1963, when he was arrested along with Nelson Mandela and others at a farm in Rivonia. He served time on Robben Island, but was transferred to Pollsmoor in 1982, where by special permission he married his common-law wife and mother of his three children, Dedika Heliso, in 1986. Nelson Mandela was a witness at the ceremony, conducted in the prison commandant's office. Afterwards Mhlaba was legally permitted to touch his wife for the first time in 22 years. After his release in October 1989, he was elected to the ANC National Executive and SA [South African] Communist Party Central Committee. In January 1994 he was chosen as the ANC's premier-designate for a unified Eastern Cape. The region includes Transkei, Ciskei, the Border and the Eastern Province, and is plagued by massive unemployment and a legacy of underdevelopment. Top priorities, according to Mhlaba, are job creation, education and housing, and basic needs like water and electricity. Mhlaba, who has played an active role in the Eastern Cape development forum, believes one way of dealing with these problems is for agriculture and manufacturing in the region to develop export markets. He has also emphasised the importance of restoring law and order. Ironically Mhlaba may take over the unified region only to see it split in two -- a proposal being widely discussed. Bisho, capital of the former Ciskeian state, is the Eastern Cape regional capital. There has been speculation that Mhlaba will move into Brigadier Gqozo's luxury residence. However a spokesman for the premier-designate's office in King William's Town said he did not believe Mhlaba had taken a decision on the matter. This would depend on discussions with the provincial secretary and coordinator, who were making logistic arrangements.
