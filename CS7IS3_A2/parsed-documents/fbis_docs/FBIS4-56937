FBIS4-56937 "drlat091_k_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Argentina Patents Bill To Be `Revamped' in Line With GATT Patents Bill To Be `Revamped' in Line With GATT PY1105004594 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 10 May 94 p 5 PY1105004594 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD English BFN [Text] (NA-DYN) -- The patents bill currently before the Senate is being revamped by the Foreign Ministry and the Justicialist Party bloc of senators so as to bring it into line with the GATT agreement and to make it similar to intellectual property-rights legislation being used in Brazil. At the same time the Senate's Industry commission confirmed yesterday that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will be giving his view on the issue before the Commission on May 19. Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday that the government's intention is not to send a new law to Congress -- which would take even longer to be passed -- but to reach an agreement with the Radical Party on a patents protection law that would fall within the framework of the GATT treaty, of which Argentina and the US are both signatories. The government's intention is to obtain, at the least, a law that is in accordance with GATT terms and at the most, one that grants foreign pharmaceutical companies greater protection as Mexico did so as to obtain its membership in the NAFTA North American free trade agreement. Notwithstanding the GATT treaty, the US has been carrying out bilateral talks in an effort to obtain even further benefits. The Foreign Ministry is now advising the Party Senators on how best to modify the current bill so as to comply with international trade regulations as well as to make it as similar as possible to Brazil's laws in view of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] southern-cone common market integration. Some of the modifications to be included will be a transition period, already in the official text but much shorter than the 10 years contemplated by the GATT treaty. There will also be a monopoly on imports to benefit the patent holder, except when it is imported raw materials from Mercosur member countries. One of the pending issues which will be heatedly debated in Congress is the automatic manufacturing licences being demanded by local pharmaceutical companies in order to avoid a monopoly situation. If the new patents law meets US pharmaceutical company demands half way as well as taking into account GATT rulings and domestic company demands, then the law could be acceptable to the local pharmaceutical companies Pablo Challu said yesterday. He added however that the patent life should only last for ten years, and not the 20 years that is being demanded by US pharmaceutical companies. Argentina is being heavily pressed by the US to have a patents law in place within the next 60 days, a deadline extension that was officially announced last Wednesday by the US Embassy.
