The resolution denounces the continued threat and blackmail of the United States to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It says: The conference is concerned over the scheme of the United States of America to venture a military intervention for destroying the nuclear development capacity of Korea which is being used for a peaceful purpose. The USA must open first its own nuclear facilities to an international inspection. This is the only fair and peaceful solution for avoiding genocide. The conference denounces the reckless massacre committed by the USA in Iraq and demands that it should not repeat this mistake in Korea. The 7th pan-African conference also calls upon all the countries to promote the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, helping the Korean people in the North and the South solve the question of reunification by themselves.
