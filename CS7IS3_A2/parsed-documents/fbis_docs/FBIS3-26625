In May and July this year [1992], the National Administration of State Property held and presided over work conferences on state assets ownership registration, as well as meetings making arrangements for registering assets ownership in units directly under the central authorities. It also printed and issued "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership Registration" and "Procedures for Implementing the Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership Registration," making concrete arrangements for registering ownership over state assets. In order to do a good job in registering ownership over state assets in economic and trade enterprises, and to gradually form a system, the relevant matters are hereby relayed as follows: I. Strengthen leadership; improve understanding. Various units must strengthen leadership over the work in registering ownership of state assets, and seriously learn from the State Council's "Notice on Strengthening Management of State Assets" and "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership Registration," as well as the procedures for implementation. They must upgrade the understanding of the significance of state assets ownership registration to protecting the integrity of state assets and preventing state assets from draining, and they must adopt effective measures in order to score real results. II. Registration domain. 1. The central economic and trade enterprises, enterprise groups, jointly run enterprises, joint-stock enterprises, collective enterprises run by state assets, and business units with business licenses issued to legal persons for operating enterprises, of various levels and directly under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], must register ownership of assets. 2. Foreign-funded enterprises, units under construction (these units will register ownership of assets upon completion of construction and opening for business), and the business units which have obtained non-legal-person business licenses, do not have to register ownership of assets at this moment. 3. The enterprises which have already registered ownership of state assets for the 1992 fiscal year according to the State Council's relevant regulations and based on their final accounts of 1991, no longer have to register ownership of assets. III. Registration of ownership of state assets in central economic and trade enterprises will be organized and implemented according to subordinate relations in financial terms. 1. Various corporations directly under MOFERT, China Foreign Trade Center (Group), and China (Fujian) Foreign Trade Center Group, must submit their ownership registration forms to MOFERT for examination and verification, and to the National Administration of State Property for examination and approval. 2. The subsidiaries of various corporations are to be examined and verified by the corporations themselves, and examined and approved by MOFERT centrally. 3. The branch offices of corporations, as well as other units practicing independent auditing, are to be examined and verified by the corporations themselves, and examined and approved by MOFERT centrally. IV. Regarding the work in registering ownership of assets in enterprise groups. 1. The corporations which have already been established as enterprise groups must still submit their asset ownership registration forms to MOFERT for examination and verification, and to the National Administration of State Property for examination and approval. 2. The asset ownership registration form to be submitted by an enterprise group should include the assets of enterprises at close stratum [jinmi ceng 4868 1378 1461], that is, the form should be filled in according to the total amount of assets of the core enterprise and the enterprises at close stratum. The enterprises at close stratum do not have to register asset ownership individually, but must have their credit standing verified (they must also fill in the forms registering ownership of state assets, but the forms only have the function of verifying credit standing), a thing to be done by the core enterprises. 3. Regarding the enterprises at the loose stratum [songsan ceng 2646 2414 1416], that is, the enterprises which have no links or relations with a core enterprise in terms of assets, but which have come into being due to business relations, registration of assets ownership will be performed according to their original subordinate relations. V. For the enterprises registering assets ownership this year [1992], the assets ownership registration forms should be filled in according to their final accounts in 1991. VI. The financial departments of various units are to be responsible for the work in registering asset ownership within the units. VII. Registration of asset ownership divided into categories. On a natural basis, asset ownership registration is to be divided into four categories: Opening, changing, canceling, and inspecting business on yearly basis. A brief explanation is given below. 1. Registration of opening of business: Newly opened enterprises, the enterprises which have broken off from the old ones and become independent legal persons, and the new enterprises which are formed by merging, must perform registration of opening of business. 2. Registration of changing of business: When some part of an enterprise breaks off, when another enterprise is annexed by the enterprise (merging), when subordinate relations in terms of finance change, when increase or decrease in assets exceeds 20 percent including (20 percent) [as published], and when the enterprise's address, economic nature, and representative of it as a legal person changes, the enterprise must register the change. 3. Registration of canceling of business: An enterprise which is annexed, canceled, or goes bankrupt must go through registration of cancellation. 4. Yearly inspection: All enterprises which are regarded as independent legal persons must go through registration of yearly inspection. VIII. The assets ownership registration here mainly refers to registration of yearly inspection. Registration of opening of business, canceling of business, and changing of business must be handled individually. IX. After examination and verification, state assets management departments will issue to enterprises "certificates empowering enterprises to occupy and use state assets," relevant regulations will be announced later. X. This year's work in registering assets ownership will end before the end of October. The asset ownership registration forms of various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT before 30 September for examination and verification, and the asset ownership registration forms of the enterprises which are subordinate to various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT before 10 October for examination and approval. XI. Various corporations (enterprise groups) are requested to seriously organize work in registering asset ownership within their own systems. They may, according to the spirit of this notice, formulate implementation procedures and supplementary regulations for asset ownership registration within their systems, and report to MOFERT for the record. XII. After the conclusion of the asset ownership registration work, MOFERT will join hands with the National Administration of State Property in assessing and accepting the work in registering assets ownership in various units under MOFERT. The units and individuals who have a good performance will be commended, and the enterprises and units which do not work according to the regulations and which are irresponsible in work will be notified and criticized, while those which have serious problems will have their asset ownership registration work and industrial and commercial registrations suspended. Regarding how local economic and trade enterprises should begin the work in registering ownership of state assets, the departments in charge of economic and trade affairs in the localities are requested to make decisions together with the state asset management departments in the localities, and the forms for registering state assets ownership may be filled out according to this notice.
