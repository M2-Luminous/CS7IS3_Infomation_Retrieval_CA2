During a news conference at Havana's Jose Martin Airport, Robaina said Latin America and the Caribbean constitute priorities for Cuban foreign policy. Asked about the possibility of Cuba's eventual reintegration into the OAS, Robaina noted that the country awaits the OAS decision on this because, he emphasized, we cannot knock on the door of a place from which we were arbitrarily removed. Robaina attributed underhanded intentions to the White House decision to exclude Cuba from the so-called Americas Summit convened by President William Clinton. Robaina's tour will include Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay.
