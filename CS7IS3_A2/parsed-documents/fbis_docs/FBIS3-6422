However, as the North side again put forward the issue of announcing a joint communique, no progress has been made in spite of a compromising plan put forward by our side. If the two sides fail to settle the procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys at today's contact, it appears clear that the realization of an exchange of special envoys before 21 March will be impossible. Reporter Kim Chong-chin reports from the secretariat of the North-South talks. [Begin Kim recording] It is likely that the seventh North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys will end without noticeable progress. The North and the South Korea have been holding a working-level contact in Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom from 1000 [0100 GMT]. However, as the North side again put forward the issue of announcing a joint communique which it raised during the sixth contact, the talks are undergoing difficulties. In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean delegation, said that the North side's withdrawal of its four-point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making step and that the South side should accept without fail the proposal for announcing a joint communique which states that the North and the South agree on the principle of exchanging special envoys. Furthermore, the North side showed a strong [kanghan] position that it will not concede even slightly [hanchiui yangbodo hoyonghaji anketta] on any of the three points concerning the missions of special envoys, the sequence of visits, and itineraries which the North and the South showed differences on in their last contact. The North side urged our side to accept all of this, thus showing a more rigid attitude than in the last contact. To this, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior delegate, said that the North side should withdraw such unnecessary proposals as announcing a joint communique, in consideration of the urgency resulting from the lack of time for exchanging special envoys before 21 March, and urged the North side to settle procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys. Delegate Song put forward a compromising plan which stipulates the issue of achieving national reunification based on the three- point principles of independence, peace, and great national unity, which includes the missions of the special envoys, as well as the principle of great unity of the whole country and national independence proposed additionally by the North. In addition, Delegate Song revealed a position willing to consider the timing of an exchange of special envoys after 21 March when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are scheduled, on the condition that North Korea-U.S. talks be postponed. However, he failed to secure any change in the North Korean attitude. In the event that the North and the South Korea fail to settle the procedural matters for the exchanging special envoys at today's contact, it is clear that the exchange of special envoys before 21 March will not be possible. Meanwhile, prior to the talks, the delegates from both sides talked about North Korean folk wrestling, which was broadcast by KBS television network recently. However, such conversation ended earlier than usual, revealing an initial atmosphere of stiffness. [end recording]
