The group, made up of 13 Swedes and two Norwegians, was stopped after refusing to hand over explosives that form part of the supplies being carried to their colleagues in Tuzla. Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says he doesn't regard this as a hostage situation, adding that the Nordic soldiers will be free to leave the area as soon as a relief group arrives on the scene. Sweden is to withdraw the two Air Force transport planes that have been taking part in relief flights to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo when the agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees expires next week. This is despite a UN request for continued assistance. Military sources in Stockholm cite technical reasons, saying the aircraft need overhaul after flying two to three times daily to Sarajevo. The planes are the only two of Sweden's eight giant Hercules transport planes with special protection against heat-seeking missiles and thus suitable for the task. Foreign Aid Minister Alf Svensson said Sweden is prepared to resume relief flights at a later date.
