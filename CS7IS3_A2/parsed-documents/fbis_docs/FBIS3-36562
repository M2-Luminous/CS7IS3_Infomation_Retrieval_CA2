Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime minister's analysis and planning group, in his letter of resignation to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a copy of which has been obtained by Interfax, says, among other things: "The approved present composition of the government and the decisions which it is drawing up (primarily those providing for huge benefits for the agro-industrial and fuel and energy complexes and on the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus), as well as public statements made by the premier make it clear that the radical change in the economic policy started more than a year ago is now complete." In Illarionov's opinion, the present government has effectively begun to restore former economic and political practices. "Having gotten on their knees before lobbyists from various industries and regions and giving in to their blackmail, it will continue to meet their interests and bolster its own power. Taking part in such activities contradicts my convictions," the aide says. "You are better aware than anyone else of the economic and political damage done over the past year and a half to the people of Russia and its president by the chairman of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. Recently you promised comprehensive support to Gerashchenko. It is perfectly clear that defending Gerashchenko is your position, with which I can have nothing to do," Illarionov says, addressing Chernomyrdin. "I cannot remain head of your analysis and planning group because I came to the government to carry out economic reforms, not to ditch them. I cannot remain in this post because I have always been trying to defend the national interests of Russia rather than those of a handful of collective-farm and state-farm barons or generals from the fuel and energy complex. I cannot remain in this post because I take a negative attitude to most of the decisions you take and because I have to publicly explain how harmful they are to Russia," Illarionov says.
