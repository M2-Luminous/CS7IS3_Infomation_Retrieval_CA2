He told correspondents that the reports by the National Statistics and Economic Studies Institute "confirm the government's scenario of a gradual improvement of economic activity in France. Hence it would be inappropriate to change course." But he added that "There is still one worrisome point: the irregular trends in consumption." He said that household consumption of manufactured products would have been up in December, except that the problems of the auto sector pulled the increase down to zero. "The rebound continued in January, and the partial indicators are rather promising," he said. As to French unemployment, now at 12 percent and expected to rise further, the minister said that "The uptrend has not been halted, but things on the job front are gradually coming to look less dark." Turning to interest rates, Alphandery said he would be "greatly surprised if we do not observe, in Europe and in France, a gradual return to the normal yield curve" (long-term rates higher than short-term rates). As to possible recapitalization of major bank Credit Lyonnais, he said he was waiting for release of 1993 financial reports before making a decision.
