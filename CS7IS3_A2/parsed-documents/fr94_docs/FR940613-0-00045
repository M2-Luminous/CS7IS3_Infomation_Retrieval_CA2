FR940613-0-00045 FR940613-0-00015 Alaska does, however, have mileage that is part of the NN. Section 4006 of the ISTEA requires the FHWA to include in the final list ``any commercial motor vehicle combination *␣*␣* with 2 or more cargo carrying units.'' A ``cargo-carrying unit'' is defined as ``any portion of a commercial motor vehicle combination *␣*␣* used for carrying cargo, including a trailer, semitrailer, or the cargo carrying section of a single unit truck.'' While section 1023 is relatively narrow in scope, section 4006 has very widespread applicability. If, as the WTA contends, vehicles not previously considered to be LCV's are covered by this final rule, it is because of section 4006. This section is also the reason that vehicles are listed in appendix C for Alaska. Thus, vehicles not previously considered LCV's are included in this final rule, because the statute applies to more than just LCV's. The ATA expressed concern that the FHWA's attempt to organize the vehicles subject to the freeze into four basic categories requires the FHWA to go beyond the role established for it in the ISTEA. The ATA contends that the ISTEA limits the role of the Secretary to reviewing for accuracy and publishing State information and that the categorization made by the FHWA involves the interpretation of State laws and regulations. Similarly, Alaska commented that the nomenclature used in designating the four basic categories ``is not universally acceptable.'' The categories used in appendix C, as included in the SNPRM, were (1) Rocky Mountain Doubles, (2) Turnpike Doubles, (3) Triples, and (4) Other. These names were chosen in an attempt to describe the vehicles covered by the freeze in terms commonly used in the trucking industry. Since there is no industry-wide or statutory definition for categories 1, 2, or 3, a degree of confusion remained as to just what vehicle combinations were covered, especially by categories 1 and 2. The ISTEA required the FHWA to list vehicles by ``configuration type'' (section 1023) or ``specific configuration'' (section 4006). In creating the basic configuration categories used in the NPRM and SNPRM, the FHWA believed it had to go beyond just publishing State-submitted information. For example, many States do not differentiate between a ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Double in the statutes or regulations which authorize their operation. Typically, these States allow a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, or a truck tractor and two trailing units where each trailing unit can be up to some maximum length. Interpretations were required to develop the maximum parameters that would apply if the State did differentiate by vehicle type. The FHWA has re-examined the meaning of ``configuration,'' however, and determined that there is no statutory requirement to classify vehicle combinations according to industry usage. In order to reduce confusion and simplify the description of vehicles covered by the freeze, the vehicles described in appendix C of this final rule have therefore been regrouped into three categories: (1) Truck tractor and two trailing units, (2) Truck tractor and three trailing units, and (3) Other. This preserves the freeze required by the ISTEA without limiting the discretion allowed by some States before June 1, 1991. Vehicles Submitted by States but Excepted From or Not Subject to Section 4006 of the ISTEA In preparing the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the February 25, 1993, SNPRM, the FHWA decided not to include certain vehicle combinations submitted by the States, which it determined Congress did not intend to include in the ISTEA freeze. No additional information regarding conditions, routes, or authority to operate these vehicles was required. In addition to describing the categories of vehicles proposed for exemption, a detailed listing by State of the vehicles submitted but exempted was contained in the SNPRM. In its comments, the ATA urged the FHWA to include in the regulatory language of the final rule the list of exempted vehicles included in the preamble to the SNPRM. The basis for the ATA's suggestion was ``to ensure that only the vehicles intended by Congress are restricted and to help clarify the intent of the restriction for enforcement and judicial purposes.'' The ATA's proposal was to include the list of excepted vehicles in an expanded definition of LCV in the final rule. The categories of multiple cargo unit vehicles exempted from coverage by the freeze include: (1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum length of the individual cargo units of 28.5 feet or less, (2) conventional automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (3) stinger-steered automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 75 feet or less, (4) truck-trailer and truck-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (5) maxi-cubes, (6) most tow trucks with vehicles in tow, and (7) combination vehicles which include a truck tractor containing a dromedary box, deck, or plate, and one semitrailer or trailer. With respect to the dromedary equipped vehicle exclusion, strict interpretation of ISTEA section 4006 would include this equipment under the freeze. By its function, a dromedary box, deck, or plate is a cargo-carrying unit. When combined with a semitrailer, the result is technically a combination with two cargo-carrying units, thus subjecting the combination to the freeze. However, dromedary equipped truck tractors in actual operation on December 1, 1982, are grandfathered under §658.13(f), causing a combination consisting of one of these units and a semitrailer to be considered as simply a truck tractor-semitrailer under the provisions of part 658. Dromedary equipped semitrailer combinations are a minor segment of the industry which probably escaped the notice of Congress, and which would require a good deal of additional time and effort to list. Should States or carriers try to evade the ISTEA freeze mandate by expanding the size of these unlisted combinations, the FHWA may have to initiate rulemaking to close this loophole.
