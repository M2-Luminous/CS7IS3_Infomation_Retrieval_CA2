Five rebels were detained after the incident, which happened Monday between Assode and Timia, in the Iferouane region. Troops seized a four-wheel drive vehicle, weapons, ammunition and various documents of the Front for the Liberation of the Air and Azawagh (FLAA), one of four Tuareg rebel movements in Niger. The clash came after the government and the rebels last week said they would seek a negotiated end to the three-year conflict which has claimed more than 100 lives. Officials from mediating countries -- Algeria, Burkina Faso and France -- met with delegates from the two sides last week and said the government and the rebels agreed in principle to a meeting soon. Both sides last met in Ouagadougou in February.
