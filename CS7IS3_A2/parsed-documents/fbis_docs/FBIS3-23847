Maryasov: "A Landslide Reduction in Fertility"] [Text] Russian fields expect a landslide reduction in fertility in the next few years, unless the state takes over the financing of agrochemical work. Not long ago I had occasion to attend an All-Russian seminar conference of agrochemical workers. The speakers said with alarm that the erosion of nutrients from the soil had increased considerably (Table No 1). We are taking all the sap from the land, and giving it nothing in return. This can have only a deplorable ending. In two or three years such a landslide reduction in the production of agricultural products will set in that no loans and no infusions from the West will help.

Ivanova, director of the Velikiye Luki Chemization Station in Pskov Oblast, was one of the first to speak at the seminar. "The conditions for agricultural development in the oblast are very difficult," said Valentina Fedorovna. "Poor soil, lack of roads, depopulated villages -- these are the characteristic features of our region. Hopes that we would have a normal life appeared in 1981-1982, when road construction and land improvement were firmly undertaken. In these years, the intensity of agrochemical service picked up. For example, high rates of liming made it possible to reduce the soil acidity from 60 to 30 percent. One could say that the land took a deep breath. The best farms began to obtain 20 quintals of grain from each hectare, and 200 quintals of potatoes. This did not last long, unfortunately. Gradually, all the good beginnings began to be reduced to nothing. In the last year or two, the Pskov rural area, I can say without exaggeration, has been approaching the critical line. "You know, everything begins with the land, but our land has found itself neglected. The placement of mineral fertilizers has dropped by a factor of eight, as compared with the 1980's, of organic fertilizers -- by a factor of three, and four-fold fewer fields are being limed. Things are coming to the point where soon a nutritive element such as potassium will not remain in the soil. "The amount of acidic soil is increasing. We can go back to the days when the acidity was such that no crops grew: barley would sprout and immediately die. Now we are approaching the same point: what we accumulated by granules for 30 years we ran off in two to three years. "The Pskov farmers obtained a 40-million-ruble [R] loan this year to purchase mineral fertilizers. In other words, there were R100 per hectare of plowed land. What can you buy for that? This is not a loan, but a mockery. "The financial situation of many farms is catastrophic. Things have come to the point where it has become more profitable not to cultivate the land than it is to cultivate it. The expenses to grow flax at the farms are more than the flax mills pay for it. They say that we used to have a ridiculous economy, but what we have come to does not fit into even this concept." Valentina Fedorovna also came out with a specific proposal: agrochemical work should be financed by the state. The farms cannot buy fertilizers at the existing prices. The farmers are also turning to the agrochemical service for help. They have many problems, and there must be interaction. When you ask the farmers about paying for the services, though, each one shrugs his shoulders: "What payment?! I have nothing but debts, and this is the third year that I haven't had a penny of income." This is the sort of speech you have. It is hard not to agree with many of the arguments. At the same time, however, one feels like arguing. What is easy to come by is not so highly valued. Not so long ago, fertilizers arrived at the farms as if from a horn of plenty, and moreover, were very cheap. So? We all remember their being scattered on the borders of the fields, in the gullies, torn sacks and incompetent storage, when they poured what should have been separated into the same heap. As we know, the doses of fertilizer placement are closely tied into the reserves of nutrients in the soil, a fact which agronomists often disregard. There was a time when many specialists acted blindly, on the principle of "we take a measure from the embankment, and then we sort it out." The soil on their farm remained a thoroughly hidden mystery to them. Now, true, most of the farms have agrochemical charts. Consequently, there is a possibility of forming a norm for the placement of fertilizers according to the needs of the plants in each field. Not everything depends on the charts, though, there are two sides to the coin. In this case the second side concerns the technical outfitting of the farms. Over ten years ago, science worked out a local method for placing fertilizers. To this day, however, the peasants have not received the equipment for this and are forced to use machines with a centrifugal sifting apparatus to place fertilizers. The lack of uniformity in placing fertilizers in this case reaches three- or four-fold the normal value. The consequence? A tremendous overexpenditure of fertilizers and an increase, on some sections of the fields, in the nutrient dose, as compared with the recommended one. This means that the problem is far from ambiguous. A simple "let it be" will not do very well here. Competent chemization of agriculture is transforming the rural area, that is indisputable. In the developed countries, however, the means of chemizing and protecting plants merges with new technology. The yield that comes from this can be judged by the published table (Table 2). Table 2.
