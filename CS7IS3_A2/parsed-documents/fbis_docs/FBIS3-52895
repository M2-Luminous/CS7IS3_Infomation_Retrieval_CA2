Recently one of America's most important newspapers warned that the suspicious financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his wife have taken away the people's confidence in the White House statesmen. Last week, the U.S. Congress Republican leaders called for an investigation into President Clinton's role in land and estate deals in Arkansas. Republican leaders called on U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno to appoint a special investigator to look into Clinton's role -- as governor of Arkansas -- in the Whitewater development company. Critics of the U.S. President's financial misuse say that before becoming president, when Clinton was governor of Arkansas, he put special government treasury facilities at the disposal of the Whitewater company, of which he was a main shareholder. That finally resulted in the government losing $60 million. But the difficulty is that the judiciary must appoint a special investigator. The attorney-general is in open collaboration with the White House and so far has procrastinated in appointing a special investigator to look into the scandal. Her pretext is that the legal period for implementing the law concerning the appointment of a special investigator by the judiciary has expired; whereas the U.S. press say that she has other legal authority for a close examination of the issue. The collusion between the judiciary -- which carries out justice -- and the executive power indicates that both powers are trying hard to erase the ignominy of this obvious scandal from the face of the U.S. President. The White House earlier announced that as soon as the numerous documents concerning Clinton's banking, personal, and electoral files are bound they will be handed over to the attorney-general's office. Clinton, under increasing political pressure two weeks ago, announced that he will be handing over documents concerning the financial connection between himself and his wife and the Whitewater company in the state of Arkansas to the attorney-general's office. But so far he has not handed them over. Finally, we point out the fact that U.S. society has always been faced with such scandals at the level of political administrative authorities. The 1988 U.S. presidential candidate, Garry Hart, sometime after the revelations about his ethical scandal, said that the personal and private lives of the leaders of U.S. society have nothing to do with the people. Now it must be asked whether that is merely his point of view or the viewpoint of all U.S. statesmen and a permanent principle in U.S. diplomacy.
