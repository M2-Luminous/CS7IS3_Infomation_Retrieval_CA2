He described it as a source of pride and honor for Islamic Iran. He referred to the impact of international Jerusalem Day in keeping alive the issue of Palestine which is the most fundamental issue that faces the Islamic world. He said: The holding of ceremonies marking international Jerusalem Day has an important effect on the continuation of the struggle of the people of Palestine. He stressed: Israel definitely will not last and the acceptance of any kind of peace plan with the regime occupying Jerusalem is suicidal. The president referred to the colonial history of the creation of Israel and said: During World War II, world arrogance realized that Zionists were a threat to the European community and decided to create a base in the Middle East to achieve its inauspicious goals, and that is exactly what it did. Since then the Israeli policy has been to drive out Muslim Palestinians step by step and to usurp their lands. Apart from such actions, Israel has also established security zones that can be used as a weapon at all times. The president added: The mass murder of the oppressed Muslim Palestinians in cases such as Dayr Yasin and the recent tragic event in the Abraham mosque in Hebron are among the usual practices of the Zionist regime. The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the colonial nature of Israel and said: The Zionist regime cannot resist a second against the struggle of the Muslim nation of Palestine if it decides to set aside its colonial nature. It is for that reason that it has always enjoyed the support of America and Britain so as to maintain their interests in the region. He added: The establishment of an Arab-Israeli peace does not seem logical as long as the relationship between the usurper Zionist regime and the Palestinian nation is one of the oppressor against the oppressed. The president said: [Begin Rafsanjani recording] The logic of the western world for creating Israel is extremely faulty and vulnerable. You see how deceptively they are trying to make themselves look good, but they have come unstuck there. But Israel is so important to them that they are prepared to take this shame on their name to their grave. They are prepared to see all their claims wiped out for the sake of preserving that malevolent, arrogant entity, which is behaving this way. But, will Israel last? In my opinion, no. It will definitely not last. That foreign body that has entered a living being cannot last long. In my opinion, ultimately, the way to salvation is Islam. What can do something, keep the people on the scene, preserve this lengthy and hazardous crusade for a long time, is Islam. What one is willing to live for, die for, put up with torture, hunger and homelessness for, is the religious and Islamic spirit which we have experienced in Iran. [end recording] In the first sermon Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi- Rafsanjani referred to the role of programs about worship, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. He said the meaningful presence, the revolutionary and Islamic concept and spirit, and the revolutionary fervor of religious centers, the resistance against conspiracies and the continuation of construction was the reason for the success and strength of the society. The interim Friday imam of Tehran added: Iran's all-round reconstruction, especially after eight years of holy defense, is the result of the self-improvement of the Muslim nation of Iran during this auspicious and holy period. Because people make up the pillars of society. If those pillars are strong and robust, and believe in religious principles and beliefs, undoubtedly the society will last. In another part of his sermons the president said: Without the presence of earnest people on the scene to defend the Islamic revolution, the issues of the country, which is under foreign pressure from all sides, could not be advanced. We are in the construction period and with their ploys the enemies intend to dishearten us in that endeavor and bring us to our knees. But our nation, with the alertness which stems from that worship has stood against all those plots and will continue to do so. He expressed the hope that, like the people of Iran, other Muslim nations of the world will find their way and fight off the conspiracies of world arrogance.
