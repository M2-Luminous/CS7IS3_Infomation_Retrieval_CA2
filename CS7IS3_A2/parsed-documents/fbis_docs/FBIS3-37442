Mikhail Poltoranin Is Ready To Give Them Other Channels' Programs"] [Text] The State Duma has also taken to heart "the questions of objective coverage" that used to concern the Supreme Soviet. The Committee for Information Policy and Communications under Mikhail Poltoranin has drawn up a draft State Duma decree designed to resolve the problem of television coverage of the State Duma's activity. In order to persuade the deputies to approve the decree, Mr. Poltoranin has promised them that a corresponding law will be enacted by 21 March. In addition, the deputies have been offered as a present one-third of the entire capacity of the "RTV-Parliament" complex left from the Supreme Soviet. The government and the Federation Council will also take over one-third each. These abstract projects do not suit the deputies, however, who want to make their own television program. Mr. Poltoranin's committee has suggested that before the law is enacted they use a "provisional broadcasting schedule." The schedule, Mikhail Poltoranin said, which has already been approved by chiefs of the "Russia" and "Ostankino" channels, will give the deputies a good half of political programs. Aside from reports on the State Duma's deliberations on the "Russia" channel every Friday and daily reports in the "Vesti" and "Novosti" programs, it is planned to oblige other programs, such as "How We Are Going To Live," "Sirs-Comrades," "A Dialogue Live," and "The Peasants' Question," to give the floor to deputies, and also to have programs such as "Details," "Man and the Law," and so forth, feature "burning reports." It is possible that the deputies will accept so "generous" a present from Mr. Poltoranin today. The chairman of the Committee for Information Policy and Communications, however, has not offered them anything new. It should be noted that even the fact that the television programs are state-owned does not entitle the State Duma to interfere in their authors' activity. This does not seem to be of great concern to Deputy Mikhail Poltoranin, who is trying to push a pig in a poke on his colleagues. State Duma members themselves, as they urge "objective coverage," to all appearances will accept air time in other people's programs without any guarantees, meanwhile drafting a law on how their own activity should be covered. This process may drag on and on, so television viewers are for the time being insured against a torrent of State Duma broadcasts.
