That agreement, if it succeeds, will represent an international legalization of a somewhat revised oral agreement reached half a century ago in Yalta among Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill. This is said in the statement by the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] Presidency. Slovenia, Croatia, and about half the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be under the political and economic patronage of the most developed countries in the world, while Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska republic will be in the sphere of the political influence of Russia. It will be a region that will not be in the position to count on the economic and technological support by the West for a long time, the SPO says. As for the republic of Serbian Krajina, its fate will be decided through negotiations between Zagreb, which is becoming increasingly strong economically, and Knin, which on the other hand is economically weakening. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will most likely find itself with Greece and Albania under the political and economic influence of the West, the SPO Presidency says.
