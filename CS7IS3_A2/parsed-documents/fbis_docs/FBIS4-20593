Therefore, a five-fold axis of symmetry cannot exist in a periodic lattice because it is not possible to fill all space with a connected array of pentagons. However, in 1984, Scechtman, et al.[.sup]1[/] found a material with icosahedral point symmetry in a rapidly solidified Al-Mn alloy. This is the first discovery of ``Quasicrystal.'' Since the discovery, quasicrystals have been found in many kinds, but only metallic alloy systems.[.sup]2[/] It is interesting to inquire whether a quasicrystalline structure can be stable in a covalent bonding system. Boron-rich solids with B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral clusters are great candidates for a semiconducting quasicrystal. This is because the icosahedral point symmetry is typical for quasicrystalline structure. We analyzed the crystalline structure of the _a_-rhombohedral boron as a 0/1-2/0 rhombohedral approximant structure of the icosahedral quasicrystal, and then constructed the _a_-boron type quasicrystal. The cohesive energy of the _a_-, _b_-rhombohedral boron and the _a_-boron type quasicrystal was estimated using a molecular orbital total energy calculation. According to the calculation, realization of the _a_-boron type quasicrystal is expected. Experimental search for semiconducting quasicrystal has been done in the B-C system. The distortion of B[.sub]12[/] is smallest in the B-C system. If the B[.sub]12[/] cluster is distorted spontaneously, there is no reason why the icosahedral symmetry grows. This is why we chose the B-C system. Amorphous films of B[.sub]100-x[/]C[.sub]x[/] (x=3,5 and 7) were prepared by an electron-beam evaporation technique. Then they were examined for the transformation by heat treatment. This is because most of the metallic quasicrystals have been found as a metastable phase in a nonequilibrium process. We found a new phase in the annealing process. The electron and X-ray diffraction patterns from the phase are identified to be that of the 1/0-1/0-0/1 orthorhombic crystalline approximant of the icosahedral quasicrystal. In many cases, the crystalline approximants have been found near the composition or temperature range in which the quasicrystal is formed. Therefore, it is possible to realize the semiconducting quasicrystal in boron-rich solids. References 1. D. Shechtman, I. Blech, D. Gratias, and J.W. Cahn, PHYS. REV.
