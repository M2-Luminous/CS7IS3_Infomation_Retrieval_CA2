Saint Onge is strong in the building of computer-based marketing systems and leads in marketing systems aimed at the multimedia age such as television shopping. Mitsui will offer Saint Onge's technology when assisting Japanese firms in marketing their products in the United States as well as introducing their technology in Japan in expanding its contract distribution businesses. Businesses are in the process of shoring up their competitiveness through the reengineering process. They are taking such action as revising distribution methods so as to expedite marketing procedures by making them more responsive to customer needs, and reducing costs by outsourcing material requirements and consolidating operating units. Mitsui decided to form the partnership with Saint Onge because it sensed a renewed concern by industry for marketing systems. Mitsui will offer consulting services to Japanese firms locating in the United States relative to factory site shipping systems and the location of distribution points. It will also provide specific services in the areas of basic facility and information systems design, selection of necessary equipment, and training of personnel. Mitsui will also provide similar services in Japan and is considering launching related, innovative business services. As an example, it is considering the establishment of in-house delivery services and to offer contract delivery services to manufacturers and retailers requiring frequent, small-lot deliveries. Integrated trading companies are constantly seeking out new sources of products and materials as well as purchasers of such items and possess the capability to market such items. Mitsui aims to reinforce such functions and expand its marketing rights through the recent tie up. Although Saint Onge is medium-sized, it is strong on a technical basis with about 70 percent of its 80 employees comprised of technicians. Recently, it has engaged in merchandise distribution services associated with television shopping networks and Mitsui believes it can use such know-how in the Japanese markets.
