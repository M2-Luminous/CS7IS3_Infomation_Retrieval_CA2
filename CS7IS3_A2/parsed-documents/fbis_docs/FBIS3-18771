"There was no progress overnight in negotiations on fishing," said Spain's Foreign Minister Javier Solana. The main hitch in Norway's membership talks remains demands from Spain and Portugal that their fishing fleets should be able to net 14,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively of cod fish from Norwegian waters each year. Portugal, which considers cod its national dish, bought 40 percent of its total fish imports from Norway in 1993. Norway has also refused to countenance demands from France and Ireland for limits on Norwegian fish exports. The foreign ministers talks, which resumed here this morning, have also faltered over new decision-making procedures to be adopted when Sweden, Finland, Austria and possibly Norway join the Union. Italy, Britain and Spain are demanding changes to the statute to make sure that small nations accounting for only small percentages of total EU population cannot veto decisions.
