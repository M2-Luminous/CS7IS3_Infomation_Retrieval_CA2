The plenary session was followed by the discussions of different work groups. Another plenary session is to take place today. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the replacement of six delegation members. The new members include the head of administration of the Leningrad region Alexander Belyakov, deputy head of administration of the Pskov region Viktor Zvonkov, deputy head of the Russian Federal Migration Service Yuri Roshtchin and department head of the Russian Ministry of Nationalities and Ethnic Policy Lev Shishov. The latter used to be a high-ranking official of the Estonian Communist Party in the Soviet period. Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin expressed his hopes of making progress in the key issues -- the situation of the Russian-speaking residents and the troops withdrawal. Svirin assured that the withdrawal deadline, August 31, is definite, provided Estonia will finance the construction of apartments and will agree with Russia to give up demands for compensation for the military bases and the ecological damage caused by the military. But he added that "Estonia does not meet those three requirements at present and the final troop withdrawal deadline will be agreed upon only after the signing of the corresponding agreements." The Foreign Ministry announced that the Estonian-Russian negotiations may be suspended if the claims of the Russian Foreign Ministry official Alexander Udaltsov will become an official government position. Estonia is willing to discuss all issues including the one on the military pensioners, but will not link them to the troops withdrawal, the Foreign Ministry stressed. Prime Minister Mart Laar described the Russian statements as an attempt to influence Estonia and present new demands. Laar added that the negotiations are practically at a deadlock and pointed out that Russia has stopped the withdrawal of its troops from January 1. The Russian Foreign Ministry official Udaltsov expressed his surprise at the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement and claimed that the Estonian side had been long aware that August 31 was not an officially agreed-upon deadline.
