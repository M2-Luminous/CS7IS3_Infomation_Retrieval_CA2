The system of payments and the unfixed exchange rate of both countries' national currencies are the greatest obstacles on the way to implementing this agreement, the Belarusian Government leader pointed out. The unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, in the opinion of Vyacheslaw Kebich, will not hamper trade and economic cooperation between Moldova and Belarus.
