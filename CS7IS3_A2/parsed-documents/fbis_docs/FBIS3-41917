As Siemens spokesman Rainer Jend said in Hanau upon inquiry, a first shipment of uranium material to the Tomsk nuclear complex in Siberia had already taken place without this so far being made public knowledge. A total of 140 tonnes of ``slightly impure residue'' obtained in the production of nuclear power station fuel elements at Hanau are to be reprocessed in Tomsk by the end of next year. This is stipulated by a ``service contract'' concluded with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. In return, Siemens imports two shipments of about 70 tonnes of so-called enriched uranium-hexafluoride from Tomsk in order to manufacture new fuel elements in Hanau. The nuclear waste produced during processing in Tomsk is disposed of in Russia. According to Siemens, only small quantities are involved. The Siemens spokesman pointed out that the deal with the ``Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises Tomsk,'' a branch of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, has been approved and supported by the responsible German and Russian bodies. According to him, the Federal Radiation Protection Office, the Federal Export Office, and the European nuclear authority EURATOM were involved. As Cay Friemuth, spokesman of the Bonn Environment Ministry, said, the permits were granted as early as in July 1993 with the participation of his Ministry and of the Economics Ministry. The first shipment to Tomsk was sent on its way via the land and sea route on 21 October. According to the regulations of the nuclear law, the permit must be renewed for 1994; this will probably be done, Friemuth said. Upon inquiry by FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, Siemens spokesman Jend said that it is still open whether the 140-tonne project will turn into lasting cooperation with the nuclear complex in Siberia. However, he pointed to the ``cooperation agreement for the field of nuclear fuel circulation,'' which was concluded by Siemens and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov in September. This agreement involved joint projects in, for instance, the construction and storage of fuel elements and the processing of plutonium from the Russian nuclear weapons. The 140 tonnes of impure uranium material, which have accumulated in Hanau, cannot be purified and enriched on site, according to Jend, because the part of the fuel element factory, which would be suitable for this work, has been closed down since a hydrogen explosion on 12 December 1990. Processing in Hanau would be possible only in the new Siemens factory, about the approval of which Siemens and the Hesse land government have been engaged in a legal quarrel for some time. Jend said: ``You must ask Minister (Joschka) Fischer, when we can do that in Hanau.'' Asked about the safety of Russian nuclear factories, Jend said that Siemens experts convinced themselves in Tomsk that the processing would be conducted in line with the internationally usual Purex process and that ``high quality standards'' are achieved in the process. Jend did not accept the reference to the nuclear accident in Tomsk, during which an explosion released plutonium last spring and 200 square kilometers were radioactively contaminated. This ``was in a completely different corner'' of the large nuclear complex, where several thousand people work. In its assessment of the safety in Tomsk, the Environment Ministry relies on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, which has access to Tomsk. Spokesman Friemuth said that his Ministry has to accept the safety standards if the IAEA does not have any indications of irregularities.
