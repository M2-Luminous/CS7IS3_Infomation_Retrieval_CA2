But it enables it to raise the question of confidence in the government. It is fairly likely that the Duma in the very first weeks of its work will get bogged down in debates precisely on this issue. The election results and the composition of the State Duma call for preemptive actions on the part of the president and the prime minister. They must not wait until the Duma raises the question point blank about changing the government composition. It is better to do this by themselves. In that event many upheavals would be avoided. In my opinion, it would be most reasonable to renew the government completely, keeping Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in his post. There are serious grounds for that. The most important among them is that over two years the first stage of reform has been passed and now adjustment of the course is required. Whereas in internal politics adjustment should consist in working out a coherent industrial and social program, what is needed in foreign policy is a clear-cut definition of national and state interests and priorities. Up to now the possibilities of international support by Russian speakers in the neighboring countries have been left absolutely untapped. The United States and Western countries, about which Foreign Minister Kozyrev speaks as of Russia's allies, have not been in any way helping to address problems related to human rights in the former Union republics. Meanwhile these problems have substantially aggravated the internal political situation in Russia, which has been brilliantly used by Zhirinovskiy in his preelection campaign. There is also a psychological dimension, which must not be ignored. The conduct of serious economic transformations always leads to a situation where their social side effects are associated with certain figures. Society has basically gotten tired of the same persons. Their replacement in itself will calm the people and prolong the "benefit of the doubt" even if the economic course remains unchanged. To be sure, to pursue a consistent reformist line a team of like-minded people is needed. The current government is no longer a monolith: It has broken up into several blocs that have vied for seats in parliament. The latter circumstance is always seen in public consciousness as an irritating factor. Today the government especially needs professionals who would be ready to work on a nonpartisan basis. And there is no need for politicians who are thinking about their own political future in the post-Yeltsin Russia, concerned about creating a social and organizational basis for their own participation in the next presidential elections. The need to revise substantially relations between the president and the government is also there. For the president to realize the powers granted him by the new constitution, a strategy of reforms must be formed in the presidential structures. And the government is called upon to implement this strategy. Otherwise Yeltsin will find himself in Gorbachev's situation in 1990-1991 when the USSR president was left with only one option -- to react to the sociopolitical process that had acquired its own logic of development. What is in fact required from the government today? First, to prevent hyperinflation. Second, to conduct a more rational industrial policy. These tasks will confront any cabinet of ministers. But the authorities should be interested in seeing it formed from among the "second echelon" of reformer economists. Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of becoming the conductor of such a course. While formally embodying the industrial lobby in the government, over the year of his premiership he has shown that he understands the laws of macroeconomic regulation and sees the possible negative implications of the "Ukrainization" of the economy. The presence of the constructive "reformist lobby" in the Duma from among the leaders of Russia's Choice, on the other hand, will restrain the new cabinet of ministers from an unduly inflation-oriented policy. But the main guarantor of the continuity of the reform course must be President Yeltsin, ready at any moment to intervene in the government's actions. A renewed cabinet of ministers would undoubtedly receive support from the Federal Assembly for the next year or year and a half. It is not ruled out that a fairly broad left-of-center coalition could be formed in the Duma, oriented toward constructive cooperation with a government that has not tainted itself with "shock therapy." Of course, the president has weighty reasons to doubt the expediency of a complete overhaul of the government. Such people as Gaydar, Fedorov, and Chubays epitomize the reforms. Their electorate is also the most active and consistent electorate of Yeltsin. But proceeding from Russia's long-term interests, the president should distance himself somewhat from the leaders of this orientation. In no case ignore them, but try to use these people in other power structures. Their deputyship gives them such an opportunity. Remaining rigidly linked to one of the groups in the current political spectrum, the president should be prepared to see that this will sharply narrow the social base of transformations, polarize society, and cause damage to the strategic aims of the reform. Yeltsin may -- and not without reason -- fear that he will be charged with "treachery" for "changing the team." It is another matter if the initiative for the renewal of the government comes from Chernomyrdin; for this he will naturally have to present a program for the continuation of the reforms and a concept for a new government. But it would be best if the idea of creating a nonpartisan "cabinet of professionals" were initiated by leaders of Russia's Choice and other partisan factions in the government. This guarantees a conflict-free renewal of the cabinet of ministers and its calm work in the near future. It appears, however, that there will no complete renewal of the government. What follows from this? Most likely the State Duma, where Russia's Choice has no majority, will raise the question of confidence in the government. This would mean a new spiral of confrontation between the representative and executive branches. Of course, the Duma has no serious possibilities of changing the government, and generally its powers are limited. But this conflict, not so important in itself, will have far-reaching implications. The entire responsibility for economic failures will be laid exclusively on the government and the president. In the context of the crisis and the quite probable "popular unrest," even a weak Duma, having embarked down the path of confrontation, is capable of extremely aggravating the political situation. And amid social and political instability nobody has better chances for success than politicians like Zhirinovskiy.
