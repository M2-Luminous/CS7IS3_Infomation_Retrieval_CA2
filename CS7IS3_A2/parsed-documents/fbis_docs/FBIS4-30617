Japanese industry views the current rise of the yen as a "temporary phenomenon." Corporate Japan appears still confident that the economy will head for a substantial recovery in the latter half of the current fiscal year which started in April. But it is also certain that the dollar's slide to below 100 yen in New York trading last Tuesday [21 June] chilled business and consumer confidence, coming as it did at a time when Japanese businesses have started embarking on full-scale restructuring. Despite concerted market interventions by the central banks of the United States and major European countries late last week, the dollar failed to regain strength in New York. The Smokestack Steel Industry in Japan is struggling to bolster its structure that has long been vulnerable to foreign exchange movements. Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, says, "The steel industry seems to have hit bottom," citing an upturn in crude steel production, higher steel prices in international markets and steady growth in exports. On the domestic front as well, the steel industry stands to benefit from a fledgling pickup of its main user, the automotive industry. "We can compete with our overseas rivals if the yen stays around 110 to the dollar," says Reiji Nakato, managing director of Kawasaki Steel Corp. There is a danger of the yen's renewed surge putting a drag on steel manufacturers' cost-cutting, restructuring efforts, however. Says Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of Nippon Steel Corp., "The effect of restructuring will weaken if we fail to achieve production targets. Moreover, we're concerned about a possible cooling-off in consumer confidence." In order to keep consumer sentiment from cooling, Japan needs to take measures immediately to pass benefits from a high yen on to consumers and rectify its external trade imbalances, he says. In the 1980s, Japanese consumers benefited from a strong yen in a limited number of areas, with prices of consumer goods remaining high relative to those abroad. The yen's rapid rise was touched off by the 1985 Plaza Accord reached among finance ministers of the Group of Five (G-5) industrial powers. Of late, however, a price gap between Japan and overseas has been narrowing. An official of major supermarket operator Seiyu Ltd. says, "domestic prices will go down further," expressing a readiness to join in efforts to push down prices by taking advantage of the yen's appreciation. Meanwhile, electrical machinery and automobile manufacturers are stepping up "transplant" production by shifting output to their overseas footholds. Toyota Motor Corp. has raised the ratio of overseas production to the total output to 40 percent. The largest Japanese automaker is to discontinue exports of small trucks to the United States next January and churn out such trucks entirely in that country. But industry analysts point out that it seems hard for lower-ranked car manufacturers to boost overseas operations because of weaker financial positions. An auto industry official predicts the yen's unabated strength will bring into bold relief the mixed performances of automakers. Performance gaps between companies and industries are expected to widen for the coming years if the yen stays high.
