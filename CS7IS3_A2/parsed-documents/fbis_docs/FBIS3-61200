However, the question: "which kind of countries should we choose," has still not been taken up so far. Leaving aside the question of a country or a people, is not each person a world unto himself? From that point of view, just as the establishment of relations with each person is in terms of the scope of knowledge, humanity, moral qualities, and nationality, similarly we establish relations with separate families composed of individuals and even with a nation. For that reason the question of the degree of relations with a given country, the need to become known to that country and in what way are leading questions of diplomacy. To answer these questions we must, first of all, before we become known to a country, strive to know that country as much as possible. This is because becoming known, in other words, means "disclosing one's secrets." When secrets have been disclosed, just like the proverb: "the Wolf keeps secret his leanness; do not expose a dog's fur to the dog," one's leanness cannot but be exposed to the light of the day, along with twisted things from a thousand places. But if secrets are not disclosed, we say "stay off a horse which you do not know about [know the secrets of]" and go over to polite [but distant] relations. What a country will do after it has obtained one's secrets, or even a country which has not obtained one's secrets, depends upon the aims and culture of the country in question. In particular, more than distant countries, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of neighboring countries which "come to your village and help you herd your sheep," share your breath, and watch how you lay your pipes. We Kazakhs, who have passed the time taking the view: "a neighbor's pay, the pay of Heaven," with regard to individual families and neighboring auyl, would seem to think of other nations in the same terms. The complicated history of our people over many centuries are clear proof of our words. Nothing more need be said. Has the lack of concern of we Kazakhs during our first relations with the Zhonghar [Dzungar] Khanate not left behind any regrets!? Moreover, you might ask how the Zhonghar Khanate in the east, so many times smaller than the Kazakh Khanate, was able to inflict upon the Kazakh people the disaster of "vagrancy with white heals [in the snow], the deviation [from the trek] out of great suffering." The Zhonghars, through frequent contacts, caught sight of the wide and beautiful Kazakh steppe and laid their plans. In such a time of struggle, the Kazakhs, with their internal "hostility," being separated into hordes and into clans, found out how to carefully exploit their "merits" by becoming 40 knives. Later the Russian colonialists were able to seize the entire Kazakh steppe. They even took special advantage of we Kazakhs' lack of connections with one another, our carefreeness. Thus, as a result of our honored properties, we could not get free of Russia for three hundred years... Leaving other things aside, forgetting that a nation is an independent state, we [should] investigate the peoples and regions within that country. After we have carried on our research, we form many special organizations of various kinds and go on researching, wasting a lot of money. For example, there appear to be tens of organizations in the Chinese People's Republic researching Central Asia (Kazakhstan in particular, as its foundation). Kazakhstan has not formed such organization since its independence. On the other hand, they were formed during the time that the USSR was strong and in its prime. Not long after the Republic of Kazakhstan declared its independence, a book entitled "General Condition of the Republic of Kazakhstan" suddenly appeared in China. When the book was published, it represented, to be sure, no general effort. The Central Asia Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region wrote and published the book. At present, young students who go to study at institutions of higher education must take examinations based upon that book. You can understand if intelligent people do not say what is really behind the "good will..." It is enough to remember only the need to take examinations based upon the book in China. As for Kazakhstan, whether it is research institutions, or educational institutions, we are only concerned about ourselves. At the most, we learn or research foreign languages. But there is no a single organization carrying out special research about our near neighbors, or about other countries in the world connected with us. On the contrary, there are some unneeded organizations now functioning, for example, the Uighur Research Institute under the National Academy of sciences. This organization is now superfluous. In our view, this institute should be reorganized as a Turkology institute. This is because it is hard to understand what possible need Kazakhstan should have for making special efforts to research our Uighur kinsmen among the Turkic peoples. In fact, if state finances improve, it would be all the more wonderful if we should create research institutes for every one of our Turkic-speaking kinsmen. However, everyone understands that just now our young republic is utterly without resources. For that reason, if there is not an Uighur Research Institute but a Turkology Institute under the Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, this would make it convenient for us to study the languages, history, cultures, literatures, art, national political economies, and education of Turkey, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Karakalpakistan, the Uighurs, Bashqurt, Tartars, and the Turkic- speaking countries and fraternal peoples. One thing which we cannot forget to mention in this context is one "quality" remaining in Kazakhstan, especially among the Kazakh people, from our former irresolution and obsequiousness. And what is this: "unreasonable trustfulness." For example, when the Uighur Research Institute was formed, Uighurs were hired there as a matter of course. If a Korean or German research division was established, it was filled up with Koreans and Germans gathered from here or there. Does not the question arise of exactly whom one wants to study when one establishes Uighur research and nationality research departments? One should not say, when establishing an institute or opening a division , "know yourself;" the Uighur people knows itself very well and likewise the Korean and the German people. In this connection we must know a people, that is, the Uighurs, the Koreans, the Germans, or the Kazakh people. For that purpose the research workers of that institute must be Kazakhs. Only then will they view the people, who are their subjects, from a Kazakh point of view and be able to solve urgent questions in the interests of Kazakhs. What this means is research in ideological areas serving Kazakhstan. However, it is altogether unfortunate that there is no research organization specially intended to study our great neighbor to the East, the Chinese People's Republic. The establishment as soon as possible of a Chinese research division, if need be within the Oriental Research Institute of the Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, is urgently needed for our young republic. This is because China is a country with an age- old culture. Today it has many people and a great history. It is a powerful country. Study of its history, and knowing the composition of its peoples, understanding the secret of the quick prosperity of what was only recently a poor country, would doubtless teach Kazakhstan many lessons. For our republic to have China as a neighbor is certainly no easy thing. This widely known nation caresses the feet of Singapore. This unsparing country wears the shroud of Vietnam. For that reason, it is proper to follow the path of Japan, Korea, and India in maintaining neighborly relations with China. These countries are like the greatest friends of China, but do not allow a single Chinese to live on their soil. As for us? China, which is covered by a billion and a half people without discord, is a master of rich economic experience. The whole world market is heating up, and, today, when the market simply consumes any disorganized nation, we see ourselves quietly passing the time as a nation combining few people, a lot of land, and such riches. But we have no reason to be complacent. Under such circumstances, there is not a little we can learn from China where the peoples economy is developing rapidly year by year in addition to guaranteeing a billion and a half people work and food. Is the Chinese People's Republic at present saying that "there are no disputes over land with Kazakhstan, no border questions?" No it is not. The idea is that the Zhetisu [Semiryechye] and Balqash regions of today's Kazakhstan is our land. It was stolen from our country at one time by an unequal czarist Russian treaty, which is described in school and higher education textbooks, and which continues to be instilled into the minds of the younger generation. God only knows what cunning things the present younger generation, who have been tempered with the understanding that "failing to speak of evil is not good thing," and who will inherit the nation in the future, will do. For that reason, if our leaders do not deal with these kinds of gnawing questions now, it is difficult to say that Kazakhstan's future will be quiet. Thus we must carry on a thorough research about Chinese history, China's historical territories, and the historical circumstances whereby the Kazakh steppe was divided up by the bayonet. There are in the Chinese People's Republic also, in addition to close Kazakh, Uighyr, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Tatar relatives, our [other] Turkic-speaking kinsmen. To advance a more or less open view about the fate of Turkistan, where these peoples live, or to take any sudden action, could have a negative influence upon the friendship of the two countries. From this point of view, it is proper that our Uighur kinsmen do nothing extremely disorganized and that the Kazakhs keep their mouths shut. This is because China is a "dragon" that one should not come in conflict with. For that reason, every citizen of Kazakhstan must offer carefully considered thought and views or, as it is written, "measure ten times, cut once." It is proper that government delegations, trade and cultural organizations, tourists, etc. from Kazakhstan be completely prudent and alert. We, Kazakhs, must absolutely not joke about this or be negligent, and must always be careful about what we say. This is because, as a "consequence" of many centuries of close interaction with Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, and, in particular, as a result of 70 years of internationalism, we have come to completely understand these peoples. And, whatever the connection, the inhabitants of our republic know the characteristics, personalities, cultural, feelings, and other sides of these peoples like the five fingers on their hands. However, our ancestors (from Uisin to Abylaykhan) have had no contact with China. We have no experience with such relationships. That is to say, our relations with China are starting only now. For that reason we cannot enter into relations until we know completely the national character, qualities, and personal feelings of the Chinese people. Only when this is the case, can Kazakhstan and China live together as friendly neighbors in peace. However, if we do not understand, and if we do not do our research, if we close our eyes in Kazakh foolhardiness, if we say "it really does not matter," and sign any kind of agreement or decision, and are not careful, it will weigh heavy upon the fate of the people. This is the problem. Our contemporaries today, thinking about the future of the nation, loving their country, are saying and writing that "China is on the move." The concerned organizations must make a great effort to take preventive measures against this sort of thing. However, there is no once concerned with the question "in what ways and how is China on the march?" Do we remember the friendship visit of Republic Premier S. Tereshchenko to the Chinese Peoples Republic during the early spring of 1992 and all the "hoopla?" During that trip Tereshchenko signed some 10 treaties. To be sure, such great comings and goings in the international arena by Kazakhstan, friendly relations with such major countries, are something to be proud of. However, it is a well-known fact that every other step of an inexperienced young country will not be an entirely lucky one. Leaving aside the others, we will discuss one of the 10 treaties. "Economic, trade, and cultural comings and goings between the Chinese People's Republic and Kazakhstan will not require visas. Visits by individuals for personal reasons will, as before, require visas." That is to say, Chinese "delegations" coming for trade, for kin, for an excursion, and for other reasons do not have to appear one by one before our chief ambassador in Beijing, Murat Awyezov. We were shocked to hear from one of our Chinese friends on "trade:" The Chinese People's Republic is going to send hundreds and thousands of delegations to Kazakhstan... Thus, if the Chinese are not on the march in Kazakhstan, who is? Why should the Chinese, who even without this are overflowing China's boundaries, not appear in multitudes taking advantage of favorable "decisions." Is it not a matter of "a stray arrow also hits some sad soul." On the other hand, our kinsmen in China never get to the Kazakhstan Embassy in Beijing. They have difficulty getting a visa to travel on personal business to Kazakhstan. One of our kinsmen from China said that, when village people come with bribes to go to Beijing, their wish is not granted. See how we have harmed out kinsmen through that "agreement" draw up to give unlimited rights to China! "If leather rains from the skies, the slave will still have no shoes," as the old saying goes. To make the matter short, Chinese are flooding into Kazakhstan and the Kazakhs cannot come. This is something we "did" to ourselves. Since the premier has gone and signed a treaty which "created no barriers to those coming for trade, tourism, or excursions," if we now say "get out!" to Chinese citizens coming on such "business," the Chinese government will come and say to us: "Oh Kazakhs, if you are going to be a country you have to keep your word. If you are not, be ready to fight." Who can blame them? This is because, as we have said above, a billion and a half people are pressed for space and having a difficult time. For that reason, the primary policy of that government carried out by Chinese citizens is: "inside China, or without, be it as it may, look out for yourself." For that reason, there seems to be no limitation placed on China's citizens wishing to go abroad. For China knows well that it cannot find, even if it looks everywhere in this world, a[nother] country like Kazakhstan which is very rich, which has abundant land, few people, and little understanding about itself, and which is furthermore a neighbor and a careless, trusting young nation. This is because several countries where the Chinese had the possibility of entry have had other thoughts after the "Singapore Tragedy." For example, Germany once and for all halted the coming of Chinese three years ago. Leaving aside other things, the nationality of Taiwan and Hong Kong is Chinese, but these countries have begun to set limits on those coming from the Chinese People's Republic. It has been two or three years since America itself, the great country on the other side of the world, enacted a resolution preventing Chinese from coming. Judging from this, only Kazakhstan opens its arms widely to Chinese and creates special opportunities for them. If something is not done about our China policy, there is no use saying: "we will clean up the Chinese problem." The reason is that if one throws out a thousand Chinese for a couple of months, a few thousand more arrive in a few weeks. Some thoughtful people are grumbling at home, but, as long as the "Beijing Treaty" signed by Li Tan and Tereshchenko stands, it will simply not be possible to do anything about the Chinese stream flooding in. This is the result of the treaty, along with the "love" inside Kazakhs for the Chinese. Thus, when the market has us by the throat, in a difficult time when the high cost of things tugs at our garments, can one take into careful consideration the Kazakh who bends down when he sees a dollar in the road. It is no secret that the Chinese, who are flooding into Kazakhstan as their future home, are buying interesting Kazakh things and Kazakh women. When you give your daughter in marriage, it is for love. That is what it is. This is because, if we are really Kazakhs, from where would we get the idea of "feasting sons-in-law who are not Muslims?" Now it is impossible to send back the Chinese...however one decides to do it. The only way is to review the treaty in question. When it has been reviewed, all comings and goings between Kazakhstan and China will be by visa. If the treaty in question is annulled, licenses will be sold to firms exporting to China and this will be made a source of income. Thereby the likes of Kazakhstan business people, affected by the entry of thousands of Chinese, will be able to get on their feet. That is the sum total of it. We have said a great deal, and we have said very little. All of this springs from our not knowing the Chinese properly. This is because the Chinese are not the Russians you know, who say "thanks brother" in their happiness at a five kopek profit. These are not our Uzbek elder brothers who set out with their right hands in the robes. They are also not our Kirghiz kinsmen who come wandering about and who come when we want them and return, saying "Oh Kazakhs, may it be so!" The Chinese are a people who do not let others know their secrets easily, who are particularly cunning, falsely polite, completely vindictive, sullen in character, and who are venturesome, carefully fulfilling plans set for the centuries. China is a great country to our east. It is not easy to be a true neighbor to China. To achieve that, first of all, we need to form a special China research institute and have it take part in official research in order to obtain correct knowledge and a clear view about China. Even if we call it a "China" research institute in the old way, we must make a special effort to prevent Chinese from filling up the ranks of that organization. In conclusion, today everything is needed for an independent Kazakhstan. Among these things, we particularly need knowledge about other countries in the world. For this reason, it would be good to form organizations to research the countries very much connected with the interests and fate of Kazakhstan. If such research organizations prepared information and materials for the branches of the government, we would avoid the type of hastiness described above. For that reason, my brothers, we must love our hard-won independence with the sincere love of our hearts and learn how to defend it to the utmost of our abilities.
