The current split in the Ohrid municipal committee of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] is the reason for our conversation with the party's general secretary, Boris Zmejkovski. As we reported in the last two issues, there are two parallel party leaderships in Ohrid, with both of them claiming that they are legitimate. As they say, they are using the same offices, but they are using two different seals. The consequences of this situation are quarrels among the membership but also uncertainty among Ohrid residents, caused by the break-ins at the party offices, the threats, the rumors about corruption, and even the rumors about preparations for an assassination attempt against the party's leaders. [VECER] Why hasn't the party leadership reacted yet to this situation, which has been going on for several months? [Zmejkovski] First, I would like to say that it is right that the quarrels in our party are being published in the news media, in contrast to the conflicts in other parties, about which people keep silent. We are likewise grateful, however, that you contacted the party's leadership, since I hope that this will be the beginning of the end of this kind of mystery about what is happening now in Ohrid. It has to do with the inappropriate and undisciplined behavior of certain members--instigators and street brawlers--some of whom even dared to confiscate food products in the name of the party, such as Tane Markovski. Those members were expelled from the VMRO-DPMNE. According to the statute, the party's general secretary is authorized, in the event of internal disagreements or passivity, to conduct dismissals and appointments in the municipal committees until conditions are created for the election of a new president. Milco Spirovski, who is authorized by the VMRO-DPMNE, is legitimate for our party in Ohrid. We did not react until now because we are examining the incidents; we also have statements by citizens of Ohrid. Changes cannot be made overnight. Second, it is not usual to make public announcements immediately about internal party conflicts. [VECER] So it is not true that you deliberately did not react to let the stronger faction win? [Zmejkovski] We never choose between the stronger and the weaker faction in any case. Certainly it is least of all in our interest to have schisms in municipal committees. The main thing is for the program to be respected. If that is not done, anyone can be expelled from the party. [VECER] Since there are two party seals in Ohrid, can you explain which one is valid? [Zmejkovski] The seal of the people who are authorized by the party is the valid one. Back in September I sent a letter to the dismissed president telling him to return the party seal, pointing out that he could face party and criminal proceedings. He did not even come to turn over the seal, however, so a seal that is not valid is being misused. [VECER] What is happening with the party offices, which are being used by both camps? [Zmejkovski] The unauthorized ones do not have any right to use those offices. Regardless of who bought or rented them, they are party offices and as such are part of the party's inventory. If anyone leaves the party, he cannot say that the party's property is his own personal property; he never had it. [VECER] How do you view the announcements by the unauthorized faction that it will completely clear up the situation and the rumors that an early VMRO-DPMNE congress will be demanded? [Zmejkovski] That is demagogy and ordinary illusions. It is the same thing as saying that the UDBA [State Security Administration], which created the quarrels in the party, will be fully cleared up. I can only say that those people have a very incorrect orientation and they are getting carried away. There are no malcontents in VMRO-DPMNE. I personally do not have anything against those who feel that way forming another party. The State Security Service [SDB] Phenomenon [VECER] I also asked the question because we are getting the impression that there are also serious conflicts in other cities where the VMRO-DPMNE was quite stable, for instance Bitola, Veles, Kicevo, and Prilep. [Zmejkovski] It is really a phenomenon, perhaps unfamiliar to someone, but quite familiar to us. It is a consequence of the continued operation of the SDB. Naturally, they strike against the stronger committees; they do not have any interest in striking against the more passive committees. [VECER] How do you explain the fact that the "unauthorized" ones are claiming that members of the other faction in Ohrid distributed Bulgarian leaflets? [Zmejkovski] I will repeat: The leaflets were distributed in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] by the Communist Party, headed by its leadership, under the auspices of Tito Petkovski. Now that all of this is known, it is incomprehensible to me that the "unauthorized ones" are saying that the other group did it. The unauthorized ones are no longer members of our party and probably joined us for other reasons--in this case it is clear that they are working for the interests of another party and under its instructions, solely in order to destroy the VMRO-DPMNE. [VECER] Are you taking seriously the rumors about assassination attempts against the party's leadership? [Zmejkovski] It is a serious matter that we will certainly examine seriously. Perhaps it is also a matter of slander, and the party will hold accountable those who made those statements. I would rather not go into further discussions of this issue, however. I would like to say that we will institute proceedings regarding the seals, and the police have already been informed about the offices. Nevertheless, it should be noted that when the VMRO-DPMNE lodges complaints, the police investigations take a very long time. [VECER] Don't you suspect that such quarrels within the party could lead to a decline in the number of members and in the party's standing? Specifically, it is being said in Ohrid that that is precisely what will happen as a result of the recognition of the authorized representatives' legitimacy. [Zmejkovski] I would not agree that the people there will contribute to a loss of membership, since every member and voter makes decisions independently, and by clearing up the situation we can only win new members.
