In a statement, NDF Vice Chairman Luis Jalandoni branded the information as a form of "disinformation" aimed at "diverting attention from the current massive protests of the people against Mr. Ramos' policies." Former Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello was recently quoted as saying he received a communication from exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison announcing the holding of preliminary talks either in Europe or Vietnam next month. Jalandoni said the claim was untrue and baseless. Indicating that the talks have even become uncertain, he said, "The NDF leadership, in considering possible preliminary or exploratory talks between the NDF and the government of the Republic of the Philippines, is taking into account the deep and widespread anger of the people against the Ramos regime's imposition of intolerable burdens on them, while continuing to be subservient to the IMF and World Bank and the foreign monopolies." He also protested the government's recent move allowing detained rebel Arturo Tabara to be temporarily released on bail. Tabara is among the so-called rejectionists in the communist movement who are opposed to the leadership identified with Sison. By releasing Tabara, Jalandoni said the government was merely coddling "renegades and expellees" from the Communist Party of the Philippines. "If the Ramos regime is indeed serious in improving the climate for peace talks, it should release the more than 350 political prisoners," he said. Jalandoni accused the government of disinterest in the peace efforts and of resorting again to "psywar schemes." Meanwhile, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon (Laban) [Lakas ng Bayan -- People's Power] yesterday urged President Ramos to declare an eight-day unilateral cease-fire during the Holy Week, in observance of the Lenten season. The suspension of offensive military operations (SOMO), Biazon proposed, should run from 28 March to 24 April, four days longer than the usual cease-fire period government declares during the Holy Week. Biazon pushed for an extended Lenten cease-fire due to the success of the extended cease-fire government declared last Christmas season. Traditionally, government declares a six-day cease-fire during the holiday season, but last year, it declared a 17-day SOMO, which Biazon said gave both soldiers and rebels and the people in the affected communities a respite from the armed struggle.
