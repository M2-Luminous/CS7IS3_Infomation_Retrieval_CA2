FR940119-2-00035 FR940119-2-00020 7. Northwest Pipeline Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;170&hyph;000] Take notice that on January 4, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;170&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon approximately 7.7 miles of 10-inch pipeline and a meter station in Grady County, Oklahoma, by transfer to Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), all as more fully set forth in the application which is open to the public for inspection. Northwest proposes to abandon by transfer 7.7 miles of 10-inch pipeline and a meter station, known as the ``Mustang Line,'' in Grady County to WNG. Northwest used the Mustang Line to transport residue gas from the outlet of the Conoco-Mustang Processing Plant to WNG's 16-inch Cement Line; however, Northwest's gas purchase contracts with Conoco, Inc. and NGL Production Company have expired. Northwest contends that the Mustang Line is located several hundred miles from its mainline transmission system and uneconomical to continue to own and operate. WNG could operate the Mustang Line as part of its system and provide shippers with access at the Conoco-Mustang Plant without incurring the additional expense of contracting with Northwest. Northwest proposes to abandon the Mustang Line by a dividend at its net book value 8 to The Williams Companies (TWC), the corporate parent of both Northwest and WNG, and TWC would make an immediate capital contribution to WNG. TWC would not hold title to the Mustang Line other than as necessary to effectuate the transfer. Northwest states that WNG would operate the Mustang Line under its blank certificate authorization pursuant to subpart F of part 157 of the Commission's Regulations. 8 Northwest states that the net book value of the Mustang Line, as of October 31, 1993, was $732,844 with an associated deferred tax liability of $223,770. Comment date: January 31, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 8. Northern Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;171&hyph;000] Take notice that on January 6, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68124&hyph;1000 filed, in Docket No. CP94&hyph;171&hyph;000, a request pursuant to §§157.205(b) and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205(b) and 157.212) for authorization to install and operate one small volume measuring station and appurtenant facilities and upgrade one existing delivery point to provide increased natural gas deliveries to Peoples Natural Gas Company, a Division of UtiliCorp United Inc. (Peoples), under Northern's blanket certificate granted September 1, 1982, at Docket No. CP82&hyph;401&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northern states that it requests authority to install a delivery point to accommodate natural gas deliveries under Northern's existing Rate Schedule to Peoples for Craig Dachtera, a residential end-user located in Washington, Minnesota. It is further stated that the upgraded delivery point is commercial and will provide for increased incremental deliveries to the Minnesota Corn Processors town border station located in Platte County, Nebraska. Northern also states that the estimated total volumes delivered to Peoples at the delivery points will be 1.5 MMBtu on peak day and 200 MMBtu annually for residential and 12,000 peak day and 3,000,000 annually for the upgrade. It is stated that the estimated cost to install the new delivery point is $993 and to upgrade the town border station is $4,779. Comment date: February 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
