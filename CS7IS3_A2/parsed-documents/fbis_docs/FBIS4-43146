Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, who is accused of involvement in the murder of a Jordanian diplomat, told a Beirut court he blew up the Pan Am airliner which exploded over Scotland in December 1988 killing 270 people. Sha'ban is a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the Palestinian terror organisation led by Abu-Nidal. But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have stated many times we believe that there is a case to be answered in a court in Scotland or the US involving two Libyans." Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives of the victims of flight 103, said the claim "should be regarded with grave suspicion." He added: "It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu-Nidal organisation." The belief that Libya is to blame for the bombing was repeated by Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, in the Dimbleby Lecture on Sunday [12 June]. Both Britain and the United States are demanding that Libya hand over the two suspects, 'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali al-Migrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fuhaymah, for trial in either country. The Abu-Nidal group has close links with Libya, but officials say it has not been identified with the Lockerbie atrocity. Nor is the name of Sha'ban well known to the security sources. Sha'ban claimed in court he had repeatedly told the magistrate investigating the assassination that he was the Lockerbie bomber but his claim had never been recorded. Yesterday the likeliest explanation for his "confession" was thought to be a desire to delay a possible death sentence in his current trial. He and two others are charged with killing Na'ib 'Imran Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January. Lebanon has recently begun carrying out the death penalty for murderers. Another theory is that Sha'ban was acting on Abu-Nidal's orders to try to divert attention from his patron Col Al-Qadhdhafi, whose Libyan regime has suffered two years of sanctions over his refusal to give up the suspects.
