But he made clear the Government was not yet ready to back demands for air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces shelling Sarajevo. Britain would, however, be prepared for strikes to protect UN forces. Last week the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot of France, complained UN soldiers were being humiliated and inhibited from taking the action necessary to fulfill their duties. He said the UN must consider "offensive intervention." Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television yesterday before leaving for Brussels last night, rejected suggestions the shelling of Sarajevo during the Christmas ceasefire and other Serb actions meant the time was right for air strikes. While acknowledging the last few days had been "unhappy and frustrating," he underlined the Government's opposition to being dragged into a conflict in Bosnia, saying the conditions for air strikes against ground targets had not been "entirely satisfied." Mr Major added: "All three parties in the dispute have been saying one thing in Geneva about wishing to have peace, but their actions on the ground of their guerrilla groups say precisely the opposite. Everyone is getting very frustrated about that. "The humanitarian position is very serious. It has got worse and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the forces to carry out their role." The conflict in former Yugoslavia is expected to be discussed at today's NATO summit in Brussels despite President Clinton's desire that a meeting called to shape the future of the Alliance should not become bogged down in a dispute over Bosnia. Leaders of the 16-nation NATO alliance will also be discussing the extent to which NATO should scale down and concentrate more on peacekeeping as a rationale for its existence. Mr Major said the alliance was at a pivotal stage. "NATO's role needs to be revised and extended." But there were still a range of trouble spots.... "We need to make sure we don't let our military guard down despite the capacity there is for reductions in military expenditure. Nobody is going to take those too far," he said. He gave his backing to the "Partnership for Peace" plan proposed by Mr Clinton. It offers increased co-operation with East Europe, holding out the prospect of eventual NATO membership. Mr Major sought to play down criticism that the plan had been watered down in the face of Russian protests and would not meet the concerns of East European nations. He said reform in Russia, rather than security guarantees, held the best hope of long-term freedom for the former communist countries. Despite the success of the ultranationalists in last month's Russian elections the reformers still got a majority of the votes.
