FR941220-1-00012 FR941220-1-00004 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The FAA has received a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit coming from the overhead switch panel on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 (MD&hyph;81) series airplane. Investigation revealed that the fire had originated in the area of the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel. Further investigation, conducted by Mason Electric Company (the manufacturer of the emergency power switch), revealed that the emergency power switch, upon exceeding 10,000 switch cycles (off-to-on-to-off) can fail due to wear or overstress. If not replaced in a timely manner, the emergency power switch could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a fire in the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 24&hyph;150, dated March 28, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitively replacing the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at regular intervals. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively replacing the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at regular intervals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. There are approximately 1,990 Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 992 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,434 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,541,568, or $1,554 per airplane, per replacement cycle. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: McDonnell Douglas: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10, &hyph;20, &hyph;30, &hyph;40, and &hyph;50 series airplanes; Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 (MD&hyph;81), DC&hyph;9&hyph;82 (MD&hyph;82), DC&hyph;9&hyph;83 (MD&hyph;83), and DC&hyph;9&hyph;87 (MD&hyph;87) series airplanes; Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes; and C&hyph;9 (Military) series airplanes; as listed in McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 24&hyph;150, dated March 28, 1994; certificated in any category.
