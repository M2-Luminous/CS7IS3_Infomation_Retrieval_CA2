The forces of the bloody military gang of al-Ahmar have continued to direct artillery, rocket, and aircraft fire on al-Dali and the villages around it, and to confront our forces, who are supported by the citizenry. For the ninth time, units from the Republican Guards, the central security forces, the 8th Independent Armored Brigade, and the al-Hamzah Brigade have attacked, in an attempt to break through the our forces' defensive positions -- they were repulsed and sent back to where they came from. Members of these units surrendered and joined our forces, having realized the falsity of the slogans concerning the defense of constitutionality and unity being prattled by the influential al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa. In Qa'tabah and Karish, our heroic defending forces repulsed the forces of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, which had continued its efforts to break through our forces' defensive positions, directing intensive artillery and rocket fire against the villages and houses of innocent civilians. This was an attempt to erode the high morale characterizing the heroic defenders and the masses of the people of Karish, known for their outstanding role in the struggle during all stages of the revolution, and in the defense of unity. In the capital of Abyan Governorate, units from the Amaliqah forces have suffered repeated defeats and have surrendered, with many of their men joining the ranks of our forces. Our forces, after reinforcing the encirclement of their positions, succeeded in storming their positions, even after they sought shelter in the houses, schools, and fields of citizens. At noon today the commanding officer of the 54th Battalion of the Amaliqah forces, Colonel Ahmad Salim al-Nahmi, surrendered, together with what was left of the officers and men of his battalion. They joined the ranks of our forces which, supported by the sons of Zinjibar, Ji'ar, and the surrounding villages, are continuing their operations to take full control of the situation in this governorate.
