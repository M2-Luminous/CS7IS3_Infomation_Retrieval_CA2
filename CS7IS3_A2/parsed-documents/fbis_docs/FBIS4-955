FBIS4-955 "drafr076_c_94040" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 20 Apr South African Press Review for 20 Apr MB2004141594 MB2004141594 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR IFP Election Decision `Turning Point' in ANC-IFP Relationship -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 20 April in a page-18 editorial says Inkatha's decision to participate in the election "means, at a minimum, a drastic diminution in the prospects of kwaZulu/Natal's polling booths becoming a war zone. It means having that super-thorny political question -- where does Zulu support reside? -- at last answered in the only true way it could ever be answered, with potentially immense implications for understanding kwaZulu/Natal and thereby stabilising the province. It means Inkatha brought into parliament, as opposed to standing outside looking in aggrieved and dangerous." The agreement also "contains at least the seeds of a lasting turning point by which the ANC-IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] relationship may grow away from brutal enmity into constitutional rivalry." However, it is "all too easy to expect too much. We will not all of a sudden find doves and peace songs in the bullet-split air around, for instance, the Thokoza hostels." But THE STAR believes a process has been started that may lead to "a steady cooling of the conflicts, led by a downscaling of the slanging matches from political leaders." Peacekeeping Force in Townships `Major Mistake' -- A second editorial on the same page declares that the decision to deploy the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) in East Rand townships "was a major mistake." "Within days of its taking over from the SADF [South African Defense Force], Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus once again became killing fields." "The TEC [Transitional Executive Council], which was responsible for the establishment of the NPKF, must bear a heavy share of responsibility. By pressing for the deployment of hastily trained soldiers in an area notoriously difficult to police, the TEC has exhibited classic symptoms of political conceit and myopia." BUSINESS DAY IFP Election Decision `Fairly Balanced' Deal -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 April in its page-6 editorial believes the country owes Kenyan Professor Washington Okumu "a great debt for pushing his way into a mediation process that Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington and five others had already given up on." However, "no one should be naive enough to believe what the agreement reached yesterday guarantees peace. Angola provides a stark warning that an election does not mean that all participants will abide by its results." BUSINESS DAY says the election deal "provides only a framework for overcoming constitutional differences. It does not resolve them. In the end, Buthelezi blinked first. He had to. He did not abandon (or perhaps he returned to) the realm of reason and strategic thinking. He chose the better of two bad options." But "the ANC too, has been forced to give ground, and for good reason. While some of its leaders may have believed Buthelezi could be vanquished by brute force and financial deprivation, others, knowing well the classical theories of guerrilla warfare, realised that the process would be debilitating and that success was far from guaranteed." Although the ANC's concession is "not as stark as those made by Buthelezi," the ANC had to agree "to postelection mediation." The ANC has "effectively removed from the ambit of the Constitutional Assembly that forum's powers in the most crucial constitutional area--regionalism. This, after all, was Inkatha's main objective in the first place. It looks like a fairly balanced and therefore workable, deal." SOWETAN IFP Election Decision `Last-Minute Reprieve' -- Referring to the IFP decision to participate in the April election, Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 April says in a page-8 editorial "the last-minute reprieve comes at a time when some were squaring up for a civil war that would have brought untold damage to this country and its people." "It has been a long haul but our final word is to congratulate Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela and Dr Buthelezi."
