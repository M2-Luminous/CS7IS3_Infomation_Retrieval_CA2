ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) is amending certain portions of its permanent program regulations governing permanent and temporary impoundments at surface and underground mining operations. The revisions are in response to a court action, and for clarification. OSM is also addressing issues raised in a petition to initiate rulemaking that would define the statutory distinction between temporary and permanent impoundments. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective November 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald E. Stump Jr., P.E., Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, U.S. Department of the Interior, Ten Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220; Telephone: 412&hyph;937&hyph;2164. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background II. Discussion of Final Rule and Comments III. Procedural Matters I. Background The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act, or SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq ., sets forth general regulatory requirements governing surface coal mining and the surface impacts of underground coal mining. Environmental protection performance standards for permanent water impoundments constructed during surface mining activities appear in section 515(b)(8) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(8); provisions governing the construction of siltation structures, a type of impoundment, appear in section 515(b)(10)(B), 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(10(B). Section 516(b)(10) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1266(b)(10), imposes similar requirements for water impoundments that are used for underground mining activities, but provides that the Secretary shall make such modifications in the requirements as are necessary to accommodate the distinct differences between surface and underground mining. OSM's regulations governing the design, construction and inspection of impoundments call upon criteria established by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). SMCRA at section 515(b)(8)(B) specifically references SCS's Public Law 83&hyph;566 as a performance requirement that must be met in the design and construction of permanent impoundments. Existing OSM regulations governing impoundment stability and margin of safety include MSHA regulations by reference. OSM has defined ``impoundment'' at 30 CFR 701.5 to be any holding structure containing water, sediment, slurry, or other liquid or semi-liquid. OSM rules regulate both temporary and permanent impoundments. Sediment ponds and siltation structures are by current OSM definition specific types of impoundments. The permanent regulatory program for surface coal mining and reclamation operations was promulgated on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15312). Requirements for sedimentation ponds and siltation structures at surface mining activities were established at 30 CFR 816.46 (44 FR 15400), while those for underground mining at 30 CFR 817.46 (44 FR 15426) to implement the provisions of section 515(b)(10)(B) of the Act. Requirements for permanent and temporary impoundments at surface mining activities and underground mining activities were established in the 1979 rules at 30 CFR 816.49 (44 FR 15401) and 30 CFR 817.49 (44 FR 15428), respectively to implement provisions of section 515(b)(8) of the Act. Permitting requirements for reclamation and operation plans for impoundments at surface mining activities and underground mining activities were established in the 1979 rules at 30 CFR 780.25 (44 FR 15360) and 30 CFR 784.25 (44 FR 15368), respectively. During revisions to the permanent regulatory program in 1983, OSM replaced most of the specific design criteria in 30 CFR 816.46 (48 FR 44051) and 816.49 (48 FR 44004) with performance standards. Furthermore, §816.46 was renamed, ``Hydrologic balance: Siltation Structures,'' to be consistent with the wording of section 515(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act and to reflect rule changes which provided for the use of certain siltation structures other than sedimentation ponds, such as chemical treatment facilities or mechanical structures that have a point-source discharge. Upon issuance, the 1983 rules for 30 CFR 816.46 and 816.49 were challenged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II), No. 79&hyph;1144 (D.D.C. July 15, 1985) (In Re: Permanent (II)). The court remanded: (1) Sections 816.49 (a)(3) and (a)(5)(i) on the basis that they included requirements for a static safety factor and for foundation investigation and laboratory testing of small sedimentation ponds without having included such requirements when the rule was proposed on June 21, 1982, as required by the Administrative procedure Act; and (2) Section 816.49 to the extent it relied only on MSHA impoundment size classification standards when OSM had not justified reliance solely on such standards. Slip op. at 30&hyph;32 and 102&hyph;117. Additionally, in response to plaintiff's challenge of the combination spillway requirement of §816.49(a)(8), the Secretary of the Interior agreed to reexamine the issue and consider proposing a rule specifying that one spillway that can safely pass the design precipitation event may serve as a combination principal and emergency spillway.
