Shortly after President de Klerk and his press and party entourage left the township, the men were stoned and security sources said they had been removed to safety while negotiations through the peace committee attempted to defuse the situation. One of the victims was Mr Simon Maseko. All three men, wearing NP paper caps, were waiting for President de Klerk's arrival, and later spent some time talking to him before the NP leader addressed a gathering crowd, mostly hostile ANC [African National Congress] supporters. "They die tonight," one ANC supporter was heard to say.
