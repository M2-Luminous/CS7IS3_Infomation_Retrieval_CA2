FR941012-0-00084 FR941012-0-00011 For two reasons, however, OSHA has decided against specifying an undercut exception for trees of a certain size. First, there is no agreement among the commenters on what size tree could be safely exempted from the undercutting requirement. There is evidence in the record, that manually felling trees of the size that some commenters say should be exempted from the requirement can pose a serious hazard to fellers (Tr. OR 265&hyph;69, 485&hyph;88). Also, while commenters agreed that unmerchantable trees did not require undercutting, none agreed on what size tree constituted an unmerchantable tree. The estimates of what sizes were considered to be merchantable trees varied greatly, from 3 to 10 inches DBH, depending on the type of wood being harvested (Ex. 5&hyph;46; Tr. OR 265, 485&hyph;88). And, as some commenters have pointed out, trees included in this range of sizes can pose hazards to fellers. Second, some commenters said that any tree that is considered merchantable is undercut, even if it is within the range of sizes that commenters say should be exempted. According to commenters the undercut is also made in merchantable trees to prevent splitting of the product (Tr. OR 284&hyph;88). As such, undercutting may be done on small trees in any event. OSHA does note that in many cases when trees are determined to be unmerchantable they are not manually felled but rather slashed by mechanical means (Tr. OR 265, 268&hyph;69, 285&hyph;87, 421&hyph;22). This provision on undercutting does not apply to trees felled by mechanical means. b. Backcut requirement. The second issue regarding manual felling on which OSHA requested comment was where backcuts should be required to be made. In the proposed standard, OSHA required that backcuts be made above the horizontal cut of the undercut. The 1978 ANSI logging and various State logging standards contain similar requirements (e.g., Ex. 38K). Several commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). These commenters said a backcut above the horizontal cut is necessary to assure that the tree does not fall in an unintended direction. However, other commenters said OSHA should permit backcuts to be at the same level or below the level of the undercut (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;52, 9&hyph;1; Tr. W2 229&hyph;31, OR 395&hyph;96, 421&hyph;24, 499&hyph;500). Some said that a same level backcut was more effective:
