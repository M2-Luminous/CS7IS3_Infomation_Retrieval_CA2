The research is based on analysis of polls conducted between 1984 and 1994. Seventy-one percent support autonomy in the territories, while 31 percent support the establishment of a Palestinian state. Support for the Oslo accord is declining but a majority still support it. Only six percent believe that the government is dealing properly with the country's problems. Some 34 percent said that the government is dealing with the issues satisfactorily, while 61 percent are dissatisfied with its handling of the situation. Thirty-two percent believe that most Arabs aspire to annihilate Israel and kill all the Jews. Twenty-three percent believe that the Arabs "only want to conquer Israel." Thirty-three percent believe that the Arabs want "to get back the lands they lost in 1967." On the Oslo agreement: 36 percent support a Gaza-Jericho agreement, 25 percent "are not sure about the agreement," and 32 percent "oppose the agreement." Support for the agreement under the latest poll is lower than in the December 1993 poll when 48 percent backed it. Those interviewed think the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has been weakened over the years, but that if the peace negotiations succeed it will be able to regain its power. Eighty-four percent believe the Gaza Strip should be returned. Ten percent are ready to return East Jerusalem. On the settlements: a third supports them, a quarter opposes them, and the remainder are ready to support them for security reasons. Fifty-five percent oppose uprooting settlements under a permanent arrangement. Thirty-four percent are "very opposed" to such a move, and 21 percent oppose it "to some extent." The remainder, 45 percent, "definitely support uprooting settlements." On Syria, 46 percent are not prepared to return any part of the Golan Heights while seven percent are ready to return all of the plateau.
