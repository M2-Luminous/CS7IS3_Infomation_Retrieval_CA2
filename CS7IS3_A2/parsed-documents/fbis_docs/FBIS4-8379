This is not the first time that certain Greek circles -- for which the Greek Government swears it has no knowledge of -- have provoked the escalation of a situation of violence and tension south of Albania with the aim of destabilizing the new Albanian democracy and creating the conditions for the realization of Greater Greece aspirations. Statements by representatives of the most nationalist clergy in the presence of Greek Government officials and the case of the Greek priest who, fairly enough, was shown his proper place, and many others culminate in the act of open terrorist attacks. The government of Kosova expresses the outrage of its people and cannot but assess that in these actions, it sees a coordination with the Serbian policy in Kosova and Serbia's efforts to open the southern front. On this occasion, we want to remind Greece and Serbia that any kind of attempt to open this front will be confronted with the common answer of all Albanians and all the consequences it can bring. The government of the republic of Kosova thinks the chairman of the EC Presidency should clearly dissociate itself through concrete actions to condemn state terrorism and prevent such phenomena before they take on Balkan dimensions. The statements on a policy of good neighborliness and barbarous terrorism do not correspond to the European climate. Reminding that our neighbor has problems with more than one country on its borders, we call on the international community, the European Union, and other organizations to examine the respect of international rights from its members and take relevant measures to preserve democratic, common European values, the statement by the government of the republic of Kosova states.
