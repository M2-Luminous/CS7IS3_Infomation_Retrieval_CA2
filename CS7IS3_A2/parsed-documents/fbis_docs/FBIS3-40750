The long negotiations over the Generalised Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, incorporating the Dunkel proposals, have ended in Geneva, and in Delhi our government, having accepted the Geneva document, has defended its decision to accept it. It is one thing to accept the new global trade regime as a fait accompli and another to espy in it virtues which do not exist. When the Minister, in defence of the Geneva outcome, talks of globalisation and gain in world trade turn-over of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, he is repeating the obvious, without hazarding even a guess at India's likely share in this rise. What India's agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry would lose is by now known. Is there any justification for understating this grievous loss? India gains nothing if the government's spokespersons gloss over this side of the reality. The West's agribusiness and food industry would gain the most--at the expense of Third World farming countries. If GATT ensures world trade expansion of even $2 billion a year, that would be only one per cent of the world's gross national product. A large part of this gain, to judge by the concessions the US has extracted under the Dunkel proposals, would go to Euro-American food MNCs--BSN Groupe, Unilever NV, UBS, among others. These will have ensured access to Asian markets which were closed to them. Even the concessions the US was obliged to make to the French farmers would give protection to temperate zone farm produce, not to the tropical agricultural products. Euro-American pharmaceutical companies have reason to celebrate the occasion. At last they would be able to extract the pound of flesh from countries like India which have made considerable progress in being self-sufficient in the manufacture of basic life-saving drugs. These MNCs have long been demanding that India pay them royalty for "imitating" their unpatented drugs. Prices of medicines are bound to increase if the Indian pharmaceutical industry is made to cough out royalty for the drugs it has long been manufacturing on its own. One only hopes that in his natural anxiety to welcome the Geneva outcome the Commerce Minister did not understate the effect the new GATT regime will have on India's pharmaceutical industry. Already Zeneca, a drugs MNC, is talking of the money it would recover from Third World "imitators." When France threatened to block the Dunkel proposals on farming the US made concessions and the European Community loosened the purse strings to give more subsidy to French farmers. When Portugal said that it [would] walk out rather than endanger its uncompetitive textiles industry, the EC allayed Portugese opposition by guaranteeing $455 million as compensation for five years. The Indian defenders of Dunkel have not said how the Geneva meeting has met India's grievances concerning farm produce, compulsory food import, patenting of seeds, cut in fertiliser and electricity subsidies and the continuance of non-tariff protectionist measures affecting low-cost, labour-intensive commodities export. While non-tariff measures will continue to deter India's export of textiles and stitched garments, European manufacturers of better quality clothes will benefit because the raw material prices will decline and the Europeans will gain access to the US market. If the protectionist wall favouring Europe's chemicals MNCs like BASF AG, ICI of the UK, and DSM NV of the Netherlands is lowered, these large firms might be persuaded to relocate their production units to low-income countries where anti-pollution laws are lax, wages low and the governments are bending over backwards to please the large foreign companies. A similar propulsion for relocation of manufacturing business of labour-intensive industrial products may be generated in other areas also. Illustratively, textiles unit may move out of Europe to seek relocation in Afro-Asia. Some "dirty" industries currently under pressure of Europe's anti-pollution laws would probably seek new homes in Third World countries. In a world without the cold war and the developing countries, including the newly industrialised nations, in no position to put up a common front against a global trade regime tooled largely to favour the OECD countries of the northern hemisphere, India alone cannot tilt against the windmills. But what is expected of the government of the day is not adventurism but frankness--the gumption to tell our people that these are the areas where GATT is going to be inequitous to the less developed countries, especially India. If the Indians have decided that discretion is the better part of valour, the French suffer from no such demoralisation. Without the Soviets' shadows over West Europe, the Europeans are able to stand up to the US to say that globalisation cannot mean Americanisation of the globe, and that Europe's culture is not going to be swamped by America's audiovisual floods. France blocked the doors to US films, TV and radio outpourings. Unlike Indians who have gleefully surrendered to the sky-piracy by foreign TV networks, France has managed to exclude the audiovisual products from the new GATT. Europe is not going to be America's cultural colony. If France has reason to resist foreign intrusion of European culture (through opening Europe to US films and TV), India had a great deal more at stake in the Uruguay Round of talks. The pity of it is that we have stopped bothering about our stakes. Had we fought for them and lost, that would have been a different matter. It is clear that we have no stomach for a fight.
