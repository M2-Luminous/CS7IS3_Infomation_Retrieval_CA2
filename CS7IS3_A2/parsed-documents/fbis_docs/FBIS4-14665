Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best possible methods are found to resolve such problems. As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5 tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check (on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400 microroentgen/hr. This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk, chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May. SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor representatives believe that because matters of ecological and radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will be towed to a safe place.
