It is hard to object to the actual idea -- in principle, all parties, groups, and factions loudly declare that they advocate consolidation, cooperation, civil peace, and accord. The agreement proposes finding common points of contact and determining the principles on which the agreement will be based, the commitments that the government and other state organs will assume, and the commitments that parties, trade unions, and public organizations will take on themselves. To oppose this idea would be to oppose the opinion prevailing among the population that it is time to end confrontation, that peace and accord are needed. The agreement on civil peace should not just be a declaration. Having named the points of contact and common aims and tasks, the president should also propose both a mechanism for implementing the agreement and the sides' commitments and the specific political responsibility of those who sign the memorandum. An extensive circle of participants will be invited to sign, that is, representatives of at least 100 public organizations, political parties, trade unions, and religious faiths as well as the power structures -- the president, the government, the Federal Assembly chambers, and the Constitutional Court. That is the intention. As a politician I believe that to oppose it, refusing to participate in the memorandum on accord, would be to demonstrate political ambitions which are far from the people's true interests.
