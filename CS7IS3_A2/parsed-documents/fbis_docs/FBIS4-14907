Instead of defense industry products, the town has gone over to supplying goods for nuclear power stations at home and abroad. In an interview, Leonid Penskikh, head of the town's administration, complained that bureaucrats forced this name on the town's residents who wanted it to be called Verkhnevinsk as it is located on the river Neva. He described the communal and sports facilities currently being built in the town and stressed that all the enterprises in the town are still operating.
