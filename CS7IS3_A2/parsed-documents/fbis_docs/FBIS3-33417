He said the money was used to pay soldiers and other personnel's salaries. He explained that when Callejas took office, soldiers had 1.5 lempiras a day to use for food, adding that "Callejas left us with 2.5 to three lempiras to use for food." He said the increases had been made with insufficient funds in the defense budget. Then the National Congress authorized the Treasury Ministry to transfer the Hondutel funds. Other Transfers Although he gave no names, Gen. Discua insisted the Hondutel funds were transferred to other government agencies to supplement end-of-the-year budget shortages. He added that the transfer was approved by the Legislative Branch as a round figure. The officer explained that the military institution is not interested in purchasing Hondutel because it cannot do so with its budget. Nevertheless, he recognized that he could invest his earnings in the corporation, just as the Military Procurement Institute would, if it ever has the funds to do so. Misunderstanding Gen. Discua believes there is a misunderstanding regarding this transfer, "which is casting doubt on the military institution." He believes Manuel Zelaya, director of the Honduran Social Investment Fund, "was caught off guard with an unfounded report." He said: "I think Mr. Zelaya was somewhat misinformed and did not go to the Treasury Ministry or the National Congress." He then affirmed there is no fault in this transaction as everything was carried out through the Treasury Ministry. He indicated the disclosed reports have two purposes: one, to gain political notoriety, and two, to highlight the privatization of Hondutel. He said: "We should speak clearly about this issue and not deceive the Hondutel employees or the union. This process is directed at privatization and we must say so clearly."
