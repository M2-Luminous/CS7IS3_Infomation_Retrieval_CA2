FR940721-0-00081 FR940721-0-00014 5. Value Added by Foreign Suppliers NHTSA noted in the NPRM that section 210(f)(5)(B) provides a specific formula for determining the U.S./Canadian content of equipment received by manufacturers from allied suppliers. The formula provides first that the foreign content is determined by adding up the purchase price of all foreign material purchased from outside suppliers that comprise the individual passenger motor vehicle equipment, and then subtracting such purchase price from the total purchase price of such equipment. The remainder is the U.S./Canadian content of the equipment. The agency noted that this formula does not appear to take into account the possibility that an allied supplier may be foreign, since it assumes that everything, except for the foreign value passed through from outside suppliers, is U.S./Canadian. Based on a reading of the statute as a whole, NHTSA stated that it does not believe Congress intended to convert the entire value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. Therefore, the proposed regulation treated the value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada as non-U.S./Canadian. NHTSA specifically requested comments on this issue. AAMA stated that it agrees with NHTSA that value added by allied suppliers located in a foreign country should be treated as foreign. Nissan stated that it agrees that it may not have been the intent of the law to treat parts obtained from allied suppliers outside the U.S./Canada as U.S./Canadian parts content. APMA stated that it supports this part of the proposal on the ground that it is responsive to Congress' intent. BMW stated that it agrees with NHTSA that the intent of the legislation was not to include value added outside U.S./Canada from foreign allied suppliers as domestic content and that, accordingly, it supports the language NHTSA has proposed. BMW expressed concern, however, that in many instances throughout the NPRM preamble, NHTSA referred to the explicit language of the legislation and stated that deviation from this language is not allowed. BMW stated that if NHTSA is able to deviate from the explicit language of the legislation in this case, the reasoning for refusing to modify other wording seems inconsistent. After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to follow the approach discussed in the NPRM. The agency notes that no commenters disagreed with the agency's view that Congress did not intend to convert the entire value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. With respect to BMW's comment, the agency notes that its interpretation is based on principles of statutory construction related to ``whole statute'' interpretation and limits of literalism. See Sutherland Stat Const §§46.05 and 46.07 (5th Ed). Basically, a statute should not be read literally where such a reading is contrary to its purposes. NHTSA does not believe that anyone could reasonably argue that Congress intended to convert the entire value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content; that result flies in the face of the statute as a whole and its purpose. The agency does not believe that any of the other situations referred by BMW are similar. 6. International Agreements; Mexico AIAM stated that before promulgating a final rule, NHTSA should consult with USTR to determine whether the rule is consistent with NAFTA and particularly Article 300 providing for national treatment of goods produced in the territories of the signatory parties. AIAM also stated that USTR should be asked whether the rule is consistent with those U.S. treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation that convey most favored national treatment and national treatment for investors and goods, particularly in light of the special treatment afforded to Canadian production. Nippondenso stated that Mexico should be treated on the same basis and Canada under the Labeling Act. The European Community (EC) stated that it considers the proposal to be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil the aim of consumer information. More specifically, the EC stated the following: The proposed labelling system would indeed not give any useful information about the product as such or its characteristics. The only information contained on the label would be whether, and to what extent, the individual parts of the product are of American or Canadian origin. In the opinion of the EC, the U.S. measure can only have the objective to influence consumers to buy American or Canadian motor vehicles. The EC believes that the U.S. proposal constitutes an unjustifiable discrimination, contrary to article 2.1 of the GATT Code on Technical Barriers to trade: •the U.S. proposed obligation to indicate the origin of the engine and gearbox could discourage U.S. constructors to import them from their European subsidiaries or from European component manufacturers. •within the European Community, the assembly of vehicles is quite flexible regarding the origin of car components, due to the internal market. For a single model of motor vehicle, a specific part may originate from one of several countries. The U.S. proposal will therefore have greater administrative costs on European importers than other importers. The EC is seriously concerned that such a proposal will create unnecessary trade barriers. Should the U.S. rules be adopted as proposed, this would put an excessive financial burden on importers to access the U.S. market. The U.S. proposal may involve the disclosure of confidential data from manufacturers other than U.S. manufacturers. In consequence, since the U.S. authorities, in accordance with Article 2.1 of the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, have an obligation to ensure that technical regulations are not prepared with a view to creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, the European Community requests the U.S. authorities to take the above comments into account and adapt their proposal accordingly. As discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA does not believe that section 210 contravenes the spirit or letter of GATT for the simple reason that it is informational in nature, and has no other effect. Violations of GATT occur when barriers to trade are established by raising tariffs on selected countries, or by granting preferences to local goods over foreign goods. Under section 210, no tariffs are levied and no preferences are given to vehicles based on the U.S./Canadian content. No quotas are established, and no vehicle is forbidden to be sold in the U.S. The only effect of section 210 is to provide consumers information about the origin of the equipment in vehicles they are considering purchasing. If a consumer is not concerned with the country of origin of a vehicle's equipment, the label will have no bearing on the purchasing decision whatsoever. If, on the other hand, a purchaser wishes to buy a vehicle that is comprised of equipment from the U.S./Canada, Germany, England, Japan, Korea, or some other country, the label will give that consumer information needed to help make such a decision. With respect to the EC's concern about administrative costs for European manufacturers, NHTSA notes that since the requirements imposed by the rule are strictly informational and do not require any product changes other than the addition of a label, the costs for all manufacturers are small. The agency also observes that, as discussed above, it made some changes in the final rule to provide greater flexibility, and hence reduced costs, for manufacturers.
