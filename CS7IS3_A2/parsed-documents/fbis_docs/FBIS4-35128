This was the opinion expressed by the director general of foreign trade relations of the European Union Commission itself, Hugo Paemen, who was in Sao Paulo yesterday to attend the "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper. "All of us share responsibility with respect to the situation in agriculture today," he said. What then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan called the zero option, which called for an end to all subsidies by the year 2000, proved to be an unrealistic goal and ultimately made things more difficult by creating a lot of antagonism, according to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, who also took part in the seminar. Paemen believes, however, that negotiations will be easier from now on. "Now we have a clearer legal structure," he said. Furthermore, the diplomat emphasized the way the implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) had been accelerated throughout the Uruguay Round and how various countries that had been left on the sidelines of the international trade system had finally been integrated into it. The goal of reducing farm sector subsidies, according to Paemen, will now be achieved naturally. More than 40 percent of the rural population of the European Union is over the age of 60, which means that within a few more years these people will leave the labor market and start coming under the protection of the social security system. This means governments will be able to stop using production incentives to guarantee the income levels of that population group. To Pedro de Camargo Neto, president of the Brazilian Rural Association (SRB), Brazilian farmers have little to be enthusiastic about. He says an illusion was created that great changes were about to occur, but it did not prove true. Throughout the entire Uruguay Round, Brazil was the country most often targeted in complaints to the GATT about unfair trade practices. "When we tried to levy compensatory duties on imports of European milk powder we could not. They argued that we had not followed the right procedure," he said. Brazil failed in its attempt to prove that European milk was subsidized, and the issued ended up in arbitration. According to the SRB president, the developed countries' policy of unloading stocks on the world market wrecks prices and hurts the poor countries. "Brazil's praiseworthy effort to try to develop an economic activity that other countries already have, such as dairy cattle, was ignored," he said. Camargo Neto believes "Europe's agricultural policies are so complex that it is possible to control surplus production and guarantee farm income without subsidizing exports." Camargo Neto emphasized, however, that Brazilian agriculture's main problem is still right here within our boundaries. He says that traditionally, there has been an illusion that inflation could be ended by importing food and other raw materials. "So we killed off domestic production of wheat and cotton, and dealt livestock a serious setback." In the case of cotton, for example, high volumes of imports have drastically reduced domestic production. In 1985, Brazil produced 970,000 tons of product, but this year the harvest is not expected to exceed 400,000 tons. Brazil's lag in the textile sector -- besides the deficit in raw cotton production, insufficient investments rendered the industrial plant obsolete -- will entail significant losses. The country has only a 0.8 percent share of the world textiles market, a market that is likely to expand by 60 percent between now and the year 2005. During the same period, the expansion of the fabrics sector should be about 34 percent, according to figures cited by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. Textile Trade Liberalization Textiles is one of the areas of world trade that is expected to show the most growth in the coming years, according to recent studies by the GATT. But that growth, which may be of particular benefit to developing countries -- Brazil among them -- will depend on progress in dismantling the Multifibers Agreement. Multifibers is an agreement under which the developed countries set quotas that are filled by exporter countries, mostly developing countries. The first attempt to liberalize world trade in this area was made during the Uruguay Round of the GATT, which began in 1986 and ended last April, when 111 countries signed the final act in Marrakech. India's permanent representative to the GATT, Ambassador B.K. Zutshi, explained yesterday during a lecture at the "New World Trade Map" seminar that the Multifibers agreement is supposed to be dismantled over a 10-year period. The liberalization is divided into three phases. The first phase is supposed to begin on 1 January 1995, when the countries are supposed to free up imports equivalent to at least 16 percent, by volume, of their 1990 imports. This means those products will start being governed by GATT rules. In phase two, which is supposed to start on 1 January 1998, the minimum percentage of products to be liberated rises to 17 percent in terms of 1990 volume. On 1 January 2002, this percentage goes up to 18 percent, and by 1 January 2005, all textile products must be integrated into GATT rules. The implementation of this agreement, however, would follow that timetable [only] if the World Trade Organization, the entity that will replace the GATT, enters into force in January 1995. The impact on exports from producer countries will also probably be limited during the first five to six years, according to the Indian ambassador. He said the agreement does not require that, during this initial period, importer countries must liberate precisely those products that are now under quota. "I am assuming that the importer countries will not remove the products from the quotas until the end of the process, and so the impact on exports from producer countries will only occur in the long term," he stated. Furthermore, Zutshi observed that textile manufacturers in the United States and the European Union are already mobilizing to try to delay the timetable for a more open market. Some organizations have even asked to have the start of the process postponed from January 1995 to July 1995. The outlook in Brazil gives cause for concern, said Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero: "This is an area where Brazil lost competitiveness. It invested too little and did little renovation." Brazilian businessmen are also worried. "Brazil is now more open than the United States and the European Union," said the financial vice president of Northern Minas Fabrics Company (Coteminas), Gomes da Silva, who also attended the seminar. He deplored the acceleration of the process of opening up the textile market that started in 1990, at the beginning of the Collor administration. "We had negotiated a gradual liberalization during the Sarney government, to give the industry time to get ready. Collor came along and accelerated the process. That is a reality now." Gomes da Silva cited Brazil's advantages in terms of climate and energy. "Our production costs are low, despite high payroll levies." He believes that if the government reduces the tax load on the sector, Brazil may be able to increase its share of the world textile market. "In 1992, world textile trade amounted to $240 billion. That market was bigger than the automobile market. Brazil, however, accounted for only 0.8 percent of that market." TRIPS Agreement The agreement on intellectual property (Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights--TRIPS) approved during the Uruguay Round of the GATT will be useful to countries like India and Brazil, which have "a large reserve of scientific talent," Ambassador B.K. Zutshi, India's permanent representative to the GATT, said yesterday. These two countries, which most fervently opposed the inclusion of the new topic in the GATT realm, out of fear of future sanctions from the developed countries, especially the United States, now see opportunities under the new accord, even though Zutshi believes that "the integration of intellectual property rights into international economic legislation puts a heavy onus on the developing countries." The principal novelties the TRIPS agreement introduces are: - Copyright [preceding word in English]: countries that signed the Uruguay Round will be required to follow Berne Convention rules for protection of artistic and literary works (last updated in 1971). - Computer programs (software): these will be protected like literary works, in the same way as "copyright." - Trademarks: the GATT agreement stipulates that marks that are well-known in a given country should be given additional protection. - Geographic indications (appellations of origin): the agreement says countries should not use geographic names that deceive consumers by leading them to believe that a product originates in a certain country. Exceptions will be made for names that have already become generic, probably the case with "champagne." - Industrial designs: will be protected for a 10-year period. - Patents: this was the most controversial of the intellectual property issues discussed in the Uruguay Round. The TRIPS agreement grants 20-year protection on patents, whether on processes or products, in all fields of technology. The agreement excludes the following from the obligation to patent: therapeutic, surgical, and diagnostic methods; and plants and animals except microorganisms. Plant varieties, however, will be protected either by patents or by a unique system such as the one described in the "Upov Convention" that protects persons who improve seeds, for example. - Layout and integrated circuits: the agreement provides that protection in both cases will be provided on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of Washington on integrated circuits. Protection will be granted for a minimum of 10 years. - Layout [preceding word in English] and integrated circuits: the agreement provides that in both cases protection will be accorded on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of Washington on integrated circuits. Protection will be granted for periods of at least 10 years. - Trade secrets and "knowhow" that has commercial value must be protected. - Oversight: The TRIPS agreement sets up a council to monitor the operations. There will also be a disputes resolution mechanism to hear litigation in the intellectual property area. - Deadlines for implementing the agreement: one year of transition for developed countries, and five years for developing countries and economies in transition. Those countries will have almost 11 years in which to implement intellectual property laws containing the provisions approved in the Uruguay Round. In the case of pharmaceuticals and chemicals products, however, developing countries must start accepting applications at the beginning of the transition period. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who yesterday attended the "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper, emphasized that "the benefits" of the incorporation of intellectual property subject matter into the GATT have not been clearly proven from the standpoint of the developing countries, but they at least served "to cool off bilateral pressures from the major partners, especially as regards patents and copyright aspects. It is possible that the agreement will make it easier for developing countries to gain access to advanced technology, but that will depend on the political willingness of the governments of the developing countries," he said. Amorim recalled that the government has been trying hard to get the Congress to pass the substitute industrial property bill, now in the Senate, by 15 June -- the deadline stipulated in talks with the United States. But the minister emphasized that Congress is a sovereign power. Francisco Teixeira, executive vice president of Interfarma, which represents 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories in Brazil, is optimistic that the substitute bill will be approved in the Senate by the 15th. He expects, however, that the bill will not return to the Chamber, which means passage will be delayed. In general, the multinational laboratories are satisfied with the provisions approved in the GATT. The Brazilian government did not submit an amendment to the Senate that deals with this subject, but promised the international community it would consult the World Trade Organization. If the consultation authorizes nonprohibition of imports, Brazil will have to implement that provision by 1996, Teixeira explained. The multinational laboratories are also satisfied because Brazil will ban parallel importation, thus preserving the rights of the patentholders in their countries of origin. GATT Helps Expand Trade The expansion in international trade that it is hoped will accompany implementation of (GATT) Uruguay Round measures will bring trade benefits and business opportunities to various Brazilian production sectors. Chief among these are agribusiness and mines and metals, including steel, in which Brazil is quite competitive. In the opinion of businessman Roberto Giannetti da Fonseca, president of Silex Trading S.A., one of the members of the panel on "Business Opportunities Resulting from the Uruguay Round," Brazilian businessmen do, however, need to improve their performance by investing more money in modern technologies so as to be able to compete. He mentioned, for example, agribusiness products such as fruits and the commodities (soybeans, cacao, coffee) that compete strongly with [as published] the United States. These will need heavier investment in genetic technologies and soil fertility. Fonseca also pointed out the need for the Brazilian Government to decide on an industrial policy in order to outline the production priorities for its domestic companies, both on the internal market, where they compete with imported goods -- now facilitated by the economic "opening," -- and on foreign markets, where competition is stiff and demands a high degree of competitiveness in order to be able to make sales. If Brazil is to obtain the new business opportunities that will be created in world trade, the businessman noted, it needs to assume the role of "global trader," even if timidly, although it is a nation with a vocation for international markets. "This country has one of the best foreign trade structures, quite diversified and well-balanced with the major trading blocs, the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America," but it is still one of the world's most closed economies, with annual trade representing only 10 to 12 percent of its GDP." According to Giannetti, that index could be expanded to 15 or 20 percent by the end of the decade. Giannetti did, however, express concern about the continuity of the application of antidumping laws by the developed countries, despite their being defined in the Uruguay Round. "They have not been applied consistently, thus inhibiting Brazilian exports and new investments in products designed for the foreign market," he observed. In the opinion of Ambassador K. Kesavapany, Singapore's representative to the GATT, no country is completely satisfied with the final results of the Uruguay Round, not even the developed countries like the United States. However, seven and a half years of negotiations led to several agreements that favor the expansion of business in various industrial sectors. In his speech at the international seminar, he emphasized ease of access to industrial products by companies all over the world, because of the reduction of tariff levels -- such as in textiles, apparel, and farm products -- in addition to the opening, for the first time, of the services sector to foreign companies. According to Kesavapany, the tariff reduction alone is expected to boost world income by about $212 to $274 billion. That benefit, however, will not be shared equally: 65 percent of it will be realized by Japan, the United States, and Europe. Export Subsidies Scored Despite fighting vigorously against incentives granted to the agricultural sector by the developed countries, Brazil still follows a policy of minimum price supports for products in the "basic market basket" that, indirectly, also generates subsidies. "But it is this policy that guarantees that the government will buy up [excess] inventory. This is a food security policy, a consumer protection policy," Pedro de Camargo Neto, president of the Brazilian Rural Association (SRB) retorted yesterday, during the "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper. "I am not a unilateral defender of the minimum price policy, which is an issue that is also being debated within the realm of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. It is undeniable, however, that it leads to increases in production and the buildup of inventories," he pointed out. The problem, Camargo Neto added, is the export subsidies. "These are indefensible. There is no reason to applaud a 21 percent reduction in these subsidies. It is, in fact, a 79 percent injustice. It means permitting that, for the sake of simplicity and economy of the strong powers in terms of their internal policies, a large part of the world will still have to wait, perhaps as long as six years, before it can grow," he stated. The president of the SRB acknowledged that a good part of the difficulties encountered by Brazilian agriculture are the result of a failure to invest, particularly in the case of livestock. But, he said, that is changing. "The figure of the winter herdsman [invernista] , for example, who used to buy cattle to fatten them on grass and then sell them, is becoming extinct. Productivity increase programs, like that of the very young steers novilho precoce, are springing up every day. Brazilian grain producers have now achieved higher yields than their counterparts in the developed nations."
