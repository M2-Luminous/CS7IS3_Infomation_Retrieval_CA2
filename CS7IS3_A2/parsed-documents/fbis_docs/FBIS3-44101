Felix Miranda, the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] correspondent in that part of the country, said the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, General Staff continues to use regular forces in its offensive against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Last weekend, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] used its self-propelled artillery to shell an area northeast of Ucua, in Bengo Province, and the area of (Quicabo), north of Caxito. The clashes were quite intense, killing more than 30 civilians, wounding dozens of people, and destroying homes. Meanwhile, Americo Chivala, the Vorgan correspondent in Cabinda, has reported the presence of Cuban soldiers in the area of N'gange. Those soldiers are ready to come into action via the sea and to provide support to forces deployed on land. Our correspondent reports that those Cuban forces are artillery and military engineering experts. It is worth noting that the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] Northern Command last week inspected all units entrenched in Uige, Zaire, and Bengo Provinces. The FALA Northern Command promised people in those areas that its forces would do everything in their power to defend the lives and interests of the people. It has also been reported that clashes have taken place in Huila Province. Vorgan correspondent Silva Aleluia reports that the MPLA- PT air force continues to carry out air raids against UNITA-controlled areas. Meanwhile, the FAPLA forces left the city of Lubango on 21 January in the direction of Cacula and are now waiting for reinforcements. Silva Aleluia also reports that the number of people killed as a result of shelling on 20 January has now risen to 14. More than 20 people were seriously wounded. As in northern Angola, the FALA Huila Province Command has already taken the necessary passive and active measures to defend the people.
