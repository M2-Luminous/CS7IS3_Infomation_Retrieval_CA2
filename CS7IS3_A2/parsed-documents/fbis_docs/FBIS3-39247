FBIS3-39247 "drweu031_b_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 BENELUX Belgium Parties Select Lists for European Elections BR0802132294 Brussels L'ECHO in French 8 Feb 94 p 3 BR0802132294 Brussels L'ECHO Language: French Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "European Elections -- Choice of Continuity"] [Text] The Socialist Party (PS) bureau, the steering committee of the Social Christian Party (PSC), and the executive committee of the Liberal Reformation Party (PRL) all selected on 7 February the "stars" to head their electoral lists for the European elections in June. It will be, and no surprises here, Jose Happart, Gerard Deprez, and Jean Gol respectively who will be called upon to set their parties apart from the rest. The PS is placing its trust in the team of the five outgoing European deputies and therefore is banking on continuity. Jose Happart, Raymonde Dury, Claude Desama, and Claude Delacroix will stand for the four top spots. Behind these four candidates for continuity are less well-known names, with the exception of the candidate in tenth and last spot, Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain. On the secondary list we find Claude Delacroix and Robert Urbain in first and second place respectively, and Ministers Laurette Onkelinx, Robert Collignon, and Magda De Galan bringing up the rear. At the end of the bureau meeting the PS president stated: "We have put our trust in the outgoing team, while making room for younger people and women." Despite the results of the most recent Dimarso poll, the PS is currently banking on four sitting MEPs [member of the European Parliament] for the European elections, Philippe Bosquin emphasized. Moreover, the results of the opinion polls should be read cautiously, he said, noting that the PS was way down in the polls at the start of 1993 while it was the only party to defend the wage-indexation system. The PS president again justified giving the top two spots to Jose Happart and Raymonde Dury by noting the desire of the PS to reaffirm its commitment to the solidarity between Wallonia and Brussels and to equality of the sexes. PSC: Deprez Signs Up Again The PSC's list for the European elections will thus again be headed by Gerard Deprez, followed by Fernand Herman and Dominique Jeanmoye. The last place goes to Albert Lienard, while ninth spot will be defended by Jean-Pierre Grafe. Michele Bribosia is first on the secondary list, followed by Anne-Marie Corbisier and Marc Bertrand. In seventh, eight, and ninth place we find Jean-Louis Thys, Michel Lebrun, and Guy Lutgen. In a press statement, the steering committee which drew up this list on Monday stated that five spots remained open, including the last spot on the secondary list, and that the mandate of the wise mens' committee had been confirmed to complete the list. Liberal Reform Party-French-Speaking Democratic Front (PRL-FDF): Gol Before Spaak The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] executive committee met on Monday to examine the list that the PRL-FDF federation is to present for the European elections. This PRL-FDF list will be headed by PRL President and Deputy Jean Gol. Antoinette Spaak, the FDF [French-Speaking Democratic Front] deputy, will take second spot. In a communique, Jean Gol stated that he wanted in this way to commit himself to strengthening the European Union, a liberal and democratic Europe, and the influence of the French-speaking community in Belgium and in Europe. He also wanted to offer the electorate the possibility of disowning the parties of the majority and the policy directions taken in Belgium by the Dehaene government. The PRL's executive committee also decided that at least one third of the names on the PRL-FDF list would be women and that all the subregions of Wallonia would be represented, in addition to Brussels. The complete PRL-FDF list should be officially presented sometime next week. The PRL president's concluding speech delivered this weekend at the University of Liege, at the "Forum of Liberal and Democratic French-Speakers of Europe," traced the main policies which, to the president's mind, must be the leading principles guiding European integration: "European integration must above all be a political project; one of the most urgent tasks facing us is to reconcile the unity and diversity of Europe; we need more Europe, not less; we want a Europe that is strong, independent, and which can be sure of respect; Europe must first concern itself with the welfare of its citizens; different cultural identities are one of Europe's advantages and we must cultivate our identity, that of French language and culture; and Europe must be open to the rest of the world and take on greater responsibility."
