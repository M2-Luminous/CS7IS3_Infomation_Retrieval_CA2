Suphachai said the declared U.S. intention to use Article 301 against Japan is probably merely a threat. He is confident that eventually Japan and the United States will be able to settle their trade differences. At present, several countries disagree with the planned use of Article 301. [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Personally, I disagree. I feel that since the GATT has reached an agreement and set up a new international trade organization, the use of unilateral retaliation per Article 301 should be illegal. The GATT members should rise up to protest this matter. The parts on which the United States and Japan could not reach an agreement should be mediated by the GATT. [Unidentified correspondent] There is a possibility that the United States may not seriously apply Article 301 against Japan. Is this correct? [Suphachai] The United States has made a declaration. In the past, it did not carry out its declaration against, I think, either Europe or France once the deadline arrived. I think it amounts to giving the other party time to think about the consequences before taking an action. Most of the time, Article 301 is used as a threat. Even if it is merely a threat, we disagree with its use. [end recording] [passage omitted]
