In view of its political and economic significance, President Frei has described the meeting as "a key visit for the future of the country." Frei will meet Clinton tomorrow at the White House during a working meeting that encompasses a luncheon. The agenda of the meeting includes political and economic issues. Chilean Government sources have said the meeting will center on free trade negotiations between the two countries. Diplomatic sources have said the Summit of the America, summoned by the U.S. Government for December in Miami, will also be a key issue of the meeting. The Chilean president stressed that his first meeting with the U.S. President comes at the initiative of Clinton, adding that this shows Chile is "a reliable partner" for the United States at the political and economic level. Just before his departure, Frei said the meeting "is of political, economic, and cultural value." After denying that free trade agreements will be the main issues on the agenda, Frei said: "we will not just discuss economic issues." Frei added: "We will sit face to face with the U.S. President." Frei said Clinton's invitation is "a great honor, not just for me, but for the entire Chilean nation." Frei added: "We will discuss human development, how to combat poverty; we will discuss political ethics and how Chile is facing this worldwide problem; and we will discuss the importance of achieving development and social justice on the basis of equality." Frei said they will also discuss problems pertaining to women, science, and technology. Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said Frei's invitation "shows the U.S. political willingness to seek a rapprochement with Latin America." Figueroa said he believes the U.S. President chose Chile because "although it is a small country, it enjoys enough prestige and moral authority" to be a valid interlocutor. Figueroa said Chile "has gone beyond traditional U.S.-Latin American ties." He said Frei is going to Washington "to propose ideas and to exchange points of view, not to request anything. All Chileans should be proud of this fact." Figueroa stressed that Chile "has overcome the mendicant stigma that has always characterized U.S. ties with Third World and Latin American countries." Figueroa denied that President Clinton's invitation grants Chile the status of a U.S. "privileged partner." He said this invitation shows Chile "is a reliable partner for President Clinton's policy of rapprochement with Latin America." The Chilean foreign minister added that the meeting "confirms the spirit of rapprochement that currently prevails in the Americas." He said this meeting proves ties with the United States "are not merely based on buying-and-selling or borrowing-and-lending." President Frei is scheduled to carry out an extensive agenda in Washington following his arrival on Monday. Among other functions, he is scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, with AFL-CIO leaders, and attend a reception that U.S. Vice President Al Gore will host in his honor at the Department of State. Before meeting Clinton, Frei will hold a working meeting with U.S. businessmen, economists, and legislators. He is also scheduled to meet with U.S. Trade Secretary Mickey Kantor. After his meeting with Bill Clinton and before his return to Santiago, the Chilean president will hold a news conference.
