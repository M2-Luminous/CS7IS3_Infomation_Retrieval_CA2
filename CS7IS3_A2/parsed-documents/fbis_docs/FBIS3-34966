The first is to strengthen and fortify our internal front using all the elements needed to destroy divisions among Lebanese. The second is to build the establishments of the state in the vital and industrial fields and try to develop and confront the requirements of the coming stage. Prime Minister al-Hariri's speech came during a seminar held in Juniyah yesterday evening. Answering questions from people attending the seminar, the prime minister said he supports the implementation of al-Ta'if, but the Syrian forces will be staying for the time being because they are helping the Lebanese security forces preserve internal security. He stressed that Lebanon came to the negotiations with Syria and will leave them when Syria does. [passage omitted] On relations among the three leaders, the prime minister said: We do not differ over the essence, but over the form. Differences are natural in a democratic system. On the absence of balance in national decision-making due to the absence of Christian representation, al-Hariri said the Chamber of Deputies was elected within an election law. The current government is not responsible for the elections that have already taken place. He affirmed that when the time comes to hold new parliamentary elections, which will not be soon, then we can rectify the representation proportions.
