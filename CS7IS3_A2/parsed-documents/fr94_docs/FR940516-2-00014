FR940516-2-00014 FR940516-2-00008 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1992 Economic and Agriculture Censuses&hyph;&hyph;1994 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey. Form Number(s): 94&hyph;A62. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 14,400 hours. Number of Respondents: 20,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 43 minutes. Needs and Uses: The 1994 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey will update data on irrigation inputs and investment in the agricultural production sector. Inadequate surface water, overuse of ground water, concerns about water quality, and increasing competition for available water are currently recognized as problems of national concern. Agricultural irrigation is the largest single use of available U.S. water supplies. Farm and ranch irrigation surveys have provided the only source of detailed, nationally consistent data on water&hyph;management practices and water uses in American agriculture. The 1994 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey will obtain data to describe the irrigation activities of U.S. farm operations. The survey will collect critically needed data on issues of national concern, such as water conservation practices and the chemical application practices of irrigators. Federal and state agencies, the irrigation industry, agricultural producers, and universities will use the results of the survey in preparing a wide variety of water&hyph;related programs, economic models, legislative initiatives, market analyses, and feasibility studies. Affected Public: Farms. Frequency: Every 5 years. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.
