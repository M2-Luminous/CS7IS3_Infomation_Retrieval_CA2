[Miller] A strike in a textile plant or even in the whole textile sector would not bring appreciable results for its organizers. After all, they are interested in making their cause heard. Therefore, notoriety can be gained only through a strike that will affect coal mines, power plants, or the telecommunications sector because it can paralyze life in the country on a large scale. Thus, organizers will always select the branches of industry in which the planned strike would, first, be noticed. and, second, have a crippling effect on the whole fabric of state life. [Sroczynski] In this case, however, there is much talk of the exceptional significance of the strikes and even of a "new gust of air" that might inflame Solidarity again. [Miller] That would be impossible in any circumstances now. Today we have a completely different management and ownership structure than we had in the 1980's. Nevertheless, Solidarity will clearly continue to provoke strikes in order to give itself a high profile, at all costs, and to paralyze many other branches of the economy. [Sroczynski] In the meantime, how do you assess the condition of our economy? [Miller] For the first time in a long while, we have a decrease in the number of unemployed: It has gone down by 20,000. This may not be very much, but it is a heartening indication that unemployment is no longer growing. The inflation index for the first quarter of the year is 4.5 percent, which is the best result for the past seven years. In addition, industrial output rose by 10 percent in the past quarter, which is also an unusual thing. [Sroczynski] Can we assume that this will be a permanent trend? [Miller] It seems so, but this optimistic outlook can be easily shattered nowadays. This can happen as a result of the strike wave that may hit at the economy's sensitive points or the abolition of the popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] act, which could cause rapid wage increases. In such a situation, Poland could again become an unstable country. [Sroczynski] When could the economic reforms bring tangible advantages also to the poorest strata of society? [Miller] If the advantageous trends I mentioned earlier prove to be the dominant strands in the economy, a real growth of wages as well as old-age and disability pensions could take place for the first time in many years. The most important aspect of that would be that the adverse trends would then be halted for the first time in many years.
