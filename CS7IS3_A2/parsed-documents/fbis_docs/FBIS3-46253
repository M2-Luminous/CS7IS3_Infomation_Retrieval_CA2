In the space of a single speech the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) accused Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod of insincerity and cast doubt on the credentials of Michael Sze Chocheung. Mr Lu insinuated that the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs was not a representative of Hong Kong people: He was too much of a dedicated follower of Chris Patten. Such attacks may be a sign of Mr Lu's own difficulties in Beijing. To his credit he pushed for the Sino-British talks -- against the advice of Zhou Nan, his rival at XINHUA (the New China News Agency). But he is now having to appear tougher than Mr Zhou. China's criticism of those who speak out (like its invitations to others to appear before the Preliminary Working Committee to explain themselves) work to undermine the administration's loyalty to the Governor. Mr Lu's barbs can hardly fail to increase the pressure on Hong Kong civil servants and add to their sense of unease about the future. Taken to its logical extreme, his argument is that the 30 per cent or so of the population who have supported Mr Patten in opinion polls over the past year have no right to be considered Hong Kong people. For the bulk of the population that is absurd. But at the top of the civil service, where public explanation of, and vocal support for, official [as published] are part of the job in our executive-led system of government, the menace of a post-1997 witch hunt is unmistakeable. Mr Sze's case, like that of Sir Hamish -- and of Anson Chan Fang On-sang when she came under attack, as Secretary for Economic Services, for her defence of the airport -- is a strong argument against Hong Kong-style executive-led government; it is an argument in favour of putting elected politicians or appointed Executive Councillors in charge of policy branches. Career civil servants are supposed to be neutral, back-room workers. But under the system invented by Britain, and preserved by China under the Basic Law, they have to play a role similar to that of cabinet ministers in defending policies for which they are not politically responsible and with which they may privately disagree. Politicians elected or appointed, are in the job by choice and should be ready to face the consequences. Civil Servants have no choice. Mr Lu and his Government are in large part responsible for the quandary in which civil servants find themselves. They are under attack, unfairly, for working within a system which Beijing has endorsed and insists must continue.
