"It is not accidental that the world community and all the people of good will interested in the cessation of the Armenian-Azeri conflict have focused their attention on the meeting in Baku," Kazimirov said. In the opinion of the Russian envoy, "in any case, a prospect for the continuation of the bloodshed should be rejected," he said. Kazimirov welcomed the concept of beginning a peace-keeping process from a cease-fire. "The most important thing now is to prevent the cease-fire and cessation of military operations from being disconnected from the next stage, in other words, to prevent the situation from coming to a deadlock, Kazimirov said. "We must ensure the integrity of the process of settlement, and strictly consistent actions should be a reliable commitment, rather than a promise, by all parties concerned," the Russian envoy said. In his opinion, this can be achieved by means of a tangible political agreement binding the sides to observe it and on which the world community can rely on with certain confidence. According to Kazimirov, the main goal of the Russian side as a mediator is to promote reliable, rather than prompt settlement of the conflict. The talks between the Azeri president, leaders of the Minsk Group and the special envoy of the Russian president were held behind closed doors and continued about four hours. Late on Friday [13 May], the mediatory mission is leaving for Yerevan.
