He said that the illness struck during Nazarbayev's visit to Japan. "The president was struggling, but the aggravation did not pass, therefore he is staying in bed," Asanbayev told INTERFAX upon arrival in Moscow on Thursday. Asanbayev noted that he supports all economic documents prepared for the summit, but he has some remarks concerning drafts on the rights of ethnic minorities. Asked an INTERFAX correspondent whether Alma-Ata [Almaty] is embarrassed that Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian Union caused a mixed reaction, Asanbayev pointed out that "in general, there are no simple answers in the world, everybody has his own point of view on the same phenomenon." "We are following closely the reaction to this proposal and at the same time trying to work on it in detail," the vice-president said.
