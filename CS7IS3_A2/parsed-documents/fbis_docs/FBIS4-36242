Chief Jordanian delegate Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah said that the talks addressed economic topics listed on the agenda, including Palestinian-Israeli agreements and the issue of developing the Jordan Valley. The conferees examined working papers that addressed a comprehensive development of the Jordan Valley, as well as future projects, about which the U.S. side expressed a willingness to chart an overall plan, Dr. al-Tarawinah added. Dr. al-Tarawinah went on to say: During these talks, the Jordanian side underscored the importance of linking these topics to the bilateral issues contained in the Jordanian-Israeli agenda signed on 14 September 1993, particularly the issues of borders, occupied Jordanian territories, and water. It must be recalled that the agenda is an indivisible whole, and that all the topics contained in it must be discussed and negotiated in accordance with the terms of reference of the peace process, and on the basis of the provisions enshrined in the joint agenda. Dr. al-Tarawinah said: A main broad Jordanian-Israeli committee has been set up to discuss the issues of borders, security, water resources, environment, and other issues. Subcommittees will emanate from this main committee. Moreover, efforts to demarcate and delineate borders will start. Discussions also touched on other issues that need further study, such as the issue pertaining to the road that will link Jordan, Egypt, and Israel, and other issues pertaining to the projects included in the Jordanian paper on the Jordan Valley. A subagenda on water resources, energy, and environment, and another subagenda on borders, occupied territories, and security have been agreed on. The negotiations will be conducted within the context of the subcommittees. Discussions of technical issues will be resumed in the region to achieve the highest possible degree of accuracy, particularly with regard to the issue of borders. The talks are scheduled to resume next month.
