Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made this remark when meeting here this afternoon with chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman, who is here attending the fourth round negotiations on bilateral textile trade. The negotiation ended here this afternoon with a new agreement on the Sino-U.S. textile trade being reached. "The agreement has been reached through the joint efforts of both sides and both sides have adhered to the principles of consultation and equality during the talks," Wu said. She said that U.S. capital, technology and equipment are conducive to China's modernization drive, as China's potentially huge market and abundant source of labour are important to the United States. China and the United States are economically complementary and China attaches great importance to developing cooperation with the United States in all areas, she said. Nevertheless, the minister said, various problems and difficulties may arise in future cooperation between the two sides. But the best way to address these problems is through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing, as has been proved by years of practice. Any attempt to exert pressure by one side on the other can only lead to a trade war between them, she said. China and the United States share common interests in dealing with illegal trans-shipment of textiles, Wu said, and added that she hoped both sides would make joint efforts to address the issue so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the bilateral textile agreement. Hillman told Wu that the just concluded negotiations were productive, cooperative and mutually satisfactory. China is the largest exporter of textiles to the United States, Hillman noted, and the agreement will provide for consistent and orderly growth of China's textile and textile product exports to the United States. The U.S. chief negotiator also said that the new agreement will provide strong tools to ensure that the trans-shipment problem is tackled forcefully.
