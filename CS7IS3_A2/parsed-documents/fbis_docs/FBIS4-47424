The worst offenders are fine-disperse particles of contaminated soil, mainly aleurite and pelite. It therefore has been necessary to monitor the toxicity of the Kerch Straight ecosystem. Until 1989 this was done in shallow water on the Savenko bank or in an experimental dump site. Since then materials are being sampled in the mussel yard near cape Tuzla. During the 1989-90 period samples were taken, among others, for the purpose of determining the contamination of mollusks by organic chlorine compounds: 1),2) (_a_,_g_)-hexachlorocyclohexane, 3) DDT with its metabolites and polychlorobiphenyls. The specimens were analyzed by the method of gas-liquid chromatography in a ``Yanako'' G-180 F.E. instrument. During the March-April 1989 period of slow physiological mussel activity and low phytoplankton vegetation intensity the ratio of maximum to minimum pesticide concentrations in water and in mussel clusters was found to be most stable, owing to slowness of fermentation and of biochemical reactions in mollusks. No polychlorobiphenyls were found in the water during that period, evidently due to the effective action of DDT combined with fast cementation and subsequent fast sedimentation of particles. During the March-August 1990 period of massive soil dumping the concentrations of those compounds in both surface and bottom layers in three sampling sites were respectively: 1) 0.041 and 0.044 mg/liter, 2) 0.026 and 0.027 mg/liter, 3) 0.020 and 0.024 mg/liter. The absence of polychlorobiphenyls facilitates massive accumulation of insoluble organic chlorine compounds and their adsorption by particles suspended in deeper water. Their spatial overall distribution of organic chlorine indicates that they do not spread far to the north into shallow shelf water. Figures 2; tables 1; references 6.
