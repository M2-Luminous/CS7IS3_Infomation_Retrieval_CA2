He made the statement at the weekly press conference when asked to comment on the assertion by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of the State Department of the United States for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 that on the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act should supersede the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on August 17, 1982. He noted that the essence of the Taiwan Relations Act is to attempt to overrule the August 17 joint communique between China and the United States and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, stressing that this is what the Chinese Government and people stand firmly opposed to. The August 17 joint communique is an international agreement reached between the two Governments of China and the United States, which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide by in the principle that international laws prevail over domestic laws and take necessary measures to prevent the U.S. Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which are in violation of this principle with a view to the maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations.
