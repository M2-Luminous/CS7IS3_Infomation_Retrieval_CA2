Cuba and Barbados established diplomatic relations on 8 December 1992 [as heard], but now the opportunity to establish a mission in Bridgetown has arisen because of Cuba's closer ties with the Anglo-Caribbean community, Caricom. Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's current ambassador to eastern Caribbean, stressed that the main objectives of his mission are to strengthen economic and commercial ties as well as to promote culture and sports ties. Cabezas represents Cuba in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Bahamas, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The only countries in that region yet to formalize diplomatic ties with Cuba are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Antigua and Barbuda.
