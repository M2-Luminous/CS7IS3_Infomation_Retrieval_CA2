Benda commented that practically no government policy for raw materials was in existence. Concerning the Temelin nuclear power plant, the minister said he thought it essential that an atomic code be created which would include the atomic law as well as other laws concerning nuclear power. The code would primarily concern legal regulations for the storage of nuclear waste or the establishment of a fund for the disposal of nuclear equipment. The ministry has completed a document entitled "Government Environmental Policy" which the government received last December as an outline proposal for the activities of the Environment Ministry. After being discussed by inter-governmental agencies, the document will be presented to the government. The ministry included in its outline an environmental action program which includes short term programs of about three years in duration.
