Under the system, companies that plan to export general-purpose goods to 20 countries considered to be areas of potential conflict, including the DPRK (North Korea), have to obtain permission from MITI if their exports come under MITI's standards. Since there are growing concerns over proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction following the collapse of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), Japan will follow the example of European countries and the United States in expanding export regulations to general-purpose goods. MITI intends to revise the Export Trade Control Ordinance as early as August, and to introduce the new system after making it known to companies. Among about 100 items subject to export regulations are: computers; semiconductors; machinery, including low precision machine tools; special metals such as zirconium and beryllium; and carbon fiber. MITI is studying the possibility of designating about 20 nations -- including North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and former communist nations -- as being subject to export regulations. Standards to be adopted by MITI are mainly comprised of the following three cases: 1) General-purpose goods are exported to such facilities as nuclear power plants at which exported goods may possibly be used to produce weapons; 2) companies themselves are aware of the possibility that exported goods may be transformed into weapons; and 3) even though companies judge that there is no problem with exports, the government notices a danger that exported goods could be transformed into weapons. For example, in case a Japanese company -- which plans to export semiconductors to Iraq -- is aware of the possibility that its semiconductors may be used to produce weapons, it has to submit an application to MITI for permission. If all 100 items require permission to be exported, companies will have to bear a heavy burden and MITI will face difficulties in examining many applications. For this reason, MITI has decided to place emphasis of regulations on the possibility that exported goods may be transformed into weapons. Nevertheless, since export regulations will be applied to general-purpose goods, companies need to strengthen their export control system. Industrialized nations, including Japan, and other countries have adopted international regulations on exports of highly-precise machine tools and pathogenic bacteria which could be directly used to produce weapons of mass-destruction such as nuclear arms and missiles. However, because such goods as low precision machine tools are also used to produce weapons, MITI has decided to regulate exports of these general-purpose goods. The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have already introduced a similar system. According to their system, if a company "is aware that its exported goods will be used to produce weapons of mass-destruction in the end, it is required to get permission" to export them. This is called the "know control" system. Although MITI has partially introduced the "know control" system into its new system, it has made standards of its system clearer than is the "know control" system by designating importers as subject to export permission.
