Not all opposition deputies showed up at the assembly session. Another conspicuous absence was that of outgoing Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz reports: [Begin Da Cruz recording] Only 37 out of the remaining 78 deputies responded to the invitation to attend the National Assembly session this morning, which was convened by the chairman and most senior assembly man, Ayitoh Kossi of the Action Committee for Renewal, who was himself absent in line with the joint decision of his party, the Togolese Union for Democracy, to suspend opposition deputies' participation in the National Assembly deliberations until the Supreme Court clarifies its decision to invalidate the election of three deputies of the parliamentary majority. Following the lack of quorum, the 37 deputies of the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] and the Union for Justice and Development, the RPT's ally, left the National Assembly, noting with regret the absence of their 40 opposition colleagues. The outgoing prime minister, the only elected candidate and leader of the Coordination of New Forces, was also absent from the session. Sources close to the prime minister's office said however that the reason for his absence is quite different from that of the opposition deputies. We note that this morning's session was notably to allow deputies to discuss the assembly's standing orders. The referent documents on the standing orders were distributed to the parliamentarians on 30 March for prior study. [end recording]
