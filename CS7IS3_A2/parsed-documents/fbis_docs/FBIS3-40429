Even if more than half the shares return to the private sector in the next five years, the three companies will retain close government ties. The postal minister will control a regulatory board and the German regional authorities [Laender] will have the right to inspect companies through a regulatory council. In addition, a holding company will head the three companies to coordinate the different advisory bodies. One of its roles will be to set charges, in consultation with the postal workers' union Deutsche Postgewerkschaft [DPG]. In other respects, no one yet knows whether the stock market flotation will serve to strengthen the companies financially or if proceeds will be used to make up the German budget deficit. These decisions come at a time when Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have decided to strengthen existing ties -- they jointly own Eucom and Eunetcom -- with plans to create a joint structure to meet all the international requirements of both companies.
