Krasnodar has a regional newspaper, KUBANSKIY KURER, and at its editorial office is the kray headquarters of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the leaders of which cannot be suspected of having an excessive amount of modesty. More than three months before the election to agencies of local self-government, the Kuban "hawks" announced the formation of a kray Legislative Assembly and a governmental cabinet. The main portfolios were distributed, naturally, among the closest retainers. The person who was seated in the chair of the shady governor was Vladimir Serdyukov, the head of the LDPR kray organization, who also performs the duties of head of the Sociopolitical Research Department at KUBANSKIY KURER. The job of chairman of the Legislative Assembly was yielded to Igor Kolomiytsev, with this action apparently emphasizing faithfulness to their principle of not forgetting services rendered to them. Because Igor Pavlovich had done rather well in providing services: during a short period of time the KUBANSKIY KURER that is edited by him was converted into a mouthpiece for the Zhirinovskiyites. So the deputy of the main Kuban "hawk," Sergey Kamarinskiy, had to be satisfied with the title of the shady general director of the department for the fight against corruption. As you compare these personnel assignments, you have to sympathize with the professionals, for example, with military jurist Anatoliy Vetrov, who was given only the job of business manager of the kray Duma. One can only guess how the already appointed shady prefects of Anapskiy, Yeyskiy, Korenovskiy, Labinskiy, and Mostovskiy rayons, and the mayors of the cities of Yeysk and Sochi, will execute the "assignment" issued by the LDPR kray organization, of making up cabinets for the local agencies of authority within a one-month period. As early as January, the leader of the Kuban liberal-democrats, Serdyukov, publicly and with complete seriousness, stated that Nikolay Yegorov, the present administration head of Krasnodar Kray, "sooner or later will have a need to join up with us... If Yegorov establishes contact with us, and gives us several departments today, then we shall not forget him tomorrow." But the "hawklets" had a misfire: the governor did not react in any way to the bait put out by the Zhirinovskiyites. Andrey Ivanov, press secretary of the kray administration head, stated that the kray's executive authority had been formed from professionals and is operating in everyone's full view. No personnel shakeup in favor of anyone's political vanities is foreseen. Everything will be decided by the voters. A valid question is: whom can the authority trust? How will the people of Kuban evaluate (or will they evaluate?) the zeal of the local "hawks, their struggle for seats in the kray Duma, and their emulation of Communists at such time? Because the Zhirinovskiyites do not spare even the Travkinites. Serdyukov has indeed stated, "We do not have anything against former CPSU members. But for all 'demorossy' [members of Democratic Russia] the path to us is closed..." As the saying goes, the masks have been thrown aside. And apparently in time. So that the voters will have time to scrutinize the situation a bit more attentively. There is still time: it is a few months until autumn and the election.
