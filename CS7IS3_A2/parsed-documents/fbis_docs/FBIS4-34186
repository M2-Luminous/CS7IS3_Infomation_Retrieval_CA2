Upon signing the Chapultepec Declaration on freedom of the press, Lacalle discussed this issue with the top officials of the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) yesterday. The president pointed out: "Even though there is a constitutional provision establishing liberty and all of us are ready to preserve it, liberty is increasingly matched by the responsibility of publishers, editors, directors, and owners." The chief executive noted: "If we bear in mind that the judicial branch may not always act quickly, it is necessary for liberty to be increasingly matched by the responsibility of owners, directors, and media promoters." Lacalle pointed out: "By signing this declaration we confirm our commitment to making men entirely free and responsible for their actions." Present at the ceremony were IAPA President Raul Kraiselburd, IAPA Vice President Robert C. Hardie, and local media executives, including EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO director Ricardo Peirano. Argentine President Carlos Menem signed the declaration on 6 June, and Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will sign it on 8 June.
