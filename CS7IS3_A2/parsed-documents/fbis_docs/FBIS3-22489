A new serotype Vibrio cholerae strain 0[.sup]139[/] was identified to be the cause of the outbreak. Because up to 7 July, all 106 cases including two deaths were identified to be non-01 Vibrio cholerae infections, and were all adults. Professor Gao Shouyu [7559 1343 0001] at the Institute of Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine pointed out that 0[.sup]139[/] is a highly virulent serotype strain, and it is still unknown whether it came from the two close neighboring countries, India and Bangladesh, which had just reported the outbreaks not long ago. Professor Gao said that since nobody in China has the kind of antibody to fight against the new strain, if an outbreak should occur, it would be an uncontrollable one.
