Vladas Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based Selma association, was arrested last week when over 40 searches were carried out in apartments of former and present Defense Ministry employees. Officials said the measure was taken to further investigate the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense forces in 1992-93. "There is and will be no influence on the troop withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia, or construction work in Kaliningrad. State affairs must not be mixed with personal matters," Petkevicius said at a press conference Thursday [24 March]. The lawmaker emphasized that Selma is not a Lithuanian organization since last September, and law experts will have to find out how the company managed to continue its existence in Lithuania without paying taxes. In Petkevicius' opinion, the case started in the fall of 1992 when Lithuanian Provisional Money, also called talonas, was introduced instead of Soviet rubles. The lawmaker said around 2 million rubles were then taken out to the Kaliningrad region at that time. He said the money was escorted by certain services but did not specify them. "This is investigated by the prosecutor's offices of both countries." Petkevicius said it is necessary to find 12 million lits and several million dollars that disappeared in the weapons deal. He said the prosecutor's office established that those who directly participated in purchasing weapons have huge sums at their disposal now. Petkevicius said he was surprised by ex-Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius stormy reaction to Selma president's arrest, because the former minister is not mentioned in the investigation carried out by the parliament's economic crimes commission. The lawmaker noted that various companies acted as mediators in the weapons deal. He mentioned a case when Russian helicopters, offered for 800,000 U.S. dollars per unit, were later purchased for 1,200,000 each, and the price difference went to fictitious firms. Petkevicius said the Russian prosecutor's office is also interested in the case because "many facts available to Lithuanian and Russian prosecutor's offices coincide."
