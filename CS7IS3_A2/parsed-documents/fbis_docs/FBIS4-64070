Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn To Choose New President"] [Text] The threat of fascism owing to the stepped-up activity of nationalist forces, the possibility of totalitarianism because of the communists' revanchist schemes, and the formalization of "neo-Brezhnev rule" by the monopolism of the corrupt oligarchy were the trends named at a news conference by leaders of the Democratic Russia movement, on the basis of which a federal party of the same name will be set up. Galina Starovoytova, Lev Ponomarev, Anatoliy Korotich, and other members of the organizing committee, explaining the need for setting up a new political organization, told journalists that the Democratic Russia Federal Party [DRFP] is designed to defend the foundation of democracy -- civil society aiming at a socially oriented market economy. According to Ms. Starovoytova, the party will absorb the middle class: medium-size and small businessmen, the intelligentsia, qualified workers, and farmers -- people whose financial involvement in the party organization the committee lacks so badly at this stage. As it is embarking on a non-confrontational path, the party will do its utmost to overcome the breakup that is currently characteristic of the democratic movement by cooperating with all who will resist the threat of fascism and totalitarianism. Unlike U.S. parties that are activated only during election campaigns, the new Russian party is called upon to be active all the time; its ranks are open for anyone wishing to join it after a procedure of "soft ceremonial purification" that, organizing committee member Andrey Frolov said, will bar the "old nomenklatura" and "former KGB agents" from entering the political organization that is being set up by people "who have never been CPSU members." The founders think that their party's federal status will be bolstered by Democratic Russia local branches: chiefs of 30 regional branches left the meeting that ended 22 May with the organizing committee's membership cards. The chiefs of the remaining 15 branches, while voicing no objections in principle, decided that "the matter should be discussed at home" first. "Moscow's diktat" in the new party will be ruled out because the capital organization will get one vote just as any regional branch. On the economic side, which was described as "a prolonged shock," the fledgling party members predicted a social upheaval at the end of summer or the beginning of fall; to avert it they suggested that the government resume "economic reform that has been effectively halted." If political reform is to be resumed also, the DRFP organizing committee thinks that all democratic forces should unite into a bloc, something which, according to Lev Ponomarev's forecast, should take place "sometime near the fall." The bloc, according to Democratic Russia's plan, should nominate a single candidate for president in the upcoming elections. The speakers in the news conference would not speculate who precisely it may be, but they pinned some hopes on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who "with his keen feeling...would help choose a future leader" by formulating "a patriotic Russian idea in non-chauvinist words and expressions."
