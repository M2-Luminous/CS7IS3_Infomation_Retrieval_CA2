Development slowed down. The entire year's rate of growth over the same period of the previous year was 14.9 percent lower than the first six months' rate of growth over the same period of the previous year. In terms of floor space, the amount of commercial buildings being built declined by 26.7 percent, and newly started projects of buildings declined by 67.2 percent, the amount of buildings completed declined by 15.9 percent, the amount of buildings sold declined by 22.4 percent, and the sales volume declined by 3.2 percent. Investment structure improved. The localities reexamined the projects of luxury buildings and projects of high-consumption construction which had already been approved, strictly controlling the granting of approval to construction projects with unclear market prospects and shifting the focus of investment to the construction of urban housing. The share of housing in the amount of commercial buildings being constructed, newly started, or completed increased markedly over 1992. Prices stabilized. In the second half of the year, forward real estate prices in the hot spot regions declined by 20-30 percent over the beginning of the year, and spot real estate prices declined by 10-20 percent. Under the situation of strong inflationary pressures and a strong demand for real estate, real estate prices remained basically stable. Market rules were being gradually perfected. The relevant agencies of the central and local governments all quickened the pace of legislation. In addition to the national Provisions for Land Appreciation Tax and Provisions for Fund and Quality Management of Real Estate Development Enterprises, provinces such as Zhejiang and Guangdong promulgated regulatory rules on real estate development; over a period of time some regions also issued such local laws and regulations as on the relinquishing and transferring of land use rights, real estate trading, real estate evaluation, and standard land prices. The situation with respect to the regulating of development companies became markedly more orderly. The companies with no real estate development capabilities were withering away by themselves. In Guangxi 380 real estate companies closed down by themselves; Guangdong terminated 170 real estate companies with no development capabilities. At the same time many law-violating companies were investigated and actions were taken against them; and, in accordance with state regulations, land management agencies and financial institutions were disconnected from the companies they had created.
