Kakkar, who heads the Bombay office of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The Madras-based advertiser had evinced an interest in buying a paracetamol-making unit. Under normal circumstances, such interest should not have caused suspicion. Paracetamol is a legal antipyretic drug commonly used to reduce fever. But the unit can also be used to manufacture methaqualone (better known by its brand name mandrax), a narcotic drug which is banned in India and many other countries. It is also a drug that is causing major headaches to the NCB. Kakkar, whose office has recorded an increasing trend of the smuggling of mandrax tablets from India to South Africa, decided to investigate the matter. The major concern is that India is the world's largest producer of mandrax. Though South Africa continues to be the biggest consumer, neighbouring African nations such as Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia, which so far were merely transit points of the mandrax trail, are also turning into users now. Recent seizures by the NCB, the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Bombay Police, only confirm the alarming rise in mandrax smuggling. In 1990, these agencies seized 2,141 kg of mandrax tablets and powder in 60 cases which in 1993 went up nearly seven times to 15,004 kg (in 283 instances). In the first quarter of 1994, seizures were over 7,000 kg in only six swoops. South Africa was the final destination in most of the cases. It is the easy money and huge profits that have attracted drug traffickers into this trade. At a conservative estimate, the annual turnover in the mandrax trade could be over Rs 1,500 crore and profitability is quite high. Rahul Rai Sur, DCP [Deputy Commissioner of Police] (narcotics), Bombay Police, says that the production cost per tablet is a mere Re 1 while the selling price is anything up to Rs 100 on South African streets. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a UN organisation set up to prevent the illicit traffic and use of drugs, is worried about this trend. In its 1993 annual report, released in February this year, the INCB stated that "the increasing illicit manufacture of methaqualone (mandrax) constitutes a major problem in India" which "remains the main source". Mandrax is identical to barbiturates in its effect. Barbiturates are depressants which act on the central nervous system of the body and slow down many bodily functions. Mandrax, like barbiturates, can be addictive and prove fatal if consumed in combination with alcohol or other illegal drugs. At the behest of the INCB, many countries have banned its sale and production. India, too, banned the drug in 1984. Since then, the country has found itself in the piquant position of becoming a centre for the illicit production of mandrax. The country's pharmaceutical industry is technologically developed and the know-how to make the drug exists as it was freely produced prior to the ban. South Africa, on the other hand, has been a user country since the 1970's. NCB officials contend that with the growing economic prosperity of the majority black population in the '80's, the demand for mandrax has gone up. To get an extra kick, black workers, whose per capita annual income has trebled since 1984, mix mandrax in liquor or smoke it in powdered form with marijuana. Given the huge profits, heroin and antique smugglers have taken up the mandrax trade in a big way. On January 11 this year, the Bombay Police arrested a 33-year-old doctor, Imtiaz Ahmed Illiyas. Illiyas and his four colleagues were carrying 600 grams of heroin and they led the police to the largest seizure (4,800 kg) of mandrax ever made. The tablets, destined to reach Mozambique, were found in 206 drums stored in a 20-ft container at Victoria docks. In August 1992, the Bombay police stumbled upon a gang of the three Bhatt brothers and seized over 100 kg of mandrax tablets. In addition to this, the police recovered an 11th century sandstone icon (3 ft 3 inch in height) of Lord Parshawanath, stolen from a Jain temple in Gujarat. For heroin traffickers, shifting to an indigenous drug makes business sense. Mandrax is more profitable as it is produced in India unlike heroin. Further, the international crackdown on heroin since the mid-'80's has also forced Indian drug traffickers based in the Middle East to look at alternatives to remain in the trade. Police investigations indicate that some major mandrax gang leaders may be based in Dubai. Sur says that he is on the verge of charge-sheeting one of them. Police sources say the investigative trail in at least two major cases leads to Dubai. On August 19 last year, a jeep containing 150 kg mandrax tablets was seized outside a restaurant in Bombay. The vehicle was rented out to Milind Chalke, a resident of Andheri who owned a tabletting factory in Paundvillage, about 30 km from Pune. Chalke's trail led to a businessman based in Lusaka, Zambia, who is suspected to have links in Dubai. However, NCB officials, while admitting the involvement of organised gangs, feel that the supposed Dubai links are still weak. "It's too early to jump to conclusions," says the NCB'S Deputy Director-General, A.M. Prasad. In fact, even the Bombay High Court has released all the accused in the August 1993 case on bail. With the slow progress by investigative agencies in catching the gang leaders, the mandrax trade continues unabated. The modus operandi and the route are clear from recent seizures and raids. The main production bases are centered in Maharashtra and Gujarat though the NCB has found a few units in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as well. According to NCB officials, even some of the legitimate drug units, especially paracetamol-making ones, are being diverted to produce mandrax. This was the reason why Kakkar was worried about THE ECONOMIC TIMES advertisement. The technology and even the chemical ingredients are the same for both drugs. In the January 1994 case, the police found that Illiyas and his partners were also producing mandrax at the Gujarat-based Ambala Organics Chemicals Pvt Ltd, originally owned by 10 partners who sold the sick unit for Rs 48.50 lakh to the drug smugglers. The common way of smuggling mandrax is through the Bombay port by falsely declaring export consignments and giving incorrect names of both the exporting firm and the African importer. The 4,800-kg found in the container at Indira docks was supposed to contain red oxide. In December 1993, the NCB, Bombay, intercepted a consignment of wooden boxes at Victoria docks said to be carrying water heaters. Instead, the boxes contained 1,500 kg of mandrax. Another 3,200-kg consignment was seized by the NCB, Bombay, in January 1993. Packed in 320 plastic bags, it was supposed to contain talcum powder. Both the exporter, Ganesh Export Import International, and the buyer, Societe Generale d'Alimentation in Zaire, in this case were non-existent. However, as narcotic agencies in Bombay have geared up to stop this illegal trade, the traffickers are changing their routes. A lot of mandrax is now being smuggled out of Gujarat ports. In one case, in July 1993, the DRI intercepted a lorry on the Pune-Belgaum highway. Starting from Vapi, Gujarat, and proceeding to the Tuticorin port in Kerala, the vehicle contained 2,300 kg mandrax concealed inside 180 bags partially loaded with onions. According to NCB sources, the mandrax was bound for Africa via Sri Lanka. What is of utmost importance to both the Indian authorities and the INCB is the fact that the use of mandrax is spreading to both the producer and transit countries. The INCB has noted in its 1993 report that manufacturing bases and even the use of mandrax have been found in countries such as Zambia and Kenya. In Kenya, three factories were dismantled in 1993. Even in India, there is an alleged case of a confectionery manufacturer in Gujarat who was selling toffees containing mandrax in major cities in Rajasthan. The toffee samples have been sent to the forensic labs by the NCB for further investigations. As an international narcotics expert in Delhi says: "If the problem is not contained now, it could become a worldwide phenomenon like heroin."
