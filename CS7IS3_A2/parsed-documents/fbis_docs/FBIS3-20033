In two to three years Iceland must decide whether the country will be linked to Europe or the United States. The decision is not easy, and a debate on the country's future is only just beginning. Pirjo Auvinen continues from Reykjavik: [Auvinen] The Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian negotiation results with the European Union [EU] surprised even Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson. By his own words, he could not imagine that agreement would be found so quickly. Hannibalsson said however, that he was even more surprised by the negotiation result achieved by Norway. According to him, it is much better than expected and is in fact good. Finland's and Sweden's EU membership is chiefly an academic matter for Iceland, which lives off fish and fish processing. On the other hand, Norway's potential membership in the EU brings Iceland to a historic situation, in the Icelandic foreign minister's own words. [Begin Hannibalsson recording in Swedish-Norwegian] [words indistinct] it is clear that Iceland is at a historic juncture, and we do not yet know in what direction we want to go. [end recording] [Auvinen] According to Foreign Minister Hannibalsson, Iceland must choose between two alternatives: Either it seeks membership in the EU like the other Nordic countries or it seeks to strengthen its current EEA [European Economic Area] treaty by concluding a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada. [passage omitted] According to Hannibalsson, by present prospects, Iceland cannot seek EU membership until after the big EU conference in 1996, but creating closer relations than at present with the United States would not be easy either. The foreign minister yesterday handed a report assessing those difficulties to the Icelandic parliament. Hannibalsson admits openly that Iceland may be drifting into a very isolated position. Its opportunities to exert influence will be reduced, and the Nordic cooperation, which is important to Iceland, will move beyond its reach. [passage omitted] According to Hannibalsson, the decision on which direction Iceland will take in future must be made quickly, in two to three years.
