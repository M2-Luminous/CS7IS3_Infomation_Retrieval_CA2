This is his personal assessment of what happened, he noted. "This is a problem for the Americans. They detained their own citizen, a CIA member, and they must deal with him in accordance with their own laws. Instead of it high-ranking U.S. officials have said, before trial, that this incident may have an impact on Russian-American relations. We do not quite understand it," Lavrov said. The U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, has already told Senate that he has no intention of commenting on events that concern America's intelligence work, he noted. "He can comment on other country's intelligence work, but not on that of America. Following this logic I must refrain from commenting on our activity, the more so as I do not see our activity in this case. What I see is that they arrested their own man. But this is their own problem. Let their court of law consider the charges against Ames," Lavrov said. He finds it hard to say why this incident "surfaced" right now. "Judging by what U.S. officials say, they have been dealing with this business for a long time. It's not quite clear why they decided to sort it out right now. This was a step taken by the American side, and we learned about it after the fact," the diplomat said. Lavrov was skeptical about the supposition that "the Ameses case" is a kind of "retaliation" for Russia's political efforts to resolve the crisis in Bosnia. "It's hard to imagine that the Americans decided to "avenge themselves" on Russia in this way. This would have been too petty," Lavrov said. With reference to his Tuesday's meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Thomas Pickering, the diplomat said that the ambassador had only handed him written information concerning Washington's reaction to the Ameses incident. "We accepted it and promised to study it in detail," Russia's deputy foreign minister said. It's essential to avoid "emotions and overdramatization" in connection with the Ameses case, said the Director of the Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy Karasin, at Thursday's briefing. The Foreign Ministry received information concerning this through "official channels", he said. "However there are many serious questions that need to be analysed before making any conclusions," Karasin noted. According to him, this should be dealt with by professionals from Russian and American secret services. "Contacts between them are well established. The main thing is to settle the incident without political or diplomatic complications and avoid kindling passions," the spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
