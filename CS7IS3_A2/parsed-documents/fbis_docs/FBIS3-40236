The work is mainly concentrated on two aspects. First of all, because the frequency of short waves is relatively higher, the magnetic and collision effects in refractive index are neglected, so that general ray equations are simplified. In the second place, a method of calculating the first-order partial derivative of ionospheric plasma parameters is presented. The calculation of the partial derivative is on the basis of model result of parameters of each ionospheric layer, that is, on the basis of mean background of ionospheric parameters. This method can be used in HF communications system, and other short-wave systems such as target-position system of HF radar, etc.
