He said at a meeting with the plant staff on Tuesday that today's campaign for the closure of the plant pursued "above all political" aims. However, the Ukrainian leadership "shares the concern of the world community over the future of the Chernobyl plant" and regards the construction of a reliable shelter above Chernobyl's generating unit no. Four and the commissioning of six new units at other nuclear plants as priority goals, Shmarov said. He said it would be a firm government policy to increase the role of nuclear plants in the country's power industry. Today Ukraine's nuclear plants generate a little over 30 percent of the country's electricity, but the government might increase this proportion due to the shortage of fuel for thermal plants. Shmarov said Ukraine had already sent to Russia three trainloads of nuclear warheads in fulfillment of a trilateral agreement between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States. As compensation for this, Russia is this year due to provide Ukraine with 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel rods. To date Ukraine has received one train with 25 tonnes of rods for the Zaporozhye plant, Shmarov said. The next shipment of fuel is due to arrive this month, he said, quoting Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov. Shmarov said the government was planning measures to bolster nuclear power engineering and support nuclear plant personnel. Thus, it has halved their income tax, is going to raise their wages and establish new tariffs for electricity generated by nuclear plants, which is today Ukraine's cheapest electricity, costing 200 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour. The charges for it are to be put up by 150 or 200 percent, which is expected to provide enough funds to buy fuel and components in Russia and implement safety measures. In winter 1994, units one and three of the Chernobyl plant, which are still in operation, produced 13 percent of the country's electricity. From the moment the plant was commissioned in 1977 to April 1, 1994, it has generated 258.9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, including 109 billion after the 1986 accident. The funds allocated for safety measures at the Chernobyl plant between 1986 and 1993 top one-quarter of the plant's initial cost. The plant today has a staff of about 5,000. The town of Slavutich, servicing the plant, has a population of about 25,000.
