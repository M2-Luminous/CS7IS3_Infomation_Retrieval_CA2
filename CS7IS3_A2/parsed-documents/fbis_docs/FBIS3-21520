In particular Valeriya Novodvorskaya has issued the following statement to the POSTFACTUM agency: "Inasmuch as the Russian president has found the time to express his distress over the tribulations of our hockey team at the Olympics and even telephoned personally to Norway while being unable to find either the time or the inclination to give an opinion on Vil Mirzayanov's imprisonment, on 21 February I sent two Western powers three secret studies of a strategic nature. That is I have done something which comes under article 65 of the Russian Federation criminal code -- `espionage.'" In addition V. Novodvorskaya said that unless Vil Mirzayanov is released by 10 March she will hand over the formula for a Russian binary weapon (over which all the trouble started) to a European Community state. Let us note that the chemist V. Uglev also intended to make this secret public. Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik yesterday repealed the preventive restriction measure chosen by the course for detaining Vil Mirzayanov. Now he must be released immediately on the undertaking that he does not change his address.
