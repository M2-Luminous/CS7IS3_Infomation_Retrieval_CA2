FBIS4-4996 "dreas066__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-066-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan MOPT To Support Nationwide Cable TV Network MOPT To Support Nationwide Cable TV Network OW0504131394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0504131394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] has started working on a project to promote the interconnection of locally operated cable television networks and to support the development of a multimedia services system which will link cable television services with telephone and other communications services. In addition to compiling a set of technical criteria for the connection of networks, the MOPT plans to conduct experiments into making practical use of cordless phones by utilizing cable television networks and eventually establishing cordless phone networks. Since the MOPT eased regulations concerning cable television services last December, it is possible that with the implementation of the new MOPT project, more trading firms and foreign cable television companies may now enter the market. Currently, approximately 1.08 million households throughout the nation have subscribed to cable television companies. This network has drawn much attention because of the possibility that it could compete favorably with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) network as a new data communications infrastructure. The MOPT's new project is aimed at encouraging the joint development of new services which will merge communications with broadcasting and the mutual provision of such services by connecting cable television networks, which are dispersed throughout the nation, with networks run by new common-carrier companies. According to plans, consideration will be given to the process of standardizing the interconnection of cable television networks, with the Cable Television Council (Kohei Kogure, chairman), which consists of 158 cable television companies, playing the major role. Studies will also be made of ways to solve technical problems regarding the joint use of different cable television networks in bidirectional services, such as video-on-demand with which viewers can see video programs at any time they want to. By experimenting with cordless phones, it is hoped that a new business can be established whereby subscribing households and other users can talk with each other by utilizing cable television networks. The cordless phone system enables cordless home phones to be used outdoors. Among its numerous advantages are that the entire system itself is very simple, with construction costs for automated transmission stations being considerably lower than the costs of constructing such stations for mobile telephone systems. One shortcoming of the system is that cordless phones cannot be used when a user is traveling at high speeds, but phone bills can be cheaper than for regular mobile telephone systems. Currently, experiments are being conducted primarily using NTT's local telephone networks in Tokyo, Sapporo, and other cities, but so far there has been no case of experiments using cable television networks. The MOPT plans to first conduct experiments by calling on cable television companies in Tokyo. It then plans to connect cable television stations together in the future to expand the areas of coverage. As for plans to link cable television networks with communications services, the Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui and Company, Ltd., the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Ltd., and the Tokyu Corporation have concluded a tie-up, in view of developing the multimedia industry in the future. The MOPT's project is expected to boost such moves among private firms.
