Dorenko says that the communications sector does not get money directly from the government but from the television companies it services, but bills have not been paid since December 1992. He says that Moscow is not suffering the consequences of the cash crisis in the communications sector as much as other regions of Russia. But as a result of satellites deteriorating from orbit, television broadcasts to the Far East are likely to stop this spring. Satellites servicing western Siberia and the Urals will go down a bit later, he says. In addition, the state broadcasting sector is not getting the state funds it needs. "At the moment the government refuses to allow state channels to become share-holding companies, but it does not finance them itself," he says. Dorenko then talks about corruption in the various editorial departments of state television when advertizing airtime is being sold. Many ad agencies resell air time bought cheaply at a profit, and the editorial departments compete with them. There is no shortage of independent companies ready to help state broadcasting out of its cash crisis, Dorenko adds, using Ostankino's Channel 1 as an example, where this is already happening. Next, Irena Lesnevskaya, president of REN TV [a private company that began broadcasting via Ostankino in 1992], is interviewed. She says: "Any talk about state television is mere bluff, because 78 percent of programs on Channel 1 are made by independent television companies, and each of Ostankino's state-funded studios has its own financial structure." She continues: "Today, they cannot make one program on state financing."
