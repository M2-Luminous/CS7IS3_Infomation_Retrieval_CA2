Exports of 3.7 billion schillings (plus 41.4 percent) were faced with imports of Chinese products of 7.8 billion schillings (plus 30.6 percent), it was stated during the presentation of a study of the Economic Research Institute on Tuesday [12 April]. "Machines and plants amount to almost 70 percent of Austria's exports to China," Ernst Laschan, Austrian trade delegate to Beijing, said. With an export share of only 0.5 percent, China is the 25th of target countries for domestic exports. In the field of engines and road vehicles, Austria has already worked out a good position on the Chinese market, he said. According to Laschan, Austria can protect future sales with products and know-how in the fields of agricultural technology, the securing of fresh water, energy, transportation systems, and telecommunications.
