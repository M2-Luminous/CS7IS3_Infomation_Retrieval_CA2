In a Monday interview with Interfax he said that the latest statement by Dudayev actually undermined the budding talks between Chechnya and the federal government bodies. On Sunday in an interview televised by NTV, Dudayev, who seemed very irritated, once again accused Russia of fanning tension around his republic and threatened to apply adequate measures to Russia. At a meeting with the press, Filatov said it was most strange that Groznyy actually refuses to continue the dialogue because he claimed it was the Chechen leadership that came with the initiative of the meeting between presidents Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokar Dudayev. Filatov regretted that instead of a policy of negotiations Dudayev chose the policy of seeking enemies. He described as a dirty game the attempt of the Chechen leader to label the decree of the Russian president on the expansion of the zone of the state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia as the occupation of Chechen territory by Russia. He said the spreading of the state of emergency regulations to Malgobek and Sunzhen regions of Ingushetia neighboring on Chechnya was agreed upon by Yeltsin and the Ingush President Ruslan Aushev and directed at strengthening stability and peace in the region. Filatov recognized that Dudayev is the actual Chechen leader who cannot be disregarded but said that a threat to Russian society comes from that area. He said arms are smuggled from Chechnya to Russia, trains are robbed, other crimes committed. "In any case Russia has two problems to resolve in Chechnya: socio-economic and fiscal, it has to protect Russian citizens there", Filatov said. He stressed that if passengers and cargos crossing Chechnya by rail are not protected, Russia might face the necessity of altering the railway route. Filatov said that despite the failure of the talks with Groznyy Moscow will try to analyze the reasons and define the way of normalizing relations. The sharp anti-Russian statements on the part of Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev make it impossible that Moscow appoint representatives for the talks on settlement of relations between the Russian federal bodies and Groznyy, Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov told Interfax today. He stressed that the president had earlier wanted new Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies Nikolay Yegorov to be the Russian chief negotiator at the talks with Chechnya.
