[passage omitted on trade negotiations] Sources further said that the Iraqi official suggested "sacrificing" the leaders of the opposition organization of Mojahedin-e Khalq if Iran agrees to resume trade operations. Iranian officials, who were interested several months ago in bringing the leaders of Mojahedin-e Khalq under control, rejected the tempting Iraqi offer because they believe the U.S. Administration is looking for "excuses to harass Iran."
