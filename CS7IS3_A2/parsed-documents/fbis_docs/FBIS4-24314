On the occasion of the meeting of the franc zone countries in Gabon, a broader stance was expected from francophone African countries. Stephane Manier and Philippe Josselin report: [Mannier] The 14 francophone African heads of state support France in Rwanda. They approved the humanitarian intervention in order to please Paris, whose greatest fear was that it would remain isolated. There is relief even if some reservations have slipped in behind this apparent unanimity. The final communique, for instance, uses generalities to approve the intervention and insists on the authority of the United Nations as a framework for any African participation. Does African participation necessarily mean sending in military troops? [Begin recording] [President Pascal Lissouba] In order to support the efforts currently under way, yes. [Mannier] In what framework will these troops be involved? [Lissouba] In whatever framework. Everything is now supported by the United Nations. [end recording] [Mannier] In any case, this will take a long time to implement, not only because the logistics of this participation must be finalized--and this is never simple in Africa--but mainly because it is important to know who will pay: [Begin Lissouba recording] My country is wrestling with major difficulties and we do not have means of transport, we do not have any equipment, we do not have the necessary logistics for that, so we are waiting for the United Nations to show willingness to help us, the United Nations or other countries, France for instance. [end recording] [Mannier] In fact, this is fair enough since this Libreville summit was theoretically devoted to monetary issues and to the aftermath of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc devaluation. The francophone African countries pointed out that, if Paris wanted to be helped, it had to show understanding toward Africa. The message seems to have been received. This is the way the best friendships are reinforced.
