Could it remain a neutral state or should it join the Western structures, such as NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]? [Mitterrand] I fully understand Bulgaria's concern regarding the situation we call the "security vacuum" in Central and East Europe. There are several ways to cope with this situation. The sense of insecurity, which is based on military considerations, springs from various other forms of instability that are related to the country's economic, social, and even ethnic situation. Therefore, France has proposed initiatives of preventive diplomacy that aim to prevent or decrease tension. This is the essence of the French idea on the pact of stability, which was adopted by the European Union. The other possibilities lie in strengthening bilateral cooperation, which we subscribe to. The third possibility is in working to bring the countries of Central and East Europe closer together, on the one hand, and the European security organizations and associations, on the other. In this context, France advocates opening up those structures to the aforementioned countries. France proposed a formula for the association within the WEU of the countries that have already been associated or are in the process of associating with the European Union. In addition, it is well known that the last NATO summit adopted the Partnership for Peace initiative. As I said in Brussels, this concept allows us to respond to the concern of states that want to associate with NATO and also avoid Russia's negative reaction -- which a new division of Europe would have caused, something that would have been detrimental to European security. For me, Partnership for Peace means that no threat could be directed against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any partner state without affecting the other partner states.
