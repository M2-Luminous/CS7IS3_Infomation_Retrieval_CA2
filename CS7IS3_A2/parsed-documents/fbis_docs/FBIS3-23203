The locomotive was on its way to pull a train with a load of rock from Chana back to Hat Yai. The incident took place at 0506 today in Ban Thung Phra, Tambon Paching, Chana District, Songkhla Province, only three kilometers from the Chana station. The explosion damaged the front of the locomotive and the tracks. The driver and engineer were unhurt. Authorities found two letters from the PULO [Pattani United Liberation Organization], one written in southern dialect and the other in Thai, claiming responsibility for the incident. They want the government to explain the motive behind the recent torching of schools in the south which, they said, was not the work of the PULO.
