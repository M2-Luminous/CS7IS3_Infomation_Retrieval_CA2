During the past three years, I have tried to obtain accurate figures on the size of unemployment in Egypt, as well as the type of unemployment. I have obtained judgements and estimates that do not inspire confidence, nor do they add anything to the already dissimilar numbers and varying estimates. Finally, I was asked to wait until registration was completed, which is the first count of the unemployed in cooperation between national and international experts. Finally, last week, I received a report on the results of the compilation, done by the cabinet's data center in all governorates, in cooperation with the Ministries of Local Administration and Manpower and Employment. It is a report that contains most the important and precise details, since the program used to prepare it confirms results reached through scientific impartiality and tells the truth about the facts of the issue. 1. Fact No. 1: This report gives us a sound basis for objective dialogue and puts the true scope of the problem squarely before us. It also presents extremely important data for each Egyptian individual and family. It must attract the attention of intellectuals, experts, businessmen, and the ministry responsible for workers and labor, which is the Ministry of Manpower and Employment. I ask the reader's permission to present this data, as it came in this report: - Number of those entering the labor market between 1982 and 1993, and who are seeking work...4,841,000 - Number of those trained for their jobs...3,415,887 - Total number of unemployed university and school graduates, who graduated between 1984 and 1993...1,425,113 - Percentage of those within the labor force...9.2 - Majority having mid-level qualifications...1,098,909 - Majority located in rural areas...1,007,356 - 31 percent of unemployed are married, and majority of them are female, or are males who have temporary jobs...435,066 2. Fact No. 2: The real size of the problem, and what must be dealt with, is the 990,047 persons who are looking for jobs. The other part includes females who are married and want to work, i.e., they have a family and, consequently, their need for work is less than the need of others. Despite being close to 1 million, the number is completely at variance with the philosophical judgements and claims to knowledge of those who, for a long time, persisted in estimating that unemployment in Egypt had reached several millions. I do not want to belittle the size of the problem, but I also would like to put it in its true perspective. I am pleased that I am the first to participate, through the al-AHRAM organization, in the call to formulate programs to ensure the reduction of this number to a few thousand, and to participate in implementing these programs. I believe that together--government, business organizations, banks, trade unions, and intellectuals--we can formulate these programs, arrange the funding required for them, and implement them efficiently. Yes, all of us, if our intentions are sincere, can put this issue on the agenda of all our leadership councils. All of us must take part in resolving this problem. All of us are responsible; the government is responsible for operating the largest possible number of training centers, and for giving direct incentives to those who absorb the unemployed. Economic and service projects are responsible for expanding their activities, opening new markets for their products, and increasing use of capabilities available to them. Young people are also responsible. They must accept jobs that may not be compatible with their academic qualifications. They must be persuaded that appropriate qualification is that qualification that is needed and demanded by the market, and not necessarily the qualification that they chose during their education. 3. Fact No. 3: For well-known reasons, the largest part of unemployment is in rural areas. The most important reasons are: the graduates' aversion to working in the fields after they are educated; decisive expansion in machine use, in order to increase production; and, limited growth in agricultural production and certain integrated, peripheral activities. The clear consequence of all this is the decisive need to think about the future of Egypt's rural development, since it is impossible to continue economic activities in a large number of governorates that are restricted to agriculture. That will lead to keeping the unemployed without work and will add to their number new thousands of those who have had opportunities for education and whose residence is in rural areas. Yes, it is impossible to continue the course of development as it is now in rural areas. There are certain successful experiences in the world at this time with regard to diversifying economic activities in the countryside, using agricultural activity as a springboard for other activities. Experiences in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China deserve close study. Therefore, I call on the government to form a team of national experts who have had previous experience in the business sector, and task them with going to these countries, studying their experiences in comprehensive rural development, obtaining all necessary details, and absorbing possible lessons from these experiences. They should then formulate programs that could be implemented in Egypt, defining the mechanisms of implementation, resources required, and appropriate sources for these resources. 4. Fact No. 4: Those with middle-level qualifications represent the largest part of those seeking work (77 percent of the total unemployed). This clearly means that the market does not need their skills. It is also clear that the holder of an industrial diploma has not been trained to be a craftsman. The holder of a commercial diploma has not been qualified to be a skilled specialist in financial and accounting matters. The holder of the skills acquired with an agricultural diploma is limited to working agricultural jobs. If it is necessary to keep this kind of education, it will be necessary to change the content and method of preparation. The change should be radical. We all know that this is not an easy matter. It requires time and resources. However, we also know that keeping the situation as it is at present is no longer acceptable. Every lesson learned from the preceding experience of other countries tells us that they abandoned the kind of education that is applied in Egypt, and replaced it with vocational training. This vocational education gives only one day of class work to every five days of practical experience, that is training in the work place. Egyptian education and instructional experts should repeatedly visit those countries, in order to create a plan to introduce the desired developments into our curricula in these schools and vocational training programs. I would also like to see intensified activity to breathe life into the nearly 450 training centers scattered throughout Egypt, although the data available to me confirms that the biggest part of them need radical development of their capabilities and administration. Training technical cadres is one of the principal pivotal points on the road to reducing unemployment. We must give it special importance and maximum priority in our concerns. The current picture needs changing. The time has come to attract special attention from the ministers of industry and the labor force. The problem is urgent and its remedy requires both time and money. Our sincere efforts on a sound basis will achieve tangible results toward controlling the problem and limiting it. Everyone must cooperate to attain this major goal. I repeat once more: everyone, not just the government alone, but also professional and labor organizations, investors, young people searching for work who must develop their abilities, and people of vision and ideas concerned with political and party action. Everyone is a partner in this responsibility; the issue is everyone's issue, and not the issue of the government alone or of any specific quarter.
