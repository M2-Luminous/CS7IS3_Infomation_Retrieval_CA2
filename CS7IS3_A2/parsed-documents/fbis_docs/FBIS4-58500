He said: What should be emphasized first is that Palestine is part of the great Arab homeland which was exposed to foreign settler occupation, and that Zionist Israeli racism, which gave concrete expression to this occupation, is endeavoring to occupy extensive parts of the Arab homeland. This is a fact which is not born of inference, since these Israeli settlers have written it in prominent letters on the door of the so-called Israeli Knesset, in a phrase saying: Your land, O Israel, from the Euphrates to the Nile. Second, awareness of this fact and of its dangers and dimensions inevitably leads one to say that the security and stability of the region cannot be guaranteed without the removal of this colonial settler racist entity and the establishment of a democratic state in the region, after the return of the invaders to the countries from which they came. If this is not achieved, the Arab presence in its entirety will be threatened and the survival of all Arabs in their homeland from the ocean to the Gulf will be doubtful. The Arabs will remain in the range of Israeli nuclear bombs and weapons of mass destruction and exposed to destruction by these weapons. The editor adds that this is a reality that cannot be hidden by persistent acts of deception, pressure, and obliging people signing worthless conventions. All this remains an illusion and a waste of time, and does not resolve the problem. The solution will never be achieved without the return of the Palestinian homeless to their own land, their homes, farms, and shops, the return of the foreigners to their countries of origin, from where they had come, and by removing the threat and danger from the Arab region, which constitute the main element of tension in the region. If at the present stage the superpowers are making their potentials available to lead the Arabs to recognize falsification, forgery, and lies, all this will remain temporary. Our advice to these superpowers is to bear true historic responsibility in order to secure a genuine solution to the problem by bearing the cost of the return of the Palestinian refugees to their country, Palestine, and the return of the alien jews to their origins. Everything else is an exercise in lies and forgery. If the U.S. Government is serious in seeking a genuine peace it must bear this responsibility. The editor affirms that neither this generation nor the coming generations of Arabs and Muslims will recognize the right of a settlement-based racist invasion on a single inch of their country, or a single grain of dust, and they will continue to fight until doomsday for their own right.
