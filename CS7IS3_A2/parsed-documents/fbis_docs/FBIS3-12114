The serious crisis caused, a few hours afterward, the sudden "irreversible" resignation of Minister of Government Antonio Paleari, who had harshly criticized provincial Justicialist Party deputies, and had questioned the national government for adopting a "discriminatory" attitude toward Jujuy in comparison with other provinces. Meanwhile, the front of public workers unions decided tonight to continue the measures of force tomorrow, including a strike that will be observed in different ways depending on the unions. For example, high school teachers will not attend classes, primary school teachers will work normally, and workers from the rest of the unions will cease activities at their workplaces and hold assemblies. The incidents began taking place today at noon, when about 150 demonstrators out of the 1,500 who were participating in the protest stoned the government house, broke its windows, and hurled several Molotov cocktails and noise bombs. The acts of violence forced the police to disperse the rioters with tear gas and rubber bullets, with the support of cavalrymen. Soon after, a group of about 50 people headed for the private home of Governor Jose Carlos Ficoseco, which they stoned, and where they broke the windows of his Chevrolet pickup truck and a Renault car that was parked there. After normalcy returned, and a little before resigning, Minister of Government Paleari blamed the SEOM [expansion unknown] and ATE [Association of State Workers] unions, headed by Carlos "Perro" Santillan and Fernando Acosta, for the outrages. Paleari said that "one of the injured policemen, whose last name is Chauqui, is in serious condition as a consequence of the explosion in his face of a noise bomb, which made him lose his hearing on his left side, while he is in serious danger of losing the sight in his left eye." The minister of government also denied that the police who had dissolved the demonstration had used live ammunition, although he admitted they had used "rubber bullets" besides the tear gas. According to Paleari, the civilians who were wounded had slight injuries, one of them having received a rubber bullet in one of his buttocks. He added that a policewoman was also wounded. Among the four arrested individuals, from whom the police confiscated "pamphlets with the picture of `Che' Guevara inciting people to violence, two of them were totally drunk." The serious situation in this capital today caused "concern" in the national government, and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf analyzed the problem with his aides, although it was said that "they never considered putting the province into trusteeship." Governor Ficoseco decided to send a draft bill to the provincial legislature restructuring the public workers' wages, which for the lowest paid workers would represent a 50 percent increase. The incidents began happening today at noon, about an hour after CTERA [Confederation of Educational Workers of the Argentine Republic] workers, headed by their national leader Mary Sanchez, began gathering. The CTERA column carried an approximately 400 meter long Argentine flag. The rioters hurled inside the government house "at least four Molotov cocktails" nearly causing a fire that was immediately put out, while several other noise bombs exploded. A little after that, the provincial police and cavalrymen dissolved the rioters by hurling tear gas and shooting rubber bullets, after which calmness returned to downtown San Salvador de Jujuy. "If national intervention in the province is done to solve our problems, let it be welcome," former Minister Paleari told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, after saying that so far "Ruckauf said these were only rumors, and that there is no reason" for intervention. Paleari, who at no moment indicated that he would resign, said that the "SEOM and ATE unions were the only two public unions that rejected an 80 peso wage increase as of April plus 20 additional pesos in 120 days," and he accused them of originating the incidents. Paleari acknowledged that "since 1991 the salaries" of the provincial public workers "have been frozen," and he confirmed that "some workers earn 123 pesos per month." After reporting on the violent incidents, Paleari officially announced at 1930 that he had tendered his "irreversible resignation" and that Governor Ficoseco had accepted it, by which his post is being temporarily held by Government Secretary Alfredo Frias. Provincial government spokesmen believe that "Paleari's replacement will be defined tomorrow," adding that "Governor Ficoseco plans to travel within the next few hours to the federal capital to analyze with national government officials the problem" in Jujuy Province.
