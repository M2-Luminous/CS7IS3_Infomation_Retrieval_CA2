The government is negotiating a virtual Brazilian candidacy -- parallel to the candidacy of countries such as India, Japan, and Germany -- but keeping in sight that "the regional component is the most sensitive one." Venezuelan Foreign Ministry sources told this newspaper that they are only supporting the Japanese and German candidacies for the new permanent seats that may be created in the UN Security Council. So far, Brazil is not a Venezuelan Foreign Ministry favorite. Argentina, the main Brazilian partner in the region, prefers to support Japan instead of favoring the Brazilian aspiration. The issue, however, requires that diplomats be careful not to offend partner countries. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim does not want to comment on the Argentine position. He only notes that the issue was "frankly" discussed during his meeting with Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion in Brasilia a few days ago. Amorim added: "Camilion said the issue must be dealt with carefully because it is not ripe and this is understandable. We are trying to talk matters over and reach understandings." According to the minister, the ideal thing would be not to have permanent UN Security Council members. "In the world, however, there are five countries (the United States, France, the PRC, Russia, and England) that will not give up being permanent members. The world has changed. The council will have to be expanded. Brazil believes this expansion will not increase the current imbalances and does not want to see only certain types of countries receiving privileges. This would not be good for the Security Council," Amorim says. According to the foreign minister, the adoption of similar positions by Latin American countries that will be represented by Brazil in the UN Security Council -- Brazil's name has been raised by the UN secretary general, and "whenever the issue is discussed, its name crops up naturally" -- may, however, run into difficulties, particularly regarding Argentina. There is still some animosity in the region about eventual Brazilian hegemonic attitudes. A diplomatic source explained to this newspaper: "The issue lies in how our neighbors will take the idea." The Foreign Ministry's assessment, however, is that during the second stage, when discussions for expanding the number of UN Security Council members reaches the point of defining these new members, Argentina will support Brazil's candidacy. The idea of expanding the UN Security Council was raised two years ago and is supported by the United States, which even accepts the inclusion of more than five members without veto power. The voting is scheduled to be held during the 1995 UN General Assembly that will be attended by 184 UN members. But Article 108 of the UN Charter establishes that all Security Council decisions must be approved at the national level by each of the five permanent UN Security Council members that can block the decision. Brazil hopes to have the support of all five member countries. Moreover, as Foreign Minister Celso Amorim informed this newspaper on 4 March, Brazilian diplomacy does not hide its satisfaction at receiving a letter a few days ago from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher praising Brazil's participation in the discussions on the former Yugoslavia. Amorim noted that Ronaldo Sardenberg, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Nations, heads the Security Council's Sanctions Committee. Brazil, like Argentina, has been participating in the council for a two-year period as a rotating member. According to Ambassador Jose Viegas Filho, under secretary of the Foreign Ministry Political Planning Department, the General Assembly has established a working group that already has held two sessions. The UN Security Council's expansion aims to reduce regional imbalance. Except for China, the five members with veto power are almost all developed countries. There are no representatives from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, or Africa. Brazilian diplomacy has been working on several fronts to spread the image that Brazil is a reliable country and "a center of stability" in the region, where it shares borders with 10 countries and has no disputes. A Foreign Ministry source said: "Brazilian nuclear policy today is viewed as reliable and no country is asking us to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty." Last week, President Itamar Franco promulgated the nuclear safeguard treaty signed by Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that was approved by Congress. Brazil also has signed the treaty proscribing weapons of mass destruction such as chemical and biological weapons, and actively participated in drafting new amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty on the denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean, but the Senate has yet to approve it. In 1993, Brazil headed the Vienna Conference on Human Rights. Although the foreign minister alleges that "Brazil cannot nominate itself," and that its name was mentioned because of its size and importance -- "Brazil has a face turned to Africa; it shares borders with many Latin American countries, and it has a tradition of the peaceful solution of controversies" -- Brazilian diplomatic circles believe that "its upholding of Western diplomatic values and understanding of the problems affecting other developing countries" are a plus in favor of Brazil.
