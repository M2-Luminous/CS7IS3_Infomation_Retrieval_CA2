FR940105-1-00017 FR940105-1-00006 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.: Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;20&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters, equipped with main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion as a result of takeoffs and external loads lifts (high-power events), that could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish the following: (1) Create a historical service record or component history card for the trunnion. (2) Determine the actual time-in-service of the trunnion from maintenance records, if possible. If the actual time-in-service cannot be determined, use a time-in-service of 900 hours per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. (3) For Model 214B and 214B&hyph;1 helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows: (i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 12 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). (ii) If the number of high-power events is known, divide that number by 2 and record the resulting number as the total accumulated high-power events. (4) For Model 214ST helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows: (i) If the number of events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). (ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as the total accumulated high-power events. (b) After the effective date of this AD, continue to record high-power events in the aircraft maintenance record. For Model 214B and 214B&hyph;1 helicopters, divide the number of high-power events by 2 and add the resulting number to the previously recorded sum. For Model 214ST helicopters, add the high-power events to the previously recorded sum. (c) Remove the trunnion and replace it with an airworthy trunnion in accordance with the following: (1) For each trunnion with 59,400 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the trunnion on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. (2) For each trunnion with less than 59,400 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the trunnion on or before attaining 60,000 high-power events. (d) This AD revises the helicopter Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing a new retirement life for the trunnion. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time, which provides an acceptable level of safety, may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0170. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on November 5, 1993. Larry M. Kelly, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
