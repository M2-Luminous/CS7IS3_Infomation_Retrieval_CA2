He said that the population of the Khabarovsk and Krasnoyarsk Territories and the Amur Region had been declining, which was alarming in the light of media reports of Chinese expansion into the Russian Far East. Podoprigora also noted that the government and parliament had to upgrade the powers of those regions while not losing sight of national interests. He believed that serious thought had to be given to the Chinese proposal that an economic cooperation zone be set up in Blagoveshchensk. Podoprigora emphasized that regional interests should not be neglected in drafting Russian-Chinese relations. He added that the residents of border areas were not all happy about the agreement between the former USSR and China under which the border should run along the mainstream of the Amur. The former border line used to be practically the Chinese bank of the river. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the State Duma, said at the news conference that Russia's active military and political cooperation with the West had to go hand-in-hand with stepping up cooperation with China in these fields. He called for introduction of regulations for Chinese citizens on Russian soil. According to the police, there are nearly 370,000 of them, he said. Lukin said that a State Duma delegation headed by Ivan Rybkin will visit China on 14-18 May. He thought that the visit would contribute to dynamic development of the bilateral relations.
