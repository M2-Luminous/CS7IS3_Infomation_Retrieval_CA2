Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, made these remarks at a meeting here with Hans Sterken, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Federal Assembly. He said there are a total of 56 nationalities in China. Those minority nationalities are practicing national autonomy according to their own actual conditions. Qiao added that Tibet has for many years exercised national autonomy. For a long time, it had a population of only one million and now its population rises to two million-odd of which 96 percent belong to Tibet nationalities. "So there does not exist such a problem that a great number of the Han nationality have emigrated to Tibet," he said. On China's labor force, Qiao said it is inevitable and reasonable that during the socialist transitional period, there exists the flow of labor force. He expressed the belief that such kind of situation will be eased after many enterprises run by townships and villages in the rural areas have sprung up. During the meeting Qiao also exchanged views with Sterken on international situation and bilateral ties, reaffirming that China's foreign policy is consistent. Today Qiao also met on the separate occasions with Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party, and Ludwig Glos, first vice-chairman of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union -- the Christian Social Union.
