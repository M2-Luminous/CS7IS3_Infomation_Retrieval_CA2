To this end, an experiment was carried out on 150 g male albino rats, and corazol was injected intraperitoneally based on a ratio of 30 mg per 1 kg of body weight 50 s, 2 and 10 min, and 3 h before decapitation. The experimental procedure is outlined. The effect of MAD on the specific [.sup]3[/] H-muscimol binding is summarized, and the dynamics of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA capture by the rat brain synaptosomes are plotted. Allowing for known data on the nicotinamide interaction with the GABA-benzodiazepin receptor complex and the findings of this study, the conclusion is drawn that the pharmacological effect of nicotinamide used for clinical treatment of epileptic seizures may be realized through NAD which activates the GABA receptors, thus facilitating the GABA-ergic transmission. In affecting the terminal stage of postsynaptic action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, NAD is capable of inhibiting the synaptosomal capture of [.sup]14[/] C-GABA just like the capture inhibitors which are efficient anticonvulsant drugs.
