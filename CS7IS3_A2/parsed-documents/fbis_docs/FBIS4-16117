Our colleague Menzere Sadiqova reports: [Sadiqova] At a meeting in Baku with the representatives of the embassies and missions of 15 countries and the UN, as well international organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov gave a briefing on the extraordinary situation that has emerged at the fronts. In this context he referred to the Azerbaijan president's televised address yesterday and touched upon the new positions set out in that address. Gasan Gasanov noted that the new wave of powerful Armenian attacks above all results from the impunity enjoyed by the Armenian Republic. The countries of the world have so far not imposed any military, political, economic, or even the least moral sanctions against the Armenian aggressors, who have been occupying Azerbaijani territory for the past six years. Instead, the Armenian Republic receives both arms and humanitarian assistance from abroad. The minister pointed out that giving humanitarian assistance to an aggressor state is an unprecedented event in international practice. The Armenian Republic is the first state ever to receive humanitarian assistance from foreign countries while engaging in military aggression. In an attempt to mislead the international community, the Armenian leaders often assert that the war is being waged by Daghlyk-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. If so, which country or countries are providing the most modern weapons, heavy artillery, and fuel to Daghlyk-Karabakh? In refutation of this duplicitous Armenian policy, the Azerbaijani foreign minister produced substantial proof. Speaking to the international community, he firmly condemned attempts by certain forces to force Azerbaijan to its knees and noted that history has repeatedly shown that it is not possible to suppress the people's will. Noting that foreign countries have adopted a passive stance toward the aggression of the Armenian Republic and its occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory, Gasan Gasanov explained that the intensification of the Armenian attacks is linked to the end of winter. If we recall the events of the last three or four years, we see that Armenia has usually seized Azerbaijani territory between April and September. In an all-around assessment of the Azerbaijani president's televised address, Gasan Gasanov once again clarified our state's peace-loving position regarding the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Referring to yesterday's presidential address, he emphasized that if the war is ended we will unconditionally guarantee the security of the Armenian population of Daghlyk-Karabakh. After Gasanov's statement, the diplomats were invited to ask questions, but none of them wanted to ask anything or make a statement, because the situation in our republic is well known to foreign diplomats. Relevant documents were distributed to the guests after the meeting. We hope that these foreign diplomats will report back to their countries on the issues raised today during the Azerbaijani foreign minister's meeting with them, and that when the international community gets this objective information on the real situation in Azerbaijan it will finally move to restrain the aggressor Armenian state. For this to happen, the efforts of the foreign diplomats must coincide with the political interests of the countries they represent. Gasan Gasanov held a news conference today on the subjects discussed at the meeting. He noted that the big powers' failure to brand Armenia as an aggressor and the free hand given them as a result has been encouraging the Armenians, who have the impression that they can achieve their goals sooner if they occupy more Azerbaijani territory. Having disregarded the peace-making efforts of prestigious international organizations and (?various) groups, the Armenians--who usually have military successes during summer--have now launched a new campaign of aggression. We must use all our diplomatic means and sanctions should be implemented to halt the aggressor. It became obvious at the news conference that the latest attacks have wreaked destruction in Geranboyskiy and Terterskiy Rayons; and in addition to the fighters, civilians have also been harmed. Gasan Gasanov answered reporters' questions on (?current affairs). Though there were not many reporters, the news conference was held in a lively atmosphere.
