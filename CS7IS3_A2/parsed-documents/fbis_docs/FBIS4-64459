'Arafat, who had come to Stuttgart on Monday [2 May] upon invitation by the Daimler-Benz AG, said that since the entire infrastructure in the occupied territories has been destroyed, Palestine must "start from scratch." Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG board of directors, said that European companies are willing to make their contribution to ensuring peace in the Middle East. Peace will last only if there is economic and social stability in the entire region. "In the long run political peace can be achieved and safeguarded only through strong and resistant economic networks," Reuter said. It is to be hoped that in the Middle East there will soon be peaceful coexistence, which includes the Palestinian's self-determination just as well as Israel's secure existence. The Daimler-Benz chief paid tribute to the PLO chairman's credit in unerringly working toward giving peace concrete shape, "against all resistance and despite all setbacks, confronted by intrigues, violence, and terror." Reuter promised 'Arafat a development study drawn up by the corporations' subsidiary Dornier Management Consulting. The study is to show how transportation and traffic systems can be expanded across borders. It is also to continue information about how border-crossing cooperation can be implemented in the field of water supplies and telecommunication. Daimler-Benz also wants to train Palestinian managers and craftsmen. 'Arafat was particularly enthusiastic about Reuter's promise that the corporation will finance the construction and operation of a kindergarten for small Palestinian children in need. "We do not want to talk about gigantomaniac projects," Reuter said, after he had received his guest at Echterdingen airport, "but about individual steps that provide progress to the people in the Middle East." Talks with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres in Israel in September 1992 obviously encouraged Reuter's intention to invite 'Arafat to Stuttgart. Reuter expressed what the corporation hopes to achieve by that as follows: "We do not want to wait passively for the peace process in the Middle East, but we want to play an active role in it." In addition, the corporation wants to open up market opportunities in the Middle East for itself -- in an area, whose number of inhabitants will rise from the current 103 million to 125 million within a few years. In the conversation with 'Arafat, Reuter said that the Middle East needs political and economic managers so that one of the world's most attractive economic regions can be established there. This February Daimler-Benz opened a corporation representation in Jerusalem and Cairo. Reuter announced that the company wants to develop a constructive network of business relations in the Middle East. Some of the things that are produced by the four company sectors of Daimler-Benz, was shown to 'Arafat in the yard of the corporation headquarters in Stuttgart-Moehringen: passenger cars, industrial vehicles, Airbus planes, helicopters, and microelectronic parts, as well as a model of the ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed train. The corporation coordinated the PLO chairman's visit with the Chancellor's Office in Bonn as well as with Foreign Minister Kinkel and FRG Economics Minister Rexrodt. The meeting in Stuttgart was preceded by German managers' contacts with politicians and companies in Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. The company has Social Democratic Party [SDP] politician Wischnewski ("Ben Wisch") as Middle East adviser, who was also present in Stuttgart on Monday. 'Arafat was accompanied by Mr. Qaddumi, the PLO's expert for foreign policy and economy, Executive Committee Member Nashashibi, and PLO representative to Bonn Franji. A luncheon in the Baden-Wuerttemberg capital was also attended by Minister-President Teufel and Mayor Rommel. In the evening Teufel hosted a reception for 'Arafat in the New Palace in Stuttgart, the former residence of the Wuerttemberg kings. The unusual event of an economic corporation inviting the PLO chief and thus stepping on foreign policy territory was commented by Daimler-Benz general manager Kleiner by saying: "We want creative togetherness of politics and economy while not calling the primacy of politics into question." 'Arafat expressed confidence about the signing of the autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. Even though difficulties still have to be overcome, "where there is a will there is a way." The PLO chairman described his role in the negotiations as follows: "It takes two to tango." He cannot yet give the date when he will return to Jerusalem, Jericho, or Gaza. This depends on when the Israelis will withdraw.
