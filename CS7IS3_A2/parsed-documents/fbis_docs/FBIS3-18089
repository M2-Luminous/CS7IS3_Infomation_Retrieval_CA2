Less than an hour ago the decisive final negotiations were started, and heavy going is expected in the case of the budget, where the EU has said no to lowered fees and, instead, is offering Sweden an extra sum of money. [Begin recording] [Reporter] It takes two to tango, Swedish Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said in Brussels today at his international news conference. [passage indistinct] Sweden is negotiating with 12 countries who are having their own internal games, but today the EU countries were finally united on their offers. It is still a clear no to Sweden which hoped for a lowered membership fee during the first few years. Instead, Sweden is being offered a sum of money which is about four million Swedish crowns, less than one-third the rebate Sweden was hoping to get. Despite this, Sweden is still the country with the best negotiation situation. Is Sweden going to sign the deal without the other countries seeking membership, if the other candidates stay behind, Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel? [Dinkelspiel] If we reach a satisfactory agreement and both parties feel that it is time to sign the agreement, then we will sign the agreement. But, our ambition and the ambition of the EU is that all candidate countries will be able to conclude at practically the same time, and we are going to work towards this end.
