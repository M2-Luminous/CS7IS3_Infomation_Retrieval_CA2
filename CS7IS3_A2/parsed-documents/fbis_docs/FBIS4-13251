[Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] We know how much you love Lebanon and its people. What can say after this meeting with Speaker Birri and the parliamentary delegation? [Husayn] This meeting is a blessed one. The beloved members of the delegation are now in their second homeland, and I am happy to have this chance to welcome my brothers. The hopes and aspirations of both sides are the same. We are the closest to each other among the Arabs. We pray God that henceforth, the march of real coordination and cooperation will resume. We have great expectations that wider Arab coordination and cooperation will take place in these difficult circumstances and in face of the challenges. There is much love for Lebanon in the hearts of all Jordanians from various origins. We are proud of our strong, brotherly, and continuous relations with God's care. [Correspondent] Your Majesty, Speaker Birri described you as the most patient Arab leader. How do you view the future of this region, especially Lebanon and Jordan? [Husayn] This is nice coming from my brother, and it is an honor to me and to Jordan. In fact, these circumstances require patience. But on the other hand, we feel that these circumstances will not continue in terms of our suffering in the whole of the Arab world. Therefore, we are patient and we wait for a real awakening and a serious and meaningful Arab move. We believe in the Arab individual and that it is inevitable that he will have the right to live and will attain all his rights in his greater Arab homeland. [Correspondent] Thank you Your Majesty.
