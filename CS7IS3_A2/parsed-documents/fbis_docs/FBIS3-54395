Syria, through the head of its delegation, reiterated its firm stand toward the bases of a just and comprehensive peace. It reaffirmed that the full return of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the homeland is a basic condition for the success of ongoing efforts. In fact, Syria's stand from now on does not need any explanation or reaffirmation. It has been the same stand since the launching of the U.S. peace initiative that led to the Madrid conference. It is the same stand expressed in the Syrian working paper presented during the sixth round of the Washington talks, which is still the only acknowledged working paper on which the talks are conducted. It is also the same stand embodied by President al-Asad at the Geneva summit when he called for the peace of the brave--a peace that removes Israeli occupation and restores usurped rights to their owners. During the Geneva summit, Syria, represented by President al-Asad, categorically, unequivocally, and clearly expressed its commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and its response to all the requisites of such a peace. Meanwhile, Israel so far has not taken the anticipated and necessary step to push the peace process forward, that is, through an announcement of its full willingness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Indeed, what we heard from Israeli officials does not foster optimism. These officials sought to cast doubts on Syria's intentions and on the use of the Geneva summit. They proposed holding a referendum in the Golan, as if the occupiers have the right to hold a referendum on territory that has been Syrian since time immemorial and that remains an inseparable part of Syria. About 150,000 Syrian evacuees are waiting for peace to prevail in order to return to the Golan and live normal lives in their homes and territory. The head of the Israeli delegation to the Washington talks said that the atmosphere was positive and encouraging. This is because Syria affirmed its absolute commitment to an honorable peace in the Middle East. However, it also affirmed its adherence to a comprehensive solution on all the conflict's fronts and to the return of the Golan Heights to its people. In fact, it is impossible to talk about positive and encouraging atmospheres without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan and without Israel's actual involvement in the peace process by fully responding to the Security Council resolutions and showing willingness to meticulously implement these resolutions. Israeli officials so far have not promised a full withdrawal, but instead have talked about a form of withdrawal. Syria, as everyone knows, will not relinquish an inch of its territory or any of its rights. It will never accept a compromise solution in the Golan that leads to sharing this Syrian territory and rewarding the aggressor for his aggression. Syria responded to the U.S. request to resume the Washington talks on the level of chief delegates. This is because the United States is absolutely and clearly committed to the comprehensiveness of the solution, to the Security Council resolutions, and to the land-for-peace principle. U.S. President Bill Clinton reaffirmed these commitments. He said that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is a first priority for his government and that the United States will exert every effort possible to achieve the desired honorable peace. Here, we should recall that during the Geneva summit, President Clinton supported President al-Asad's call to achieve the peace of the brave and considered it the only way to achieve stability in the region. The United States is playing a major role in pushing the peace process forward and rendering it a success. Hence, the positive results people are eagerly anticipating depend on Israel. When the latter abandons its policy of evasion, prevarication, and procrastination, puts an end to its useless maneuvers such as the idea of holding a referendum on the Golan, and pledges to implement the Security Council resolutions and to end the occupation, only then will peace be at hand. Peace serves the interest of all. It serves the interest of the countries in the region, the world community, and the United States itself. The stability of the world stems from the stability of the Middle East. It is no coincidence or complement that peace in our region is at the top of the U.S. Administration's list of priorities.
