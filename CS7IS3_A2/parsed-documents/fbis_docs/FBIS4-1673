The province has built more than 4,500 reservoirs and dug a network of river courses and ditches since the late 1970s when the country began its rural reform. At present, the province has brought 2.63 million hectares of farmland under irrigation, which may secure a good crop despite drought or excessive rain. "Science has played an important role in Anhui's agricultural development," a provincial official in charge of agriculture said. The Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences alone has since 1986 made 189 research achievements. Many of them have been applied in production. One survey shows that farmers in Anhui have spent 5.6 billion yuan in purchasing farm machines.
