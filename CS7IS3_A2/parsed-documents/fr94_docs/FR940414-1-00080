FR940414-1-00080 FR940414-1-00010 To provide a more comprehensive accounting of the costs of achieving compliance with the proposed PFPR regulation, EPA therefore identified and assessed additional mechanisms by which facilities might achieve cost savings through use of pollution prevention. Specifically, EPA identified five mechanisms by which facilities may offset some of their regulatory compliance costs through pollution prevention. Two mechanisms are associated with the direct costs of PFPR processing and manufacturing PAIs: recovery of PAIs, and recovery of water (reducing water and discharge costs). The other three mechanisms, termed indirect cost savings, arise from reductions in facility and firm costs (or other business-enhancing benefits) that are not directly associated with the manufacturing or PFPR processing of PAIs. These indirect cost savings mechanisms include: reductions in permitting costs, reductions in business insurance premiums, and reductions in firm cost of capital. Using Survey data for PFPR facilities subject to regulation, EPA estimated facility-specific savings for the two direct cost mechanisms listed above. Although EPA was not able to estimate facility-specific savings for the three indirect cost mechanisms, EPA assessed these opportunities on the basis of discussions with permitting authority and insurance and finance industry personnel and a review of relevant literature. From these discussions and reviews, EPA concluded that the indirect cost mechanisms would also offer cost-savings opportunities to PFPR industry firms that adopt pollution prevention measures as part of their compliance strategy. 1. Savings From Reduced Water Use and Water Discharge Wastewaters that contain reusable PAIs can be recovered and reused with the same line or processes in a PFPR facility from which it was taken. Economic benefits can accrue due to the reduced demand for new water and as well from decreased volume of wastewater discharge and associated sewage system costs. In its analysis, EPA assumed 100 percent reduction or reuse of water that is currently discharged. Water and sewer rates were obtained from Ernst & Young's Water and Wastewater 1992 Survey of the monthly rates for the 100 largest metropolitan areas. EPA supplemented this rate information with data on water rates for facility locations not covered by the Ernst & Young data. Also, EPA adjusted these rates to reflect the trend in expected increases in water and sewer rates which is greater than the general rate of inflation. For the 529 facilities with compliance costs under Option 3/S, EPA estimated that 519 facilities could be expected to achieve water and sewer cost savings by use of pollution prevention. For those facilities achieving cost savings, the mean water and sewer savings is estimated at $213 per annum. The maximum annual savings at an individual facility is approximately $11,000. On average, these savings represent about one percent of the total annualized compliance costs for the facilities expected to achieve water and sewer cost savings. However, the maximum percentage of compliance costs estimated to be saved at a specific facility is about 11 percent of total annual compliance costs. For some facilities, therefore, the reuse and recovery of water and PAIs can provide substantial savings. On the basis of the individual facility values, EPA estimates national aggregate annual benefits from water and sewer savings of $116,000. 2. Savings From Recovery and Reuse of PAIs Under Option 3/S, facilities will recover PAIs from interior wastewater streams. The value of these PAIs was estimated based on PAI-specific prices calculated for the pesticide manufacturers effluent guideline when necessary data were available, and from secondary sources when not. Of the 545 facilities expected to incur compliance costs under Option 3/S, 354 were assessed as being able to recover and reuse PAIs by use of pollution prevention in complying with the proposed PFPR regulation. In aggregate, facilities are estimated to save about 77,816 pounds of active ingredient per year with a total value of $628,065 (in 1988 dollars). The mean estimated annual PAI savings per facility with savings was estimated at $1,777. On average, these savings represent about 0.65 percent of these facilities' total annual compliance cost. The facility with the highest savings is estimated to save $427,000 per year. 3. Savings From Reduced Costs of Permits and Fees EPA believes that facilities may also save money by reducing indirect and direct discharge permitting costs as a result of using pollution prevention measures in complying with Option 3/S. Permitting costs include application fees, costs of preparing applications, discharge monitoring reports and engineering reports, annual fees, and monitoring costs. A review of permitting information from several states with PFPR facilities showed that permitting costs vary considerably from state to state. In general, reducing or eliminating discharge volumes through pollution prevention should allow facilities to save on permitting costs. In some cases, facilities may be able to forego permitting costs entirely by eliminating discharges. In other cases, facilities may incur lower permitting costs. For example, several states vary permit application and maintenance fees based on facility discharge volumes and complexity of discharge streams. Some states indicated that their permit fee structures have been explicitly designed, or are being designed, to promote pollution prevention as a discharge reduction or elimination method. The permitting cost amounts that may be saved vary from a few hundred dollars a year for some POTW-related charges to tens of thousands of dollars for direct discharge permits. As an illustration of the possible significance of these savings, EPA developed an example scenario in which total PFPR industry annual permitting cost savings might amount to $2 million or more. The Agency solicits comments from the industry and other parties on the likelihood and possible value of such savings. 4. Savings From Reduced Insurance Premiums Although liability and general business insurance policies do not currently incorporate discounts for use of pollution prevention, trends in insurance coverage show that decreasing risks in the chemical industry will be reflected in cost savings in the insurance premiums. Specifically, the insurance industry has begun to recognize that pollution prevention efforts can reduce a number of business and liability risks. Representatives from business insurance firms indicate that compliance with the PFPR effluent limitations guideline by means of pollution prevention could result in lower insurance premiums through several mechanisms, for example: •Reduced volume of pesticide ingredients shipped and handled at a facility can result in lower risk of hazardous exposures for workers and the surrounding community; •Elimination of pollutant discharges would result in a lower risk of leaks or accidental excess discharges of polluting materials; and •Elimination of pollutant discharges reduces the risk that a facility would be found in violation of discharge limits.
