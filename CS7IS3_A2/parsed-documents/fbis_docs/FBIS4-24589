In the first four months of this year, the volume of border trade exceeded $17 million, an increase of 93 percent over the same period last year. Dandong City is located in the northern end of the mainland coastline of China, and faces the DPRK's Sinuiju City across the Yalu Jiang. It is one of the largest border cities in China. In 1988, Dandong City was named as one of China's open cities, and in 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of the Dandong Border Economic Cooperation Zone. After that, Dandong City made use of its favorable geographical position of being adjacent to Korea and the doubly favorable policies for coastal and border areas and has increased border trade with the DPRK year after year. In 1993, the volume of Dandong's border trade with the DPRK exceeded $52 million. In Dandong's border trade with the DPRK, Dandong mainly exports grain, pork, beef, textiles, chemical raw materials, household electric appliances, and light industrial goods to the Korean side, and mainly imports steel products, timber, aquatic products, minerals, and silkworm cocoons from the Korean side. As Dandong's opening up to the outside world continues its expansion, the structure of trade with the DPRK has also expanded from the previous sole pattern of barter trade to plural forms of cash-based trade, processing trade, entrepot trade, and the tourist trade. At present, there are more than 170 business companies engaged in trade with the DPRK. Trade partners on the Korean side extend from Sinuiju to such interior cities as Pyongyang and Wonsan. There is economic and trade cooperation with an increasing number of the DPRK's large, state-level commercial institutions.
