Their wrong actions surrounded them and, therefore, they must be defeated and must bow to the people's will and their strike force on all axes and sectors. On the Abyan-Aden axis, fighting is continuing in several directions, and the forces of renegade and secession are trying to send innocent people to certain death to merely gain time, show empty arrogance, and entertain themselves with destruction, after the units of the Armed Forces--the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy--tightened the siege [words indistinct] and are continuing to follow their targets with patience and accuracy, taking into account the circumstances in the fields of confrontation on this axis. All the feverish air and naval attacks have failed, and the forces of renegade and secession sustained double losses as a result of the lack of control of the collapsing and domineering [words indistinct], their dark and ominous fate. The brave men in the air defenses confronted the aircraft of the forces of renegade and secession and managed to down two aircraft, and the hostile attacks did not cause any losses. On the Shabwah axis, the heroes in the units of the Armed Forces are continuing to carry out the duties assigned to them, and they made great progress in carrying out their missions after they managed to control the (?Sab) District as a result of the great cooperation by the brother citizens, who moved to shoulder their responsibility along with their forces--the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces received [words indistinct] a complete battalion of the (?Hnayshan) Brigade, as well as the [word indistinct] forces in the (?Nisab) District [words indistinct], which declared their joining the forces of unity and constitutional forces, rejected the conspiracy of secession and the plan of renegade and rebellion, and condemned the sinful secessionist elements for what they did against the people, the homeland, and the Armed Forces and security. On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the heroes in our Armed Forces are continuing their progress to carry out the remaining combat duties on that axis. In this sector, 22 missile bases were seized. The brave heroes in the brave Air Force continued to carry out the duties assigned to them with success and effectiveness. All aircraft returned safely to their bases. With the continued progress of the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy to confront the remaining forces of renegade and secession, out of concern about people's lives, and to avoid the continuation of the fighting, whose result is considered decided in favor of the forces of the people, the unity, and democracy, we renew our call on all officers, noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers, who are still under the control of the sinful secessionist forces to leave the positions of hostility and come to unity and the people and to join the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which is the place of every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier in the Armed Forces. They will find every understanding of their situation and the circumstances that forced them to be [words indistinct] under the banner of the Yemeni unity. The fate of the forces of wrong, deviation, secession, partition, and destruction is known. [words indistinct] [Signed] The Defense Ministry
