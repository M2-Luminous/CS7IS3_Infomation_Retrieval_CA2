FR940603-1-00073 FR940603-1-00009 (c) The Project, from the commencement of work to completion, or to such earlier date or dates when the Owner may take possession and control, in whole or in part as hereinafter provided, shall be under the charge and control of the Bidder and during such period of control by the Bidder all risks in connection therewith and the materials, supplies and equipment to be used therein shall be borne by the Bidder, except risk of loss or of damage to materials or equipment furnished for or used in connection with the Project by the Owner, Bidder or any subcontractor, caused by fire, lightning, wind damage, explosion, riot or civil commotion, aircraft and other vehicles, and smoke damage (against which perils the Owner will maintain insurance, hereinafter called ``Builder's Risk Insurance''). The Bidder will make good and fully repair all injuries and damages to the Project, or any portion thereof under the control of the Bidder by reason of any act of God, or any other casualty or cause whether or not the same shall have occurred by reason of the Bidder's negligence, except damage covered by the Owner's Builder's Risk Insurance. (i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Bidder's employees) and loss, damage to or destruction of Owner's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but not limited to Bidder's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment supplied or services performed by Bidder, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall be construed as making Bidder liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence of Owner. (ii) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all liens and claims filed or asserted against Owner, its directors, officers, and employees, or Owner's property or facilities, for services performed or materials or equipment furnished by Bidder, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier, and from all losses, demands, and causes of action arising out of any such lien or claim. Bidder shall promptly discharge or remove any such lien or claim by bonding, payment, or otherwise and shall notify Owner promptly when it has done so. If Bidder does not cause such lien or claim to be discharged or released by payment, bonding, or otherwise, Owner shall have the right (but shall not be obligated) to pay all sums necessary to obtain any such discharge or release and to deduct all amounts so paid from the amount due Bidder. (iii) Bidder shall provide to Owner's satisfaction evidence of Bidder's ability to comply with the indemnification provisions of subparagraphs i and ii above, which evidence may include but may not be limited to a bond or liability insurance policy obtained for this purpose through a licensed surety or insurance company.
