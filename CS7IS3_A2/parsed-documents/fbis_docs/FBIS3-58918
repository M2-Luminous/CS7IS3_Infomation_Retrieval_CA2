In presenting the government's future projects during a BRT [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television] radio program on Monday 24 January, was Jean-Luc Dehaene seeking to drive out the demons -- no doubt of every shape and size -- which lurk on the fringes of the "affair": further risks of discrediting our politicians, the prospect of future conflict relating to the same old community refrains, the promise of heated debates on the subject of the division of the social security system and, in short, of the State itself? Anxious to reduce the temperature, the prime minister wants to turn the page as soon as possible on this painful episode which has struck at some of the very bases of democracy which has found itself caught between the judiciary and politics. Jean-Luc Dehaene has opened up the future of his team to the third of the government's three main priorities: after the institutional and budgetary priorities, completion of State reform and achievement of the government's global plan without a social pact, there is now the famous contract promised to the citizen in favor of a society of greater solidarity. But is this no more than a means of shifting the public's attention away from this annoying "Agusta" affair? Jean-Luc Dehaene seems serious when he speaks of the need to get to grips with the ultimate priority of a reconstituted government. He points out that the party presidents have confirmed their determination to implement the governmental agreement and to continue their cooperation until the end of the present parliament: "It is the only way to achieve results with respect to the three priorities of the governmental agreement" says Jean-Luc Dehaene. Conceding that following the institutional reforms and budgetary affairs, the government's next priority of a society of solidarity -- or what is referred to by some as the "contract with the citizen" -- had remained rather in the background, the prime minister adds that: "This is not to say that nothing has been done in this area." By way of example, he cites the modernization of the administration, the depoliticization of appointments, the appointment of an ombudsman, a better functioning of the legal system, security contracts, etc. [passage omitted]
