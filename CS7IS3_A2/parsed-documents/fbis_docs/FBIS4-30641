This official further said: As for the Khmer Rouge, if we do not outlaw them, they will not soften their attitude or make concessions to the royal government. If the Khmer Rouge are left the way they are now, the royal government cannot do anything. If they are outlawed and become rebels, they might perhaps show some flexibility or even be willing to negotiate with the royal government. Concerning the issue of outlawing the Khmer Rouge, it was recently rumored that some officials in the royal government do not agree with the view of the leaders of the royal government and of the National Assembly. The same official affirmed that "what is important and constitutes the key for the royal government at present is that the royal government wants complete unity within the cabinet ... [ellipsis as published] within the royal government in order to continue its work to outlaw the Khmer Rouge, because what the government is doing now is in accordance with the constitution, in response to the aspiration of citizens, and in harmony with its mandate. This official further said that, legally, in any government, even a coalition government, officials in the cabinet who do not follow the policy of the prime minister or the royal government can be considered as the government's opponents. Legally, these officials should resign, or the prime minister should remove them from their posts or dismiss them so that the implementation of government policy is not hindered. The same government official further affirmed that "in the future the royal government will reshuffle positions in a number of ministries; ministers will not be dismissed, but their positions will be switched. For example, some officials will be removed from the Interior Ministry and transferred to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, or removed from the latter to other ministries... [ellipsis as published] because for these officials the probation period has ended. However, this official did not elaborate on the reshuffle, on the personalities affected, or when this will be carried out.
