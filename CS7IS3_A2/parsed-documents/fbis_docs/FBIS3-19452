EU sources said the move, which reversed an EU statement the previous day, was part of a deal under which Paris will drop its opposition to the admission of Norway to the European Union. The European Commission confirmed that the prices, due to expire March 15, will be extended until May 17. It did not specify there had been pressure from the French Government. Earlier in Paris, the French Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry said the decision was taken overnight after strong lobbying by France. "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of minimum import prices," said the statement, citing Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech. The prices were decided on February 4 and are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices were set for fish last year as well, from February to December. [passage omitted] Sources said that in return for the extension France had agreed to conditions on Norway's admission to the European Union, although no details were immediately available. [passage omitted] Initial reactions to the extension among French fishermen were not positive. In Concarneau, Britanny, fishermen called the deal "a half measure, which will have no effect long term, and which does not solve the problem." Union leader Yves L'Helgouac'h said: "If this measure has been thrashed out at the expense of giving Norway membership of the European Union, it is a dupes' market." Norway's admission "is not a good deal for our fishing industry, which risks being swamped even further by Norwegian fish," he added.
