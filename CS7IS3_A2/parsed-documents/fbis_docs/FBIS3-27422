Urging the warring parties in bosnia to grasp the chance for peace now, diplomats from the European Union, Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States as well as a U.N. representative decided to use the current momentum deriving from the success in Sarajevo to work closely together to promote an early negotiated settlement between them, said the guidelines released here. "The participants proceed from the basis that the parties have already agreed to the quantitative territorial aspects of a settlement, as outlined in the European Union action plan, but that the quality and viability of territory for the Bosnian Government needs to be improved," the guidelines said. In Sarajevo, efforts will be made to stabilize the ceasefire by effective disengagement of forces, ensure free access to Sarajevo by land for humanitarian aid convoys and restore normal life to the city with the assistance of the United Nations, said the guidelines. To create necessary conditions to facilitate a peaceful solution and to alleviate the suffering of the civilians until a settlement is achieved, efforts also include rapid rotation of U.N. forces into Srebrenica and Zepa and rapid opening of the Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid deliveries, the guidelines added. The participants in the one-day meeting welcomed the recent developments in and around Sarajevo as an important step towards ending the war throughout the former Yugoslav republic.
