[Parliament Speaker] Petru Lucinschi proposed to examine this issue reminding that these agreements were examined by the former parliament and that only 4 votes lacked to their ratification. That is why the former parliamentary presidium took into account all economic problems and restrictions caused by Russia and asked the president to sign all the agreements of joining the CIS and CIS Economic Union to Moldova's benefit. A number of 17 deputies have opposed on 8 April the proposal to examine the agreements. The faction of Peasants and Intellectuals noticed that the parliamentary regulations are violated. According to it, the documents to be adopted have to be presented three days beforehand for their examination. PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling party] representatives and in particular Andrei Diaconu, retorted that the problem is well known and was examined on August 4th, and therefore it would not be reasonable to start a new discussion. Valeriu Matei, from the faction of Peasants and Intellectuals, stated that the documents have a series of stipulations contradicting Moldova's current policy and several legislative documents. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader and vice speaker of parliament, replied that the commissions that should ensure the fulfillment of the regulations is only being created. He said that this problem had been examined for two years and the delay in ratifying the CIS agreements would represent a blockage. Dumitru Diacov presented the notification of the Parliamentary Commission of Foreign Relations regarding these documents. He argued that Moldova should join the CIS and mentioned that seven of the nine members of the commission were in favor of ratification, while the other two representing the FPCDM [Christian- Democratic Popular Front -- opposition] Alliance and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals opposed it. Premier Andrei Sangheli made a report noting that the CIS agreements should be ratified as soon as possible. He added that after the former parliament rejected them, serious damage was caused to Moldovan economy. In 1993, this sum amounted to 40 billion rubles. Sangheli asserted that the government in its 7 April session agreed to the ratification of the CIS agreements. During the debates, Vlad Clubreacov, from the FPCDM faction, mentioned "the disastrous economic consequences of ratifying the CIS agreements and the danger to which Moldova's independence is unjustifiably exposed." He said that "it is strictly necessary that beside the two agreements presented to us, we should have at our disposal over 200 agreements signed by Moldovan officials. The agreements are only partial and insufficient information, which disguise the real purposes of the previous agreements." Vasile Nedelciuc, faction of Peasants and Intellectuals, analyzed several economic articles of the agreements. He pointed out that Moldova has other alternatives, including the ones in the West, which could help overcome the current difficulties. He said that joining the CIS would negatively influence many areas. One of the consequences is that the legislation must be adjusted to the conditions of the CIS economic community. Speaker Petru Lucinschi said that the decision to join the CIS is not made forever and with new realities coming in power it could be revised. At present, when there is no other alternative but the Eastern market, parliament welcomes the adherence to the CIS.
