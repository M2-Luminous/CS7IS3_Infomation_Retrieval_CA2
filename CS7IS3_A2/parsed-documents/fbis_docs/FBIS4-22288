Is Islamic Fundamentalism Such a Threat to Russia?"] [Text] Some of the buzz-words in current Russian political cant are "civilization," "civilized behavior," "joining the civilized world," etc. But the references are exclusively to Western civilization; i.e., a term is used which was rejected by Western sociopolitical thought itself back in the early 20th century and was finally buried together with the collapse of fascist ideology. Advocates of the idea of "ushering Russia into civilization" seem to forget the axiom of the diversity of civilizations: Western Christian, Confucian, Moslem, Eastern Slavic, and others. Each has its specific values and each will, in its way, contribute to the pluralist world civilization of the 21st century. Western domination of the Far East even in the technological field is now in doubt. And if something like this cannot yet be said of the Moslem world, who can predict the future? However, the emergence of this discarded idea in the confused, sick social and political mind of Russia in a transitional period is not accidental. It reflects the unresolved question of Russia's self-identity. After the collapse of communism, that extreme, radical form of ideology imported from the West, the erstwhile debate between "Westerners" and "Slavophiles" has turned into a debate between "democrats" and "statists." The former advocate the idea of transplanting Western values to our inhospitable soil, the latter stress the preservation or restoration of special, exclusive traits characteristic of Russia. Naturally, in the framework of sociopolitical struggle there is no clearcut watershed between representatives of different trends. Likewise, there is no organic link between "democratic" and "statist" convictions and the positions of their representatives with respect to the Islamic world or Moslem citizens of Russia. Representatives of the opposing camps may come to terms on the basis of different premises for their negative attitudes towards Islam. Freshmen of the market and democracy school highhandedly attempt to teach Moslem countries and peoples the "values of civilization," while rabid chauvinists impose upon them their idea of "Russia ber alles." But strange as it may seem, understanding and cooperation with the Islamic world is advocated by both "communist-internationalists" and anticommunist "new Eurasians." The picture is complicated by the fact that the quirks of history and geography require Russia to take a position in the discordant relations between the West and Islam. The old confrontation between East and West, between Western democracy and communism, is being replaced by confrontation between the West and the Islamic world. Western public opinion is developing a partly true but generally artificial "enemy image" of the Moslem world, while Russia is being drawn into an unnecessary and alien conflict, the cost of participation in which may prove to be deadly high. Threats to the fate of Russia are appearing at three levels at once. Firstly, in relations with countries of the Moslem world outside the former USSR, especially those opting for models of sociopolitical orders differing from the West. Following the twists and turns of Western political behavior, Russia may get into confrontation with countries with which it has no contradictions. The unfriendly relations of Moscow with Iran and Libya, which have taken no anti-Russian actions on the governmental level, is the best example of this. If continued, such behavior will inevitably further weaken the already greatly deteriorated positions of Russia in the Moslem world. An even greater threat may arise if Russia fails to launch a dialog and cooperation with Moslem nations of the near abroad. The matter here is not so much economic losses and difficulties along thousands of miles of common borders. At issue is the fate of Russian-speaking populations in the former soviet republics. The ghost of Bosnia and Herzogovina is stalking Central Asia and Transcaucasia. Finally, the third level is Russian society itself. A special feature of Russia's historic development and geostrategic position is that it has not just lived next to the Moslem world; Russia has been as it were within that world, it was a border situation not only in the geographical sense. The confrontation between the two civilizations has been going on for a thousand years, but there has also been an intermingling and interaction of the cultural, sociopolitical and anthropological aspects. In the final analysis, not only Slavs are Russians "by blood," but also Ugro-Finns and Turks. There are common elements in music, dances, ornaments, poetics, national character and psychology. The life of Russian and Tatar villages in the Volga country differs only in minor details. The Cossacks were constantly replenished by Kalmyks, Circassians, Tatars and Kazakhs. Hundreds of nobility family names are of Turkic origin. Vaguely similar patterns can be found in Spain, the Balkans and India. But drawing parallels is dangerous. On the Iberian Peninsula history decreed that Islam would be eradicated, leaving behind traces in culture, the anthropological type of people, the psychology. A bloody drama has flared up again in the Balkans. India is seeking with difficulty ways of cohabitation among Moslems and non-Moslems. Will it find one? Whereas in its search for self-identity Russia is in contradiction with itself, which is leading to a split between the intellectual and political elite and, as a consequence, of the masses, among peoples with Moslem roots one can observe a similar dualism with respect to themselves and the surrounding world. Their situation may be very broadly defined as a struggle between trends towards the Turkish or the Iranian model of development. Western influence, market relations and political practice draws them towards the early Turkish model (preferably the authoritarian model of Kemal Ataturk), while their own civilization, mythology, mass sentiment and demagogy tend towards the Iranian model. In any case, in the post-soviet independent Moslem states the self-identity of both the political elites and the masses is based on Islamic nationalism. This assumes a certain "distancing" from Russia, as well as raising the level of anti-Russian sentiments. But whereas nationalism in the newly independent states assumes orientation towards the West, Islam looks to the East, or to be more precise in the strictly geographic sense, to the South. During the first two years or so of independence, the former soviet republics have already experienced a period of euphoria over the acquisition of brothers and cousins in both the ethnic and religious sense: Turks, Iranians, Arabs, Pakistanis. They have already experienced a period of hopes that "the West will help us" or "fraternal Moslem peoples will help us." These hopes failed to materialize in any real sense on either side. It turned out that Turkey, Iran, the Arabs, and the West were all pursuing their own attractively packaged but frequently self-serving objectives. While with Russia it was necessary to find a common language and mutual understanding. "Attraction" will develop if, in the first place, Russia sets its own house in order, embarks on socioeconomic revival, and will be able to launch a constructive dialog and cooperation with both its own Moslem citizens and neighboring Moslem states. The prerequisites for this are there. After all, Russia (like the Soviet Union) was not an empire in the usual sense of the word. It lacked at least two basic elements that characterize an empire: economic exploitation of the outlying provinces by the Center and preferential social and material status of the Russian population with respect to other peoples. However, rational prerequisites do not necessarily always determine the social and political actions of people, political elites or nations. Relations between people and entire nations are frequently determined by nationalistic ideas and naked momentary egoism. The road of dialog and cooperation between Russia and Moslems, as represented by communities, peoples and states, is filled with a number of dangers. One of them is fundamentalism. We shall not go into terminological or semantic investigations or recall that the term itself appeared several decades ago in Protestant religious thought. The term fundamentalism assumes several interrelated elements; --references solely to one's own real or imagined values: religious, cultural, legal, moral, ethical, sociopolitical, and others; --juxtaposition of oneself against others, dividing the world into "us" and "them"; --stressing incompatibility with others; --readiness to resort to violence to impose one's own vision of the world and way of life. It will be readily noticed that this definition covers all kinds of fundamentalism: Moslem and Protestant, Hindu and Russian Orthodox, liberal and Bolshevik... Differences between peoples may be promoted by ideas and forces both within and outside a certain social entity. What matters is the actual effect of different ideas and forces. In this sense it would be worth taking a dispassionate look at the manifestations of, specifically, Islamic fundamentalism. In its extreme form it is an expression of the reaction of a society, a civilization, to its inequality in the world. Colonialism has gone but dependence on the West in the economic, technological, cultural, information and other spheres remains. The Soviet Union has collapsed, but de facto dependence on Russia remains. This gives rise to similar developments in different countries, be it "Moslem Brotherhoods" in Egypt, Syria or Jordan, the National Salvation Front in Algeria, Jamat-i-Islam in Pakistan, or the Islamic Renaissance Party in Russia and Central Asia. The founders of Moslem fundamentalism in Russia are not necessarily familiar with the writings of Moslem Brotherhood ideologues Hasan al-Banna or Sayyid Quth, but they are as adamant as those religious thinkers in their opposition to Western values, calling for a return to "the true Islam," application of Sharia as the legal basis of Moslem life, creation of an Islamic state and a Moslem economy. They also take similar positions on East Jerusalem and Palestine. Interestingly, though, Moslem fundamentalists derive some organizational forms of their activities from recent communist practice. However, as in other cases, applying historical parallels to fundamentalists may be risky. Religious political extremism has gained virtually no foothold among Moslems in Russia. The Islamic Renaissance Party is hardly more than a network of small clubs. Nationalist slogans appeal more to the elites than to the masses. And even in Central Asia (in particular, Tajikistan), where the Islamic Renaissance Party was most successful, this was a manifestation not so much of the injection of politics into religion as simply clan hostility and rivalry. Islamic fundamentalism poses no real threat to Russia. There is the threat of extremism if the socioeconomic and interethnic crisis continues to deepen, the threat of a rise of the threshold of information rejection and of a loss of the ability to engage in dialog. This makes impossible not only a transition to the information society, with its movement of information, but even the simple coexistence of peoples (Yugoslavia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). At some stage in conflicts between confessional and ethnic groups their members simply cease to understand each other, whatever the educational or cultural level of individuals. A demonization as it were of the opponent occurs, cutting off all possibilities for dialog and compromise. Difficulties of mutual understanding and cooperation may also be due to objective circumstances. In this sense the example of Chechnya is indicative. Russians and Chechens are alienated by historic memories of genocide, of which the Chechen people were victims three times: in the 19th century, the 1920s, and the 1940s-1960s, during the period of mass deportations from the Northern Caucasus. The people survived, in particular, thanks to the clan structure of their society and the extensive proliferation of the Naqshbandiyah and Qadiriyah Sufi orders. That same structure makes it possible to quickly gain new socioeconomic positions in the developing market economy of Russia, frequently by criminal means. Understanding between non-Moslems and Moslems is hindered by reciprocal incompetence and ignorance with regard to each other, the spread of myths which, through repetition, acquire the force of facts. It should be noted that in Russian sociopolitical thought, to say nothing of the mass media, there is a mishmash of entirely different concepts: "Moslem renaissance," "pan-Islamism," "Islamic fundamentalism," "Sufism." Similar ignorance, combined with extreme anti-Russian or anti-Christian attitudes, creates an explosive mixture on the other side. Speculating on ignorance and emotions may yield short-term political and daily life dividends, but it increases the level of tensions in religious and ethnic relations. As a result, instead of constructive dialog, the conflict expands. References to sources, to the legal and behavioral norms of Islamic civilization create difficulties both within a multireligious society and in international relations, but these difficulties are not basically insurmountable for coexistence and cooperation. Sharia and the system of Western law (codified and based on precedent) would seem to be worlds apart and incompatible. The former regards law as a revelation of God, the latter as the people's will or customs that have become the norm. Identical situations (marriage, inheritance) are regulated differently in the West and in Moslem society. History knows examples of the total imposition of Western law (including transformed into communist form) on Moslem societies: Turkey, Yugoslavia, China, USSR. But hand in hand with the renaissance of Islam goes a revival of Sharia norms in the area of civil, family and other law. Is there a possibility for compromise? Yes, there is. Many Moslem legal scholars are "reopening the doors of ijtihad," which were closed at the end of the 4th century of the Hijri (the 10th century of our era), i.e. they again recognize the ulemas' right to independently interpret and judge. For that they have the formal tools. According to most of the schools of Moslem legal scholars, there are areas in which Allah prohibits, does not recommend or, on the contrary, permits or does not object to, certain behavior or decisions. Between these four variants lies a fifth, "grey" zone, in which Allah is neutral and where the introduction of certain legal norms is possible, as long as they do not contradict the four others, in which the will of Allah is clearly expressed. Over the last century and a half, Sharia has demonstrated considerable abilities to adapt to new realities, from Osman trade and customs codes to traffic rules, from the establishment of a banking system which managed to skirt formal interest profit, to women's rights to education and work outside the family, or the waiving of fasting for air force pilots during Ramadan. Russian society still must find a solution to problems connected with the revival of the fundamental postulates of Islam and the refusal of some citizens to obey a common unified system of law. Perhaps public practice will move ahead of legal norms and employers will take into account specific features of employing Moslem manpower during the Ramadan fast, the state will recognize Moslem holidays, to say nothing of cultural, enlightenment or religious activities of Moslem communities or the political rights of Moslem autonomous entities. In the final analysis, both the Russian and Moslem peoples have the historical experience not only of conflicts but also of cohabitation and mutual enrichment. Russia's place and role in the new world order depends not only on its relations with the West, but also with the Islamic world. It will either find understanding and a basis for cooperation and constructive dialog with Moslems both outside and within or will sink into a protracted conflict with no solution in sight. It could bleed and weaken Russia so much that it would become a significant element contributing to the disintegration of the country and undermining its ability to develop. Blind imitation of Western sociopolitical and economic models can cause and is already causing their rejection by Russian society. Mindless following of the most nearsighted Western prescriptions of confrontation with the Moslem world can be self-defeating. Russia should have its own road of internal development, taking into account world experience, and its own approach to the Moslem world.
