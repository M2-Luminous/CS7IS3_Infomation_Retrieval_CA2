They had talks with Stanislav Daskalov, minister of foreign affairs, while their meeting with President Zhelev is still in progress. After the meeting with Daskalov, Lord Owen pointed out, in reply to a journalist's question, that he has never abandoned the original plan to solve the Balkan conflict, and that the plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into three parts on the basis of ethnic principles has recently emerged as the only possible alternative for a peaceful solution of the problems.
