In case no diplomatic solution was found for the nuclear problem, Panov said, the UN Security Council should attach equal importance to the call for an international conference and possible sanctions against Pyongyang. Panov saw the problem as extremely delicate. He reminded Interfax that last year Pyongyang declared its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. One day before it was legally entitled to act on it, Pyongyang suspended its decision. In other words, Panov said, it remained party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. According to Panov, it was not Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that called for sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a country for this kind of decisions, Panov said, because any country was privileged to join a treaty or withdraw from it. According to Panov, the international community was discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and cooperate with the IAEA. Day in and day out it remembered to attach conditions to whether it would or would not allow inspections of this or that facility, which translated, according to Panov, into a refusal to meet its pledges under the treaty and IAEA regulations even though it remained party to the treaty and a member of the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA failed to get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and moved to raise the issue of sanctions. No IAEA report claimed Pyongyang had enough plutonium to produce nuclear weapons. The IAEA only stated its inability to get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program, Panov said. In Panov's view, the possible introduction of anti-Pyongyang sanctions should be, if anything, gradual. Instead of being tough, the sanctions ought to spell a word of warning. They must remind Pyongyang that the international community meant business and wanted it to comply in good faith with its commitments. The further course of action would depend on Pyongyang. Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for an international conference gained growing support, he said. Panov saw media reports on plans for President Yeltsin's visit to South Korea as premature. The recently-held Russian-Korean summit failed to discuss that issue in detail, he said, although President Kim Yong-sam had, indeed, invited his Russian counterpart to visit Seoul and the invitation had been accepted. The two national leaders agreed, though, Panov said, that diplomatic officers would discuss when exactly the visit was to take place.
