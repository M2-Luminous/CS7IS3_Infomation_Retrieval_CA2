It is learned that one of the four major forms of reforming the property rights system for state-owned enterprises in Fuzhou city is to graft foreign capital onto them. In 1993, a breakthrough was made in transferring enterprises. The Fuzhou Perfumery and the Fuzhou Printing and Dyeing Mill were completely transferred to foreign businessmen, and a large number of large and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Fuzhou Special Steels Plant, the No. 1 Plastics Plant, and the Fuzhou Silk Factory, formed joined ventures with foreign capital. In 1993, 28 enterprises signed 31 joint venture or cooperation projects with foreign businessmen, with a contractual investment volume of over $82 million and the use of over $25 million in foreign capital. The number of state-owned enterprises in Fuzhou City that have had foreign capital grafted onto them now accounts for 52 percent of the total. After the grafting, most state-owned enterprises have changed their operational mechanisms and have notably improved their economic returns. According to a briefing from official quarters, a large state-owned light industrial enterprise in Fuzhou suffered losses as soon as it went into production. It lost a total of 170 million yuan in 10 years. After having foreign capital grafted onto it, it made a profit of over 1 million yuan in 1993. Official quarters added: The transfer and grafting of state-owned enterprises have also brought many social problems, such as the placement and medical insurance of staff from former state-run factories. Sun Haishan said: In the future, Fuzhou will go on promoting the grafting of state-owned enterprises to foreign capital to boost the reform of state-owned enterprises. What is slightly different from past practice is that the city will also select some state- owned enterprises which have good returns and a good market share to be grafted onto foreign capital. Moreover, standards for assessing foreign capital will also be raised. The focus of foreign capital to be introduced will be shifted to large companies in Europe, America, and Asia, and the grade of foreign capital utilized will also be raised.
