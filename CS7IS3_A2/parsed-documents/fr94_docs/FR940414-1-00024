FR940414-1-00024 FR940414-1-00006 (4) USPS 120.120, Personnel Records_Personnel Research and Test Validation Records; and USPS 120.152, Personnel Records_Career Development and Training Records. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow. (i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing materials, the disclosure of which would compromise the fairness of the future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely new examinations after each administration as would be necessary if questions or answers were available for inspection and copying. Consequently, exemption from subsection (d) is claimed. (ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply to these systems for which exemption from subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures since access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing examination process may be appropriate in some cases. (5) USPS 120.151, Personnel Records_Recruiting, Examining, and Appointment Records. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who has furnished information to the Government in confidence as part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment and (k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow. (i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application of the provisions at (d)(1)&hyph;(4) would reveal to the applicant whose suitability is being investigated the identity of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. As a result, the Postal Service's promise of confidentiality would be breached, its ability to obtain information in the future would be diminished, and the information source could be subjected to harassment by the applicant. To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), the requirements of the exemption at (d)(1)&hyph;(4) and the reasons for exemption information relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process are the same as those given in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
