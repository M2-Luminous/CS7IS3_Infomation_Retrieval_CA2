[Woerner] In NATO's history -- yes, of course. It was the very first combat action. In addition, it was a combat action not to defend one's own territory against a threat but, if you like, out-of-area -- that is, beyond our normal alliance territory. However, this operation has nothing to do -- at least not directly -- with the other tasks that we have set ourselves in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is an operation to enforce the no-fly zone. Apart from that, there are other operations --for example, to enforce this exclusion zone [Ausschlusszone] -- and I think that one should beware of general judgments. In any case, it makes it clear that NATO is now confronted with a completely new task, which it is fulfilling successfully: crisis management and the enforcement of UN peacemaking measures.
