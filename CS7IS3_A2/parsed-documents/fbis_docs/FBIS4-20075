FBIS4-20075 "drweu080_o_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 CYPRUS UN's Clark Explains Meaning of CBM's UN's Clark Explains Meaning of CBM's NC2504121994 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in Greek 1030 GMT 25 Apr 94 NC2504121994 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, has said that the area to be used as access to Famagusta's fenced-off area will remain under Turkish control, that no territory will be returned, and that the United Nations will be in charge of protecting access and guaranteeing the safety of those who will use the road. The UN envoy made these revelations in a speech on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] at the Carnegie Institute in Washington. Commenting on Turkish criticism that the UN document of 21 March has been modified, Clark said that rigid interpretation of the package would give the two sides no serious benefits. The UN envoy said the Turkish Cypriots will have the right to communicate with the outside world through direct flights and will be given travel documents by countries that don't do so now. They will also be able to charter flights for passengers and cargo. Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot side stressed that the CBM's package goes a long way toward lifting the embargo. In his address, the UN envoy mentioned that the United Nations is trying to persuade various countries, particularly European, to begin facilitating Turkish Cypriot travel the day the Greek Cypriots return to Famagusta's fenced-off area. It is also asking the countries concerned to commit themselves to negotiations for offering landing and take-off rights to a Turkish Cypriot airline. The United Nations is also trying to ensure that the Turkish Cypriots will benefit earlier from international, economic, and technological assistance. Although three different views were expressed at the UN Security Council [UNSC] on what must be done if no agreement is reached on the CBM's, the five UNSC permanent members are focusing on the success of Clark's new tour of Ankara and Nicosia. According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in New York, diplomatic circles believe that it is doubtful whether Clark's tour will be effective because it has been proven that the U.S. Government is sending the wrong messages to Ankara by stressing that the Greek Cypriot side must accept some concessions on access to Famagusta, that it will not press Ankara, and that it is not ready to discuss alternative ways at the Security Council. The same circles say that Russia's position on the dispatch of a UNSC delegation to Cyprus to study ways to lift the embargo is more positive. But they note that while it is a significant counterproposal to the U.S. position, the Russian initiative does not have much chance of being accepted now. The diplomatic circles also noted that Britain appears ready to discuss alternative ways but links them with the UN secretary general's proposal that he will want to evaluate the situation personally and that he will suggest nothing that will not be fully supported by the five permanent members.
