"The United States and North Korea virtually agreed at a series of contacts in New York last month to simultaneously resolve the issues of the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea's acceptance of full-fledged nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea," the senior official said Monday. "So we expect a great change in inter-Korean relations this year." He said that Washington and Pyongyang will have another working-level contact to reach final agreement and he expects direct consultation between the IAEA and North Korea to resume soon. An IAEA inspection team could enter North Korea as soon as Jan. 10, he said. On the day the team enters North Korea, Seoul will announce suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military exercise with the United States, and Washington will announce the holding of a third-round of high-level talks with Pyongyang, he added. The two Koreas are expected to have a working-level contact for exchange of special envoys. "Pyongyang and Washington are expected to have the third round of their high-level talks as early as around the end of this month to find a thorough and broad solution of the North Korean nuclear problem and discuss improvement of Pyongyang-Washington relations," he said. Former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung, who is engaged in the study of unification, said on New Year's day that he expects great progress and even an inter-Korean summit this year if the nuclear problem is solved. The government should lay emphasis on solving the nuclear problem and then on resumption and revitalization of inter-Korean economic cooperation, Kim said. At the end of last year, President Kim Yong-sam told journalists that he saw signs of change beginning to show and there would be an important turning point in inter-Korean relations in early 1994.
