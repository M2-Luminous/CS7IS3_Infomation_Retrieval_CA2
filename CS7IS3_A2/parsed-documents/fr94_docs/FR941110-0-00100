FR941110-0-00100 FR941110-0-00016 Response: As discussed later in this preamble, we are revising the scheme that appeared in the proposed rule by eliminating scope and severity scales, as such, and by substituting instead a scheme in which HCFA and the State will assess deficiencies by application of several factors that will gear enforcement remedies to the seriousness of noncompliance at facilities. However, we are accepting the second comment with some modification. With the exception of isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for only minimal harm, all deficiencies will be recorded on the HCFA&hyph;2567. Those isolated deficiencies will not be recorded on the official deficiency statement, but will be recorded on a separate document as discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule. However, all of a facility's deficiencies, including those deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm, will be disclosable. We are revising §488.325(a)(2) to require the release of the summary of isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm deficiencies. Comment: One commenter asked how this information will be disclosed to the public and also wanted to know if facilities have any responsibility relative to disclosure. The same commenter wasn't sure what we meant by ``direct or indirect interest in a SNF or NF'' as used at §488.325(a) (7) and (8). Response: Existing procedural requirements at §§401.133&hyph;136 and 431.115 as well as sections 3300&hyph;3320 in the State Operations Manual remain in effect relative to public disclosure of Medicare and Medicaid survey documents, respectively. While §431.115 provides only minimum disclosure requirements for States, it directs that States have a procedure for disclosing the specified survey information. Sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide the statutory bases for §488.325 regarding disclosure of inspection and other information on SNFs and NFs by the States and HCFA. The only requirement we are imposing on nursing home providers in this regard is that, not later than 10 working days after receiving a notice of substandard quality of care, a SNF or a NF must provide the State with a list of each resident in the facility and the name and address of his or her attending physician. Failure of the facility to disclose the information timely will result in termination or alternative remedies being imposed. Due to an administrative oversight, the word ``ownership'' was omitted from the proposed regulation text at proposed §488.175(a) (7) and (8), clarifying ``direct or indirect interest.'' We are revising both cites, which have been redesignated as §488.325(a) (8) and (9), respectively, to specify ``ownership'' interest. We are also cross-referring these cites to §420.201, which defines ``direct'' and ``indirect'' ownership interest.
