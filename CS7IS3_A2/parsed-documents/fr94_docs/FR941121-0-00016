FR941121-0-00016 FR941121-0-00001 (b)(2) Amount of Dividends To provide uniformity and parity with provisions of Regulation DD, the Board has adopted comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;2, but has limited its application to interest-bearing deposit accounts. It would be difficult and burdensome, if not impossible, for a credit union to state the amount of accrued dividends on a statement, since as discussed in comment 2(i)&hyph;3, such dividends are not generally properly declarable until the close of the dividend period. Comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may use a variety of terms to disclose dividends earned, and that the regulation does not mandate use of the examples. In response to a national trade association commenter, NCUA has conformed comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;4 to the final Regulation DD commentary, and credit unions are permitted, but not required, to show the APYE and dividends as zero, on a closed account on the periodic statement. In response to two commenters, NCUA has revised comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;5 to reflect that information, other than the dollar amount, regarding extraordinary dividends may be disclosed on the periodic statement as long as it is not inaccurate or misleading. The Board believes that information regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividend, and additional APYE and dividend rate figures taking into account the extraordinary dividend, would not be inaccurate or misleading and might offer the member additional useful information on the accounts held by the member. (b)(3) Fees Imposed This comment has been changed to reflect the final amendment to ยง707.6(b)(3) of part 707 made in this rulemaking to correct a redundant typographical error. In response to three commenters, including a national trade association commenter, various clarifications are made to enhance understanding without substantively changing the meaning of proposed comment 6(b)(3)&hyph;2. (b)(4) Length of Period One national trade association requested that NCUA clarify proposed comment 6(b)(4)&hyph;2, opening or closing an account midcycle. The commenter stated that when a member opens an account in the middle of a statement period the credit union should be required to use the actual number of days the account has been opened, as opposed to the number of days in the statement period. Comment 6(b)(4)&hyph;2 has not been changed, as it is in conformance with Regulation DD. However, the NCUA Board believes that the commenter's concern should be addressed, and has plans to address it in the NCUA Accounting Manual for FCUs. Section 707.7_Payment of Dividends (a) Permissible Methods (a)(1) Balance on Which Dividends Are Calculated Comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;1 has been expanded to reflect TISA's legislative history, which cites the ``low balance'' method as an example of a prohibited dividend calculation method. Proposed comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;6 addressed ``dormant'' accounts. The FRB solicited and received numerous comment on whether an institution should be permitted to withhold the payment of dividends for dormant accounts. Some FRB commenters believed institutions should be permitted to withhold the payment of interest for dormant accounts, if authorized by state or other law and the deposit contract. Other FRB commenters noted that what constitutes a ``dormant'' account varies widely among the states and institutions. These FRB commenters expressed concern about the impact of the rule if any period of inactivity_however brief_could transform an account to dormant status. Still others raised concerns whether TISA, which requires that interest be paid on the full amount of principal in the account each day, permitted such an interpretation. (12 U.S.C. 4306(a).) Based on the comments received and further analysis, the FRB believes that account inactivity does not affect an institution's duty to pay interest. (See comment 7(c)&hyph;3, which provides that institutions must accrue interest on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account.) The FRB believes this position_reflected in comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;6_is consistent with the purposes of TISA and the rule that interest must be calculated for funds in accounts meeting minimum balance requirements for as along as funds remain in the account. For the reasons stated by the FRB, the NCUA Board has revised its comment accordingly. Although two commenters, including a national trade association commenter, requested that the Board revise this comment to also include sample contract language, the Board notes that the FRB did not provide such language, and since the language must be in accord with state law, any attempt to provide uniform national language might result in a disclosure that would not accomplish its objectives in some states. Therefore, the Board declines to provide such sample contract language. Another commenter insisted that NCUA meant ``inactive account,'' which could be defined by the credit union by contract, rather than ``dormant account,'' which is defined by the state. However, NCUA has copied this section from the FRB's Regulation DD, which concerns ``dormant accounts.'' Therefore, NCUA declines to make the nomenclature change to ``inactive accounts,'' which might create a substantive variance from the FRB.
