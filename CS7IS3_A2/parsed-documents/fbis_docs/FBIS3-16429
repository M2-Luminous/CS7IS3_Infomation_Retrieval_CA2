[Begin Churkin recording] We do have some ideas how we can make further progress toward a political settlement, taking into account the latest developments, the advancement toward setting up a Muslim-Croatian federation. What concerns me, for example, is how the rights of the Serbs, who are one of the peoples making up the state, will be regarded and ensured in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which should in our view be preserved as a territorial, integral state. Will they join the Muslim-Croatian federation which is currently being set up? It seems to me that it is of fundamental importance that Croatians and Muslims possess sovereign rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It should be obvious that the Serbs should have the same sovereign rights, too. [end recording] [Video shows Churkin being interviewed at airport]
