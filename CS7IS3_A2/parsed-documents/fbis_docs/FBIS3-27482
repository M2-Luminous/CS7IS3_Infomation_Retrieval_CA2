The bureau sees the pattern for restructuring of the statistical system in such a way that a new statistical system had to be set up by which periodical general surveys would be staged centering on a regular sampling survey and helped by a comprehensive statistical graph, key investigation and scientific projection. The new system is aimed at ensuring the gathering of evidence for accurate, timely and comprehensive statistical figures for reference by the government in its decision-making. Starting this year, the bureau will adopt a new statistical system in which collection of information will be made on a regular basis from the grass roots which can effectively reflect the market economy, marking a change from the planned economy to the market economy. Mr Zhang pointed out that some significant statistics collected in recent years showed trends and changes in the economy. As contradictions are growing prominent between partial and overall interests, regional and central interests and between individuals as well as collective interests and the state interests, the possibility of distortion of statistics is becoming greater. The original statistical system in line with the planned economy no longer meets the needs of the new situation and it is yet to be restructured. The bureau has warned against falsification of statistics aimed at showing inaccurate results. Such statistics would have an adverse impact on decision-making regarding the economy made by the government and in turn result in damage to the national economy. It has to be seriously dealt with. A large overhaul of national statistical practical will be jointly held by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Ministry of Supervision, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the State Council and the State Statistical Bureau in the second half of this year. Entities and officials found guilty of malpractice in statistical practice will be seriously dealt with and punished.
