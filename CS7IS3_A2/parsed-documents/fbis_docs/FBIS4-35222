Palestinian sources said the marchers, who converged on the town from around the Israeli-occupied West Bank, went on to hold a public meeting in a mosque. Brandishing the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and waving flags, they called for the "liberation of the whole of Palestine." However, they steered clear in their slogans of attacking the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal, which Hamas rejects. Dozens of Palestinian policemen stood by, but there were no incidents, the sources said. It was the first Hamas demonstration here since the police took over Jericho in mid-May. The Israeli army closed off access to the enclave for Israeli civilians to avoid incidents, military sources said.
