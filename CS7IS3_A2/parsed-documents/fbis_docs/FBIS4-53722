The meeting was put off after Russia abruptly cancelled the visit to Seoul by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin who was to represent Russia at the meeting slated for May 20-21. In the message, Yeltsin said he was very sorry for the cancellation of Shokhin's visit to Seoul due to Russia's domestic situation. Russian Ambssador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze called on Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong to hand him the message for delivery to President Kim. Asking for President Kim's understanding of the "unexpected sitaution" that kept the Russian delegation from visiting Seoul, Yeltsin said he was suggesting that the meeting be held in Moscow at an appropriate time before President Kim's planned visit to Moscow. The Russian president also said in the message his country was looking forward to President Kim's visit to Moscow, which he said would be very useful to bilateral relations in many aspects.
