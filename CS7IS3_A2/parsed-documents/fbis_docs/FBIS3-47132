In an article calling for a nuclear-free world he pointed out that the current threat to world peace comes from the US policy of nuclear aggression against North Korea. He noted that the United States is stepping up preparations for a nuclear preemptive strike at North Korea. Direct nuclear threat to North Korea is part of the anti- communist and anti-socialist policy pursued continuously by the United States, he said, and added: It is the same policy as the nuclear business in the old cold-war era. Facts show that Clinton is more bellicose than his predecessors, he stated. He branded the U.S. imperialists as the very one actually threatening world peace. He called upon the anti-war, anti-imperialist forces to rebuild America's peace movement to conduct activities with a demand for a stop to the threat to North Korea and demand for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea.
