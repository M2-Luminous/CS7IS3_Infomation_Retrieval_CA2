V. Request for Comments Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on any aspect of the amendments to forms and rules that are subject to this release are requested to do so. The Commission also requests comments on whether the proposals, if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act.

Summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA''), pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 53 regarding the proposed rules. The IRFA notes that the proposed amendments are intended to provide issuers greater flexibility and efficiency in accessing the public securities markets. The proposed amendments would not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements on any entities. No alternatives to the proposed amendments consistent with their objectives and the Commission's statutory mandate were found. 53 5 U.S.C. 603 (1988). It is expected that the overall effect of the proposed rules will provide issuers greater flexibility and increased efficiency in raising capital from the public securities markets. The proposals to eliminate certain financial schedules and to streamline financial statement requirements relating to significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign equity investees could apply to any domestic issuer, including small entities registering or offering securities for public sale. To the extent that these proposals have an effect on small entities, it is believed that the proposals would reduce the compliance burdens associated with Securities Act or Exchange Act registration for such entities, as they would for any other issuer. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from Wayne Carnall, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street NW., Mail Stop 3&hyph;13, Washington, DC 20549, (202) 272&hyph;2553.
