President Aliyev outlined this when he received Colonel General Fedor Reut, commander of the Transcaucasian group of Russia's troops, at his request on 6 January. President Aliyev said the illusions of Armenia's extremist circles, which believe the occupationist forces will remain in the territory they have occupied in Azerbaijan indefinitely, are meaningless. He asserted: Azerbaijan can and will safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the nonviolation of its border. But we believe the dispute, which has continued for nearly six years, is meaningless. So, we call for obstructing unnecessary bloodshed and killing. President Aliyev also asserted: CIS resources must be used to achieve that; the organization was not established just to solve economic problems. It also has political and military responsibilities. We have signed the agreement on collective security. The CIS must not remain inactive in the face of aggression by one member against another. On behalf of Azerbaijan, which is a sovereign republic, I brought the issue to the attention of the participants at the Ashgabat summit. As the commander of Russia's troops in the Transcaucasus, you must contribute to the effort to halt Armenia's continuing aggression against Azerbaijan. Geydar Aliyev said: Russia has military bases and units under your command in Georgia and Armenia. Many of our kin live miserably in several rayons in Georgia. We have received serious information that they are being unjustly treated. We have held talks with Georgia's leaders. A great tragedy may emerge if the negative developments are not stopped. The incidents in Karabakh confirm that. Stability must be established in the region at all costs. According to President Aliyev, Russia's military units in the Transcaucasus and Russia must play a significant role in arranging relations among the republics in the Transcaucasus. He said: The [word indistinct] of Russia's troops in Armenia has a military status. Azerbaijan and Russia are members of the same alliance. We are independent countries. I have the legal and moral right to make my request. I wish to unofficially stress that Azerbaijan's leaders have received information that Russia's military units in Armenia have helped that republic's military forces in various ways. But considering our friendly relations with Russia, Azerbaijan will spare no effort to facilitate the transit of freight through our republic for Russia's military forces in Armenia. Information we have received that the freight, fuel in particular, is falling into the hands of the Armenian military forces makes us very uneasy. Gen. Reut described his talks with Aliyev as a very important development. He said Russia's political and military leaders support the effort to find a peaceful solution to the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Without directly referring to the points raised by Aliyev, Gen. Reut said the dispute in the region has made everyone, including Russia's military forces, very uneasy. He said that they too are forced to live under conditions of war. Gen. Reut stressed that he has arrived in Azerbaijan to ask the Republic's leaders to facilitate the uninterrupted transit of military echelons [last word in English] travelling to Armenia through Baku. Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov and Defense Minister Mamed Rafi Mamedov attended the meeting.
