The government will not address it as a party to negotiations." Regarding Ocalan's statement that he is prepared to discuss all the alternatives, including the possibility of the establishment of a federation, Demirel said: "That is a nonsensical statement." On the occasion of the religious festival Demirel received citizens in his house in the Etiler quarter of Istanbul at 1500. He later met with a group of journalists. Stressing that the PKK is a criminal organization that has killed 1,800 citizens, including several members of the security forces, he said: They Must Surrender PKK members have taken up positions on the heights in Igdir, Ardahan, and Kars provinces. They have turned the caves into arms depots. The state will continue to struggle. It must render that organization ineffective; no other alternative exists. Ocalan may have said this or that, but the state will not listen to him. We have called on the PKK members to agree to surrender, and I wish to reiterate that call. They must surrender to the state's judicial organs. They must come down from the mountains. No one must try to test the capabilities of the republic. I wish to inform everyone both inside and outside Turkey that the government will safeguard Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. I Congratulate the Security Forces The culprits responsible for the massacre at the railway station in Tuzla have been arrested. I congratulate the security forces. Their search uncovered the culprits whose action cut five young people to pieces. Their arrest makes us happy during this religious festival. Europe's Squint-Eyed Approach The European Parliament's decision [on the lifting of the immunity of Democracy Party deputies] is biased. It indicates that the European Parliament looks at the matter with half-closed eyes; they look at it from the wrong angle. I believe that it is shameful for them to applaud the developments in Turkey while they deem it inappropriate to even mention the word Corsica to France [sentence as published]. Foreign Currency Will Not Be in Short Supply The question of terrorism is the only problem in Turkey. We can find everything we need in the markets. Do we have lines of people waiting for gasoline, pharmaceuticals, and powdered sugar? No, we do not. Will foreign currency be in short supply in Turkey? No, it will not. People can go out into the streets in large cities like Ankara, Istanbul, Erzurum, and Trabzon at any time of the night, which is not the case in Europe. I am a standard bearer of democracy. I will be the first to oppose any action that conflicts with democracy. Demirel was in a happy mood. You could tell at first glance that he had had his hair cut on the occasion of the religious festival. His house was full of people making holiday visits. The first to arrive was Gokberk Ergenekon, the True Path Party deputy from Antalya, and Erman Yerdelen, chairman of the Turkish airline's executive committee. Meanwhile, Aga Ceylan, who is known for his close relations with former President Turgut Ozal, sent a bouquet of flowers to Demirel.
