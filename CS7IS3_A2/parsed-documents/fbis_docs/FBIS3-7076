"There were no specific talks on macroeconomic measures...and we can't offer something new" regarding permanent tax cuts or boosting public works spending, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a scheduled news conference. Saito was referring to an earlier meeting he attended at the Diet between Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. The government has promised to enact tax measures by the end of the year. Steps envisaged include a permanent cut in income taxes and raising indirect levies such as the consumption tax. The government has also said it will consider boosting its 10-year 430 trillion yen public works spending program if funding can be secured. Takemura told a separate news conference that he wants to include "direction" of macroeconomic measures in the March package, but details will take until June to work out. But the chief government spokesman said he "fully recognizes" the ministry's "unchanged" cautious macroeconomic stance. Saito said the meeting covered only "general discussions," adding, "you (reporters) shouldn't speculate."
