SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission publishes the Report of the Tar, Nicotine, and Carbon Monoxide Content of 933 Varieties of Domestic Cigarettes. DATES: October 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the full report are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, 6th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20580. (202) 326&hyph;3222. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phillip S. Priesman Attorney, Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, 6th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20580. Telephone (202) 326&hyph;2484. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These are the most recent test results of the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels of the smoke of domestic cigarettes reported by the FTC. The Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory (TITL), a private laboratory operated by the cigarette industry, conducted the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide testing for the widely-available domestic cigarette varieties. This testing was conducted under the review of a representative of the FTC through periodic unannounced inspections. TITL provided the results to the respective cigarette companies. The companies provided the data generated by TITL regarding their own brands to the FTC in response to compulsory process issued by the Commission. Cigarette smoke from generic (no brand-name), private label, and not-widely-available cigarettes was not tested by TITL, but was tested by the cigarette companies and provided under compulsory process to the FTC. The methodology, processes and procedures that the companies and TITL employed are the same as those the Commission has followed in the past. By direction of the Commission. Donald S. Clark, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26328 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M
