FR940214-1-00017 FR940214-1-00004 (7) Commodities approved for sale or barter need not be imported and sold free of all duties and taxes, but nongovernmental Cooperating Sponsors may negotiate agreements with the host government permitting the duty and tax-free import and sale of such commodities. Even where the Cooperating Sponsor negotiates such exempt status, the prices at which the Cooperating Sponsor sells the commodities to the purchaser shall reflect prices that would be obtained in a competitive commercial transaction, i.e., the prices would include the cost of duties and taxes, so that the amounts normally paid for duties and taxes would accrue for the benefit of the Cooperating Sponsor's approved program. (8) No part of the proceeds or services realized from sales or barters may be used for operating and overhead expenses, other than for personnel and administrative costs of local cooperatives. Operating and overhead expenses are costs attributable to the overall administration and management expenses of the Cooperating Sponsor in its regional, national, or U.S. offices, including rent, taxes, insurance, utilities, telephone, office supplies, and depreciation, and in the case of nonprofit private and voluntary agencies and cooperatives, costs of monitoring, evaluation, auditing, and travel within the host country except where such costs are directly related to a specific activity and essential to the effective implementation of the activity. (9) The Cooperating Sponsor shall use commercially reasonable procurement practices in purchasing goods or services and in construction activities using monetization proceeds or program income, and shall employ procedures that prevent fraud, self-dealing, and conflicts of interest and provide for free and open competition to the maximum extent practicable. Title to real and personal property acquired with monetization proceeds and program income shall be vested in the Cooperating Sponsor, with the Cooperating Sponsor providing the Controller, CCC with an inventory list of all assets valued at one thousand dollars (USD) or more. The Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of such property as directed by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in the event the program terminates or is transferred to another Cooperating Sponsor. (10) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to acquire, develop, construct, alter or upgrade land, buildings or other real property improvements or structures that are either: (i) owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious activity, or (ii) used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, monetized proceeds or program income may be used to finance repair or rehabilitation of an existing structure owned or managed by a church or organization engaged exclusively in religious activity to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated commodities, provided that the structure is not used in whole or in part for any sectarian purpose while donated commodities are stored in it. The use of monetized proceeds or program income to finance construction of such a structure may be approved in the operational plan or by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache if the structure is needed and will be used for the storage of donated commodities for a sufficient period of time to warrant the expenditure of monetized proceeds or program income and the structure will not be used for any sectarian purpose during this period. (b) Food for Progress. Unless the Food for Progress Program Agreement provides otherwise, commodities donated under Food for Progress may be sold within the recipient country without restriction or special procedural requirements. ยง1499.13 Usual marketing requirements. A foreign government Cooperating Sponsor shall provide data showing commercial and non-commercial imports of the types of agricultural commodities requested for the past five years, by country of origin, and an estimate of expected imports of such commodities during the current year. A Program Agreement with a foreign government may include a usual marketing requirement and shall prohibit the re-export of donated commodities, as well as of other related commodities specified in the Program Agreement. ยง1499.14 Processing, packaging and labeling of section 416(b) commodities in the foreign country. (a) Cooperating Sponsors may arrange for the processing of commodities donated under a section 416(b) Program Agreement and for packaging or repackaging prior to distribution. When a third party provides such processing, packaging, or repackaging, the Cooperating Sponsor shall enter into written agreements for such services. The agreement shall require that the provider of such services (1) shall fully account to the Cooperating Sponsor for all commodities delivered or otherwise be liable for the value of all unaccounted commodities and (2) shall maintain adequate records and submit periodic reports pertaining to performance under the agreements. Copies of the executed agreements shall be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
