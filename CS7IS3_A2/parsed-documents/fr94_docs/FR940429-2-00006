FR940429-2-00006 FR940429-2-00005 A. M. Timber Sale, Okanogan National Forest, Okanogan County, WA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On November 21, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the A. M. Timber Sale, was published in the Federal Register (56 FR 58679). The majority of the analysis area for this timber sale falls in an area identified as both a Key Watershed and Late-Successional Reserve in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl. Because of the restrictions on timber harvest activities in Late-Successional Reserves and on road construction in unroaded portions of inventoried roadless areas in Key Watersheds, I have decided to terminate the environmental analysis process. No draft or final environmental impact statement will be issued for the A. M. Timber Sale. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to Arlo VanderWoude, Timber Management Assistant, Twisp Ranger District, P.O. Box 188, Twisp, Washington 98856 or telephone (509) 997&hyph;2131. Dated: April 20, 1994. Billie Hansen, Acting Forest Supervisor.
