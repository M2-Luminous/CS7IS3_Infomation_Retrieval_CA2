Poos, Party Chairman B. Fayot, Group Chairman J. Asselborn, Representative M. Zanussi, R. Hencks, and Group Secretary O. Mores) met with representatives of the CGFP [General Confederation of the Civil Service, the national association of government-employed people] (namely, First Deputy President P. Trausch, General Secretary J. Daleiden, and Financial Administrator F. Haas) on 25 May. The main topics discussed, with a view to the LSAP election platform and the ideas of the CGFP program, were the role of the civil service in a modern state, the possible introduction of hospital insurance, the future orientation of pension systems, the 1991 tax reform, the latest tripartite measures, and the process of European integration. The LSAP and the CGFP are convinced there is no alternative to the existing system of civil servants. In the future, on the basis of a transparent recruitment and pay policy, these civil servants should strive to achieve the highest level of competence, efficiency, and effectiveness. In this context, the LSAP expressly called for the preservation of civil servant status. In addition, the two delegations discussed the recently adopted tripartite measures aimed at fighting unemployment and inflation. The LSAP and CGFP regard the Luxembourg indexation system as a tried and tested instrument for conserving purchasing power and an important contribution toward guaranteeing social peace. The instrument in question must therefore be fully safeguarded. As regards European policy, both delegations emphasized the need for a democratic and social Europe. Moreover, they said that European integration would have to be improved, in compliance with Luxembourg's interests and national peculiarities; that enlargement of the European Union would have to proceed in a well-thought-out manner; and that preparations for the intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996 should include all the relevant forces involved.
