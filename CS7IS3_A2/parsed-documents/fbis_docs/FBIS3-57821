On 30 December a Serb carrying 1.5 kg of explosives with fuses and detonators wanted to enter Austria. The explosives were hidden in a traveling bag in the baggage compartment of the bus that he was driving. The driver and owner of the vehicle, who operates a bus line between Belgrade and Switzerland, was not transporting any passengers. During the interrogation, he pretended not to know anything: He said that he was unaware of the explosives. The bag was to be handed over to somebody in Switzerland. The Serb was arrested. The purpose of the explosives was still unclear on Monday [3 January]. It is not known whether the material was to be sold for profit or used for attacks. A link with the bomb threat against [Vienna's] Schwechat Airport on New Year's Eve has been ruled out. It has only been confirmed that the explosive found after the double murder of the German border policemen on the "Danube Courier" train was of the same "type."
