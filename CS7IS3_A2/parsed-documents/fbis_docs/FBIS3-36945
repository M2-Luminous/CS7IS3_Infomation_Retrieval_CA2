Kosmo made the remarks in his speech at the Viking Revue '94 conference of NATO's North European group. The mayor of Russia's St. Petersburg, Anatoliy Sobchak, in his response termed the position of the Norwegian minister as "very dangerous." Sobchak in his address to the conference among other issues reasserted Russia's stance that the regions of Jaanilinn (Ivangorod) and Petseri were traditional Russian lands and that Estonia's claims for these areas were lacking any grounds. He also said that "a rise of nationalism" was in evidence in many former republics of what was once the Soviet Union. The Estonian delegation to the Viking Revue meeting comprises the commander-in-chief of the country's defense forces, General Aleksander Einseln, and deputy chancellor of the Defense Ministry, Tarmo Molder.
