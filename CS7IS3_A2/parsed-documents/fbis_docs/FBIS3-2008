"The Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions Concerning the Building of the Socialist Market Economy Structure" (the "Decision") adopted at the meeting has followed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, concretized and systematized the goals and basic principles on building the socialist market economy structure set at the 14th CPC National Congress, constructed the basic framework of the socialist market economy structure, and formulated the general program for the reform of the economic structure. It is a program for actions to carry out the reform of the economic structure and to speed up economic development from the present to the end of the century. It is of great practical significance and farreaching historical significance to the reform, opening up, and socialist modernization in our country. The "Decision" has regarded rural reform as its important part and put it in a very important position. This is because the development of the socialist market economy needs a firm agricultural foundation and deepening rural reform is an important part of building the socialist market economy structure. We should seriously implement the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of the central rural work conference, strive to open up a new situation in agriculture and rural work, and push the reform and development in rural areas to a new stage. This is of very great importance to smoothly attaining the goal of building the socialist market economy structure and to fulfilling the strategic task of the national economy and social development in the 1990's. I. Concerning the Present Situation in Agriculture and Rural Areas Guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the agriculture and rural economies of China have entered a new period of development and the general situation of the rural areas is good. In particular, since General Secretary Jiang Zemin convened the rural work forum of six southern provinces in Wuhan and Premier Li Peng convened the national television and telephone meeting on agricultural work in Beijing at the end of last year, a new turning point has emerged in agriculture and rural work. This is prominently expressed in: First, all promissory notes for payment in the procurement of agricultural products have been cashed and virtually no more promissory notes have been issued in the procurement of agricultural products this summer and autumn; second, the central authorities and local governments have taken resolute measures to reduce the peasants' burden and have attained evident good results; third, since the central authorities began to strengthen macroregulation and control, the situation whereby large quantities of land are not used for farming and large amounts of funds are flowing out of the rural areas has taken a turn for the better; and fourth, leadership at all levels has attached greater importance to agriculture and has changed the phenomenon of neglecting agriculture which had emerged. Therefore, the situation in agriculture this year is better than was expected at the beginning of the year. However, we must be aware of problems such as lowering the comparable efficiency of agricultural production, particularly grain production; the widening price scissors of industrial and agricultural products; and the slow growth in peasants' income, have not yet been fundamentally solved. In the course of promoting reform, there are many new situations and new problems in agriculture and rural work which we have to study and solve. We should, through implementing the "Decision" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of the central rural work conference, earnestly solve the existing problems and further develop the favorable rural situation. II. Concerning Stabilizing the Party's Basic Policies for Rural Areas In leading the practice of rural reform, our party has gradually formed a series of basic policies. The Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee systematically summed up these policies. There are nine major ones. The most important ones are implementing the responsibility system, with the household contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output as the dominant factor, and the two-tier operational system integrating centralization with decentralization; persisting in regarding public ownership as the dominant factor and developing various economic compositions at the same time; not relaxing grain production, energetically developing diversified management, and supporting and guiding the healthy development of township and town enterprises; gradually removing restrictions on agricultural products markets and using various channels for circulation; and encouraging some localities and some people to become rich earlier than others through honest labor and lawful operation in a bid to eventually attain common prosperity, and so on. These policies, which have been tested in practice for more than 10 years, are proving to be completely correct. They conform to the three standards put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the reality of agriculture and rural work in our country, and the desires of the broad masses of peasants. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee explicitly put forward that these policies must remain stable for a long time to come and should be constantly improved in practice. From the very beginning, the party's various basic policies for rural areas are characteristic of their market orientation: First, they give the peasants the right to make their own decisions on production and management to arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants; second, they enable agriculture and the rural economy to enter the market and give play to the role of market mechanism; and third, they strengthen protection and service for agriculture and stabilize agriculture's position as the foundation. The rural reform based on these basic policies is, in fact, the successful practice of building the new socialist market economy structure in rural areas. Therefore, stabilizing and improving the party's basic policies in rural areas are important parts of the building of the socialist market economy structure. We should have a thorough understanding of this. III. Concerning Deepening the Rural Reform Some problems which have cropped up in the development of agriculture and the rural economy should be solved mainly through carrying out reform. At present, in implementing the "Decision" and the guidelines of the central rural work conference and in deepening the rural reform, it is necessary to seriously and properly grasp three aspects of work. First, on the basis of stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, promote an optimized distribution of rural economic resources and the rational flow of production essentials in order to arouse the enthusiasm of peasants and various kinds of rural economic organizations, raise labor productivity, and improve the efficiency of the utilization of resources. Therefore, the "Decision" and the central rural work conference stipulated: While upholding the prerequisite of collective ownership, the period for farmland contracts should be extended, the inheritance of contracted management rights of production projects of a development nature should be permitted, and the transfer with compensation of the land utilization rights should be permitted; in a few localities where the economy is relatively developed, various forms such as the transfer of contracts and buying shares can be adopted to develop management to an appropriate scale while adhering to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. These stipulations are of great significance to improving the land contract system and to raising labor productivity in agriculture and the output rate of land. Second, develop the rural market, invigorate rural economic circulation, and adopt various ways to link the scattered production and management of thousands upon thousands of households with a unified market. Make great efforts to develop the agricultural products market and to develop markets for various production essentials, such as land, manpower, and funds, in a bid to gradually form a complete market system. In the course of building and perfecting the rural market system, stress should be laid on the development of various intermediate organizations which link the peasant households with the market. Many good forms, such as the integration of commerce, industry, and agriculture; making production, processing, and marketing a coordinated process; and companies helping peasant households, have existed in Jiangxi. These management organizations and management methods have broken the limits of ownership, departments, and localities, and have linked the peasant households with the market, cities with rural areas, and production and circulation with consumption. They have powerful vitality and we should energetically give them support and speed up their development. Third, build a system for the government to guide, support, protect, regulate, and control agriculture. This is determined by the characteristics of agriculture itself and is also an objective demand in developing the socialist market economy in rural areas. The building of a social service system for agriculture is an important guarantee to promoting the specialization, commercialization, and socialization of agriculture. The peasants have an urgent demand for such a system and we must make great efforts to do a good job in this respect. IV. Concerning Solutions to Conspicuous Problems in the Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy The most conspicuous problem at present is grain and cotton production. The central rural work conference focused its attention on studying this problem and put forward some solutions to it. First, increase the comparable economic results in grain and cotton production, increase the peasants' income from grain and cotton production, further arouse the peasants' enthusiasm in production, and ensure a steady growth in the output of grain and cotton. Second, establish central and local grain risk funds and a reserve regulation system to ensure an ample supply of grain, stabilize market grain prices within a rational range, and protect the interests of the peasants and the consumers. Third, make great efforts to support the economic development of main grain and cotton producing areas. Main grain and cotton producing areas should stabilize grain and cotton growing areas, increase the multiple crop index and per unit area yield, rationally readjust the production setup, develop diversified management and township and town enterprises, in particular, do a good job in the processing industry for agricultural and sideline products, taking the road of development of integrating production growth with increase in value through transformation. Efforts should be concentrated on giving support to major counties which produce commodity grain and cotton and the building of production bases should continue to be strengthened. All localities and departments should firmly grasp the formulation of implementation methods and organize people to implement them as soon as possible. Grain is of great importance and has a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood, social stability, and state security. New problems cropped up in grain production and circulation should be seriously dealt with and properly solved and should not be treated lightly. In studying and solving these problems, we must proceed from the national conditions of our country and from reality. Our country has a large population and not much farmland. The comprehensive production capacity of agriculture, that of grain in particular, is not great and the capability of resisting natural disasters is not great either. The development in different localities is uneven and there are localities which do not have sufficient grain, even in provinces and regions which produce much grain. The formation of a unified and orderly grain market system has not yet been completed. Some external conditions for grain production and management, such as the supply of the means of production and the storage and transportation of grain, need further improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the steady growth of grain output over a long period to come. At the same time, it is necessary, through deepening reform, to gradually and properly put the purchase and marketing structure in order and correctly handle the relationship between grain producing localities and marketing localities, the relationship between grain and other cash crops, the relationship between the domestic market and the regulation of imports and exports, and the relationship between the present and the future. In short, it is necessary to implement correct policies for grain production and management which are conducive to the development of grain production, the stability of the grain market, and the protection of the interest of the peasants and the consumers. V. Concerning the Development of Productive Forces in Rural Areas Concentrating efforts on the development of productive forces in rural areas is the central task in the party's rural work. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of water conservancy work, popularize practical technology for agriculture, and strengthen the material and technological foundations for agriculture. It is necessary to gear readjustment of the agriculture product mix and the production setup in rural areas to market and to make great efforts to develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture and develop township and town enterprises and other nonagricultural industries. Jiangxi has put forward two main tasks in the development of the rural economy and we can say such tasks are of universal significance. One of them is development, the development of agriculture, the development of various kinds of nonagricultural industries, and the development of products. Many localities have made full use of local resources to carry out a series of developments so that production and management have developed to a considerable scale, have developed into industries, and have effectively promoted the development of the rural economy. The other is to continue the development of the township and town enterprises. The "Decision" and the central rural work conference have fully affirmed that township and town enterprises are an important part of the rural economy and have put forward principles and measures to guide and assist township and town enterprises to develop healthily. It is necessary, through deepening reform, to blaze new paths in the property rights system and the ways of management of township and town enterprises in order to further increase their vitality. It is necessary to develop mainstay industries and best-selling products, increase production to a considerable scale, improve economic results, and to increase competitive power. It is necessary to guide township and town enterprises into becoming appropriately concentrated, fully transform and utilize existing small cities and towns, develop new cities and towns, and integrate the development of township and town enterprises with the construction of small cities and towns. Reform means the liberation and development of productive forces. "Development is the last word." It is necessary to concentrate efforts on developing productive forces so that the rural economy can develop to a higher level. VI. Concerning Strengthening Agriculture's Foundation Position The "Decision" and the central rural work conference stressed the necessity to readjust the structure of the national economy, readjust its distribution pattern, increasing the percentage to be used in agriculture, of investment in the capital construction of the state, funds included in the financial budget, and credit funds. The central authorities have put forward that, in formulating the state credit plan, it is necessary to ensure the growth rate of agricultural loans is more than two percentage points over the growth rate of other loans and that, in the additional bank loans next year, the percentage of loans for agriculture should be increased to more than 10 percent and the percentage of financial input into agriculture should also be increased. Not only the central authorities but also local governments should act in this way. In readjusting the economic structure, the important thing is to readjust the ratio between industry and agriculture. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward this issue in his speech "On the Ten Major Relationships" a long time ago. The experience of several decades has proved that if the structure is rational and the agricultural foundation is stable, the development of industry and the economy will have a favorable environment; and, if the structure is irrational, agriculture shrinks and the agricultural foundation is unstable and industry, even the entire national economy, will be affected. At present, an important factor affecting industrial production is the market. The stockpiling of products in some industrial enterprises is because the market, the rural market in particular, has not opened up. The market in China has a great potential and such potential lies mainly in rural areas. If agriculture is not developed, and if the peasants' purchasing power is not increased, industry will not have the necessary raw materials and a broad market. We should understand this truth. Readjusting the economic structure and properly handling the ratio between industrial and agricultural production is an issue to which we should pay attention for a long time to come. For decades, we have repeatedly come across this issue. In the course of building the socialist market economy structure, it is all the more necessary to attach importance to the issue. The development of agriculture and the rural economy has to meet the needs of the market economy but, on the other hand, in the course of building the market economy structure it is necessary to strengthen support and protection for agriculture. Agriculture is the kind of production which produces great social benefits but few benefits for itself and which has a relatively weak foundation and needs special support and protection from the government. All developed countries act in this way. To ensure that agriculture's foundation position remains unshaken, we must increase input in agriculture and strengthen support and protection for agriculture. VII. Concerning Strengthening the Building of Spiritual Civilization in Rural Areas It is necessary to uphold the principle of grasping with both hands, and grasping firmly with both hands, strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas, strengthen the building of rural grass-roots organizations with party branches as the cores and the building of democracy and the legal system, and strengthen the building of grass-roots political power and the building of the contingent of rural cadres. It is necessary to frequently carry out education on patriotism, socialism, and collectivism among peasants; eradicate feudal superstition, outmoded conventions, and bad customs; oppose extravagance and waste; encourage industriousness and thriftiness in managing a household; and display the spirit of mutual help and friendship. At present, the peasants are highly critical about social order. It is necessary to strengthen comprehensive management of social order and crack down sternly on train bandits and road scoundrels, on illegal activities which damage the peasants' interest and undermine production, and on kidnapping children and women. It is necessary to strengthen guidance to rural cultural life. In films, television, music, operas, literature, and paintings, it is necessary to create more works loved by peasants. Literature and art performance troupes should regularly go to rural areas to give performances for peasants and should strive to enrich peasants' cultural lives. At present, to properly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the central rural work conference, it is necessary to depend on two things: The first is to depend on party organizations at all levels. It is necessary to pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of rural grass-roots cadres, raising their ideological level and enhancing their understanding of policy, and encouraging them to work creatively. Party organizations at the provincial, prefectural, county, and township levels should put implementation of the guidelines of the two meetings on their agendas and make concrete arrangements. It is necessary to put forward our own targets, plans, and methods for implementation in accordance with the principles, goals, and planning put forward by the "Decision" and closely in light of local reality. The other is to depend on the masses of people. It is necessary to disseminate the guidelines of the "Decision" and the central rural work conference among the broad masses of peasants. It is necessary to be good at using lively and vivid methods and simple, easy to understand language to relay to peasants the guidelines of the central authorities. In the course of changing over to the socialist market economy structure, many things in agriculture need studying and many problems needs solving. The responsibility of rural work is very heavy and it is necessary to strengthen the party's leadership over rural work. The broad masses of cadres who have taken up rural work, the leading cadres in particular, should seriously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, study a series of expositions by Comrade Xiaoping concerning agricultural development and rural reform, and strengthen the consciousness of adhering to the party's basic line and implementing the party's various principles and policies for rural areas. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, and under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, united as one, work hard, strive to properly carry out various kinds of rural work, and promote rural reform and rural economic development.
