According to statistics, in 1992 the Chengdu individual economy (individual industrial and commercial households, private enterprises, market fairs) provided tax revenues of 180 million yuan, approximately 8 percent of that city's revenues. Individual tax revenues represent about 10 percent of the province's industrial-commercial tax revenues: Last year alone the province took in 820 million yuan in taxes (excluding Chongqing). On the other hand, because some of these entrepreneurs do not pay much attention to taxation, the market mechanisms are not fully developed, tax collection policies and collection methodologies are less than perfect, and because of the number and quality of our tax collectors, the phenomenon of "avoiding, cheating, minimizing and evading" taxes is commonplace among entrepreneurs, and seems to be growing as well. What is needed is to promote the healthy growth of the individual and private economy on the one hand and on the other to reduce to the lowest level possible all losses in state tax revenues. This is presently the most prominent and most pressing problem awaiting solution in the area of individual taxation. Some days ago these reporters visited the provincial and Chengdu city tax departments and discovered that at the present time there are the following four main problems in individual enterprise taxation. 1. The collection of individual enterprise taxes is very difficult, our ability to levy and administer taxes is very weak. To avoid taxes, some individual and private enterprises use such tricks as not keeping records of income, false registration of ownership, bogus contracts, falsification of rents and leases, falsification of joint operations, and so forth. And the inadequate resources for levying and administration exacerbates the difficulty of collecting individual enterprise taxes. According to statistics, the Chengdu Tax Bureau handles taxes for some 150,000 individual enterprises, but they only have 410 tax department cadres responsible for the direct administration or the shared administration of individual enterprise taxation, so each officer administers an average of 390 enterprises. At the Hehuachi Market in Chengdu, the average tax cadre administers 427 enterprises. The uneven ideological and cultural qualifications and temporary nature of the 1,300 plus auxiliary tax officers also exerts a certain influence on the normalized development of individual enterprise taxation. 2. Some individual and private enterprises are changing into cooperative-run, state-run, or foreign-funded enterprises. In the past several years the concerned departments in this province have time and again attempted to clean up the "four false enterprises" (false cooperatives, false state run, false foreign invested, false subsidiaries) but their numbers continue to grow. In 1990 alone the Chengdu City Tax Bureau uncovered over 4,000 "four false" enterprises within the city. At present, many individual and private operators, in order to cut their taxes, are changing themselves into cooperatives, or state-owned, or foreign-funded enterprises, and registering subsidiary ownership, thus causing severe losses in individual enterprise tax revenues. (There is also the fact that some street management offices are requiring individual enterprises to change to cooperative enterprises in order to increase their own management fee income.) Three of Chengdu's major areas -- Qingnian Road, Ranfang Street, and Nanshuwa Street -- have been affected by the change from individual to cooperative enterprises. In 1992 there was a decrease of 190 individual enterprises, and the tax revenue for the three districts dropped 410,000 yuan. 3. Interregional operations currently represent one of the big drains of tax revenues. Over the past several years the economic contacts and exchange of products between regions, between city and countryside, between the interior provinces and the outlying regions have become more closely linked day by day. However, the tax collection and tax administration departments of the various localities only pay attention to the end of the operation in their location; add to this all the trouble caused by regional protectionism, and a huge leak in individual and private enterprise tax revenues is created. Some individual household and privately run operations are registering as subsidiary operations under state-owned and cooperative enterprises, nominally opening offices or warehouses in Chengdu or other districts but in reality they carry out independent operational activities; some so called non-independent accounting units in reality have no accounting relationship with any parent organization; some register as branch operation subsidiaries of special economic zone companies or enterprises, but in reality neither end of the operation pays income taxes. For instance, early last year a Guangdong individual enterprise entrepreneur, nominally registered as a subsidiary joint operation of a certain Chengdu electrical equipment company, in actuality was just an individual household operation, and was responsible for some 100,000 yuan in lost tax revenue. 4. False use of an enterprise's name, operating without a license. Some individual entrepreneurs have no operating license or tax registration, falsely use the name of some state-run enterprise (that is, of some duly licensed state run enterprise, but with which it has no accounting relationship and is not a branch organ) to carry on operations and avoid taxes for long periods of time. For instance, a certain Chengdu private enterprise operator used this method to operate without a license from July 1991 to March 1992; she was investigated and punished and made to pay over 53,000 yuan in back taxes. Experience has proven that if we want to promote the growth of the individual and private economy and also want to reduce state tax losses to the lowest level possible, then the key is the strengthening and reform of tax collection work. At the present time, the administration of individual taxation is in the form of democratic evaluation, tax bureau approval and periodic collection. With the expansion of the market economy, this formulation no longer meets the requirements of the developing situation. A somewhat better method would be, for the individual and private enterprises, to set up accounts and establish licenses, collect taxes according to the account audits. We should strengthen the license issuing administration system, truly implement figuring taxes according to rates and collecting taxes according to the laws. At the present stage, because a lack of understanding of the idea of taxation according to law among the individual and private enterprises, plus the inadequate collection and administrative force of the tax departments, it will be difficult to render the system scientific, standardized and systematic in a short period of time. At the present stage we could implement quota-determined tax calculations, appraise and fix a base figure and then in succeeding years calculate and levy taxes according to a certain ratio, modifying treatment according to differences and changes in the different districts, different businesses, different ports and markets. Use a "give the fish plenty of water" policy to cultivate tax revenue resources. The second is that the preferential tax treatment policies enjoyed by all the economic elements of all types of ownership systems in the same region should be equitable and rational, avoiding lopsidedness of too much or too little. Thirdly, hire ample tax collection and administration personnel for handling the individual industrial-commercial households and privately run enterprises, gradually achieving a level where each official on the average handles 100 enterprises. At the same time, bolster the ranks of the auxiliary tax force, set up a full fledged network for aiding and protecting the tax workers, overcoming the abuses of taxation by whim and the seeking of personal benefit that still exists in the tax collection process. Looking at the long term, we should take a cue from international examples, push for the modernization and socialization reforms of tax collection and administration. In this regard, the Haikou City Tax Bureau in Hainan supplied us with an experience worth examining. Their method is this: they have abolished the traditional method of a specialist tax officer being in charge of the tax collection and administration of each household and changed from administration by household to administration by category; they have changed from having the taxpayer report in to pay taxes to having the taxpayer initiating the payments, and being held responsible for the contents of her tax report. Components of the tax departments, in order to meet the requirements of specialized division of labor, have devised a administration by category method of operation, eliminating the investigation units in the sub-bureaus and having the city-level investigation unit provide uniform leadership and control. At lower levels they instituted various and numerous smaller units having investigative powers, authority to open case files, and authority to levy and accept registration fees, and so gradually moving toward specialization. The main responsibility of the tax sub-bureau is the collection of tax moneys, and tax law propaganda work; as for enterprise tax collection, it is all done under computer control, the tax collector directly collecting taxes or carrying out taxation through some social intermediary organization acting as agent. At the same time, they have strengthened tax collection audit work, and set up tax law offices. They are gradually setting up a new tax system wherein the tax offices levy taxes by computer according to the law, the taxpayers themselves report and pay their taxes, there are social intermediary organs to act as tax agents, and the judicial organs handle tax law violation cases according to the law.
