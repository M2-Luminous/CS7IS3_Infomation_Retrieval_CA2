In a Tokyo speech, Mieno said that the long recession after the collapse of the late 1980s speculative bubble highlights the dangers of the financial industry concentrating its lending in one area, such as real estate. Mieno said private risk-management ability has weakened, citing a financial sector tendency "to use industry averages as a benchmark and stay in the pack," unaware that "ill-managed behavior in one corner can spread risk through the sector." Noting competition-forced innovations in domestic industries such as autos and electronics, the central bank chief said most financial sector improvements have been copied from abroad, and asked "why is it that innovation is hard to come by for Japanese financial institutions?" Reforms needed to strengthen the financial sector center on letting the market more effectively drive financial institutions to seek profits while shareholders and other market players discipline "excessive behavior," Mieno said. He praised December's Hiraiwa Commission report calling for deregulation, called on institutions to improve their risk management procedures and urged beefing up of such financial "infrastructure" as accounting and disclosure systems. Regulation and surpervision remain essential to "embed moral standards in financial institutions," but regulations focus heavily on risks while the market constantly balances risks with rewards, Mieno said. The concentration on real estate-related lending in the bubble era has left financial institutions saddled with huge nonperforming assets, which they must write off to allow full recovery, Mieno said. He repeated that adjustments need not be complete for recovery to begin but said they will continue to retard a return to full-throttle growth. Bright spots continue to emerge, but more time is needed for stock and balance sheet adjustments and responses to increasing international competition, he said. Mieno noted that some areas of consumption and industrial production are brightening but said capital spending and labor conditions continue to worsen. He cautioned that such recent signs as higher output from mines and factories somewhat reflect a typical surge toward the end of the fiscal year in March. "Conditions are falling in place for a better-balanced growth," but some excess capacity run up in the bubble days may never be fully used, he said.
