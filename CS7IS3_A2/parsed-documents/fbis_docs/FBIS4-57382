Indian leaders warned Sixto Duran-Ballen that if Congress does not reject a draft agrarian law they consider harmful, they will close highways and isolate the capital. Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said that if this law is approved, Indians will fall back into the times of slavery. Our land would be taken away from us, and we would be unable to produce, he added. Macas said that the law jeopardizes the Indians' ability to obtain food in the country, as it extends the landholders' controls over agricultural projects with the sole purpose of producing for export. Another Indian leader explained that the draft law seeks to eliminate the agrarian reform, which would deprive the Indian communities of their land.
