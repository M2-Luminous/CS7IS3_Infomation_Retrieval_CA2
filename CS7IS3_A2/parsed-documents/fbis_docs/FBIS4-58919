The Iranian interests section in Washington in a strongly-worded letter to the U.S. foreign affairs department through the Pakistani embassy, described as "insulting" the way customs officials at Washington airport behaved with Iranian Minister of Economy and Finance Morteza Mohammad-Khani and Governor of Central Bank Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli. The U.S. Customs officials stopped the two senior Iranian diplomats, re-checked their suitcases and took photographs from them. The letter voicing dissatisfaction, said the treatment not only violated the basic diplomatic principles but contradicted the U.S. Government's responsibility towards international organizations based in America. It continued that U.S. Customs officials had repeatedly shown such disrespect for Iranian officials visiting America for international sessions. The letter expected that the U.S. as a country which hosts international sessions would put an end to such practice.
