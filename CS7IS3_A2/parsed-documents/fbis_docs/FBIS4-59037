What would constitute the most serious threats at home and abroad? [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful, although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups. Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors, our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military forces is present. We should view their situation differently. In those areas, security is provided by others and for their own interests. We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and east of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot efface them fast. [passage omitted] In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity stemming from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations. Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran. The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States. The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the Europeans. The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States. If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the straying of their youth were not important for us, we could ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the eastern regions of the country would become completely safe. It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human rights violations. But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to narcotics. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] If possible, let us get to the second part of the question, that is, what is the most important threat? [Rowhani] We perceive no real threats, whether at home or abroad. Every country plans its security around potential threats, which we also face inside and outside the country. In a discussion regarding internal security, a potential threat could be that the people become indifferent to the system and the aspirations of the revolution. The day the people become indifferent and do not feel that this country and revolution belong to them, or that the burden of this revolution is on their shoulders, will be the day when we should feel danger. People are the greatest repository of the strength of the country's system. If the people do not remain active in the political, social, and economic arenas, we will face difficulties everywhere. The enemy has invested much in this regard and constantly seeks--by disseminating innuendo, fallacious statistics, and rumors--to project the impression that the revolution has done nothing for the people, deliberately downplaying its achievements and magnifying minor problems. They want to deprive the revolution of its greatest asset, that is, the people. [passage omitted] In the sphere of foreign threats, while we are not in a state of war, a potential threat does exist. There are so many foreign warships alongside our water. They can provoke countries and even attack us and initiate a war. We perceive the prime factor in terms of a foreign threat in the United States, which is a real threat for us. This threat is the powers of world arrogance spearheaded by the United States and its lackey in the region, that is, Israel. Israel implements the United States' instructions. If today we have no real threat we should still be wary of malicious enemies. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] By changing the political geography of Iraq, the powers of world arrogance are seeking to create an area under Kurdish domination that will ultimately lead to the establishment of a greater Kurdistan. Is this not a danger to our security? [Rowhani] We are opposed to the dismemberment of Iraq and basically all kinds of changes in the political geography of the region. This is something we have proclaimed frequently. It is unlikely that this will seriously happen in the region. Even if it does, it will pose no threat to us. First, I should explain that there is a great difference of opinion among the Westerners in this regard. Europe believes in one thing, the United States in another. Even among the Europeans, there is no consensus of opinion. Turkey has a specific viewpoint. The issue is not so simple that in northern Iraq they can so easily create a country called Kurdistan. The countries in this area are very sensitive about this issue, especially Turkey. If we were to hypothesize that one day Iraq is dismembered and a Kurdish government is set up in northern Iraq, this would not be a threat to us. The people of our Kordestan have realized--with this experiment in autonomy in northern Iraq--the problems that have been generated. They know the hands of the colonialists want to manipulate them constantly and use them in ploys and as puppets. Our Kords have realized that the colonialists seek only their own interests. We do not differentiate among the Kurds, Turks, or Farsis in Iran. There is no restriction anywhere in Iran, neither in the universities nor in the Majles. Any Kord can be a candidate and become a Majles deputy and participate in the legislative decisions like all the other deputies. In some countries, people are not even ready to mention the term, Kurd. The country that has the most Kurds refers to them as mountain Turks and is not willing even to use the word "Kurd." They have problems but we have no problems right now. Apart from some residual activity by grouplets affiliated with the colonialists and great powers and Iraq--and their number is quite negligible--we have no security problem. You witnessed the dazzling presence of the Kordish people in the 11 February marches in the Kord-inhabited cities. The people of Kordestan came of their own accord and expressed their sentiments toward the system and the revolution. The participation of people in the Kord-inhabited cities during the elections is never less than in other areas. We have never felt any sense of danger from these areas. [RESALAT] You mentioned threats from the United States. You know that last year economic relations between Iran and the United States increased considerably. German officials said that the United States is Iran's main economic partner. Isn't this closeness to the United States a threat to our interests? What is your opinion? [Rowhani] Our relations with the United States were severed in the diplomatic, military, and cultural fields and there is no contact of any kind between us and the United States in these areas. Our economic contacts are not official, merely continuing since 1359 [year beginning 21 March 1980]. Economic relations between [Iranian] companies and American companies were never severed. These relations have occasionally been weak, even moderate, especially in the area of the purchase of oil by American companies. Nearly anytime we sold oil on the international market the American companies bought it. The high figure that is sometimes quoted is a two-way figure, much of it pertaining to the purchase of our oil by American companies. [RESALAT] What is the figure? [Rowhani] I have no precise figures but mostly it concerns the purchase of oil. Last year the volume of exchanges with us increased, with a very positive result. This is because the United States constantly exerted pressure on Europe and Japan to reduce their volume of trade with Iran. The Americans asked: Why do you not reduce the level of your trade relations with Iran? Why do you purchase goods from Iran and make its economy flourish? The announcement of these figures has now floored them completely. Now most of the G-7 countries openly attack the United States and ask: Why did you ask us to reduce the quantum of our trade with Iran when you yourself have increased your trade relations with Iran? This topic has generated serious discord among them. I believe that the ploy the Americans had in hand and wished to use against the Islamic Republic of Iran has been lost. It is to our benefit that our real trading partners, namely Japan and Europe, should know that there is another competitor and this gives our companies greater strength to maneuver in international economic relations. It is clear that in this rivalry, we have a greater choice in our hands, which will bring prices down, raise the quality, and ensure greater facilities. We must consider our own interests in trade relations. I think the United States has been exposed before the Europeans and the Japanese and a blow has been dealt to its credibility. [RESALAT] But there is another danger. If there comes a time when only American companies are the buyers of our oil or of much of it, and if they suddenly decide not to buy the oil, this will undoubtedly cause us a lot of problems. Will it not? [Rowhani] You should see who buys our oil in the market. In any case, a considerable percentage is bought by the Americans on the international market. But we have never relied on this purchase. The volume of our sales is not such that it could generate problems for us. The basis of the policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran has always been to diversify and not depend on one source. If a problem arises, we will have room to maneuver and solve our problem. But in the case of the United States, our sales from American companies should be restricted to what is absolutely necessary. Nothing else. [RESALAT] No clear answer has been received from our officials on our debts, that is, on why and how we ran up such debts. Who is responsible for this and what will be our situation? [Rowhani] We have few problems with debts. [RESALAT] Would this not be a question of security? [Rowhani] In this context, every issue can become a security issue from a particular perspective, be it political, cultural, economic, or even educational. I wish to state that our debts are not high, no more than expected. Our debts are what was envisaged in the first Five-Year Plan. We permitted the government to make the pledges. [RESALAT] The period for repaying foreign debts will expire in the next two or three years. Do you not think that this will create a serious problem for the next president? [Rowhani] There are two factors for the next presidential tenure: One is that the main projects in which we have invested in recent years will become operational and the future president need only inaugurate these projects. [second factor not mentioned] Of course there is the problem of debts but these are not expected to reach a very mind-shattering level, so we foresee no serious problem. If we depend only on oil then we will always have this problem. [RESALAT] The projection was $27 billion but we have now pledged over $30 billion. The nature of the debts varies. [Rowhani] We will manage one way or the other. The volume is not such that it would be very amazing. Our commitments are below $30 billion, that is, nearly the amount envisaged in the Plan. They do not overstep the prescribed limits and are within the volume projected. To have foreign commitments worth 20 plus billion dollars is not a very big deal. It is quite natural for a country with an income of $20-25 billion to have foreign commitments on the same level. This is lower than the international norm. If the projections in the Plan had been envisaged in foreign exchange earnings, these problems would not have arisen. For example, we predicted in the Plan that the quantity of our nonoil exports should be approximately $18 billion. We viewed this in the context of our total income. But the export of our nonoil products is not within our control such that we can incorporate it in our programs. Our other problem was the slump in oil prices, which created problems with regard to our reimbursements. Oil prices are very inappropriate as there is too much of a difference from the OPEC base price. Another problem is the parity of the dollar. The fluctuations the dollar has had in the course of the first Five-Year Plan have cost us $6 billion, because we sell against the dollar and buy mostly against the mark. That we have $25-30 billion of foreign commitments poses no problem, in view of our income. Our problem stems from the collective repayment falling due soon. Our problem is not the commitment but the cash flow. We made short-term commitments, which would have caused no problems had they been medium or long-term ones. So it just happened that some repayments fell due all at the same time and created this situation. Some may say our foreign exchange management is weak and that we could have organized it better. But it is not easy to pin down who is to blame, as most of the decisions are made collectively by the Supreme Economic Council and the Cabinet. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] The necessary forecasts should have been made. Again this makes the management answerable. [Rowhani] True, the government, the Central Bank, and the Majles should have anticipated this situation but the fact is that when the Five-Year Plan was being compiled, there was no way of foreseeing that the oil price would plummet so much. No one could have thought that oil prices would reach the level they reached in 1353 [year beginning 21 March 1974]. (The value of the dollar is under 10 percent of what it was then). [RESALAT] In view of its experiences in 1372 [year beginning 21 March 1993], the Majles has presented a more realistic budget for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], applying much caution and thought. For example, it is specified how much will be allocated to the repayment of commitments from our anticipated income. The Majles made this allocation and included different scenarios with a different plan to be followed in each case. As for our commitments, I can sum up briefly: 1. The volume of the outstanding debts did not exceed what was envisaged in the Five-Year Plan. 2. All the problems that arose were not the fault of the management. If the oil price had not slumped and we had not had a cashflow problem, this situation would not have arisen. I am optimistic that with the attention the Majles and the president will pay to this issue, we will have no similar problems in future. Of course, we have found some specific solutions for the repayment of our debts and the problem of careless debts has almost been solved. But because of the caution by the Majles, the budget for this year is rather tight. Ministers don't usually favor such budgets.
