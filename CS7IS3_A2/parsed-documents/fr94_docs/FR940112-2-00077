FR940112-2-00077 FR940112-2-00057 Social Security Administration Social Security Ruling SSR 94&hyph;1c; Supplemental Security Income_Disability_Illegal Activity as Substantial Gainful Activity AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of Social Security ruling. SUMMARY: In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling 94&hyph;1c. This Ruling is based on the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Dotson v. Shalala, which affirmed the U.S. district court decision upholding the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denying the claimant's application for disability benefits under the supplemental security income program. Among other things, the court of appeals determined that the decision of the Secretary that the illegal activity in which the claimant engaged to support a drug addiction constituted substantial gainful activity (SGA) was consistent with the Social Security Act and the Secretary's regulations and supported by substantial evidence, and that in determining whether such activity was SGA, the cost of the claimant's narcotics could not be deducted from the claimant's income as an impairment-related work expense. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joanne K. Castello, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1711. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors, disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs.

Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon as precedents in adjudicating other cases. If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register to that effect.
