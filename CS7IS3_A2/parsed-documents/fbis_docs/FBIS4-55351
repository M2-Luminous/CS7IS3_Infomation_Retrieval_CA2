This was possible thanks to an accord between the trade unionists and the chairmen of the coal companies. In a number of cities, Solidarity organized strikes and demonstrations. This is a part of the protest action the continuation of which was decided upon yesterday by the National Commission. The action is to continue until the time that the government undertakes bilateral talks with Solidarity on the subject of national postulates.

In the course of talks during the night, the protestors agreed to work off the strike days during time normally off work. They can also include the strike days as part of their holidays or take them as unpaid leave. Before the miners receive payments for the days worked off, they will be able to apply for advances. Now they are awaiting the implementation of the decisions adopted.
