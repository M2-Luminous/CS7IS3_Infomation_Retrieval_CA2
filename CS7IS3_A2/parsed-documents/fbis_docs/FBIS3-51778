Only six delegates, including Legislator Hernan Gnaeggi and Luis Ramon Fabrega, abstained from voting in favor of the presidential ticket proposed by convention leader Joaquin Fernando Franco, who chaired the PLA meeting. A total of 221 out of 257 delegates attended the convention, which proceeded slowly after starting three hours late due to a blackout. Franco said the process was slow "because we took the utmost care to avoid having to face another challenge." The convention delegates amended two articles of the party's statutes and elected the National Executive Authority with chairman Arnulfo Escalona, the members of the National Political Authority, and the members of the Honor Court.
