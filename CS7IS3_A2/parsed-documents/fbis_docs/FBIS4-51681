The quarterly Economic Planning Agency report also found growing hopes of an economic recovery, but an official cautioned that it would be hasty to read the survey as showing the economy hitting bottom in its longest postwar recession. Companies plan to cut their spending on plant and equipment by 9.2 percent to 40 trillion yen in the fiscal year that started this month, the third year of declines in a row but narrowing from the fiscal 1993 cutback of 10.3 percent, the survey found. Manufacturers' capital spending plans were down 17.6 percent for the third straight drop, compared with the previous year's 18.7 percent decline, while nonmanufacturers plan a second straight cutback, with the decline narrowing to 5.0 percent from 5.5 percent. The agency canvassed 4,550 companies with capital of at least 100 million yen on March 1, with 4,304 responding. The agency's Business Survey Index found sentiment on the economy registering minus 3 for the April-June quarter, an improvement from the previous quarter's minus 22 reading. "Cautious opinions among corporate managers about the domestic economy are easing and expectations of recovery are again emerging," the report said. The index subtracts the percentage of companies seeing declines from those citing improvement. The outlook for the quarter starting in July rises to plus 13, but the official noted that projections for two quarters ahead have been positive since late 1992 even as the economy continued to slump.
