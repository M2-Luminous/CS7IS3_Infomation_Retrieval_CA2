Computerization is considered a must to accommodate the amount of information acquired by overseas missions and quickly meet demands as documents are now managed separately by bureau, office and division, the officials said. The ministry plans to start building up a data base on diplomatic information this year. It will begin with information on people, protocols, economic and trade statistics, National Assembly interpellation summaries, diplomatic schedules, dates of global events and international organizations this month. Work on the data base will continue to include diplomatic policies, materials, books and personnel. Comprehensive and efficient management of diplomatic information is neccessary to respond quickly and aggressively to changes in the world, an official said. In the long run, the ministry will adopt a multi-data system that handles letters, images and sounds at the same time and introduce an optical file system to produce colorful image data.
