He also said the date to put the new currency, the real, into circulation has not been established yet. An agricultural harvest that may hit historical records, high foreign currency reserves, prices that are gradually being converted into URV's at the pace the government expected, and workers who received their first salaries converted into URV's -- these are just a few of the signals of the economy that has a new administrator as of today: Minister Rubens Ricupero. Early today in the program Bom Dia Brasil, the minister said in his first interview of the day he was sworn to in his post that the current conditions are better than those of the former economic plan. In an exclusive interview, the minister said that in the next few days the government will convert public utility rates into URV's, something that must be done before 15 April. According to the minister, a date has not been established yet for putting the new currency, the real, in circulation. Minister Ricupero also said he will control government expenses. As for the changes Congress might make in the provisional measure creating the URV, Ricupero said he will not accept changes to the economic plan such as the possible creation of a salary readjustment trigger: [Begin Ricupero recording] We must end the idea that it is necessary to perpetuate inflation. We must eradicate inflation once and for all and give the government a minimum period of time to give it credit so as to allow the economic program to demonstrate its advantages.
