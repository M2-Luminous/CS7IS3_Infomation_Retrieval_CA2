FR940317-1-00194 FR940317-1-00016 In so crafting the 1975 Amendments, Congress struck a balance between investor protection and intergovernmental comity. This concern is reflected in Section 15B(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits the MSRB from requiring ``any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectly through a purchaser or prospective purchaser of securities from the issuer, to file with the Commission or the Board prior to the sale of such securities by the issuer any application, report, or document, in connection with the issuance, sale, or distribution of such securities.'' 35 While narrowly tailoring the authority of the MSRB to require that disclosure documents be provided to investors, 36 Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Commission under Section 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act. 37 35 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(d)(1). 36 The so-called ``Tower Amendment,'' adding section 15B(d)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(d)(2) to the Exchange Act, prohibits the MSRB from requiring municipal issuers, directly or indirectly, through municipal securities broker-dealers or otherwise, to furnish the MSRB or prospective investors with any documents, including official statements. The MSRB specifically is permitted, however, to require that official statements or other documents that are available from sources other than the issuer, such as the underwriter, be provided to investors. 37 15 U.S.C. 78 o (c)(2). Moreover, Section 15B(d)(2) expressly indicates that ``[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commission under any provision of this title.'' 38 Thus, while prohibiting the Commission from requiring municipal issuers to file reports or documents prior to issuing securities in Section 15B(d)(1), 39 Congress expanded the Commission's authority to adopt rules reasonably designed to prevent fraud. The Commission believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 are consistent with its Congressional mandate to adopt rules reasonably designed to prevent fraud in the municipal securities market. 40 38 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(d)(2). 39 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;4(d)(1). 40 Rule 15c2&hyph;12 was adopted pursuant to the Commission's authority under Exchange Act Sections 2, 3, 10, 15, 15B, and 23; 15 U.S.C. 78b, 78c, 78j, 78 o , 78 o &hyph;4, 78q, and 78w. V. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 41 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider the anticompetitive effects of those rules, if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission preliminarily is of the view that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment, however, on any competitive burdens that might result from amendment of the rule. Moreover, while the amendments apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, the Commission is interested in receiving comments on the extent to which the proposed dollar threshold in the new exemption in paragraph (e) would burden one segment of the industry more than another. 41 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2). In addition, the Commission has prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (``IRFA''), pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 42 regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. The IRFA indicates that the amendments to the rule could impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers and municipal issuers. Nonetheless, the Commission is of the view that many of the substantive requirements of the rule amendments already are observed by broker-dealers and issuers as a matter of business practice, or to fulfill their existing obligations under the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission requests comment on the extent to which current practice deviates from the requirements of the proposed amendments, and the extent to which additional costs may be imposed on small broker-dealers and municipal issuers if the amendments are adopted as proposed. 42 5 U.S.C. 604. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from Janet W. Russell-Hunter, Esq., Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 7&hyph;10, Washington, DC 20549, (202) 504&hyph;2418.
