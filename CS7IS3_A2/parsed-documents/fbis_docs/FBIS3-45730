Statistics show that by the end of November 1993, the total market capitalization of Chinese capital had reached HK$156 billion [Hong Kong dollars], about 6.02 percent of the total market capitalization of HK$2,300 billion. [all figures as published] With more and more mainland state-owned enterprises listing on the Hong Kong market and the continuous expansion of Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded listed companies, the total market value of Chinese- funded companies is estimated to account for 10 to 15 percent of the Hong Kong stock market's total value this year. The situation is heartening. Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded companies with a solid power base in the early 1980's were mainly the China Resources Group, China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation Company, China Travel Service, and the Bank of China Group. In the mid-1980's, the Yuehai Group and Huamin Group, under the direct authority of the Guangdong and Fujian provincial governments, started trading in property, finance, and tourism in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Company] and Beijing's Everbright Group were also building up business in Hong Kong. After years of development in Hong Kong, from the latter half of 1992 onward, these big corporations began floating their Hong Kong-based subsidiaries to raise more funds for business expansion and to enlarge their scale of operation. CITIC Pacific was prominent among these companies, becoming a composite share of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index in August 1992. Authoritative figures in Hong Kong economic circles hold that given the strong force behind Chinese-funded stocks, the growth potential for these stocks is enormous and their development prospects are considerable.
