They are now investing less in traditional politicians and turning to their own leaders in an attempt to reach the front line in national politics. "No middlemen," says Senator Albano Franco (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Sergipe), president of the National Confederation of Industry and one of the first businessmen to exchange private management for public administration 27 years ago. The legalization of business contributions to parties and candidates and the fears aroused by revelation of the bribery schemes headed by P.C. Farias and Joao Alves have made self-financing more attractive. "Since the managers proved to be incompetent and corrupt, the best thing for the businessman to do is get involved in hand-to-hand combat himself," says Antonio Fabio Ribeiro, president of the Brasilia Federation of Industries and a stockholder in Encol. In the homestretch of the race for party affiliation--the deadline was Sunday the 9th--the switching of people and parties was intense. At least four prominent business leaders made their choices at the end of the year. The president of the Minas Gerais Federation of Industries, Joao Alencar Gomes da Silva, landed in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], from where he may run for state governor. The former president of the Rio Grande do Sul Federation of Industries, Luiz Carlos Mandelli, joined the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] and is also expected to run for governor. Two other federation presidents--Fernando Bezerra (PMDB) of Rio Grande do Norte and Miguel de Souza (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]) of Rondonia--will seek seats in the National Congress. "We are encouraging our fellow businessmen to join, and we now have representatives in several parties," says Albano Franco happily. The bevy of businessmen includes the heir to a communications empire. Edson Queiroz Filho of Ceara, who is a stockholder in the Edson Queiroz Group, a 21-company conglomerate that expects to bill about $500 million this year, intends to run for the Senate. Queiroz, who is Tasso Jereissati's brother-in-law, president of the PSDB, and former governor of Ceara, founded the PP [Progressive Party] in his state. His decision to be a candidate is causing his rivalry with his brother-in-law to intensify even further. Queiroz is entering the scene with the strength of a group that controls the Green Seas System (the Globo Network's affiliate in the state), the DIARIO DO NORDESTE, and 23 radio stations. "The new candidacies by businessmen show that the latter were no longer able to solve their problems quietly through negotiations with the administration," says Deputy Flavio Rocha (Rio Grande do Norte), heir to the Guararapes textile group. He wants to be the PL [Liberal Party] candidate for president of the republic. Someone else noting the rush by businessmen to enter politics is the president of the Sao Paulo PFL [Liberal Front Party] and former minister of agriculture under Collor, Antonio Cabrera. With only three days left in which to join a party, Cabrera found that among the new party members in his state, there were 18 businessmen who wanted to run for federal deputy. One of them is Aires da Cunha, owner of Blue Life, the country's third-largest private health care group. As orphans of the PRN [National Reconstruction Party], several people who had once been part of Collor's troops went looking for parties that would help them fulfill their desire to return to public life. That was the case with former President Collor's friend and backer of the story about Operation Uruguay, businessman Luiz Estevao de Oliveira, who is now a candidate for district deputy in Brasilia. Although wanting to join the PSDB, he had to be content with the PP. Former Minister of Health Alceni Guerra, the victim of an unfounded accusation concerning fraud in the purchase of bicycles for sanitary agents, is considering an invitation to run for the Senate or even for governor of Parana on the PFL ticket. The invasion by businessmen is occurring at a time when career politicians are losing ground. Several of them are also showing discouragement. "I'm tired of this disgusting business," says Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB), who will leave the governor's palace in Ceara for Harvard University in the aristocratic State of Boston [as published] in the United States. If he can get a full scholarship, Ciro will spend 12 months studying economics and political science. After 36 consecutive years in office, Senator Jutahy Magalhaes (PSDB, Bahia) is also going to retire. His place will be taken by his son, Jutahy, Jr., former minister of social welfare. The PSDB also expects to say farewell to Senator Jose Richa (Parana). Defeated in his 1990 bid for state governor and thoroughly trounced in the 1993 congressional campaign, Richa has become discouraged and has already announced that he will not run in 1994. Because of all that, Congress is expecting to see more new faces than it ever has before. Only 40 percent of the congressmen managed to get reelected in 1986. The number fell to 32 percent in 1990. Governor Leonel Brizola (Rio de Janeiro) believes that 85 percent of the current Congress is going to be replaced. That change does not necessarily indicate a change in the ideological profile of the legislative branch. "Today's Congress is worse than yesterday's, and the one we get tomorrow will be worse than the one we have today," predicts Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul). Election Timetable The parties that may present candidates for president of the republic are the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], the PFL, the PL, the PMDB, the PSD [Democratic Social Party], the PRN, the PSDB, the PT [Workers Party], the PTB, the PP, and the PPR.
