The disclosure of this plan draws our attention. The relevant officials of the Ministry of National Defense [MND] say that this change was not made abruptly at that time but because the ROK and the United States felt the shortcomings of the negative operational concept in the sixties and seventies for the North Korean southward invasion, they gradually introduced the offensive operational concept of air-raid on and advance to the North Korean rear areas. The MND officials say that this has nothing to do with the present North Korean nuclear issue. Until the mid-seventies, the ROK and the United States had a negative operational concept against the North Korean southward invasion of abandoning Seoul, if unavoidable, and retreating to the area south of Seoul, and, taking step-by-step counter-attack actions when the U.S. reinforcement arrives and repelling the enemy to the area north of the truce line. The ROK side strongly suggested to the U.S. side on several occasions that Seoul not be abandoned. Accordingly, the operations plan changed in the mid-seventies to the effect that the North Korean advance should be checked in the area north of Seoul. In the early eighties, the old concept came under criticism calling for stronger punishment for war provokers, and the ROK-U.S. operations plan took on a more offensive nature incorporating the U.S. Air-Land Battle [as published] concept. The concept was that if North Korea wages a preemptive attack, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces would attack major facilities in the North Korean area with Air Force planes and special forces. As soon as large-scale reinforcement forces arrive from the U.S. mainland, the ROK-U.S. forces would make offensive operations, landing large-scale landing forces in the North Korean rear areas, thus dealing North Korea a serious blow. This strategy was developed from the mid-eighties to the early nineties, but the ROK and the United States could not establish a precise target as to what extent we should strike North Korea. The issue of "target" began to be discussed in 1990 when General RisCassi assumed the post of commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and began a fundamental review of the ROK-U.S. operations plan. In the discussion of this subject, the ROK and the United States differed in their views at one time. The ROK and the United States finally agreed in 1992 that they would occupy or isolate Pyongyang, decide on advancement north of Pyongyang in stages according to the situation, and proceed to attack North Korea just enough to demolish its regime and for the ROK to gain the initiative in reunification. According to this "new operational plan 5027," the ROK and the United States have established a 5-step scenario against possible southward invasion by North Korea. First, they will prevent war by deploying U.S. rapid deployment deterrent forces (FDO) [expansion unknown] on the Korean peninsula. Second, if a war takes place, they will deter North Korea's southward invasion north of Seoul and destroy strategic facilities at North Korea's rear. Third, they will annihilate North Korea's major combat capabilities and conduct large-scale landing operations while breaking through battle lines to advance northward. Fourth, they will isolate Pyongyang and place occupied areas of North Korea under their military rule. Fifth, they will achieve reunification of the Korean peninsula upon the ROK's initiative. Military officials say that these changes in the ROK-U.S. joint operations plan, both in name and reality, enables preparedness against a possible North Korean southward invasion, and if necessary, guarantees the destruction of the North Korean regime and reunification according to the ROK's initiative. The details of the changes which have only now been disclosed, are reported by the U.S. media as though a U.S. idea being realized based on its current hard line policy on the North Korean nuclear issue. The Defense Ministry officials regard the U.S. media's recent reports on this and policies to reinforce the ROK-based U.S. Forces, such as the deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, as a series of U.S. moves aimed at creating tension on the Korean peninsula, and they are keeping careful watch over the behavior of the U.S. Government and media.
