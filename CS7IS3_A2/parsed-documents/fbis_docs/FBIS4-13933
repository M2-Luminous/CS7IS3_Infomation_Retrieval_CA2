The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, and Mr. Mihoub Mihoubi, diplomatic adviser and official spokesman of the presidency of the Republic. In a statement to the radio about this meeting, the Yemeni envoy said: [Begin al-Dali recording] I was asked by brother 'Ali Salim al-Bidh, vice president of the Yemeni Presidential Council, to make this visit. I have a message related to the situation in Yemen and the recent developments it has witnessed, and also to the efforts made by Arab brothers in past months to overcome the crisis experienced by Yemen. This visit is also related to the stance of our brothers in Algeria toward these efforts. In fact, we found a very big response, in what we have heard, and a great eagerness for security and stability in Yemen, for Yemeni unity, and for the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in Amman. [end recording] Asked about the mediation the Arab Maghreb Union, chaired by Algeria, will undertake in an effort to solve the difference in the leadership of fraternal Yemen, Mr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali said: [Begin al-Dali recording] We consider that both in Algeria and outside Algeria we have brothers, so we do not use the word mediation. However, we consider that the Yemeni issue is Algerian, Maghreban, and Arab; consequently, their contribution will be a strong one. I would call it a strong contribution, not a mediation. We welcome every Arab effort to help Yemen get out of its present situation and ensure that it has more guarantees for future unity and stability. [end recording]
