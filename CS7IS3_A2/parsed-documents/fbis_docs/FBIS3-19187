In some cases it is not to blame, and in other cases it is to blame. The Majority is reprehensible when it stresses these failings. The Left, however, would be clumsy not to seize on them. However, politics is not simply a question of adroitness, or at least adroitness has its limits. Let us consider the example of youth and the unemployment crisis. It is quite legitimate for [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard -- even if he was unable to convince youth and could not solve the unemployment problem, and even if, being who he is, he has resorted to using vulgar arguments -- to criticize [Prime Minister] Balladur's policies. It is not acceptable, however, for him to draw fire and bitterness, and feed the flames of anger with his insidious remarks that combine the problems of secularity, unemployment, and the supposed censuring of freedom of expression. Everything precludes these actions: the nature of his responsibilities, his failures, and good will. Let us take another example, that of civil liberty. When Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand sensationally condemns the attacks on civil liberties by the current government, clearly accusing Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, although not naming him directly, of endangering democracy, she is parodying reality, overstepping her duties, and insulting her adversaries. France is clearly not a land of oppression. Mrs. Mitterrand does not occupy the post of judge, and the Majority has passed the laws that she is questioning. The similarity between these references is no coincidence. Naturally, it is hardly likely that the wife of the president of the Republic and the first secretary of the PS planned together to heap opprobrium on the Balladur government. However, it is not merely by chance that they seized on the same opportunities to fight the same battle with the same arguments on the same ground and with the same political objective. There is a common thread behind the cause they are defending. This thread is the disarray of youth. There are no holds barred in feeding this disarray, irrespective of the excesses and the harm that this could result in. It is the government's weak point. It is thus this weakness that they are attacking, with even the most trivial of weapons. Let us agitate the most malleable of armies, those people who are the most affected by the current hard times, and attack the enemy! The socialist Left was looking for this kind of clientele. Now it has found it. The Left is faltering: The Mitterrand generation will give way to the Rocard generation! Since they cannot prepare a political and ideological takeover campaign, they are restoring an inexhaustible issue -- youth -- under the banner of an inexhaustible myth -- liberty.
