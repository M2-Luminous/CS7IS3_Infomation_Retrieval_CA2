This is contained in an official message addressed to the Security Council by Yemeni UN Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ashtal. In the message, Yemen said it considers the call for convening a Security Council meeting to be interference in its internal affairs, which conflicts with Paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the UN Charter that says nothing in the charter justifies UN interference in affairs that are purely part of the sovereignty of any country, and that nothing in the charter stipulates that member states can call for a discussion of such issues.
