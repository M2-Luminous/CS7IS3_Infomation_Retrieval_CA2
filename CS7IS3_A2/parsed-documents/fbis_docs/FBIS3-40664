These were based on the controversial Dunkel proposals, and the prime minister is being pressed for answers. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], already angered by the jailing of its leaders, has gotten all the opposition parties together and has vehemently condemned India's decision to sign it. The consensus shown by the entire opposition in objecting to India's signing as a "sell out," is praiseworthy. However, this realization has come too late to the opposition parties. Rao government could not take a definite stand during the Uruguay Round of talks which were held among specially formed committees, away from administration's view. The developing nations had not devised a common approach and any secondary effort by India would have only met with failure. The opposition parties that are raising such a hue and cry did not propose even a single alternative then! Our representatives did not have any backing to present to Europe and to the U.S., possible disadvantages to India in signing the pact. One of the reasons U.S. dominated the Uruguay Rounds is that there was no political stability in India. V.P. Singh Government was busy securing its place and was unable to give GATT issues the serious attention they deserved. The Chandra Shekhar regime was interested only in extending its time in power, and our politicians also had to concentrate their energies on that. The Rao Government which has already subjugated itself to directives of major financial institutions in embarking on a more open trading system, could not address the true interests of India in Uruguay the way they should have been. Not a single political party is devoid of the blame of neglecting such serious issues of grave national consequences as multinational entry into our trade sector, etc., in preference to other less important matters. The opposition parties can only pride themselves for having frustrated the ruling party for sacrificing the country's sovereignty but no one can shirk the responsibility for allowing multinational authority over Indian indigenous agriculture, trade, and commerce.
