The International Computer Forum is an elite gathering of computer people -- tickets for the event are not on sale, you cannot just "walk in" off the street. Each year the International Computer Forum marks a stage in the country's progress toward the assimilation of modern information technology. This time around 600 computer industry leaders were registered in Moscow. Some of the ever-presents -- such as the famous "Borland" -- decided to miss out on this forum. On the one hand, this looks like a slight, but most often refusal is due to the fact that the leading computer firms in Russia already have a network of dealers and distributors, and they usually display only innovations at the Moscow forum. The International Computer Forum differs from the larger "Komtek" exhibition in that the forum is not a trade fair but a place to draw attention to your name. The practice of previous forums shows that invitations to the International Computer Forum are much in demand and are sold and resold at large "mark-ups." In the opinion of Mikhail Mishustin, chairman of the International Computer Club Board, the distinctive feature of Russia's computer market in 1994 will be the increasing activeness of managers who have been trained in the West. Talented programmers who have surprised their colleagues with their output play a secondary role, while the businessmen, who just five years ago could make some kind of a living by reselling simple Western computers, are quite overshadowed. These changes show that Russia, following the example of the developed countries, is gradually organizing a civilized information technology structure. The number of computers in Russia is currently put at 3 million "PC's," while the software market is valued at $350 million. Last year around 500,000 computers were sold in Russia -- still very few by the standards of the developed world. But attention is drawn to the increasingly widespread switch from 286's to more modern processors. The Fifth International Computer Forum was marked by the number of new boys in the computer world. The Banyan company, which has thrown down the gauntlet in the network operating systems market to the mighty Novell, was making its Moscow debut. "Entrepreneur of the Year" Dzherri Rodzhers [name as transliterated], president of the Cyrix firm, which destroyed Intel's long-standing monopoly in developing 386- and 486-compatible processors, will be coming to Moscow. The forum is particularly valuable for the participation of Sisko [name as transliterated] Systems, the world leader in the market for internetwork communications -- which Russia needs more than anything. It is clear from the list of participants that the International Computer Forum is seen by Western participants as an important springboard for the veritable war that is currently being waged in the market for central processors. The special events include the first presentation of certificates to the 100 most influential people in the Russian computer market -- whom we have now followed the developed countries in identifying. The "top 10" were also picked out. These included IZVESTIYA's hero -- Yevgeniy Veselov of "Mikroinform." Stepan Pachikov ("Paragraf") was named most influential person in the software sector, with Anatoliy Karachinskiy ("Ay-Bi-Es") getting the hardware award. The "top 10" includes seven Russians and three foreigners.
