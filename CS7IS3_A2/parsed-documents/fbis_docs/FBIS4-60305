The party said in a statement that it is considered a blatant violation of the Constitution of our Republic of Yemen and the legitimacy announced on 27 April 1993. The statement notes the RDP's rejection of all calls for secession and its support for and call on the forces of constitutional legitimacy not to be lenient with this rancorous separatist clique. The party said that its support for the forces of constitutional legitimacy stems from the party's adherence to Yemeni unity, which is considered the result of the efforts and struggle of all honest Yemeni strugglers. The party stressed that its stand is firm and clear in terms of safeguarding the national constants, particularly unity, democracy, and the achievements of the 16 September and 24 October revolutions. The RDP's statement urges brothers and friends to stand at the side of the legitimate leadership to preserve these achievements, particularly Yemeni unity. The statement notes that al-Bid's criminal attempts to destroy Aden and some southern and eastern governorates are a continuation of the destruction inflicted on brave Aden in the January events [reference to 13 January 1986] to satisfy his destructive whims and those of his clique. The statement urges all national and political forces and our masses to stand at the side of constitutional legitimacy and its leadership and to render all support for this leadership. This was issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party.
