He arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a private visit to discuss ways of cooperation between the RDC and Japan's largest opposition Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) and attend an international seminar on investment problems. He was due to meet with members of the LDP and Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership on Tuesday. "While recognising the existence of a territorial problem, we consider that any approaches to its solution should be based on the results of the Russo-Japanese summit talks in Tokyo in autumn last year," Gaydar pointed out. He expressed an opinion that the problem could be resolved only when public consensus develops in Russia and Japan on how that could be done. Touching upon the RDC's foreign contacts, Gaydar said the party intends to conclude cooperation agreements with a number of foreign parties, similar to that which was concluded with the Japanese Liberal-Democratic Party last week. "Strengthening political ties with those political forces abroad, which are interested in a normal development of Russia, is an important element of our calm work to overcome xenophobia in Russia and to counter ideas, which are being spread in the country by some of our political opponents, about some conspiracy against Russia and her isolation in the world," Gaydar said. "We attach much importance to developing contacts with Japan and regard the LPD as one of our serious and long-term partners," the RDC chairman pointed out. "The conclusion of an agreement with the LDP is not linked with hopes to get financial support from it," he said. "We may not permit ourselves to make use of financial support from foreign political parties and intend to build our relations with them on the basis of equal partnership," Gaydar said. The RDC chairman said "Russia will succeed in maintaining political stability within at least the next six months despite the existence of forces which are interested in destabilising the situation in the country".
