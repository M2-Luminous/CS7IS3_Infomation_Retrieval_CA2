According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman, a number of bilateral documents are expected to be signed during Jose Raul Mulino's visit. They will form a legal basis for cooperation and give a much needed impulse to Russian-Panamanian interaction in different spheres, he said. When ITAR-TASS asked whether recent frequent visits to Moscow by representativies of Latin American countires are coincidental or testify to the activization of Russia's Latin American foreign policy, Demurin noted that the Russian Foreign Ministry strives to be equally active and dynamical in all directions. "Being a great power, we cannot put on the brakes or step on the gas or dash off to one or the other region," he emphasised.
