There are indications that there has been a change in the U.S. immigration policy toward Cubans. We would like to hear details on this issue. [Castellon] Yes, good morning. This week, for the first time, U.S. authorities intercepted and returned a group of Cubans who were found at sea who were on their way to Florida from the Bahamas. Up until now, the policy of impeding groups of illegal aliens from arriving on U.S. territory had only been applied to Haitians and other foreign nationals but not to Cubans, who as everyone knows benefit from the 1966 law. This legislation permits any Cuban citizen to be admitted immediately once they reach U.S. territory despite the originating point of their voyage or the reasons for that trip. At the moment, this exclusive privilege is being challenged in Congress with a bill that seeks annulment of the privilege considering it discriminatory to other foreign citizens who are required to present evidence of their allegations of political persecution in their native land. The interception and return of these 19 Cuban immigrants to Bahamas by the U.S. Coast Guard is described by the MIAMI HERALD's 14 April editorial as a good attempt to make the U.S. immigration policy more consistent. According to the same editorial, under the new policy, Cubans will be returned if they come from a third country where they were established according to declarations from an official of the U.S. Administration who was not identified. With the pretext that there is already an immigration crisis with the Haitians in the Bahamas, the government of those islands criticized Washington's decision of returning the Cubans to the Bahamas and has refused to accept any other deportees. The editorial goes on to say that Cubans, Haitians, and other possible illegal aliens should be warned, through radio broadcasts and family members living in the United States, of the risks in traveling to U.S. coasts on fragile boats and rafts. The editorial also suggests that Washington be firm in breaking up immigrant smuggling networks, that it ask other governments to discourage illegal emigration, and not to expect other nations to give up their sovereign rights, as in the case of the Bahamian Government which rejected the return of Cubans to its territory. [Alonso] Yes, Marcos. But this is something strange especially when it regards Cuban citizens. I would like to hear your opinion on this change in policy by the U.S. Government. [Castellon] This is a complex issue because the U.S. immigration policy is something that is very difficult to understand -- it is very inconsistent. Many point out that it is full of inequalities and gives privileges to the Cubans. Coinciding with the request by a U.S. Congressmen that the United States invade Haiti and get rid of the military council that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 16 players of the Haitian soccer team asked for asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago and were rejected. These players say that if they return to Haiti they will be the object of political persecution. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government did not accept their request for asylum. This brings to mind the situation of Ponce, Puerto Rico, where deserters of the Cuban sports delegations to the Central American games, encouraged by anti-Castro groups, decided to stay. Those that decided to stay had the immediate protection of the U.S. Government without having to prove that they qualified for the condition of political refugee. On many occasions it has been pointed out that this difference in treatment between Cubans and Haitians, in addition to having political overtones, has aspects of racial discrimination. This is not surprising if one considers the results of a recent survey, which was published today, that says the U.S. black population is becoming more radical and pessimistic every day. This study was conducted by the University of Chicago. Half of those interviewed even support the formation of a national political party consisting only of blacks. Seventy-three percent doubt they will ever be able to see racial equality in their lifetime. A similar number believe that the legal and economic systems, and society in general in the United States, are not fair with black citizens. That is partly reflected in the U.S. immigration policy. [Alonso] Yes, that is very interesting. I believe Zenaida Costales has a question for you. [Costales] Good morning. I thank you for the help you give to the "Doing Radio" program. I was wondering if you could tell us about the treatment given to those who leave Cuba illegally and reach the United States. How are these people received? [Castellon] They are automatically admitted. When Cubans are seen in the Straits of Florida they are immediately helped. They are taken to Coast Guard bases and are quickly processed and are turned over to groups who give them support. They immediately become an object of press coverage and later become part of the general social current. At the beginning, depending on the position they held in Cuba, or if the circumstances of their arrival are dramatic, their arrival is used as an element of propaganda. One must examine their condition months later. Undeniably, many of them have relatives here and they adapt and progress in this society. But there is also an enormous quantity, who are not given as much press coverage, who months after arriving are still waiting for promises of work and are still having problems with housing. There are some who are even begging for money on the streets. There also many, many of whom I have met and whom have not been given enough coverage, who regret coming to the United States and they miss their relatives and their homeland. This is a reality that is very shocking. [Alonso] Marcos, we thank you for your opinion and your cooperation.
