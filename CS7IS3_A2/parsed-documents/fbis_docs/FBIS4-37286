The visit coincided with significant military victories for the government forces against the rebels in southern Sudan, in which the government forces recaptured the city of Kajo Kaji and 12 other cities and villages. It has been reported that the U.S. officials who now visit Sudan have begun to change their old threatening tone and talk about improvement of relations. A highly placed Sudanese source has told AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI that the change of tone came after heated and explosive dialogues between these envoys, including Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau, and President al-Bashir and Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, the well-known Islamic figure and secretary general of the Arab and Islamic People's Congress. The source said that in one of these dialogues Dr. al-Turabi told a U.S. envoy that by pursuing a course hostile to Sudan and its Islamic government and by criticizing the application of the Shari'ah [Islamic law], the United States is moving into quicksands dangerous to it and its interests. Dr. al-Turabi made that remark after the U.S. envoys expressed concern about Christian human rights in Sudan and about violation of human rights and implementation of the Shari'ah. The source added that Dr. al-Turabi told one of the U.S. envoys that Sudan is concerned about the violation of black rights in the United States and about the persecution of American Muslims; and that he reminded him that the white Americans had killed all Indian males and taken their women prisoners, and that what Sudan is doing now to preserve its territorial integrity was what George Washington did when he liberated the United States and safeguarded its territorial integrity. Dr. al-Turabi told the envoy that some U.S. officials did not even know what Sudan was, so why this hostile attitude toward it? He added that when he was foreign minister he once met President Ronald Reagan during President Numayri's visit to the United States, and he made great efforts to explain Sudan's location to President Reagan who thought it was adjacent to India. The highly placed source said that Dr. al-Turabi protested strongly when President Bill Clinton received the British author Salman Rushdie, who is of Indian origin. He said that receiving a writer who offended the Islamic faith and the prophet was a provocation to the entire Islamic nation confirming a deep-seated grudge against Muslims. The U.S. Government had addressed a strongly worded ultimatum to the Khartoum government accusing it of terrorism and of opening training bases for extremist organizations. President 'Umar al-Bashir's reply to that ultimatum was that he told the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum that Sudan would defend itself against any U.S. interference and that what the Americans faced in Somalia and before that in Vietnam would be a "picnic" compared with what they would face in Sudan. AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI has learned that Washington's recent change of tone came after it became certain that threatening language is futile with Sudanese officials. It seems that the Sudanese Government has begun to react positively to the new U.S. line. President al-Bashir told U.S. Envoy Wells that his government is committed to any U.S. move to settle the dispute in southern Sudan peacefully. He also said that threats of blockade against Sudan would not help but would complicate the problem.
