FR940202-0-00081 FR940202-0-00006 (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the rule in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Example. Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a single fixed rate_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, X purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a variable rate debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2001, and that has a stated principal amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for payments of interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. For the first 4 years, the interest rate is 4 percent, compounded annually, and for the last 2 years the interest rate is the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, plus 200 basis points. On January 1, 1995, the value of 1-year LIBOR is 2 percent, compounded annually. In addition, assume that on January 1, 1995, the variable rate debt instrument has approximately the same fair market value as an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years. (ii) Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. Under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as if it provided for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the variable rate debt instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that has an issue price and stated principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for interest payments of $2,000 for the first 4 years and $4,000 for the last 2 years. (iii) Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest. Under ยง1.1273&hyph;1, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of $4,000 because a portion (200 basis points) of each interest payment in the last 2 years is not a qualified stated interest payment. The $4,000 of OID is allocable over the 6-year term of the debt instrument under ยง1.1272&hyph;1. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, the difference between the $4,000 payment made in the first 4 years and the $2,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in those years is an adjustment to qualified stated interest. In addition, any difference between the amount actually paid in each of the last 2 years and the $4,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is an adjustment to qualified stated interest. (f) Special rule for certain reset bonds. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph (f) provides a special rule for a variable rate debt instrument that provides for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial interval, and provides that on the date immediately following the end of the initial interval (the effective date) the stated interest rate will be a rate determined under a procedure (such as an auction procedure) so that the fair market value of the instrument on the effective date will be a fixed amount (the reset value). Solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as_ (i) Maturing on the date immediately preceding the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value; and (ii) Reissued on the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value. ยง1.1275&hyph;6T [Removed] Par. 16. Section 1.1275&hyph;6T is removed as of February 2, 1994. ยง1.6050H&hyph;2T [Removed] Par. 17. Section 1.6050H&hyph;2T is removed as of February 2, 1994.
