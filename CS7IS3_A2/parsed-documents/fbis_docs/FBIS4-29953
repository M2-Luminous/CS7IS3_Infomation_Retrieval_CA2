It will examine how deregulation measures -- such as reviewing the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, liberalizing the information and communications sector, and easing rules on housing construction -- will contribute to economic growth and how these will affect consumer prices. By demonstrating deregulation's effectiveness with specific figures, the agency aims to provide a basis for promoting deregulation. It plans to inaugurate a research group composed of intellectuals as early as next week so that it will be able to compile the results of its assessment during July. Private sector think tanks have conducted many surveys on the scale of the market and the possibility of market expansion when deregulation is promoted in each industry. Meanwhile, it is rare for the government to study comprehensively the effects of deregulation on the economy. The government plans to compile external economic measures at the end of June which would include deregulation measures and macroeconomic policies. The EPA intends to examine whether the deregulation measures to be included in the external economic measures will be effective in causing economic growth. Its assessment is expected to center on the housing, information, and distribution sectors. The agency aims to provide specific figures on how much consumer prices will be lowered through a review of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, and on how effective the liberalization of the information and communications industry will be in improving the employment situation and attaining economic growth. The EPA thinks that if companies' productivity and international competitiveness are enhanced through deregulation, "the Japanese economy's latent power for growth will be strengthened." In order to promote deregulation as early as possible, the agency plans to compile the results of its assessment in about a month, after the research group decides on the items to subject to analysis.
