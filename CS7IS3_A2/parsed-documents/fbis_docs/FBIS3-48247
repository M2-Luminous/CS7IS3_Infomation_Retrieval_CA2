Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet secretary (in charge of administrative affairs), who stands at the top of the bureaucracy, remained in office through the change in political regimes and has supported the prime minister's office during the turbulent year. While, on one hand, the bureaucrats' leadership is supposed to have been strengthened under the new government, they feel they are facing a serious situation where Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Representative Secretary Ichiro Ozawa proposed his plan to revise the National Diet Law, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was shaken by the personnel change taking place. I interviewed the deputy chief cabinet secretary to look back at the year 1993, and to let him talk about the politics, the bureaucrats, and the tasks of Kasumigaseki [the bureaucracy]. (Note: At the conference of the coalition parties' representatives held on 12 October, Ozawa proposed his "fundamental plan to revise the National Diet Law" as follows: (1) The present system under which the bureaucrats are required to make explanations at the Diet on behalf of the government shall be abolished and politicians will make the explanations; (2) Two or three parliamentary vice ministers shall be assigned to each ministry as vice ministers and; (3) several Diet members shall be assigned to each ministry as parliamentary councilors. Repulsion against this plan spread among the bureaucrats as it means that the initiative in making policies is to be transferred from bureaucrats to politicians). [Asahina] What is your impression, as an insider, about the change in political regime? [Ishihara] Personally, I felt I should resign, but I was strongly requested [to remain in the post] by Prime Minister (Morihiro) Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary (Masayoshi) Takemura who are intimate friends of mine. As I felt it was a civil servant's duty to help the new government make a smooth start, I decided, after consulting with (Kiichi) Miyazawa, then prime minister, and (Masaharu) Gotoda, then vice prime minister, to stay. I think I should hand over my post to someone after the new government makes steady headway. An adequate time for me to resign may be when the political reform bills are approved. While there is a saying that a samurai is not supposed to serve two lords, I have served five lords. This is a rather exceptional case, and my philosophy as a government official makes me feel very uncomfortable. Fortunately, however, there was not much difference in the key policies of the new government as it succeeded the fundamental national policies without modification, and my conscience did not feel much guilt. [Asahina] Can the same thing be said about the rice issue? [Ishihara] I think the decision would have been almost the same no matter who was prime minister. It would have been impossible for our country alone to indignantly leave the conference. The situation was literally the same when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in the past. We are not allowed to withdraw from international cooperation. [Asahina] What about the policymaking procedures? [Ishihara] There has been considerable change in that respect. Under the LDP government, the party decided key policies, which, in most cases, were accepted by the government. Under the new government, it seems that policies are being made with both sides acting on equal grounds, or, through consultation between the coalition parties and the government. [Asahina] Is such a procedure creating a bureaucrat-dominant structure? [Ishihara] It is true that each ministry is beginning to gain confidence. They try to frame a policy with the responsibility of presenting it to the coalition parties for discussion, and, as a general trend, the policy adopted considerably reflects the original idea. [Asahina] What about intervention by the Zoku-giin [Diet members having strong influence on particular ministries and agencies]? [Ishihara] It has decreased. While government officials are transferred in two or three years, Zoku-giin remain in their post for many years and, therefore, are very familiar with the internal affairs of the particular ministries. Though their existence has its merits, it also has its demerits, as it tends to create collusive relations with business circles. [Asahina] Is there no resistance to the deregulation proposed by the Hosokawa government? [Ishihara] Although I do not think the proposal is really welcomed by all ministries and agencies, they have become very cooperative. When I asked all the ministries and agencies to report the items to be removed, I was thinking there would be about 20 or 30 items at best. However, they have come up with as many as 94 items. Very drastic deregulations were also included in the reports. In the past, even if we tried to persuade government officials, they were unable to persuade the Zoku-giin and, in many cases, they used to refuse the proposal saying: "The party will not approve." The atmosphere has changed to some extent. [Asahina] How about decentralization? [Ishihara] The prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary are totally in favor of decentralization. Ozawa is also in favor of decentralization. Although each ministry has its own opinion concerning the individual proposals, and while certain ministries directly opposed decentralization for the reason that "even if the authority is transferred to local governments, they are not able to fully exercise it", they recently tend to refrain from expressing their opposition. It seems that the necessary conditions to rapidly accelerate decentralization in the future are being prepared. [Asahina] What is your opinion on Ozawa's plan? [Ishihara] Ozawa's plan is creating serious shock and anxiety among all the ministries and agencies. Leading officials, in particular, are taking the plan seriously. It is an established procedure that Diet members hold discussions at the national Diet, and not government officials. However, the leading officials are afraid that if politicians are assigned to the respective bureaus of the ministries and agencies to take part in framing policies as parliamentary councilors, the administration's neutrality might be hurt since making policy and executing policy are like two sides of a coin. [Asahina] Is that all? [Ishihara] Elite bureaucrats devote their every spare moment working for low pay because they find their lives worth living in that they can realize their ideals by consistently playing a role from the time they frame the policies until they are put into practice. They are afraid that, under the Ozawa plan, the officials may be degraded as subordinate workers. As we see in the case of the United States, the officials of bureau director-class and above have to leave their posts when the President leaves his office and, therefore, they can not take part in making important policies. Under such circumstances, it is not possible to secure capable persons. In the United States, all the important posts such as bureau directors are being occupied by lawyers and other persons. All the ministries are feeling serious anxiety over the possibility that the most important portion of the administrative work, which, in Japan, is being performed by the bureaucrats as lifetime work, might be transferred to politicians. It Is Difficult To Comment on the "Controversial Personnel Affair" in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [Asahina] Is it not considered democratic for politicians elected by the people to have more power than officials? [Ishihara] In the prewar days when party politics were flourishing with Minseito and Seiyukai competing with one another for political power, it was said that even the chief of a police station was transferred when a political regime changed. After the war, as it is impossible for government workers to devote themselves without anxiety, to their duties under such a system, the existing public service system was established. In both a good and bad sense, a proper order in the respective ministries and agencies has been established. Persons who are capable of performing their duties efficiently, and who are good at managing their followers, are expected to become leading officials in due course. Certain officials are afraid that the most important portion of the existing system as I have just explained might be changed if politicians are assigned to the respective bureaus giving a strong influence of the political power to the personnel affairs. [Asahina] Is it that they are afraid the minister of international trade and industry may press a bureau director to resign? [Ishihara] Well, I think the incident that took place at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is a problem of a different nature. I find it quite difficult to comment on the problem. To me, it is a personnel administration problem within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and it does not seem proper to discuss the matter, as a whole, as a cabinet problem.... [ellipses as printed]. [Asahina] Should promoting an officer who is to run for an election be strictly criticized? [Ishihara] It is quite hard for me to comment as I am not familiar with the facts. Yet, I do not think the treatment of personnel at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was very unfair. Although I think the ministry must have followed a reasonable procedure, I do not have any concrete knowledge of the situation. I can not comment as a member of the prime minister's office as doing so would create considerable influence.
