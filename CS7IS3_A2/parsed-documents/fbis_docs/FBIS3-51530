Alarcon pointed out that the goal of the Cuban Parliament at the Work Centers is not to spread the same idea throughout the country, but rather to expand it and really put it into practice, effectively managing to streamline the nation's internal finances. (Jose Marrero Camacho), president of the Pinar del Rio Assembly of the People's Government, explained to the union leaders that in the province, for the purpose of eliminating economic problems, it is more effective to raise production efficiency than to raise the price of products. Theft that increases costs; a lack of monitoring of the workforce; and leaving one's job during the day to stand in line or to take care of personal problems were examples presented in Pinar del Rio as affecting the nation's internal economy. During this meeting with provincial union leaders, with a view to the parliamentary assemblies at the work centers, it was suggested that every work group administer its own budget, and that the work group especially demand trustworthy accounting. Deputy (Maria Celia Santana) suggested that no personnel rosters handed down from above be accepted. Others suggested eliminating inappropriate egalitarianism [el igualitarismo] and paternalism. A tax on salaries was amply discussed. CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal said profitability and efficiency should be at the center of these discussions, with a view to solving problems.
