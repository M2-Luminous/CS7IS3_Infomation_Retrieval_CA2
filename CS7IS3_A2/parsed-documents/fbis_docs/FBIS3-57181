Mikhaylov by Vladimir Gubarev; place and date not given: "Enthusiastic Uranium Deals. Clinton Has 'Donated' $12 Billion to Russia"] [Text] The Moscow meeting between the presidents of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine has prompted a number of rumors. In Kiev Kravchuk's opponents are claiming that Russia "did well out of the uranium deal" whereas the Ukrainian president was "sold short." Some people in the United States are saying that Clinton "gave away" $12 billion to Russia -- this is the amount it is proposed to pay for uranium destined for U.S. nuclear electric power stations, which will be obtained from our nuclear warheads. Finally, "joyous" hopes have arisen in the Russian Government: The word there is that U.S. dollars will now come flooding into our country.... I was keen to ask the following questions in an interview with Russian Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov: [Gubarev] How did Ukraine lose out by this deal? [Mikhaylov] The level of Ukraine's security has increased -- so in fact Ukraine has benefited. Some of the reprocessed uranium from the nuclear weapons will go back to Ukraine in the form of fuel rods for the reactors of nuclear power stations. You must bear in mind that an extremely critical situation has developed in Ukraine regarding weapons and their storage and servicing. The weapons which have been delivered to us are very dangerous -- scheduled maintenance has not been carried out, nor have they been serviced. I will not beat about the bush, I am very worried by the weapons situation there -- you simply cannot play around with nuclear warheads! It must be clearly understood: Ukraine cannot be a nuclear power -- neither the technical nor any other conditions exist there. Moreover, if Russia were not a nuclear power, in present conditions we too would be unable to build weapons or to service them at the appropriate level.... Quite honestly, I do not understand how people can play political games with nuclear weapons. I am convinced that the agreement signed in Moscow has saved Ukraine from new "Chernobyls." [Gubarev] What have the Americans gained? [Mikhaylov] They have made several billion dollars on this contract. Basically, U.S. uranium-235 enrichment plants are defective. Compared with our plants, they are obsolete and the technology is substandard. Their enrichment plants are about 20 times less efficient than ours in terms of electricity consumption. Therefore the Americans are closing down their enterprises and our fuel is going to their nuclear electric power stations. Incidentally, there are approximately 100 reactor units in the United States. The government is basically a "middleman" now, it is reselling our fuel for nuclear electric power stations. I think it will make about $3 billion on this contract. [Gubarev] What about Russia? [Mikhaylov] The contract benefits us. But not in the financial sense. First, the process of dismantling weapons is very expensive -- according to expert estimates, it works out at $30,000-100,000. The arithmetic is simple, and therefore you can see that "fat profits" will not be coming our way.... But for me the important thing lies elsewhere: This contract enables us to maintain Russia's nuclear industry, retain our cadres, and keep our scientific centers. In addition, the world will become a safer place: There are currently too many weapons at nuclear storage facilities. I am telling you this in all seriousness, since all my life I have been involved in developing nuclear weapons.... But I would like to reassure our fellow citizens: There is quite enough uranium in Russia to fully ensure supply to our nuclear power industry and weapons complex for many decades to come.
