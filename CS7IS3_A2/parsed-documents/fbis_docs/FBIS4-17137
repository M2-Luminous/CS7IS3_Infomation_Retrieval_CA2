It is related to the fighting in the front-line areas and the measures that are required in that regard. It is common knowledge that the Armenian military forces moved on 9 and 10 April to intensify their aggression and attacks on Azerbaijan's territory and our positions on the front lines. They have maintained their attacks until now. We asked that talks be held to end the attacks. It is common knowledge that I appealed to Azerbaijan's people through the radio and television network on 12 April. Furthermore, I appealed to the Armenian leaders, the Armenian people, the Armenian and Azerbaijani citizens in Daghlyk [Nagorno] Karabakh, the international community, the CIS leaders, and international organizations to inform them about the situation. I stressed that Azerbaijan demands that the attacks be halted, peace talks be held, and the necessary agreement be reached. The international community and foreign countries reacted favorably to my appeal. Regrettably, the Armenian side and the Armenian military forces have maintained their claims and tried to distort the situation. They have been trying to blame Azerbaijan for the attacks. It is common knowledge that the CIS heads of state held a summit in Moscow on 14 and 15 April. I held talks with President Boris Yeltsin during the summit. I also held talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin; Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev; several CIS heads of state; and President Levon-Ter Petrosyan. I made an official speech on 15 April. That speech has been broadcast by the television networks and published in the press. You are already aware of it. I stressed that the CIS cannot remain indifferent toward the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In particular, it must take concrete measures to obstruct the Armenian military forces' latest attacks. A debate was held on my proposals. Later, a joint communique by the CIS heads of state was approved. That, too, has been published in the newspapers. It said that the CIS heads of state have considered the fact that the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have expressed support for a cease-fire agreement. Yes, I expressed support for a cease-fire agreement. Other views also were expressed. You are already aware of them. However, regardless of the joint communique by the CIS heads of state, the Armenian military sub-units fired on Azerbaijan's positions and attacked them from various directions on 15 and 16 April. Serious and bloody fighting took place yesterday, last night, and today. All that has shown that the Armenian leaders have rejected our peace initiatives. Although they purport to agree, they continue to maintain their approach, which is aimed at forcing Azerbaijan to accept an agreement which will be in their favor. You have been informed through the television reports that I expressed my views on the very recent Armenian attacks during the closed session of the CIS heads of state. A debate was held on the matter. Journalists asked me and President Ter-Petrosyan to comment on the matter during the press conference that was held after the summit. I briefly explained the situation. However, President Ter- Petrosyan said that Armenia is not involved in the war and that the fighting is between Azerbaijan and Daghlyk Karabakh. Furthermore, he stressed that Armenia is prepared to sign Russia's [peace] plan together with all the participants of the CIS summit. However, the question is as follows: What right does Armenia have to sign that plan if it is not a party in the war? Obviously, the Armenian officials have exposed their approach. All that may be regarded as an interesting development. However, not for us. What is important for us is the maintenance of our present positions and the defense of our republic's territory. Regrettably, I wish to reiterate that we have suffered severely from the unending Armenian attacks. We have lost many people. Bloody clashes took place in several residential areas yesterday. Some of them were lost and then taken back. The situation changes every day. Therefore, establishing what goes on is impossible. However, it is common knowledge that the Armenian military forces have launched very strong attacks. That is a fact. We must also admit that their attacks have been at a very professional level. Meanwhile, we have been informed from the front-line areas that those attacks have not been organized only by the Armenian military forces. Observations indicate that foreign forces have been involved in the organization and launching of those attacks. That state of affairs has greatly exacerbated the situation in the front-line areas. I must also stress on the basis of the information I have received that the Azerbaijan military sub-units have retaliated against the serious and devastating attacks appropriately. They are bleeding and dying to become martyrs in the effort to defend the homeland. Of course, they have been confronted with difficulties. They have been forced to withdraw in various places. Nevertheless, they have continued to defend our territory. I was informed this morning that Ferhat Askerov, who was named a national hero in view of his services during the fighting in Shusha in 1992, was martyred while heroically fighting to defend Sumu in Agdamskiy Rayon last night. But, there are others as well. I have mentioned his name because he was a renowned national hero. Many of our people have been martyred while fighting to defend our homeland's territory. That is very natural. That state of affairs is an indication of our people's and Army's heroic nature and courage. It is also an indication of the fact that our people can block the Armenian attacks more effectively and skillfully in the future. I urge you to observe a moment of silence to commemorate the memory of the sons and citizens of Azerbaijan who have been martyred in the latest fighting. [silence observed to commemorate martyrs; Aliyev continues] God bless their souls. I convey my condolences to the families of all our martyrs. I wish to assure them on behalf of Azerbaijan's people that they will never be forgotten. They will always be remembered by Azerbaijan's people as heroes. Their heroic services will strengthen and elevate Azerbaijan's people and create the basis for the safeguarding of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Regrettably, I also wish to stress that some of our citizens have acted in a cowardly way and deserted from the front lines. Some of them fled to save their lives. Regrettably, that state of affairs is still continuing. That is a situation that weakens our defenses and keeps us from retaliating against the Armenian attacks in an appropriate way. Undoubtedly, no one will treat the cowards and deserters respectfully. Furthermore, no one will treat their families and relatives respectfully. They will always be hated by the community. I am convinced that they will be brought to account in accordance with our laws. I feel the need to reiterate a point that I stressed in my radio and television speech on 12 April. We have serious problems in the effort we are making to organize our army and find the necessary officers and men for the military units. That is due to the inefficient maintenance of the state of mobilization and to the cases of desertions from the military units, that is, in addition to desertions from the front lines. The matter was seriously discussed during the meetings that were held by the leaders of the rayon executive authorities and military commissars in Beylagan and Barda on 11 and 12 April. We gave serious instructions to the leaders of the rayon executive authorities and administrative organs to strengthen their struggle against such cases. The main task of each and every individual and the officials in particular is to contribute toward the effort made to provide men and officers for the military units, establish discipline, and obstruct desertions. Another more serious task does not exist. Nothing can be done in connection with the pending economic and political measures and nothing can be done to meet the wishes of the people because we shall be defeated if we fail to defend our territory. The enemy forces will advance to occupy the remaining part of our territory. Who will survive after that is unknown. In view of that, I am obliged to reiterate that what I have mentioned is our main task and problem. The developments that took place in the front-line areas on 15, 16, and 17 April indicate that we have failed to change that state of affairs. We face a serious situation at the present time. We have made several peace initiatives. We have had recourse to the CIS. The CIS issued an important statement on 15 April that noted that the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to immediately implement a cease-fire agreement. However, the Armenian military forces launched strong attacks against Azerbaijan's positions on the same day. Apparently, the peace initiatives have failed to yield results. President Boris Yeltsin emphatically agreed in our private talks and in the general convocations we had later that a cease-fire agreement has to be imposed. He emphatically asked me and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to move to end the shooting. President Yeltsin also said that he would even visit Azerbaijan and Armenia to help us resolve the matter if we do not object. However, the strong attacks by the Armenian military forces on 15, 16, and 17 April, that is, shortly after the talks we had with President Yeltsin, showed that the Armenians do not attach importance to talks and statements. They only wish to pursue their aggressive intentions and maintain their aggressive policies. We have appealed to the international organizations. My appeal was conveyed to them through our channels on 12 April. It was conveyed to the UN organization, the UN Security Council, the CSCE, and all the heads of state. However, the Armenian aggressors have not drawn any conclusion from the developments. They have maintained their aggressive and occupationist policies and their activities within the framework of those policies. Considering that state of affairs, our most important and urgent task is to establish our Army, provide the necessary manpower for our military units, help the Army, and stop desertions. How many of you are here in this meeting hall? How many of you can sincerely say that you have effectively fulfilled that task? I have not been able to see anyone who has done that in this meeting hall. Everyone believes that others must fulfill that task but whether he himself does so does not matter. Therefore, I wish to ask: Why are we trying to defend our homeland? Why should Azerbaijan continue to exist? When are we going to rid ourselves of Armenia's aggression? When are we going to guarantee the defense of our people? We have discussed all those matters. However, considering the fact that the necessary result has not been achieved, I have decided to invite you to attend this extraordinary meeting. We do not need a lot of time. I do not know how things are for others, but each and every moment is very important for us. So, we must hold substantial talks in this meeting hall. We must do everything we can today, tomorrow, and in the next few days to see to it that the requirements of the state of mobilization in the Republic are quickly fulfilled. We must establish new military units from our reserves. We must also help the Army in other respects. We must take the necessary measures in the front-line areas. I was informed from the front lines last night that the Barda Battalion's troops fled in the vicinity of Terter. I was forced to call the executive authority in Barda to ask why the men from that rayon fled. Barda and Terter are so close to each other that there is nowhere to go. I was informed by the head of the executive authority a few hours later that he went to the area and instructed his men to return to their posts. Why has that situation come to pass? Why should the head of an executive authority run here and there to collect his men from this or that town in the night? However, that is not the only case. I have conveyed my views to you on our heroic fighters and martyrs, particularly on Ferhat Askerov, who became a national hero in Shusha. The deserters have defamed and dishonored Azerbaijan's people and worsened our present situation. In view of that, I believe that we must discuss the concrete measures we need at the present time. The matters that should be discussed are crystal clear. However, I wish to outline the tasks to be fulfilled: First, I wish to stress that the quarterly task related to the military call-up must be fulfilled. That task requires that the head of the executive authority, military commissar, chief of police, procurator, and head of the state security administration in each and every rayon, city, and locality personally control every issue, including the fulfillment of the quarterly task of the military call-up. Fulfilling that task does not mean that you will go and transfer the matter in question to the military commissar's office and then come back to report that you have fulfilled your task. No, that is not the way to fulfill your duties. You are responsible. You will see to it that recruits apply to the assembly points. You will follow the way they are drafted in the assembly points. Furthermore, you will control how they fulfill their military obligations in the military ranks for some time. I do not wish to make calls in the future to say that the Barda Battalion, Koykey Battalion, Mingechaur Battalion, and this or that battalion have abandoned their positions. I do not want any official to inform me two or three days later that he has done what was necessary. That is your obligation. You must always keep your duties in mind. You must follow the men from your rayons to establish the way they serve in the military forces. I received a call before I left for Moscow. It informed me that the Khachmas Battalion in Agdamskiy Rayon dispersed and fled. I called the head of the Khachmas Executive Authority at 0100 in the morning. I forced him to go to Agdamskiy Rayon to reorganize his men. Is that my job? Should I be doing that? Why do we have officials serving as heads of executive authorities if I have to instruct or force them to fulfill their duties? Therefore, you are responsible not only to fulfill the procedures required for the conscription of recruits but also to see to it that the conscripted recruits report to serve in the military units they are assigned to. You must follow the way they serve. That is your task until this state of affairs ends. Undoubtedly, each and every rayon will be instructed in that regard. However, I wish to appeal to the executive authorities, leading officials, and the esteemed people of the occupied rayons as follows: The people of your rayons have become refugees. They are living in various areas. Many of them are unemployed. Instructions must be given to those rayons because they had many young men. They must join the military units and make an effort to liberate their occupied lands. I do not agree with the view that they will have to fight to liberate other rayons. All the Republic's citizens are equally responsible for the defense of Azerbaijan's territory, regardless of the city or rayon they come from. All the citizens are expected to fulfill their patriotic duty in the same way. Regarding the occupied rayons, I wish to say that the young men from them who are unemployed must join the military ranks to defend Azerbaijan's territory. I believe that that will be an honorable duty for them. That is the second issue. Let me reiterate that you are responsible for the work in the call-up of recruits and matters related to the mobilization. In fact, all the rayon and city organizations are responsible together with you. That task has to be fulfilled. Meanwhile, the law enforcement organs must seriously work to establish those who avoid the mobilization and the call-up for conscription. The military commissar's office has proposed that individual centers be established to carry out the work. That system was applied in the past. However, it was not successful. In fact, it led to negative developments from time to time. Therefore, I believe that that is not an appropriate system. Let me stress that the district police inspectors are well aware of the people in the areas they serve. They are well aware who does what, who is employed or unemployed, and who avoids conscription. They are well aware of all that. Therefore, our police organs in particular must concern themselves with the work to be carried out. That also applies to the procuracy organs. Serious and urgent measures must be taken against those who avoid the requirements of the mobilization regime and the call-up for conscription. The people must be urgently informed about the measures. The number of deserters has increased. We have discussed that many times. The duty of the rayon and city executive authorities and their leading officials must be to establish the deserters in each and every rayon, district, and city and return them to the military forces. Serious work must be carried out in that regard. I have established a deadline for the mobilization and call-up procedures. The requirements of the call-up for conscription must be fulfilled in three days and those of the mobilization in five days. We have allowed 10 days for the return of the deserters to their units. All the deserters must be forced to return to their units in 10 days. I wish to reiterate that charges will not be brought against the deserters who return to their posts. Very serious measures must be taken against those who fail to do so in 10 days. The number of positive cases in that regard are not few. For example, I can recall the meeting I had with Colonel Elburus Orudzh oglu on 13 April, that is, after my appeal to the people through radio and television on 12 April. He informed me that 100 deserters returned to their units to serve and fight after my appeal. What I mean is that our life is not full of only negative developments. We also have many positive developments. However, we do not mention them often much because our general situation is unfavorable. I was very happy to be informed of the situation by Colonel Elburus Orudzh oglu 24 hours after my appeal. I agree that 100 men is not a large force. However, they wished to correct the mistake they made. They rushed to rejoin their military units on the front lines. They joined the fighting. That was a move worthy of respect and attention. That was not the only case. There were many more. Therefore, serious work has to be carried out in 10 days. The deserters must be returned to their units. The matter requires serious attention. The procuracy and other investigation organs must take serious measures to bring the deserters who fail to return in 10 days to account. I am convinced that our procuracy and judicial organs will effectively and accurately apply the laws and the provisions of the Republic's criminal code. I am also convinced that the work they carry out will create the conditions we need to change our general situation. I wish to particularly outline the work to be carried out by the military commissars. You have observed that I have assigned all these tasks to the leaders of the executive authorities, the police, procuracy, and security organs, and the military commanders. Actually, the matter mainly concerns the military commissars. They must concern themselves with that work. However, we have said several times that the military commissars have not been able to successfully fulfill their duties. In fact, they do not wish to do so because of certain reasons. In view of that, I wish to stress that I am not satisfied with the work of the military commissars. The Republic's military commissar has disclosed in this meeting hall that a criminal investigation has been initiated against several military commissars. I wish to urge that the work in that regard be quickly carried out and the people be informed of their mistakes. Considering the need to establish discipline and law and order in that field, I have decided to take action as of today. That is as follows: The appointment and discharge of the military commissars must be subject to the approval of the presidential apparatus. The matter was transferred to the Defense Ministry. Regrettably, serious shortcomings have been allowed by the Defense Ministry on that matter until now. Therefore, I will instruct the presidential apparatus to study the situation of all the military commissars and advise me as to which military commissar can or cannot work in the future. That information must be conveyed to me in 10 days. I will decide on the matter. Undoubtedly, I will do so on the basis of your detailed reports. You will establish who can or cannot work in 10 days. I will instruct the defense minister today to comply with that rule. I will instruct that military commissars be neither appointed nor discharged without the consent of the presidential apparatus and that the research be carried out in 10 days. Undoubtedly, the research must be carried out in cooperation with the Defense Ministry. However, I wish to recommend that the president's adviser also participate in that process. Speaking in this meeting hall, the Republic's military commissar has expressed his opinion on the work of several military commissars. I have received information that the work of Lieutenant Colonel Amirov Gusayn Miral oglu, military commissar of Dzhelalabadskiy Rayon; Major Rakhimov Vadim Ferman oglu, military commissar of Kuba Rayon; and Lieutenant Colonel [first name indistinct] Orudzh Ferhad oglu, military commissar of Masally Rayon, has been very unsatisfactory. As such, they have been unable to fulfill their duties. I am removing them from their posts as of this moment. Furthermore, I am instructing Minister of Defense Mamedov to issue orders for their removal from their posts in accordance with my instructions in two hours. Send them to the front-line areas. Complaints have been made against the work of the police organs. We have received information from several rayons from time to time that the police organs disobey the executive authority and that the head of the executive authority is unable to control them. We have also received information that arguments take place between the procuracy and that the police organs and the head of the executive authority are unable to resolve this or that problem. All that undermines discipline and law and order and worsens the situation. We cannot accept such a state of affairs. Therefore, I wish to underline the following: The head of the rayon executive authorities are the representatives of the president. They are accountable to the president on every development in the rayons. Therefore, all the rayon organs are subordinate to the heads of the rayon executive authorities and they must work together. However, that does not mean that the heads of the rayon executive authorities can do anything they like. No, that is not so. I am asking for businesslike relations between the heads of the executive authorities and the rayon organs. Under the existing grave conditions, I want everyone to help each other. I want the clashes and arguments between them from time to time to be put aside. The heads of the executive authorities are competent officials. They must use their authority. However, the authority that has been transferred to them has placed significant responsibility on their shoulders. That responsibility requires them to set an example for all the other organs in every domain, including work, morale, and loyalty to obligations. If they fail, then they cannot fulfill their obligations. The arguments among the administrative organs in the rayons must be removed. I do not wish to go into detail on that matter. The administrative organs must work together. They must cooperate to fulfill the main tasks. I expect the heads of the executive authorities to see to that matter. Suggestions have been made to the effect that we have to take additional measures because of the serious situation in the Republic. Yes, similar suggestions were also made in the past. The Republic is in a state of war. Our life and activities must be reorganized in accordance with the demands of the military situation. The people must realize until that is done that everyone can be called to defend the homeland. The situation at the present time is that a part of the community is in the front line areas. They are fighting. Our officers and men in the military forces are fighting. They are being killed every day. Many of the refugees are in a very miserable condition. However, a certain group of people have a comfortable life, particularly in Baku. They are not concerned with the war. Nor are they concerned with the situation of the people who live under grave conditions. They have plenty to eat and drink. However, they must not display it. Entertaining in restaurants and other places will not help our situation at the present time. I have stressed several times that nothing can be more effective than the experience we have gained in the past. The people lived in the same way during World War II. Consumption of bread was 400 or 500 grams per person. That applied to everyone. No one tried to get double that amount. Naturally, there were exceptions. However, they were very few. Unfortunately, certain people eat, drink, and entertain in the restaurants at the present time. They do not think about the continuing bloodshed. They do not think about the people who are dying of hunger. Furthermore, they make suggestions on how this or that should be done. In view of that, I believe that the demand for the declaration of a state of war for the strengthening of discipline is justified. We must consider that state of affairs and take the necessary measures. Meanwhile, I wish to appeal to our people to conscientiously consider the way we live at the present time. Everyone must live in accordance with the conditions of war and defend our territory. Any other alternative does not exist. The Republic's military commissar has said that several decrees are inappropriate. That viewpoint was also expressed earlier. I do not know why changes have not been made. Who is responsible for making proposals to have the decrees changed? Is it the military or the legal advisers? They should have done so. If the matter concerns the presidential decrees, then proposals should be made to the presidential apparatus. If laws have to be changed, then the National Assembly should take action to resolve the matter in three or four days. I wish to instruct the presidential adviser on military affairs and the legal department of the presidential apparatus to draw up their proposals in three days. I wish to assure you that the serious talks we had in this meeting will yield results. We shall make changes in various fields in the near future. I wish to stress that I am convinced that Azerbaijan's people and the officials they have trusted and placed in high-level positions are aware of how grave the present situation is for our republic. They will draw the necessary conclusions and take the necessary measures. Thank you. I wish you success in the effort you will make to fulfill your tasks.
