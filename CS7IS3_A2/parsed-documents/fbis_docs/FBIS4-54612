He said that a failure to meet this condition might influence Egyutteles' support for the government coalition. "I know nothing about the proposal to sign the European Charter of Minority Languages having been withdrawn," Duray told CTK, adding that while discussing the government program the parliament charged the government with joining the charter. This had been demanded by Egyutteles for at least two years, already during the former Czechoslovakia, he said. The Slovak Government press department today told CTK that the proposal for the signing of the charter had been withdrawn from the agenda of today's cabinet meeting. However, the government today approved a parliamentary proposal on population registers. The passing of this proposal was one of further demands by Hungarian minority leaders as it was to include the use of Hungarian first names and Hungarian women's names without the Slovak ending -ova. Meeting this demand was also one of the conditions which Slovakia committed itself to fulfilling when it was accepted to the Council of Europe.
