The reason for dismissal was gross violation of legislation and regulations governing expenditure of the budget funds, exposed by a special investigation. In particular, due to lack of control, the ministry has sold off 17 vehicles to various commercial organizations. The damage from unauthorized business trips made by the ex-minister and a number of his subordinates abroad and within Russia is estimated as very serious. At a modest estimate, financial "slips" made by Tarmayev cost the taxpayers more that 20 million rubles. The government of Buryatia has forwarded the evidence of the investigation to the republic's procuracy.
