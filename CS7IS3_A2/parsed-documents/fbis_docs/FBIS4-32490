According to the explanation, the Ministry of International Economic Relations (NGKM) is unnecessary because the market is unified, and there is not a domestic and a foreign market. Therefore, it will be dismantled and most of it will be inherited by the future economics ministry. Down to the level of deputy state secretary, the structural and supervisory system is the same at the two affected ministries -- the Industry and Trade Ministry (IKM) and the KGKM. The two administrations were directed by a total of seven deputy state secretaries but, for example in the IKM, the National Tourist Office (OIH) was a separate unit and its chairman had the rank of head of a main department. Similarly, the Office for European Affairs, headed by an administrative state secretary, had a special role in the NGKM. The IKM will be the basis of what is to be called the economics ministry. In addition to the already mentioned OIH, it had four major professional areas: industry, energy, trade, and economics. It seems to be expedient to keep the first three of these because the fourth organization is almost the same at the two ministries. They both have economic, finance, control, statistics, and computer sections. Although with different tasks and requirements, both ministries have an organizational unit dealing with foreign relations, investment, privatization, and joint ventures. In addition to this, an international integration main department also operates in the IKM under the leadership of the deputy secretary of state for trade. According to the news, the NGKM will see the biggest changes. The ministry will actually be divided up between three ministries. The departments dealing with international finance and investment policy, and the aid coordination secretariat of the OECD will be attached to the Finance Ministry. The Foreign Ministry is also to receive part of the NGKM, namely the network of the state's trade representations abroad. However, it is questionable what to do with the regional main departments because all trade representatives belonged to the main department of their region. These are most probably to work within the framework of the newly established economic ministry. The fate of the Office for European Affairs is the biggest question. The 50-member organization was established to coordinate integration into Europe In all Western European countries, independent ministries or similar offices were established to help ease the entry to the European Community. However, actual membership was arranged by the foreign ministries and, since neither the Hungarian Socialist Party nor the Alliance of Free Democrats wants to set up an integration office with a minister without portfolio, this office will probably also be attached to the Foreign Ministry.
