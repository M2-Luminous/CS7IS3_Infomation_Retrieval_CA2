The Baotou-Lanzhou railway line is a key railway line linking northeast China with north China. The Baotou-Lanzhou single-track railway lines cannot meet the spiralling transportation needs resulting from the development of the national economy, and it is extremely urgent that the railway lines are expanded and rebuilt into double-track ones. According to the preliminary designs, the construction on the Baotou-Shiguai section begins first and will be built in stages. The first-phase project will be completed by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Upon the completion of the first-phase project, the transportation capacity can increase to six pairs of passenger trains and its annual goods transportation volume will reach 28 million tonnes. Upon the completion of the entire double-track railway line project, the passenger train transportation capacity will add to eight pairs and the annual goods transportation volume will surpass 40 million tonnes. The trains on these lines are drawn by internal-combustion engines so the driving equipment is automatically blocked.
