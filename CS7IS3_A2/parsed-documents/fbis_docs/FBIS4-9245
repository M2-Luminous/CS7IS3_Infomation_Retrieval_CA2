Tomorrow he is expected to meet his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The sides are expected to review the legal framework of the bilateral relations. Signing of accords is not envisaged. The Bulgarian-Slovak ties date back to the 1939-45 period, the time of the first Slovak state. Bulgaria was the sixth country to recognize Slovakia after Czechoslovakia was divided and immediately after the two countries established diplomatic relations in September 1993. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the current state of the bilateral relations can be described as very good. Experts are now intensively drafting a number of economic accords. President Zhelev went to Bratislava during a February 1991 visit to Czecho-Slovakia. In April 1992 then Slovak prime minister Jan Carnogursky paid a formal visit in Sofia. Informal meetings between the two parliaments' speakers followed in 1992 and 1993. Slovak President Michal Kovac last August came to the Bulgarian Black Sea coast on a holiday. In the meantime he met Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and invited him to visit Slovakia. The Bulgarian-Slovak commercial exchange marks an equilibrium with figures which are nearly identical in the two directions. According to experts, the effected levels are too low and do not correspond to the countries' potentials.
