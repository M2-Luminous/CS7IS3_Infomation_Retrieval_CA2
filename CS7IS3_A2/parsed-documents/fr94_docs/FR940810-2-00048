SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5) it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE41130 to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $100,000 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of developing a pollution prevention program. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) that a noncompetitive award based on a proposal, which is meritorious based on the Department's general evaluation, is justified. The activity is being conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provide by third parties, however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such activity. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $100,000. The proposed project is fully compatible with the mission of the Office of Industrial Technology, the sponsoring office. This project will allow DOE to develop a regulatory framework, implemented on a pilot basis, that will prevent pollution and reduce emissions generated in the industrial sector; and it provides an opportunity to make further progress toward environmental protection, foster industrial innovation to prevent pollution, and increase the effectiveness of environmental programs.
