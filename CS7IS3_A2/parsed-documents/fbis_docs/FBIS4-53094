The ASAHI SHIMBUN said the central bank has provided from tens of billions of yen to about 100 billion yen in loans to the Norinchukin Bank under a memo exchanged between officials of the Finance Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry in February of last year. The memo also gives favorable treatment to farm cooperative-affiliated financial institutions under the umbrella of the Norinchukin Bank on the reduction and exemption of loan interest to help them, the daily said. Such institutions provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the housing loan companies, it said. The memo was exchanged for relief measures for Nippon Housing Loan Co., the nation's largest housing loan company, and later applied to those for other housing loan companies, the daily said. The memo says the BOJ will provide necessary loans to the Norinchukin Bank because it is difficult for farm cooperative- affiliated financial institutions to reduce and redeem interest on loans for housing loan companies. The daily said seven housing loan companies are having financial difficulties due to bad loans to realtors, with the loans totaling 13.6 trillion yen.
