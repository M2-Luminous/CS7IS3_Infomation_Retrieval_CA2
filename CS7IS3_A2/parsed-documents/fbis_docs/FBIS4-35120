Ricupero said Social Action Minister Sergio Cutolo participated in drafting the proposal and that the additional cost will not affect the Treasury. Ricupero said the increase will be covered by rethinking some benefits, by eliminating the payment of irregular benefits, and by fighting fraud. He reaffirmed that the economic team will continue to balance public accounts because the stabilization plan is based on fiscal adjustment. Ricupero advocates the use of regional minimum salaries. He said this will help solve the problem facing poor municipal districts that are unable to pay high minimum salaries. Ricupero thus answered a question about the effects on state and municipal governments of increasing the minimum salary to $70. He reiterated that the main stumbling block for increasing the minimum salary is the public sector because most private companies are already paying more than the established minimum. Ricupero said the stabilization plan seeks to lay the groundwork for "reasonable" interest rates following the implementation of the real. He said, however, that if there is speculation on commodities and prices during the transition period, a "firm" control on the issuance of new currency will be used to provoke a shortage of cash. Ricupero added that interest rates would therefore rise and force those who speculate with their products to sell them to obtain cash. He added that care will be taken to ensure interest rates do not become excessive. Ricupero said the fear expressed by businessmen about high interest rates is unjustified. He sees a contradiction in their claims about high interest rates. In his opinion, some businessmen "would like to stockpile their products, but they will be unable to do this if interest rates are high." Regarding the impact the recent frost will have on food prices, Ricupero said the government is prepared to use its buffer stocks, if necessary, to avoid excessive price increases.
