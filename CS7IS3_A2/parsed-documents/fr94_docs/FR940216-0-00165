FR940216-0-00165 FR940216-0-00010 For example, consider a blender-refiner who has the anti-dumping statutory baseline, and who is subject to the complex model standards (toxics and NO X emissions performance). This blender-refiner uses two blendstocks during a certain portion of the averaging period, a light FCC naphtha and a reformate, and these blendstocks are blended at the rate of 10 vol% FCC naphtha, 25 vol% reformate, and 65 vol% base gasoline. A partial list of the properties of these blendstocks, as determined by the blender-refiner through sampling and testing, are as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1FCC naphtha 1Reformate 1Anti-dumping statutory gasoline Aromatics (vol%) 13.5 31.1 28.6 Olefins (vol%) 39.8 1.0 10.8 Sulfur (ppm) 289 10 338 Specific gravity 0.753 0.801 0.742 The blender-refiner determines the properties of the blends that would result if these blendstocks were blended at these rates with gasoline having properties equal to the anti-dumping statutory baseline. In the case of aromatics, the calculation would be the following: aromatics (vol%)=(13.5×0.10)+31.1×0.25)+(28.6×0.65)=27.72 As stated earlier, fuel properties measured on a weight percent or ppm basis would have to be adjusted for specific gravity as follows: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.000 All other parameters required for the complex model would be calculated in a similar manner to create a list of calculated parameters except for the determination of RVP for ethanol blends. Because of the high RVP of ethanol and its non-linear blending characteristics, gasoline blends with at least 1.50% ethanol by volume should be entered into the appropriate complex model with an assumed RVP 1.0 psi greater than that of the base gasoline and other blendstocks. Below 1.50% ethanol concentration, the RVP of the base gasoline and blendstock should be unchanged for calculation purposes in the complex model. These parameters are then applied to the complex model to generate the values of the exhaust benzene, toxics and NO X emissions performance for the hypothetical calculated blend. In this example, the complex model yields a NO X emissions performance for this gasoline of 640 mg/mile. The properties of the anti-dumping statutory gasoline are then applied to the complex model to determine that this gasoline has a NO X emissions performance of 660 mg/mile. The blender-refiner in this example then subtracts the NO X emissions performance of anti-dumping statutory gasoline from the NO X emissions performance of the hypothetical calculated blend, to yield the NO X emissions performance effect of the blendstocks used of ^20 mg/mile (640^660=^20 mg/mile). The blender-refiner would then repeat this process for all blends produced during the averaging period where blendstock was added to base gasoline. These per-batch NO X emissions performance effects are then combined on a volume-weighted basis, and the blender-refiner would have met the NO X anti-dumping standard if this net value is equal to or less than zero. A similar analysis was performed for toxics emissions performance. X. Provisions for Opt-in by Other Ozone Non-Attainment Areas Section 211(k)(6) of the Act allows certain areas to opt into the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. Thus, such areas may choose to participate in the RFG program, unlike the nine areas with the highest ozone design values which are required to participate.
