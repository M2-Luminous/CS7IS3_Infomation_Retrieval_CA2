One Serb soldier was wounded and civilian buildings were considerably damaged in the attack. The Krajina Serb Army headquarters specified that the Croatian attack, which lasted all day long, started in the wider Kozjan region, southwest of Korenica, which came under tank and artillery fire, spreading then to the entire region along the front line, west of Korenica and Vrhovine. The headquarters statement said that Krajina Serb forces had responded to all attacks, and the Serb defence line remained stable. According to the statement, the Croatian Army violated the ceasefire in the territory of the western Slavonija (sector west) on Monday, opening fire from small arms around the forest of Prasnik. The Croatian actions ceased when the Serb troops returned fire, the statement said. A twice extended ceasefire between the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia has been in force since Christmas. It will be in force by March 31, when the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate in Krajina expires. The republic of Serb Krajina has been declared by the Serbs in their ethnic and historical territories in Croatia, in response to Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of Serb civil and national rights by Croatian authorities. The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed a U.N. Protected Area in spring 1992 following the conflict between the Croatian Army with the Krajina Serbs and the former Yugoslav Peoples Army. The U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed there under the Vance peace plan. Croatia has launched three offensives on the Republic of Serb Krajina since then, trying to take control of it by force.
