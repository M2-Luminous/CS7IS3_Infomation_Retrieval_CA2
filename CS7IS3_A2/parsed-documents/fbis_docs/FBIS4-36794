During a meeting with the head and members of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, Ramadan described the suffering of the sons of our people, particularly the children and elderly, due to the blockade and resulting shortage of medicines as the crime of the age, a violation of human rights, and an encroachment on divine values and international charters. The vice president added that the continued food and medicine blockade on the Iraqi people has exposed both the enemies of mankind and those who are using the defense of human rights, peoples' freedom, and peoples' prosperity, as a disguise. He noted the importance of moves by charitable and humanitarian organizations to reject the U.S.-led hostile policy which is implemented by the U.S. allies who are fighting the Iraqi people using food and medicines after they failed to harm them through a wide military aggression. Dr. Sa'dun Khalifah, head of the Society, reviewed its efforts to alleviate the illnesses which the children and elderly are suffering as a result of the continued blockade.
