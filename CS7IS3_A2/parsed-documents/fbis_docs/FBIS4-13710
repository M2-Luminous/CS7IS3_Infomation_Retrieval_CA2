These organizations, which are mostly under the influence of Zionist groups, have once again propounded the perpetual claims of the United States and the Zionist regime based on Iran's military presence in the strategic regions of the Persian Gulf. These claims have been made repeatedly by Western and Zionist circles. Despite such claims, Iran has always been in favor of an amicable settlement of its differences with its southern neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates. Goodneighborliness, assistance in adopting a regional policy, and the elimination of the danger of domination by foreigners are integral and strategic parts of Iran's policy, which is being misconstrued by the United States as a lessening of its vital interests. In addition to these claims, what contributes to major dangers in the Persian Gulf is the presence of deep-rooted territorial disputes among the regional Arab countries, which stem from their thirst for power, affiliation with arrogant powers of the world, and the influence of these arrogant powers. Conspicuous examples are Iraq's attack on Iran and later on Kuwait. The Persian Gulf region has been transformed into a potential center of tension because of Saudi Arabia's extensive dependence on the anti-Islamic and antipopular policies of the United States. It is under these circumstances that Saudi Arabia has embarked on expanding these baseless claims and exacerbating the territorial claims that are exactly what the enemies of the region and Islam want. According to political experts, countries that strive to preserve flash points and expand baseless territorial claims are most certainly acting against their own interests. The proliferation of artificial crises in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf is the long-term strategy of the greater powers, the United States in particular, who wants to consolidate its position on this basis. By implementing this divisive strategy, the West has managed to transform a potentially dangerous union of these countries--which would be opposed to Western interests--into a subtle hostility against one another. By creating doubts and apprehension among the regional countries, the United States is seeking the necessary pretexts for its greater presence and more overt interference, which is against the interests of countries in the region. This has been made possible by the servile Saudi rulers, who are now accusing Iran to justify their own actions. It is by realizing this tangible fact that Iran should adopt a strategic policy to expose these suspicious and dangerous moves and should refrain from needlessly pandering to the power- seeking Saudi rulers. Unfortunately, we have not developed a clear course of action regarding Saudi Arabia's political, discord-generating moves and this has resulted in making the Saudi rulers more audacious and arrogant than ever before.
