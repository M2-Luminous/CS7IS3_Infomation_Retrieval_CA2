This was announced to journalists by Sergey Tsekov, speaker of the Crimean Supreme Council, in his first news conference on 15 May. The Crimean Supreme Council's final objective is to restore unity with Russia, he said. This is recorded in the programs of the Republican Party and the "Russia" election bloc from which the majority of the deputies and President Yuriy Meshkov were elected. The speaker also intimated that a Crimean national guard will soon be set up. Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, has stated in this connection to the "INTERFAX-UKRAINE" news agency: "A coup is under way in Crimea with all-round support from the Russian Federation." In his view, the fact that "ranking officials from Russia are taking part" in the work of the Crimean parliament is also a matter for concern. They "are suggesting to Crimean leaders the idea that Crimea join the CIS, and that Crimea should raise the question of the withdrawal of Ukraine's armed forces from its territory."
