Correspondent Mikhail Shakhnovich reports that the communication workers have one and the same reason -- acute financial crisis. The country's television and radio companies owe Omsk over 600 million rubles and, as a result, there is no money to pay for electricity, and employees of relaying centers have not received their wages since November. But the switches have been turned off not just at RV-49. A VHF station and television transmitters have stopped working on the oblast's territory. Communications workers intend to strike until all their demands are met. A government telegram that arrived in Omsk this morning unfortunately does not give answers to any of their questions, including the main one, namely when the debt will be settled. To all appearances, the switches on transmitters are not going to be turned on very soon, although local television and radio channels are continuing work, because the Omsk communication workers have no complaints against the Irtysh television and radio company. They are not taking part in in the information blockade. Radio relay and cable links are working. All the oblast's radio transmitters relay the Moscow channel.
