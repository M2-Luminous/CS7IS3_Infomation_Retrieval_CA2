FBIS3-5652 "dreas046__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Media Understanding Sought on Phone Issue OW0303200794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Mar 94 Evening Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0303200794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [By Shigeru Komago in Washington] [Text] On 28 February, the Japanese Embassy in the United States began to send officials to visit major U.S. newspapers to explain its view on the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) charge that Japan has violated an agreement in the portable and car phone sector. The embassy seeks to gain the U.S. news media's understanding by explaining that "the USTR's charge is full of errors." But some people are cool toward this, saying: "What Japan should do promptly is to talk with the U.S. Government rather than do public relations work with the news media." The embassy, after consulting with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, prepared a paper entitled "Refutation of the USTR's Claim" in English, and explained it to newspapers like THE WASHINGTON POST and THE WALL STREET JOURNAL individually. In the paper, the embassy rebuts almost all points raised by USTR Mickey Kantor on 15 February as violations of an agreement by Japan. The paper cites specific reasons in refuting the U.S. charge as a "misunderstanding of facts" or an "incomprehensible assertion." The U.S. news media, in reporting on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, took the position of criticizing the Clinton administration with respect to its demands for objective criteria, thus making favorable reports on Japan. But as far as the portable and car phone issue was concerned, the news media supported the USTR's assertion, and most major newspapers criticized Japan in their editorials. Given this situation, Japan appears to have decided that it should do public relations work with the U.S. news media in this regard. After listening to Japan's explanation, a major newspaper's reporter gave a wry smile and said: "I see that the U.S demands are rather unreasonable. But what surprises me most is that the Japanese and the U.S. Governments are too different in their perceptions and stands." Another said: "The gaps between the two governments should be filled by the governments themselves. The news media cannot do that for them."
