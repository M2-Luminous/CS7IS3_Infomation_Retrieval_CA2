Because of the circumstances of the sanctions, Iraq has a 40 percent shortfall in its need for certified seeds, that is, seeds suitable for planting. The use of non-certified seeds prepared by specialists is a process with uncertain results. Last year the validity of this view was proved, when the Agriculture Ministry made use of seeds from the Commerce Ministry and distributed them to peasants. The director-general of the General Iraqi Company for Seed Production explained that there were ongoing operations to sort through, examine, and certify the seeds. Wheat seeds were found to be a minimum of 96 percent pure, and a maximum of 99 percent pure. The certification process was supervised to the end, as was the process of distributing them to the peasants. On another front, preparations are now underway for the receiving of rice seeds from the company's laboratories in Ghammas and Nahr Sa'd. The General Iraqi Company for Seed Production has defined standards for this purpose, and the peasants were informed of them, as well as of the fixed prices. The same company is currently preparing vegetable seeds, for tomatoes and cucumbers for distribution to peasants so they can sow them in the winter season with protected and covered crops. They are to monitor local tomato seeds in special fields for the production of seeds with facilities provided by the company. The company has also contracted with a group of field owners in the Euphrates region for the production of onion seeds, and they will monitor and supervise the fields. For their part, the peasants question the rise of seed prices in general, particularly for vegetable seeds. They have asked many times for permission to keep some of the wheat, barley, and other seeds to be sowing-seeds the following season, especially as the law of the land forbids that! The Ministry of Agriculture, for its part, came up with many plans and programs to make the winter growing season successful, to correct mistakes made last year, to seek privatization for agriculture in the future, and to encourage peasants to produce the harvest itself. There is another view, according to which the government's increased purchase prices for some cash crops is a factor in encouraging peasants to produce those cash crops that ordinarily are not suitable for cultivation in their lands.
