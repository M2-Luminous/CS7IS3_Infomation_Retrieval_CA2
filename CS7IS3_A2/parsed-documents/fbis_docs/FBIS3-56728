Passersby Die"] [Text] Explosions in the center of Moscow are a lamentable tradition. This time the latest explosion boomed out on Ostuzhev Street -- a homemade explosive device was planted beneath the apartment window of Dmitriy Tsyn, director of the "`Alternativa' Trading House" Joint-Stock Company. One man died and three were injured as a result of the explosion. A chance passerby died -- Sergey Plamenevskiy, a fitter from the local Rayon Housing Administration, who was doing the rounds of Nos. 16 and 17, Ostuzhev Street. He died from his injuries an hour after the explosion -- at 1000 hours in the Sklifosovskiy Emergency Hospital. The three other victims -- Dmitriy Tsyn, the presumed target of the explosion, outside whose window the bomb went off; his bodyguard Yuriy Dukayev; and driver Mikhail Strukov -- suffered shrapnel wounds. Only the businessman is now fit for work. The explosion also blew out the windows in Nos. 16 and 17. An explosion outside the apartment of a trading house director can hardly be regarded as commonplace -- the investigation has not yet ascertained the motive for the crime. Dmitriy Borisovich claims that in 34 years he has not made any enemies, no one has threatened him, but what is most offensive and incomprehensible is that no one had warned him, even anonymously, about any of his actions, as criminals and terrorists are wont to do. What is more, Tsyn admits that even if the bandits had demanded money from him, he would not have been able to pay up -- in 1993 the "`Alternativa' Trading House" invested all its money in developing and setting up enterprises: It set up two insurance companies and several branches from Estonia to Magnitogorsk, and expects to receive the profit in a year at the earliest. At the moment all it has is debts. The investigation into the explosion will take two directions at once: A headquarters has been set up, where highly competent specialists from the City Internal Affairs Administration will work on several scenarios. They are not ruling out the idea that the explosion outside the businessman's apartment was a warning to one of his partners or apartment block neighbors, nor are they ruling out the idea that the bandits' demands might be made after the event, which Dmitriy Borisovich himself does not deny. As well as the official investigation, the case of the explosion will be tackled by the "`Alternativa' Trading House" security service, which comprises two retired top-class specialists -- Colonel Kotov, former head of Moscow Criminal Investigations Department, and KGB General Ryabov -- as well as a staff of over 50 people armed with regulation weapons issued under City Internal Affairs Administration license. Who will be the first to clear up the crime?
