Observers have made different comments on the prince's trip. They are as follows: Some say Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh went to Singapore for a medical checkup because his overwork had caused him dizziness and hypertension. But others believe that the prince's medical treatment in Singapore was a minor issue. What is important is that he wanted to talk to Singapore leaders in person about buying ammunition from Singapore, since the island state is a market place for war materiel. Observers are watching the move to see whether their assumption is correct and whether Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh did go to Singapore only for a medical checkup or also to buy ammunition for the Phnom Penh Government troops, which is conducting a military campaign in the current 16th dry season. Some other observers hold that Singapore's intention of selling ammunition to the Phnom Penh government appears to be improper, because ASEAN's policy toward Cambodia is to achieve national reconciliation and peace. This position of ASEAN is emphatically mentioned in the ASEAN joint communique issued in January 1993 specifying that ASEAN wants Cambodia to reach national reconciliation and to regain peace. ASEAN wants to see the Cambodian problem settled in accordance with the five-point proposal of King Norodom Sihanouk.
