Panov and N. Preobrazhenska: "Be Careful--Don't Eat `Kovboy!'"] [Text] The Zelenyy Svit [Green Earth] association had appealed to the General Procuracy of Ukraine as early as 1992 with the request to verify the facts of gross violations of legislation for the purchase and use of pesticides in agriculture. The General Procuracy took up this issue and ascertained significant violations of the law, as well as financial abuses on the part of some officials. It was thus determined that Ukrahrokhim, the Radykap plant and the Ukrayina AG had been buying up hundreds of tonnes of pesticides in various countries whose use is prohibited in those same countries. The IkrDITOKS Institute, or more precisely its leaders, who should have been standing guard against the penetration of poisonous mixtures into Ukraine, gave permission for their use. It has been established that the damages to the state as a result of the actions of these individuals are valued at 18 million dollars. Seven criminal cases have been filed based on these crimes. Investigation is now underway, but a question has arisen here: how can it be that we, ordinary mortals, are using pesticide products that are poisonous abroad? Not an easy question, the more so as the people affiliated with it are continuing their dirty work. A governmental commission was created by request of the procuracy that was to halt the use of unsafe mixtures and punish the guilty officials, but this has not happened. Director M. Motuzynskyy and his assistants A. Podrushnyak, A. Bolotnyy and S. Omelchuk, removed from their positions at UkrDITOKS on the recommendation of the General Procuracy, were asked to be experts at the State Chemical Commission of the Cabinet of Ministers--that is, the chief judges of their own criminal actions. The head of that state commission himself, V. Petrunyak, authorized the bringing of the unregistered mixtures into Ukraine. The chief sanitary physician of Ukraine, V. Mariyevskyy, who signed the authorization for the use in agriculture of a whole series of mixtures that are not safe for people, holds a senior position in the Ministry of Health to this day. Carcinogenic, mutagenic and allergenic pesticides that are not even registered in the producing countries are being shipped into Ukraine with the blessing of high persons even today. And one can imagine what is being hidden on the farms if in the capital oblast alone--in Boryspilskyy rayon--mixtures without even names were being produced. The kolkhozes in Obukhivskyy Rayon have been using Kovboy and Satis mixtures, which are not listed among those permitted. In Vasylkivskiyy rayon, clear of radionuclides, they are polluting their fields to a significant extent with pesticides, while in Poliskyy the Ahroindustriya Scientific-Research Center is offering farms the unregistered Kovboy. Wherever you look, we are thus being polluted, robbed and poisoned--and no supervisor is being brought to liability. The Ukrainian Zelenyy Svit ecological association has appealed to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with the request for the immediate removal from their posts of the people who are promoting the poisoning of the already quite polluted Ukrainian lands through their unprincipled and criminal actions. Zelenyy Svit is also appealing to the citizens of Ukraine: people, be careful! Demand complete documentation for pesticides and herbicides, and certificates for their use in agriculture. Demand, from monitoring bodies of stores and markets, guarantees of the quality of agricultural products. Do not permit the poisoning of yourself and your children.
