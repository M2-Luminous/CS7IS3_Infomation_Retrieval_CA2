In an article today on the downing of the two helicopters, the paper adds that deteriorating morale among U.S. officers, which is a traditional flaw in U.S. national security, makes them panic and act irrationally whenever they have doubts about the existence of an enemy force. U.S. propaganda and media incitement against Iraq added to the U.S. officers panic, thus making them act hastily, killing 26 Americans and Europeans, who they mistook for people of another nationality -- which would make it okay to kill them. The paper adds: As in previous cases when he lied to Congress, Clinton this time tried to peddle another lie among the U.S. public to justify this incident and to contain any negative repercussions. He claimed that the dead were on a humanitarian mission assigned to them by the United Nations. However, the United Nations did not wait long to answer, immediately responding that it had nothing to do with the mission nor had it asked anybody to undertake this mission. The United Nations also said that the two helicopters received orders from the United States.
