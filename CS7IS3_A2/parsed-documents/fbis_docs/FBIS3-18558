It must be said that agriculture was probably one of the biggest obstacles to be overcome, because the new arrivals have prices which are markedly higher than those of the Twelve and will have to be brought into line as of 1 January 1995. In an interview with LE FIG-ECO, Mr. Steichen first explains that he is "satisfied" with the results and that the various amounts of compensation granted to the candidates "will not affect the implementation of the reform of the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy]." In his view, these countries have "a concept of public support for agriculture which is closer to regional development and environmental protection than to performance at all costs" and, he added, "because the reform tries to reconcile the two problems, I am not particularly worried." However, he makes no secret of the fact that it is "rather the rules for operating the European machinery which will become problematical." The need to depart from the (famous) guidelines of the European budget, which place a ceiling on agricultural spending during the 1994-1999 period, could thus prove necessary. "It is an important question," Rene Steichen admitted. "A solution will have to be found. What solution? We are working on it. When the GDR automatically became a member, the guideline was increased.... The arrival of the new members should generate more GDP and hence a broader guideline." Is he not afraid, more generally, that "green Europe" -- which absorbs a good half of the European budget -- will be at the mercy of a budgetary crisis? "Every effort has been made to prevent it," he replied. "However, there are problems to be solved: The monetary chaos has led to an additional bill of 10 billion [currency not specified] which the Twelve have pledged to settle. We will have to be careful about spending in 1995 because economic growth will only leave us little room to manuever.... But I do not expect anything insurmountable." At a time when he is preparing to fly to Budapest, the commissioner could not fail to discuss the competition from the East European countries which is likely to become increasingly fierce. "For the time being, that is not the case," he said. "More because of their own structural problems than because of our health or other barriers, their agricultural exports to us fell by 7 percent between 1991 and 1992, whereas our exports to them increased by 11 percent. I would like to add that agricultural production fell by 12 percent in Poland and by 20 percent in Hungary in 1992." But Mr. Steichen admits that it is "inevitable" that the Twelve will open up to East Europe and that for 30 years the East European countries have often been a "convenient outlet for our surpluses." He thinks that "the fall in prices for which the reform makes provision will be the best protection of the European Union's agricultural potential faced with competitoin from these Central and East European countries which are already opening up and will open up more." Verbal Exaggerations The commissioner for "green Europe," who is confident by nature and hardworking, is satisfied with the implementation of the CAP reform more than one year on. "Even though the individual position of many farmers is still worrying, I think we must first put an end to the `alarmist' statements on the CAP," he said. "There is deep disquiet in this section of the rural world. The drop in the number of young farmers setting up worries me. Should it be attributed to the uncertainties of GATT or the reform? Some extreme statements also influence the farmers' individual behavior.... ``What is the real situation? We were at a point at which European agriculture was threatened with explosion both on the internal and international levels. The situation has not become ideal but we now have a plan to support agriculture which is trying to reconcile competitiveness and the occupation of the rural area. The rules of reciprocal discipline accepted in the GATT framework henceforth bring us international peace.'' With regard to big farms, Rene Steichen thinks that the objectives are being achieved. "The control of grain production at around 165 million tons will not lead to additional set-aside if it is confirmed," he noted. "The ruinous stocks are being reduced. They were still 32 million tons last summer. They are 21 million tons now. Finally, the regular loss of our markets in animal feed in favor of substitutes is being reversed." Positive Result of the Reform "Our fears," he continued, "relate to beef and we have been saying this from the start. There is an ultimate risk of a serious crisis if production is not better controlled, which would have serious consequences for stock-raisers' incomes. Moreover, the sale of the surpluses is continuing: 400,000 tons of stocks currently, as against 1 million tons last year." Mr. Steichen also thinks that the setting up of the system of direct aid to farmers is going well. Especially in France where "aid has been paid within the time stipulated," which proves "the efficiency of the French civil service." But he refuses to launch into controversy over the development of incomes. "I will merely say to those who predicted a disaster that they were mistaken: There was a 12 percent increase in France in revenue from `big farms' in 1993 compared with 1992." "I note," he added, "that the sectors which are recording considerable loss of revenue are those which have not been reformed...." And he announced that, in the wine, fruit, and vegetables sectors which have still narrowly escaped reform, he intends to make proposals soon. The wine issue "greatly worries" him. Moreover, he thinks that the fruit and vegetable situation is "complex." A Set of New Measures What if the CAP reform failed? This iconoclastic question received a direct answer. "The risks of failure cannot be ruled out. Some people are even predicting them with relish. If the race for yields is not controlled, if there is cheating over subsidies or set-aside, if there is monetary instability, there will be a problem. And it will not be the fault of GATT or the Americans... It will then be necessary to choose between two bad solutions: Either a return to market stabilization measures which will increase the rural exodus -- that was the policy followed before the reform -- or taking administrative measures to manage production which will curb intra-Community trade. Indeed, it is in France's interests to ensure that the reform succeeds even if some provisions may be reviewed." Mr. Steichen thinks this reform provides "a panoply of new measures" which can also contribute to the regional development policy. "Our aid can henceforth encourage environmental protection, the use of pasture, forests, rural tourism, and so forth. We are also preparing a system for the protection of regional products inspired by French legislation. Finally, the considerable increase in Europe's participation in contracts between states and regions must be noted. More than half of France's rural areas will benefit from a contribution of 15 billion francs for the next five years."
