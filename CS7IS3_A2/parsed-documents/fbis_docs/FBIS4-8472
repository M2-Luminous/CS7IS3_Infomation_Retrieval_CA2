It is natural that the topic of the officer corps occupies an important place in the newspapers. According to Minister Aleksandrov he had seldom encountered such unanimity in the criticism of him as on this issue. At the last meeting of the Consultative Council on National Security at the Supreme Command the defense minister reported on the cadre situation in the army. He told journalists that since December 1991 there had been no cuts at the Ministry of Defense and stressed that no cuts are being made now or in the future. Military personnel are simply being retired. One must distinguish between cuts that are made on the basis of a certain criterion, and applying the existing law. Minister Aleksandrov said that the cadre issue is a basic issue in the army. The first civilian team that entered the Ministry of Defense more than two years ago found that there a serious anomaly. Many jobs in many structures of the ministry were being done by people with various qualifications. In other words, many officers were involved in inappropriate activities. In addition, during the tenure of Minister Aleksandrov a study has been implemented, which has shown that "our family" had increased by 1,500 members since the beginning of the reform. Naturally, this took place at the expense of new structures, which did not exist before, but without whom work under the new conditions in anything related to the legal and social aspects and certain units of the Ministry of Defense would have been aggravated. After many academic talks and discussions the situation with the cadres has been analyzed and one factor unfortunately inherited from an incorrect cadre policy has become obvious. This prompted the decision to restore the pyramid in the command structure. It is well known that most officers in the army must be junior officers -- lieutenants and captains. The pyramid becomes narrower at the higher echelons, and at the top there are a few generals. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that at present we have an accumulation of senior officers in the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and in all the administrative structures and commands. At the same time there is a serious shortage of combat officers in the units. At present 55 percent of the officers have the rank of major and above. Obviously, the model has been turned upside down. Afterward, the minister informed journalists about the results of several very important sociological studies. The basic dissatisfaction of the officer corps relates to the low wages and social status. However, nothing more could be done under existing conditions. The second cause of officers' dissatisfaction relates to the lack of prospects regarding a career as commanders. This is the results of two factors: Either the cadre selection is incorrect, or senior officers have "plugged up" the central leading units. Personnel not related to combat units can be reduced. As an example Minister Aleksandrov pointed out the decrease in the personnel of the Ministry of Defense General Chancellery, which was brought down from 33 to 11. On 6 April Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, signed a decree that all colonels from the Ministry of Defense and the Military-Economic Bloc over 50 years old who have been on active service for 20 years must retire according to the requirements of Article 71 of the current law. This applies to 87 people and does not affect colonels performing generals' duties. Decreasing the personnel of the General Staff will be a gradual process, Minister Aleksandrov said. This is a result of the simple fact that the members of the General Staff have great responsibilities. It is there that operational plans are worked out, strategic deployments decided, and their responsibility is for anything related to the troops' combat readiness. The officers of the General Staff are highly qualified and not mere clerks. This only is the beginning of the process. The transition toward the corps-brigade organization will reduce in the future the personnel of many staffs. We planned this for 1995-97, the minister said, but the aggravated economic situation and the iron framework of the budget compelled us to hurry. The Bulgarian Army General Staff fully supports this position. The necessary retirements and changes in the officer, sergeant, and enlisted men corps will be effected by the summer, in accordance with the existing law, the code on the military service of the officers and sergeants, and the Labor Code. By 30 April the structures of the administrative units General Staff, and the commands of the troops and the detachments will be optimized. We will not allow the combat command personnel to be painfully affected by the reforms, the minister said. In May the changes and optimization will be discussed by the Military Council of the General Staff and submitted to the minister of defense. Afterward, the payrolls of the approves structural changes will be worked out. Thus the cadre issues will finally be resolved, Defense Minister Aleksandrov said. The goal is to complete the cadre reform by July and August. By about 1 September, when the graduates of the military schools receive their posts and the others climb one stage higher in accordance with the approved structures and payrolls, one will be able to determine the number of people who have not received and will not receive a new post and will be released from the army. However, all this will only be done according to the law in anything related to the post, age, years of service, and rank. The sergeants, military employees, and other civilians without a post after the structural changes, will be released after 1 June in accordance with the law and the Labor Code. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that there are 2,886 officers who do not correspond to the requirements of Article 71 of the law. Those people will have to leave the army during this period. The issue will be resolved in an easier manner concerning sergeants. About 1,500 of them do not have a high school education. Minister Aleksandrov announced his decision that military doctors-colonels and graduate military personnel of military- scientific units could serve until the age of 60, because they are first rank experts and the army needs them. The minister of defense also answered many questions from the journalists.
