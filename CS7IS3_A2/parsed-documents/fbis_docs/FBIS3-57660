KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI asked Leonid Kuchma, a politician and expert in missile-building, to comment on the event. [Reporter] Your opinion about the decision of the Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian presidents is interesting as the position of a politician and, more importantly, as a professional who has spent many years designing and building missiles. [Kuchma] Let me single out several aspects of this undoubtedly momentous event for Ukraine. It is so important that I think the Ukrainian president should have first consulted with the public before making such a decision. He could then have used some trump cards in his discussions with parliament. Generally speaking, people should be involved in making such key decisions as this one, so that no one gets the impression that some deal was cut. Now on to the decision itself. Its first aspect is purely political. It is no secret that over the past two years, deliberately and with the active participation of international media, people have been cultivating the image of Ukraine as a resentful, unstable, and unpredictable partner. Unfortunately, at that time, the world equated our country with such countries as Libya, North Korea, or Iraq. The main directions of this misinformation, and that is putting it mildly, are well known -- "communist reserve," "the country of bellicose nationalism," etc. But what really strikes the nerve of Western society is the notion that Ukraine is a "new nuclear monster." I believe that in the beginning of this year, all conditions were ready for the complete political isolation of Ukraine followed by the liquidation of its independence. This state of things called for a breakthrough, a move capable of refuting at least some of the unfounded accusations thrown at Ukraine. And such a move that invoked positive reaction of the world has been made, I believe. Secondly, a pretext for uncivilized economic pressure on Ukraine exerted by forces interested in it was removed. At present, one can no longer say that Ukraine poses a threat to Europe or the world, or that it stands in the way of global nuclear disarmament. This is why one needs to change their attitude and language during negotiations with Ukraine. Third, it is a change in character of general European politics. On the one hand, Ukrainian stubbornness in 1993 made Europe and the whole world aware of its existence and managed to get the point across that it was ready to comply with international agreements -- only without hurting itself and with respect to its rights and interests, including economic ones. On the other hand, the hand- twisting practices applied by its partners in negotiations have hardly earned them much credit in Europe, showing that there are "little" and "great" countries in relations among states. [Reporter] What can you say about the economic aspects of the agreement? Is it good for Ukraine, considering its trade and payment imbalance and growing oil debt to Russia? [Kuchma] I would rather refrain from making an outright euphoric assessment. Ukraine was granted the right of full participation in nuclear disarmament, enjoying all of its benefits and advantages. Let me also not repeat the widely held belief that Ukraine supposedly received a generous gift. As of now, Ukraine has received nothing more than documented confirmation of its right to receive compensation for giving up its nuclear weapons, which were created to a large extent at the expense of its natural resources, finances, and labor potential. I am not excessively optimistic about the agreement's economic aspects, because I am confused by the all-too-vague terms of Ukraine's admission to the uranium markets, too vague terms and degree of compensation, as well as Bill Clinton's equivocal promises about economic cooperation and unrestrained investments in Ukraine. Generally speaking, I agree that we undoubtedly saw Europe take a big step toward peace. It is hard to ignore the political significance of the event. However, the way the agreement was signed and the methods applied to reach a consensus were humiliating, not so much for Ukraine as for its overseas partner. In particular, I am sure that Mr. Clinton's tactless remark at Boryspol Airport in Kiev was humiliating to himself, most of all. [Reporter] As far as I can remember, your position at the closed Supreme Council session in June of last year was slightly different. At that time, you were against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. [Kuchma] That is not true. I have always believed that for Ukraine, nonnuclear status is the only correct path for the future. I have always stressed this. However, in June of last year, we were told to disarm without any serious security or territorial guarantees, as well as any hint of compensation. The Ukrainian budget and economy will not survive nuclear disarmament on their own. Let me remind you that it was my government that came up with the proposal to handle the issue of nuclear disarmament in a complex manner, taking into consideration dismantling, transportation, processing, and so on. It was the first to bring up the problem of compensation for tactical missiles and emphasized the need to respect Ukrainian interests and rights in solving the problem of strategic missiles and intercontinental missile silos. I am glad that these rights and interests have eventually been recognized and taken into consideration. In addition, the agreement provides Ukraine with access to large long-term credits, which would enable the country to establish a stabilization fund for its national currency and, therefore, curb inflation. The latter is the main precondition for saving the Ukrainian economy from collapse and increasing investments into it. One should not think, however, that this will come automatically without a hard work. We have no right to lose our chance, as was the case in 1992, when Ukraine had the potential to overcome the crisis. [Reporter] What do you think will next happen to the agreement? It was negatively assessed by almost all Ukrainian political parties. [Kuchma] The agreement's fate will depend on the goodwill of politicians. We know some "patriots" who did not manage to become professionals and whose words and judgments are much faster than their reasoning. At first, they forced the nonnuclear status into the Declaration of Independence, and now, the same people do not want to keep their promise to the people and the world. It would be a good thing to ask them when they were sincere -- when they promised an influx of Western money in return for nuclear weapons, or now, when they want to intimidate everyone with the missiles? In my opinion, their criticism is a result of a lack of political professionalism. Anyway, the first serious test for the agreement of the three presidents will be its ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. I am afraid that, as usual, instead of the document's text or its geopolitical meaning being addressed, the main topics of discussion will be personal squabbles and a clash of interests between the executive and legislative branches. If we manage to overcome this hurdle, the rest will depend on the goodwill and readiness of the United States and Russia to fulfill their obligations, as well as on our ability to take advantage of this historic opportunity.
