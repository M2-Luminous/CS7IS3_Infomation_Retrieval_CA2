IT IS TRAGIC for the European Union and the international community to express abhorrence at the bombing of civilians in Sarajevo while, at the same time, they threaten a massacre through air raids against the same place where the blood was shed. IT IS TRAGIC for the bombing, which will certainly kill people and cause bloodshed and will most probably mean an extension of the Balkan war, to be regarded as one of the "measures" that "would be a first step toward realizing the European Peace Plan." IT IS TRAGIC to express abhorrence for the ongoing bloodshed, to discuss peace plans at the table while under the table arms are being passed to all the belligerent parties. IT IS TRAGIC for people who desire peace to play games behind their backs and the same people pay the price with blood, the blood of civilians, the blood of children. IT IS TRAGIC for human logic not to find a solution, the solution that the people desire, and in the name of these people to commit crimes with the same people as victims. IT IS TRAGIC for everyone, both Europeans and non-Europeans, to know that here are the Balkans, and the Balkans are the powder keg of Europe and still, those who make any decisions for air raids and the like do not realize that they are paving the road to a new Vietnam. So, IT WOULD BE tragic if in the end the international community did not avoid "the major evil" to which it will be led with the air raids by ignoring the value of human life and the blood that will be shed. FOR THIS "major evil" the expression of any abhorrence would be the glorification of hypocrisy and cynicism. Greece, since both the government and the parties agree, ought to react in every way against such a "solution." The presidency of the United Europe offers to Greece additional possibilities.
