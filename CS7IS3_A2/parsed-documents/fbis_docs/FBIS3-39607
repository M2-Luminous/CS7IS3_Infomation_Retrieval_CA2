They are the third wing of the Bierset base (near Liege) and two logistical units. The operation is part of the Army restructuring plan which was approved in January 1992 by the government. The Air Force will disband the third wing on 31 March and leave the base at the end of June. The Mirages have already been withdrawn from active service. Some weeks ago the Air Force flew the last aircraft of that type to the reserve base in Weelde (Antwerp) for storage. There they are waiting for a buyer. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was instructed to look for interested parties. Yesterday it emerged that the Philippines were a possible purchaser. The facilities at Bierset will be transferred to the Army's light aircraft unit. It will become the base for the Agusta A109 helicopters and the Alouettes which have been brought back from bases in Germany. This year, two of the Air Force's five logistical units will also disappear. Only the "maintenance," "communication," and "support" wings will remain on the Evere base. The Air Force chief of staff announced yesterday that in the coming months 31 F-16s will also be transferred to Weelde. These planes are to be withdrawn from active service due to the cutbacks announced in July 1993. The Air Force also wants to sell these aircraft. One plane will be stationed in Saffraanberg (St. Truiden) and serve as teaching material. The military training center in Koksijde will close in June due to the abolition of compulsory military service. The last conscripts will then receive their training in Florennes or Kleine Brogel, depending on their linguistic roles. The Defense Ministry will soon centralize the basic training of all Air Force personnel in Saffraanberg. [passage omitted]
