FR941021-0-00168 FR941021-0-00022 c. Out-of-band interference to RAS from secondary downlinks in the 1.6 GHz band. 114. In the Notice, we proposed to codify the Committee's recommendations to eliminate potential harmful out-of-band interference to RAS from secondary MSS downlinks operating at 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz. 142 The Committee recommended that such operations be restricted to frequencies separated by the upper edge of the RAS band by at least 2.2 MHz, that MSS downlink emissions be filtered aboard the spacecraft, that frequencies be selectively controlled and that an analysis and testing program be conducted in cooperation with the radio astronomy community. Based on its deliberations, the Committee proposed that we adopt rules governing use of the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band that limit out-of-band emissions so that they do not exceed ^238 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at non-VLBA sites and ^198 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at VLBA sites. 142 Notice, supra note 2, at para. 51; see also proposed ยง25.213(a)(2). 115. Motorola argues that the limits proposed in the Notice are too rigid and would unduly constrain MSS operations. 143 In support, Motorola contends that those limits were devised originally using assumptions that are not applicable to Big LEO operations. For example, Motorola notes that the calculations assumed an immobile, continuous interference source, whereas secondary MSS downlink LEO operations would present an intermittent source. Further, Motorola notes that although the Committee reached a consensus on a recommendation regarding limits, it did not agree on a proposed rule to govern Big LEO MSS operations. Motorola asserts that instead of adopting specific protection limits applicable to MSS secondary downlinks, the Commission should only restate the general obligation that secondary services not cause harmful interference to primary services. 143 Motorola Comments at 54. 116. LQP and TRW disagree with Motorola. LQP states that our proposal is reasonable and should be adopted. 144 TRW asserts that Motorola's proposal does not adequately consider the needs of the RAS. It states, however, that if secondary downlinks are limited to the 1621.35&hyph;1626.5 MHz band, thereby creating a 7.5 MHz guardband between RAS and secondary MSS, Motorola's proposals would be acceptable. 145 144 LQP Reply at 59&hyph;60. 145 TRW Reply Comments at 74. 117. We recognize the need to protect RAS observations from secondary MSS downlink operations. At this juncture, however, we need not consider specific limits on Big LEO MSS secondary downlinks. Secondary services by definition shall not cause harmful interference nor claim protection from primary services. 146 This provision applies to protection of primary services from both in-band and out-of-band emissions and would apply to secondary MSS downlinks regardless of specified pfd levels. Thus, we see no reason to codify specific pfd limits as proposed in the Notice. We will instead modify proposed ยง25.213(a)(2) to note that secondary MSS downlinks shall not cause harmful interference to primary RAS operations in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band. Further, operators of secondary downlinks will be required to take whatever steps necessary to resolve interference complaints by radio astronomers. We expect that an applicant proposing to operate MSS downlinks in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band will be able to demonstrate in its application that it has sufficient satellite out-of-band emission attenuation to protect adjacent band U.S. RAS operations based upon the frequency separation inherent in the frequency assignment scheme adopted here. 146 See note 21, supra. 118. Finally, Cornell University, Arecibo Observatory, notes its concern that MSS downlink transmissions at 1.6 GHz could have a ``disastrous effect'' on passive space research in the 1610&hyph;1667 MHz band. 147 LQP, in support of Cornell, notes that the Commission must limit MSS downlink transmissions to the 5.15 MHz proposed in the Commission's Notice, that is, to 1621.35&hyph;1626.5 MHz. 148 Motorola responds that ``the 1613.8&hyph;1660 MHz band is not allocated to the RAS on a primary or secondary basis'' and thus is not entitled to protection from secondary MSS downlinks operating outside that band. 149 147 Cornell Comments at 3&hyph;5. The 1610&hyph;1667 MHz band is being used passively, without any allocation, by radio astronomers to observe red-shifted Hydroxyl (OH) emissions. 148 LQP Reply Comments at 59. 149 Motorola Reply Comments at 49.
