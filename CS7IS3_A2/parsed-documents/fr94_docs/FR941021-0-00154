FR941021-0-00154 FR941021-0-00022 34. Some of the applicants also argue that we should require only a demonstration of partial financing. They contend that applicants that have the financing to meet construction and launch costs for the number of satellites needed to provide limited domestic and global service will be able to finance the remainder of their systems with the operating income from these services. Such a position, however, would not promote the global availability of this service. A system that relies too heavily on operating income from its first satellites for its completion could easily become stalled before it is able to provide domestic or global service that meets our service requirements. 49 Any applicant that cannot demonstrate the capability to launch more than a limited number of satellites should not be considered for licensing at the expense of potential entrants that could provide global service and continuous domestic service. 49 See para. 29, supra. 35. Ellipsat comments that we should require applicants relying on internal funds to demonstrate a management ``commitment'' to expend those funds for the Big LEO project. Ellipsat argues that this requirement would put companies with greater capital assets on an even footing with smaller applicants who must rely on ``irrevocable'' outside loan commitments to establish their financial qualifications. As we stated in adopting the domestic-fixed satellite standard, we will not require management to set aside specific funds for the system. We will, however, require applicants relying on internal assets to provide a balance sheet demonstrating current assets or operating income sufficient to meet the space segment costs together with evidence of a management commitment to the project. This does not require an unalterable commitment that the funds will be expended regardless of market conditions. Rather, consistent with our approach to credit arrangements provided by outside sources, management of the corporation providing the funding must commit that absent a material change in circumstances, it is prepared to expend the necessary funds. 50 Those applicants relying on financing from parent corporations must make the same showing with respect to the parent corporation's commitment. 50 See 1985 Processing Order, note 38, supra, at n. 26. 36. AMSC urges that, given the short life of LEO satellites, we should require the applicants to demonstrate the financial capability to build an entire constellation and a fleet of replacement satellites. Although some of the proposed systems use satellites with a short life, a requirement to demonstrate full funding for these before the first generation is built would be exceptionally onerous and unnecessary. We are confident that after constructing and operating a full fleet of satellites, a licensee would have ample incentive and resources to implement replacement satellites, unless there is insufficient demand. In that case, however, the public would not be harmed by discontinuation of the licensee's service. 37. We recognize that applicants may be able to provide the service requirements adopted today with fewer satellites than proposed in the pending applications. In such a case, an applicant has the option of course, to modify its pending application to specify only those satellites necessary to meet our minimum requirements, and its financial and technical showing would need to cover only such a constellation. It could then apply to expand its constellation as originally envisioned, as it attains the financial capability to do so. 38. Consequently, to meet the public interest objective of ensuring prompt initiation of this new satellite service, we adopt our proposed rule that requires each Big Leo applicant to demonstrate the ability to build and launch all satellites for which it has applied, which includes those satellites necessary to fulfill our service requirements, and to operate its system for one year after launch of the first satellite in its constellation. In doing so, however, we shall modify our eligibility requirements somewhat in an effort to achieve greater participation by the applicants in this processing group.
