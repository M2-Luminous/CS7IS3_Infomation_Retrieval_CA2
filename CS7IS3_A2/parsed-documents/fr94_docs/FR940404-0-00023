The regulations are also amended to add Haiti, as a result of the UN arms embargo against it, and to add Sudan. A new provision is added to reflect the qualified embargo of Angola which is set forth in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993 and which is also implemented by the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 64904).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of State is amending the ITAR to reflect that it is no longer the policy of the United States to, pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1, deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in the following countries: Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. With respect to these countries, all requests for approval involving items covered by the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. With respect to Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, this action is taken in response to the great progress made by these countries in transforming themselves from authoritarian, one-party communist regimes to free market democracies. Cambodia is removed from the provisions of ยง126.1(a) as a result of the installation of a new and democratically-elected government, and the end of multifactional civil conflict that plagued the country for over a decade. Section 126.1(a) is amended to add Haiti as a result of the UN arms embargo against it, and ยง126.1(d) is amended to add Sudan, which was designated by the Secretary of State on August 12, 1993 as a country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. A ยง126.1(f) is added to reflect the qualified embargo of Angola which is set forth in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993 and which is also implemented by the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, at 58 FR 64904. This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and this is excluded from the major rule procedures of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193) and the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554. This final rule does not contain a new or amended information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .).
