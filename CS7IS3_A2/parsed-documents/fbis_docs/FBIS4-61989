He said the main focus was on discipline and arms procurement rather than show. The minister went on to say that until recently, there was no regular army as such and the notions such as "brigade, corps or regiment" were used in a loose way leading to Georgia's defeat in the Abkhazian war. "Without a single command center, it is impossible to achieve any success," Nadibaidze said. And he added that to the best of his knowledge, as many as three Georgian commanders were in charge of military operations in Abkhazia. He thinks the national army formed by conscription must consist of six or eight separate contingents (armor, motor rifle, artillery, air, and naval units), 1,000 to 1,500-strong each. "More importantly, they must be mobile and well-trained", said the minister. On the Abkhaz conflict, Nadibaidze said he was in favor of a political rather than military solution with Russian troops playing a major role, especially in providing security guarantees to returning refugees. On the relationship between the Georgian and Russian armies, Nadibaidze said questions of military cooperation were outlined in the appropriate bilateral accords. Initially, this includes the training of Georgian military experts in Russia and supply of weapons and hardware to the national army. "Parts of those joint plants are being implemented," he said. Formerly deputy commander of Russian troops in Transcaucasia, Nadibaidze was nominated by Eduard Shevardnadze and appointed by parliament as the country's new defense minister on 26 April. He was sworn in as minister after a farewell ceremony by Russian troops in Tbilisi on 9 May.
