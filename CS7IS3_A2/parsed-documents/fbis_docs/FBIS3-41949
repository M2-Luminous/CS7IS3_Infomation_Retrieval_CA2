Tanyuk announced that according to his sources, "Kravchuk is planning a big conflict with the parliament. The parliament may be dissolved," he said. He believes that in such a situation new parliamentary elections may not be held. Ukraine signed the Moscow agreement "on its knees," said Tanyuk. This agreement cannot be implemented because Kravchuk is only planning to ask experts to make corresponding estimates. Tanyuk described such actions as "anti-state," and carried out under the pressure of forces which are not interested in Ukraine's development.
