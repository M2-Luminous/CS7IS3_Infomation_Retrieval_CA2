According to this information, Cordero has ties with several private firms allegedly used to launder money. However, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino pointed out that those reports are all intended to tarnish the Panamanian Government's image. Mulino made those statements at a posthumous ceremony honoring former Foreign Minister Julio Linares. [Begin Mulino recording] I am sure the report is politically motivated and is attempting to damage the government's image internally. What they are doing with utter irresponsibility, however, is harming our country. The Spanish magazine does not highlight anything specific on the deputy foreign minister. It only mentions his firm superficially. The problem is a different one in Spain. [end recording] Foreign Minister Mulino said Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero will clarify this information in due time.
