This according to SA [South African] Institute of Race Relations researcher Anthea Jeffrey, who notes the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] position that mediation "will not achieve anything while the election process and its timetables outstrip steps that can be taken to find a comprehensive solution". However, African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela has said the election cannot be postponed, a position endorsed by the National Party [NP]. Ms Jeffrey says that if mediators get the antagonists past this obstacle then two key constitutional issues, plus the demand made by King Goodwill Zwelithini for Zulu self-determination, still need to be resolved. February amendments to the constitution, reflecting the viewpoint of the ANC and the NP, included an increase in the areas of jurisdiction -- although not the legislative powers -- of provinces, and the provision for two ballots in the election. Another amendment enables provinces to determine their own "structures", although not their legislative or fiscal capabilities. Central to the issues which still need to be resolved by mediation is the IFP's position that it will make further concessions -- accepting wide powers of central override in relation to provincial legislative powers -- only if the Freedom Alliance's December 19 "yellow paper" is accepted as a package. The two key issues at the heart of the yellow paper and which require international mediation are: - the current two-phase process for constitution-making; and, - the entrenched devolution of substantial power to provinces. The ANC insists on the former, Ms Jeffrey Notes, but refuses the latter. The IFP insists on the latter but rejects the former. It has said it will concede a two-phase process at national level only if substantial power is given to provinces in the transitional constitution and also entrenched in the final constitution. Substantive, entrenched provincial powers, in the IFP's view, require: - more legislative competance for provinces; - an independent tax base for provinces; - substantial autonomy for provinces in drawing up their own constitutions; and, - entrenchment of provincial autonomy. The ANC, Ms Jeffrey notes, says it and the NP have gone "a long way" towards addressing the Freedom Alliance's concerns, much further than they believed they ought to have gone. The IFP has said the election timetable might need to be revised to give the mediation process enough time and to enable all parties to compete on an equal footing. But, according to ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa, "the election date is engrave in stone. It cannot be changed." If mediation goes ahead despite the repercussions of the recent events in the homelands, Ms Jeffrey concludes, "one of the first and most difficult issues to face international mediators, accordingly, will be procedural rather than substantive: the timescale for mediation and the date for the April election". It was announced in a joint statment this week that the ANC and the IFP had agreed to international mediation "to seek a constitutional settlement between the two parties" and that this should begin as soon as possible. Senior negotiation sources have revealed that former U.S. secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Henry Kissinger will head the mediation commission and British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington will be one of three other men under him. The sources told SAPA the two parties had agreed to abide by the commission's decision.
