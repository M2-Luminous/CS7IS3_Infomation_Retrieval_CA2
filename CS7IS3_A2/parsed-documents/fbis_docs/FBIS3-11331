At 1330, Lieutenant Colonel Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, Major Pedro Emilio Alastre Lopez, Captain Wilmer Barrientos Fernandez, Capt. Miguel Rodriguez Torres, Capt. Luis Henry Jatar, Lt. Oscar Carrizal Flores, Lt. Florencio Porras Equezuria, and Lt. Nicolas Tejas Arrieta were freed. The usual gestures of happiness could be seen among friends and relatives awaiting them at the doors of the San Carlos headquarters from where they were transferred to their respective posts. Only two were discharged: Lt. Urdenta Hernandez and Maj. Alastre Lopez. Reporters waited in vain for two hours for the announced statements by Lt. Col. Urdaneta, who decided to quickly leave the area instead. Only 29 cases remain, and they expect to be pardoned in the coming weeks.
