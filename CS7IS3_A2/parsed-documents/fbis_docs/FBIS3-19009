The occasion for these remarks today was the pope's meeting here with a group of soldiers from a Canadian regiment on its way home from a stint in Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping force. The pope said he wished to underscore his great esteem for the UN forces from diverse nations which are helping to limit, despite extremely difficult conditions, the fighting underway in Bosnia and who are doing everything possible to move that country closer to peace. The pontiff praised their perseverance and dedication in serving as "efficient agents of international solidarity." He told the Canadians that their presence had allowed humanitarian aid to reach populations which had been reduced, "through interminable sieges and fighting," to living under material and psychological conditions pushed to the very limits of what is humanly bearable. Without the presence in Bosnia of United Nations forces, the situation in that war-torn land would be even more tragic than it is already, the pope concluded.
