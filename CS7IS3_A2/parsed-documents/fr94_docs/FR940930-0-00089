FR940930-0-00089 FR940930-0-00016 VII. Regulatory Impact Analysis A. Introduction Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians and suppliers of screening mammography services and equipment are considered to be small entities. This final rule revises interim regulations on Medicare coverage of screening mammography that were published in the Federal Register on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510). Those regulations implemented section 4163 of OBRA '90, setting conditions for coverage for and limitations on screening mammography. In the interim final rule, we presented an analysis of the various effects that the screening mammography benefit would have on beneficiaries, physicians, and suppliers (55 FR 53518). We received no comments on the impact analysis. Below, we present revised estimates of projected Medicare costs and utilization rates and the effects, as far as they can be foreseen, of the changes we have adopted as a result of public comment. Our estimates of projected additional costs and services are lower than those we anticipated when the interim final rule was published in the Federal Register . One explanation for lower than anticipated costs and services for this service may be that physicians have been furnishing screening mammography services but have been billing for the services using the CPT code for diagnostic mammography. We anticipate that Medicare coverage of screening mammography services will result in the following costs: Table I._Projected Budget Impact as a Result of Medicare Coverage of Screening Mammography [in millions] 1‚ê£ 1FY 1995 1FY 1996 1FY 1997 1FY 1998 1FY 1999 Benefit costs $90 $95 $100 $110 $115 Table II._Projected Number of Screening Mammographies Performed as a Result of Medicare Coverage [in millions] 1CY 1995 1CY 1996 1CY 1997 1CY 1998 1CY 1999 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.6 Beginning October 1, 1994, FDA replaces HCFA as the Federal agency responsible for surveying and certifying suppliers of all mammography services, both diagnostic and screening. Beginning on that date, all facilities furnishing mammography services will be expected to meet only one set of national standards. This provision should benefit mammography facilities and help ensure the safety and accuracy of screening mammography services performed under Medicare Part B. The Medicare program will no longer be responsible for funding this cost. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. B. Rural Hospital Impact Statement Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We do not believe small rural hospitals will be required to make any operational changes to comply with this final rule. Therefore, we are not preparing a rural impact analysis because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
