"Estonia intends to make no concession at negotiations with Russia," Luik said while adding that Estonia's Government has been flexible enough by issuing a decree under which retired Russian military can apply for residence permits on individual basis. On commenting possible agreement on Russian troop withdrawal, Luik said that "if the agreement comes, it will certainly come with different terms than the agreement between Russia and Latvia". Russia must consider Estonia's Aliens Law, Citizenship Law and property legislation, Luik added. "In Latvian-Russian agreements we considered positive only the general agreement on troop withdrawal," Luik said. "We did not comment on other agreements," he added. "We do not accept pegging troop withdrawal to other issues." Social guarantees of the retired Russian military are Russia's problem, Luik said. Now, Russia is also covering social expenses of the retired military under a draft being negotiated for already two years, Luik said. "Giving residence permits is entirely Estonia's domestic matter and we decide whom we will give the permit and whom we will not," Luik said.
