We were proceeding from information provided by Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD. Yesterday we asked Mr. Cernak for his comment on the interview with Jaroslav Svechota. [Cernak] I tend to stand behind what I say. That is also why I tend to formulate my statements carefully. At that time, I said in reply to a specific question: "You are on the right track." Today I can only add a few words to my reply: "Explore the matter further." We also asked Interior Minister Pittner for his comment: [Gembicky] Mr. Pittner, there are certain indications that an intelligence agency engaged in the gathering of material against representatives of the government coalition is active in Slovakia. Can you confirm or deny this suspicion? [Pittner] Such activity is inadmissible under the law. But, because there exists a shadow cabinet, an adventurer could perhaps be found to set up such an agency. However, this is a matter to be dealt with by the Slovak Information Service [SIS] and not by the Ministry of the Interior. [Gembicky] The most charming thing about the whole affair is that, according to these indications, Mr. XY, one of the leading SIS officials, is supposed to be a collaborator in this private agency. (We obviously gave his name to the minister, but we cannot publish it for the time being.) It is probably not very realistic to expect [SIS Director] Mr. Mitro's employee to disclose himself.... [Pittner] I repeat that supervision of SIS is not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. A special NRSR commission has been established for its supervision, which is chaired by Mr. Ivan Gasparovic. [Gembicky] Would you consider it appropriate for us to turn to him with these suspicions? [Pittner] Certainly. [Gembicky] So yesterday we sent a fax to NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, who chairs the Special Supervisory Commission for SIS, asking him to reply to the question of whether the commission has availed itself of the information that one of the leading SIS officials is working for a private intelligence agency. We will publish his reply as soon as we receive it. We are thus taking seriously NRSR Deputy Chairman Ludovit Cernak's recommendation: "Explore the matter further."
