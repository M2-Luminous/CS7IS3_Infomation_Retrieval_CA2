Major General Mordekhay was surprised Monday [24 January] night when he was informed by Brigadier General G., commander of the liaison unit, that IDF guns were responsible for shelling the SLA post and the death of the soldier. The mistaken shelling was carried out when terrorists tried to attack the SLA outpost in the 'Alman-al-Shumariyah area. The terrorists lobbed mortars rounds and launched Sagger antitank missiles. In response, the IDF and SLA returned artillery fire, foiling an attempt to overrun the outpost. The investigation has so far shown that the IDF fired many shells at the outpost, and one of them apparently fell inside the post causing the death of the soldier and the wounding of two others.
