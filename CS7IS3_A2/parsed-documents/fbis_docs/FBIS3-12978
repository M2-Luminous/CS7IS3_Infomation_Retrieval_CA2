Do you think this document can end the crisis? [Al-Shu'aybi] In my opinion, documents are not important. What is important is the practical implementation of what was agreed or will be agreed. Once this happens, an objective solution can begin. But where do we stand vis-a-vis documents and treaties? It is well known that the unity agreement itself, according to which the merger took place, has not yet been implemented. This led to the crisis. [Al-Daw] Do you mean past experience shows documents and agreements are not respected? [Al-Shu'aybi] Not absolutely. I can be more specific and say between the YSP and the GPC. [Al-Daw] You said practical implementation can lead to a solution. How can this document be activated to lead to the aspired solution? [Al-Shu'aybi] The matter simply lies in the credibility of the political leadership. Real credibility leads to the aspired solution. [Al-Daw] During the crisis, several problems emerged once again, such as federation, confederation, and division. What is your opinion? [Al-Shu'aybi] First of all, we should admit that the Yemeni reality has transcended the partitioning process. Even the politicians have realized that unity is not a decision signed by leaders, because unity is rooted deep in Yemeni society, both north and south. Any careless decision to divide Yemen will certainly lead to a devastating civil war that might spill out of Yemen in to the entire region. Any other proposals should be presented to the masses in a popular referendum. In any case, temporary solutions lead nowhere and the crisis will continue to persist. [Al-Daw] But the unity itself after more than three years now appears to be unity between two parties. Many issues are still unresolved. The unity has not embodied the people's feelings. [Al-Shu'aybi] I think unity within the framework of the Yemeni people is solid and firmly established. Even the past division was a political one between the authority in the north and the authority in the south. Both are primarily responsible for the consecration of division. Once there is a real national authority, unity will have great prospects. [Al-Daw] Within the framework of unionist popular feelings, do you not believe that the cultural discrepancy between north and south has adversely affected the process of unity? [Al-Shu'aybi] I do not think so. The issue of unity is, north or south, not a subject of discussion among individuals. Even during the partition, the Yemeni citizen rejected division and said he was a Yemeni, and not a southern or northern Yemeni. [Al-Daw] We have learned you sent a memorandum to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih shortly before the signing of the latest document asking him to resign. Do you still insist on this? [Al-Shu'aybi] Nothing has changed. The recent document and its implementation are put to the test and all he can do is resign. This may end the crisis. [Al-Daw] What prompted you to make this appeal? [Al-Shu'aybi] As a politician observing the Yemeni situation after unity, which is over three years old now, I have not sensed any credibility in what he said or did. All he did was throwing dust in the eyes. Democracy continued to be blocked by his personal mood. It has not reflected on the Yemeni situation politically or economically, or even on the unity. [Al-Daw] Accordingly, you consider the president the source of the crisis? [Al-Shu'aybi] If not so, he is largely blamed for it. The leadership should be able to overcome crises. Why is the Yemeni crisis continuing? I admit that there are good and active elements in the GPC, but they have been shackled by the leadership bureaucracy. They were not given the opportunity to do as much as they could. [Al-Daw] Do you think Yemen is living a real democracy? [Al-Shu'aybi] Very regrettably, no. [Al-Daw] Then, how did you dare to present this memo? [Al-Shu'aybi] I have personally tasted the bitterness of political conflicts for about 29 years. I have been to prison and experienced the pains of displacement and deprivation. Nothing is left for me except speaking the truth, whether the rulers liked it or not. Nobody can question my patriotism. This is enough. [Al-Daw] 'Ali Salim al-Bid said Sanaa became an arsenal of weapons. Do you believe this? [Al-Shu'aybi] Certainly. This was one of the most important points in the YSP's memorandum. Sanaa has indeed become an arsenal of weapons. Al-Bid's description was right. Removing the manifestations of these arms from the capital and the other major cities is a pressing need. [Al-Daw] Do you believe the GPC is behind this? [Al-Shu'aybi] Generally speaking, no. This is because, as I said, there are good elements who are against these practices. However, there is a group of people who activate such matters. I wish the GPC was an organized and effective political party that keeps up with developments. Regrettably, however, the GPC is run by leaders whose only interest is scoring political points. [Al-Daw] Financial corruption was one of the GPC's charges against the YSP. Do you share that opinion? [Al-Shu'aybi] It is quite the opposite. Financial and administrative corruption exists in former northern Yemen. I say so, despite our past differences with the brothers in southern Yemen, who used to have a Marxist orientation. The economic situation is a heavy burden for Yemen. Once security is achieved safety will be brought about. But I am afraid that as a result of the financial corruption, Yemen might turn into an Arab Nigeria or an Arab Brazil, so to speak. This is so because the wild beasts in power are primarily interested in looting the Yemeni people's resources. [Al-Daw] Let us discuss the political violence that prevailed in Yemen in the wake of its unity. What is your explanation of all these practices? [Al-Shu'aybi] First of all, we are against political violence. Within the framework of the Liberation Front, we experienced much political violence in the past. We tasted its woes with the YSP, but we were not dragged behind this violence. When Yemeni unity was achieved, we supported this unity with our thought, views, and actions because this was our duty to perform. We also ignored grudges to champion the homeland's interest. I should say here that senior personalities and leaders support political violence. I believe the YSP has known claws, but it abandoned this policy and tried to follow a democratic way. Regrettably, however, the YSP has faced this kind of dirty conflict. [Al-Daw] Does Yemen's tribal structure have any role in creating the conflict? [Al-Shu'aybi] I do not think so. As I said, some parties failed to deal with the political conflict through democratic dialogue, so they resorted to arms. Everyone wants to impose his viewpoint in his way. These parties failed to dispose of their old methods and could not comprehend the change that had taken place or keep pace with the times. [Al-Daw] But how can individuals be disarmed? [Al-Shu'aybi] By awareness and by following the example of others. I recall that during the times of martyr al-Hamadi, people abandoned weapons because they followed al-Hamadi's example, so people regarded any violation as a shame. [Al-Daw] What is the role of the Yemeni Jihad Movement in political violence? [Al-Shu'aybi] It has a great share, of course. It wants to impose its presence in Yemen by violence. Some people power promote this attitude. Naturally, if this support ceases, the movement will lose contact with its roots. [Al-Daw] Is the Yemeni Reform Grouping, led by Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, a facade for the Jihad Movement? [Al-Shu'aybi] This is partly true, despite the fact that there are good elements in the Reform Grouping. However, others aggravate matters to reach a critical point. The YSP mentioned this, and pinpointed the Jihad Movement's camps. The authorities should take a fully clear position on this issue. [Al-Daw] Is there any foreign support for the Jihad Movement? [Al-Shu'aybi] Of course. The fundamentalist movements that recently emerged in the Arab arena are linked with each other. I believe al-Turabi's movement in Sudan is the spearhead. Regrettably, this issue has not yet been discussed seriously in Yemen, either at the level of the leadership, the media, or other levels. [Al-Daw] Do you believe that there is any future for the phenomenon of fundamentalism in Yemen? [Al-Shu'aybi] Whether in Yemen or elsewhere, this is a transitional phenomenon that is the result of transitional circumstances. Yemenis are a Muslim people by nature. They do not accept acts of atonement or violence. [passage omitted] [Al-Daw] Can you shed light on the Liberation Front Party? [Al-Shu'aybi] This party has been a political organization since the days of armed struggle. It consisted of several groups, including the labor conference in Aden, which played a major role in the 26 September revolution. The party received a blow in 1967, so its leaders went abroad. Most of its leaders lived in the former northern Yemen and were not allowed to act. The leadership is still abroad since conditions for its return are not yet opportune. These leaders include Secretary General 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi and 'Abdallah al-Asnaj. We are now trying to reinstate the party. In September, we inaugurated a headquarters in Aden, in addition to the first one. However, and as you know, posts were given to persons who would serve the authorities. We are facing such difficulties. The party, however, exists, even within the framework of the GPC and the YSP; there is 'Ali Ahmad Salamah, who used to head the Liberation Front's Political Bureau. There is also 'Abdallah Mutlaq, and Balin Bin- Raji' Bin-Labbuzah [name as transliterated], who is the brother of the man who unleashed the October revolution, and many others. [passage omitted]
