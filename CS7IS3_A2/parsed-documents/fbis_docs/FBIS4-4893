The Tokyo-based news service, monitoring a KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY [KCNA] dispatch, said the Seventh Meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly was convened with North Korean President Kim Il-song, and his son and heir apparent Kim Chong-il in attendance. The new legislation included the execution of a socialist economic readjustment period ordered in December by the Korean Workers Party and the approval of laws adopted by the assembly's Standing Committee during the assembly's absence. The KCNA report made no mention of any policy initiatives as international demands mount for Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguards inspections and calls for economic sanctions against North Korea continue to grow. The report also gave no indication of any change in the North Korean leadership. Speculation has grown over when the dynastic succession in Pyongyang may occur.
