The city has recently made a decisive decision, that is, except for a small number of backbone enterprises engaging in posts, telecommunications, railways, and roads, the city's 5,000 or so state-owned enterprises will be changed into nongovernmental enterprises by 1995 at the latest. Harbin is the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, and the city's economic situation can be regarded as the epitome of the whole province. Sun Weiben, the provincial party secretary, and Shao Qihui, the provincial governor, are suspected of inefficient leadership and the inability to change the persistent situation of loss-making state-run enterprises, so they were stripped of their "official posts" by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during his recent inspection tour of the three northeast provinces. The posts of provincial party secretary and provincial governor have been taken by Yue Qifeng and Tian Fengshan respectively. Harbin Vice Mayor Zhu Shengchu told reporters at a public occasion in Hong Kong yesterday that the number of loss-making state-owned enterprises in the city had reached a situation where "major surgery" was unavoidable. He said that in 1991, according to an estimate, over 40 percent of the 5,000 state-owned enterprises in the city were losing money, and since last year the figure had risen to 60 percent, while many enterprises have ceased production or are operating at half capacity. Zhu said that the city's plan to change state-owned enterprises to nongovernmental enterprises had won approval from the central authorities, and this was a pioneer move in contemporary China. At present, Harbin has 1.5 million people working in state-owned enterprises and units, and Zhu said that an absolute majority of cadres and workers "welcomed" the above-mentioned reform. Zhu said that Harbin had decided to change more than 5,000 state-owned enterprises in the city--except for a small number of backbone state enterprises engaged in posts, telecommunications, railways, roads, and communications--into nongovernmental enterprises no later than next year. Methods to be adopted will include the joint-stock system, auctions, and leasing to workers or persons in society. This year, Harbin will first begin work to change state-owned enterprises in the four counties of Hulan, Acheng, Fangzheng, and Yilan to nongovernmental enterprises. Early this year, Binxian County took the lead in selling and leasing all 168 state-owned enterprises to society. Some enterprises went to their workers, who bought shares. At present, all of the factories are able to pay wages, and economic returns have greatly improved.
