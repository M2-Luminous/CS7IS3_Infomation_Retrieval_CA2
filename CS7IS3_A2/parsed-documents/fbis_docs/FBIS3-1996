Following the implementation of a new report system for state statistics this year, the State Statistical Bureau will, thanks to the new report system, be able to know the operation of the market economy from statistical information which it regularly collects from grass-roots statistical organs. The implementation of this new system signifies a transformation in China's statistical work; statistical work, which was adapted to a planned economy in the past, will now serve a market economy. The State Statistical Bureau devised this new state statistical report system in line with the requirement for establishing a socialist market economic system and following the revision and simplification of various specialized statistical report systems and of various statistical targeting systems. This new statistical report system enabled the Statistical Bureau to carry out a major reform of the statistical targeting system; to unify standards in statistical work; to smooth out the relationship between specialized statistical departments; to correct the defects of compartmentalization and dislocation formed under a planned economic system which have long plagued specialized statistical departments; and to raise the level of standardization and the regularization of the statistical system as a whole. This new state statistical report system features eight sets of basic statistical report forms for enterprises, institutions, administrative units, and fixed-asset investment units, as well as relevant composite statistical report forms. To coordinate with the application of the new statistical report forms, the Statistical Bureau has also set standards for statistical investigation units, devised a "category and zip code" system for various trades and professions in the national economy, and formulated other statistical standards. A statistics expert pointed out that marketing has been made the centerpiece of the target structure in the new state statistical report system and that the past emphasis on gathering information that reflected the speed of the generation of output value and output amount has now shifted to an emphasis that stresses the collection of information that reflects efficiency -- namely, an emphasis on collecting information on the relations between input and output, on exchange and distribution, on the accumulation of surpluses, on production and marketing, on people, on assets, and on goods. This kind of statistical report should help permit the better understanding of the operations of enterprises which are the main players in market transactions from the angle of macrodecision-making and macroeconomic regulation and control.
