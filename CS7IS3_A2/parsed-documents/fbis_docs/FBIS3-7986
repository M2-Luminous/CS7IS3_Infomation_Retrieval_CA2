How different is the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] from the former state party? Where can we place the MSZP on the list of left-wing formations in Europe? Will the MSZP start restructuring or restoring things if they get into power? We asked former finance minister and current MSZP politician Laszlo Bekesi, whose name is also mentioned as a possible candidate for the position of prime minister. [Szendrei] We cannot find a single party today that does not have some kind of problems or reservations regarding the socialists, while a considerable part of political forecasts mention the MSZP as a potentional governing factor. You are being measured, and possible coalition partners do not seem to hurry to contact you. From the other side, you receive the label of being the successor to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party [MSZMP]. Threatening tones can also be heard, claiming that the communists will come back with you. Preparing for its last congress before the elections, where does the MSZP stand in the left-wing arena used in the Western- European terminology? [Bekesi] First of all about "measuring." The tough quarantine after the elections held in 1990 is the consequence of the demarcations of various intensities and intentions. Most parties won over a considerable number of voters through a tough anti- Bolshevik and anti-leftist propaganda. This worked perfectly in 1990. Of course, in that cast, the MSZP was the undesirable and improper successor party. Most parties think that this anti- communism might also bring votes this year. The third cause can be the essential one: It has become clear that, with very tough and detailed work, the quarantined MSZP preserved its calm and strengthened the professional image that emerged as a nostalgia for the Nemeth cabinet. This feeling is so strong today that all the political parties running in the elections regard the MSZP as their biggest rival. [Szendrei] Do you think that only fear of a socialist victory and the loss of power dominates the evaluation of the MSZP? [Bekesi] The government coalition displays an aversion to us and accuses us of everything because it clearly realized that a considerable part of our society finds the leading energies in the MSZP. It is, therefore, clear to the coalition parties that the MSZP represents the biggest danger against their desire to hold on to power. Therefore, nothing is too costly for them, and they make use of everything, including slander, lies, and the misinterpretation of achievements. Without Sacred Dogmas [Szendrei] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] does not get closer to you either; on the contrary: Viktor Orban sent you a message in the press according to which the MSZP is facing 34 years of opposition. [Bekesi] The liberals, who generally follow the same goals as we do, see us as a rival whose success at the elections would lead to its predominance in a potential coalition. [Szendrei] Would you accept this coalition? [Bekesi] Why would we discard it? Let us stay with the idea that the liberals fear that we, the socialists, could gain the upper hand in the government. However, a social-liberal coalition is the real solution in Hungary. They can only envisage such a coalition if the MSZP can only get a subordinate role. This is their interest. [Szendrei] After all, no matter how we look at it, the MSZP suffered a defeat four years ago. The hope for a comeback is only natural. [Bekesi] There are no revanchist emotions or hopes involved here. The accusation that we are a successor party preparing for the restoration of the old ways is totally unfounded. We are preparing for restructuring, and not for the restoration of the milder phase of the Kadar regime. [Szendrei] Apart from rejecting the accusations, how else can the MSZP get rid of the labels of the past? [Bekesi] Of course, we know that rejecting accusations is not enough. It also transpires from our program that the MSZP is a pragmatic party definitely in favor of modernization, a party that does not stand on ideological bases, and a party that offers recipes for solving the current Hungarian social and economic problems. In addition, to the extent our economic scope allows it, we are also trying to represent classic left-wing values, like solidarity, the reduction of inequalities of chances, and help for fallen strata. [Szendrei] These words coming from socialists make us recall the empty dogma of the past. [Bekesi] I use the aforementioned expressions without fear, because we are definitely not thinking about these values on the level of dogma. The MSZP is not based on an ideology equivalent to the program of the German social democrats in the sixties. We are far rather following the Scharping-thinking characteristic of Western Europe at the end of the 20th century, a reasoning according to which nothing dogmatic is sacred. [Szendrei] This is how communists became socialists? [Bekesi] Neither here nor abroad can people claim that this is some kind of post-communist party with nostalgia, one strengthening and stressing the social democratic roots of the 19th century. [Szendrei] However, along with the increasing sympathy, many people fear that the reviving old political elite is preparing to violate the democracy emerging in the wake of the first free elections. [Bekesi] Such opinions have indeed been voiced. Before listing our counter-arguments, I must firmly declare that there can be people among the politically-active public who reject the left and the MSZP from the outset, but they do not treat the fears and accusations seriously. Obviously, there is such a narrow circle of people, but these people can never be convinced with arguments. They voice their prejudices. [Szendrei] Let us turn to the concrete counterarguments. [Bekesi] In other words, we are the camouflaged communists, the deniers of pluralism and democracy, and even the pioneers of restoration? If the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] or other similar parties did nothing else but review the way they gained power and objectively analyze the period in which the Nemeth cabinet played the leading role, they could read from this the refutal of all the accusations. If they came to an objective conclusion, they would see that it was the post-communist Nemeth cabinet, and not they and the opposition at the time, that laid the basic pillars of democratic restructuring, including the legal, constitutional, and economic pillars. If they took a look at the system of institutions that emerged between 1988 and 1990, institutions that shaped the bases of market economy, they would not continue to be suspicious regarding the sincerity of our decision to change the regime. We formed a two-tier banking system, reduced the budget, liberalized the imports, reduced the subsidies, reduced the political expenses, started the privatization, legislated laws regulating the enterprises, created the stock exchange, and so on.... I cannot list everything now. It is rather difficult to call all this an attempt of the post-communist Nemeth cabinet to preserve the existing and discredited socialism. One can calmly examine the past four years. It transpires from this that the legislative proposals of the MSZP, its parliamentary motions, its attitude, and now its program have always been directed at accelerating the process that has begun, rather than slowing or reversing it. If you find a single element in our program that refers to restoring old ways rather than accelerating the conclusion of the process of restructuring, then there is sense in arguing. Otherwise, all that remains is the labelling, something that is not taken seriously anywhere. [Szendrei] In other words, this is the Socialist Party that wants to build capitalism and not socialism. Who will lead the party? The first three places on the party's list are occupied by former members of the MSZMP Central Committee. [Bekesi] Our program is European. Two out of the three members of the national list were members of the aforementioned Nemeth government. Despite the accusations hurled against him, it would be difficult to say that Gyula Horn was not one of the driving forces of restructuring. Of course, there are also historical lies, but one can also find facts in history. A considerable stratum of young professionals has emerged in the party and its surrounding in the past three years, people who are indeed less known. But every opposition party received little coverage in the media and, thus, new faces find it more difficult to become known. Mistaken Indicators [Szendrei] We have not yet spoken about the third member of the socialist troika, namely Sandor Nagy. A liberal economic policy with trade union support? Some Western-European governments have already failed in this. What will the trade union leaders do if the citizens demonstrate and strike against government measures? [Bekesi] First of all, let us clarify the permanent attributes. The Hungarian economy is struggling with a deep crisis. We have no right or reason whatsoever to provide liberal, social, or conservative labels to the realistic economic policy capable of treating this economic situation. It is either a realistic policy spiced with any ideological elements, or it is unrealistic, and then we can call it by any name. According to my experience, there are not even slight differences between the party programs formulated after a serious analysis; at most, there are differences in phraseology and technical solutions. However, the guidelines are the same in the economic programs of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], or the MSZP alike. I see more decisive differences among the ideological parties. However, I must point out that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is also beginning to become more realistic, precisely as a result of its government experience. Therefore, every labelling is mistaken. [Szendrei] What about the cooperation with the trade unions? They are good in order to obtain power, but it is better for them to remain in the background in the governing activity. [Bekesi] The MSZP has never claimed that the political agreement signed with the trade unions will guarantee a government free of arguments if the socialists participate in the coalition. No one believed even for a moment that the implementation of our economic policy program will not find some opposition points with the trade unions. There will be tough debates. The socialists do not want a trade union government. We cannot allow the trade unions to suppress a rational economic policy in the direction of distribution. However, we must add that the inevitable difficult steps will not succeed without a new social agreement. We, who regard the trade unions as our partners, have more chances than others. [Szendrei] Hopefully Sandor Nagy will not become labor affairs minister.... [Bekesi] You must be kidding. This is impossible. If any trade union leader accepts a position in Parliament or in the government, he will naturally resign from his trade union position. These two positions are incompatible. Besides, trade union leaders work in the parliaments of every European democracy. [Szendrei] Thus, the employees' representatives can clearly see what they can count on. What can the employers hope for? Superficial readers of the program fear that the socialists want to introduce the property tax. [Bekesi] Nothing like that. We are not talking about a property tax; we are talking about taxing the increase in property. This is something totally different. On the other hand, our program contains the elimination of the minimum tax, the restoration of tax benefits for investments, the elimination of tax on the interests of accounts that encourage savings, both forint and hard currency accounts. We are the only ones to say that investment benefits should also be extended to amortization. It is our goal to return the general turnover tax in order to increase housing construction. We say that the share of income and profit taxes should be reduced in the entire tax system. In other words, we would gradually reduce the company and personal income taxes. On the other hand, however, we would tax the final consumption and property increase. This means the inheritance tax on non-productive accumulated luxury property. We would not tax the active property. [Szendrei] The elections are approaching, and then the formation of a government. The socialists met with Miklos Nemeth. The congress in not preparing to name the candidate for prime minister either. Among the rumors, it emerged that your party would accept Gabor Kuncze as prime minister. Your name has also been mentioned. Has the time come to clarify the issue? [Bekesi] The essential thing is that the socialists are concentrating on solving the tasks in the election campaign, and not on distributing the future government positions and nominating the people. Only a coalition government can emerge in Hungary. We can envisage several variations. Therefore, we cannot name a candidate for the position of prime minister now. With this, we would considerably limit the chances of coalition talks. Miklos Nemeth has indeed been considered. He rejected the nomination because of his work in London, and thus we took this issue off the agenda. About Gabor Kuncze I can say that we indeed see the future in the form of a social-liberal coalition. Our programs also match. We say that we need a government that knows its job. Thus, we do not find it impossible to have the politician of a smaller party that wins the election become prime minister. Therefore, we will ask this congress to decide on this matter at a special congress after the elections. [Szendrei] In such a moment, what would you say if they asked you to become prime minister? [Bekesi] This is an academic question.... There could be such a constellation. [Szendrei] Would you accept the position? [Bekesi] A lot of conditions must be fulfilled in order to say yes, but such a possibility cannot be excluded.
