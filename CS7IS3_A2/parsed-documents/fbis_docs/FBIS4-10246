During a news conference the president highlighted the PJ victory in 15 of the country's 23 provinces. The Radical Civic Union (UCR), the main opposition party, which Peronism signed a pact with to reform the Constitution in common agreement, won in three districts. The other districts were won by provincial parties and the Great Front [Frente Grande -- FG], a center-left coalition that rejected the pact. Menem stressed that the agreement with the UCR will be "strictly adhered to" and that "there is not the slightest" danger, despite the force's low performance [preceding word in English]. To his way of thinking, the UCR did well in the elections. Regarding FG's victory strategy in the federal capital, Menem considers that this coalition "correctly interpreted" the message of the people of Buenos Aires. "We will attempt to make certain corrections, because this serves democracy," Menem said. Nevertheless, Menem stressed that Argentina is "not the federal capital. [sentence as received] It is a victory that can be overcome and I want to congratulate them, but we have to reckon with it." Menem said that the FG, which he described as "Marxist and Trotskyite" in mid-campaign, can become an important force at the national level. He did not rule out dialogue with this sector of the opposition. According to the president, the reports of alleged illegal dealings by the official Buenos Aires candidate Matilde Menendez did not affect results in the capital. "Argentines do not vote out of spite," he said. Menem asked himself: "How are we, the winners, going to make self-criticism?" Menem was replying to a question about the bitter election experience, wherein the ruling party won 42 percent of the votes, an amount similar to what was attained in the October 1993 elections to renew parliament. In this connection Menem recalled that Peronism won in the provinces that suffered social outbreaks in 1993, such as Santiago del Estero or San Luis, where Governor Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was involved in a sexual scandal. Regarding the 6 percent who cast blank votes, Menem said that this made no sense in a country where there is freedom and no restrictions.
