According to President Yeltsin, "a vacation is a change in the schedule of work" for him. He said that he was feeling normal after the flu and his trip was not "for treatment but for work." During his vacation, the president intends to work on the definition of a mechanism of implementing the president's message to the Federal Assembly. Within the frame of this project, he will probably be visited in Sochi by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other Russian leaders. Responding a question from ITAR-TASS, Boris Yeltsin said that he would also work "during my vacation on drafting an agreement on civil peace and concord." "Of course, it will not be simple to sign a memorandum of accord, the spectrum of differences is extensive," he said. "Nonetheless I believe that common approaches can be found and an agreement can be signed on their basis." [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0900 GMT on 14 March adds: "Yeltsin reported that he had recently undergone two bouts of influenza and was experiencing some weakness. However, he stressed that he was going to Sochi not for a cure but just for a vacation, and also to work."]
