Kliridhis added that he does not expect anything from his meeting tomorrow with Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. The president said there is nothing new to justify the convening of a National Council meeting. He added: When there is, I will convene it. Asked whether he will stop over in Athens upon his return from Strasbourg where he will address the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly, Kliridhis said this will depend on his schedule.
