FR941202-0-00152 FR941202-0-00014 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary M. Crouter, Special Counsel, Office of the Chief Counsel, RSPA, DOT, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001 (202&hyph;366&hyph;4400) or the RSPA Dockets Unit, (202) 366&hyph;4453, for copies of this final rule or other material in the docket. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 15, 1994, RSPA published a final rule (59 FR 7426) to require operators of gas, hazardous liquid, and carbon dioxide pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, who are subject to 49 CFR part 192, 193, or 195, to implement alcohol misuse prevention programs for employees who perform certain covered functions. On March 15, 1994, RSPA received a Joint Petition for Reconsideration and Request for Clarification (Jt. Pet.) of the final rule from the American Gas Association and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (Petitioners). Discussion of the issues and RSPA's responses follow. 1. RSPA Should Stay the Effective Date of the Final Rule on Alcohol Misuse Prevention Programs Until RSPA Issues Final Rules in Currently Pending Rulemaking Proceedings The Petitioners noted that, in addition to the alcohol misuse rules, DOT also published two proposed rules on the use of alcohol screening devices and the use of blood alcohol tests in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations when an evidential breath testing device (EBT) is not reasonably available. The Petitioners request that RSPA stay implementation of the alcohol misuse rule until such time as DOT issues final regulations concerning screening devices and blood tests. The Petitioners contend that delaying implementation of the final rule does not present a safety issue because the type of alcohol testing required by the rule (e.g., post-accident, reasonable suspicion) is already performed by most natural gas utilities and pipeline operators. The Petitioners note that the proposal on alternate screening devices would allow employers to use them to determine the presence of alcohol and then perform confirmation tests using approved EBTs. With regard to the proposed rule on blood testing, the Petitioners note that the rule would allow blood tests in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations where operators may not have reasonable access to an EBT. The Petitioners are concerned that, to comply with the current final rule, operators will have to purchase EBTs and train operators, or enter into contractual agreements for testing with EBTs, only to learn that DOT has now issued a rule authorizing blood testing. The Petitioners are concerned that pipeline operators will unnecessarily spend thousands of dollars to comply with a rule that may soon be revised. In addition, Petitioners request that, since pipeline operators are not required to conduct pre-employment or random alcohol testing, RSPA should allow blood testing as an unqualified alternative to EBTs. The Petitioners state that in the pipeline industry, where many employees are located at remote sites, there will be numerous situations where operators will not be able to transport quickly an employee to a testing facility or have a breath alcohol technician and equipment readily available. Moreover, the Petitioners contend that mandating the use of EBTs will significantly add to the costs of carrying out alcohol prevention programs, in terms of procuring new equipment, developing training manuals, and instructing employees on their use, even though there exists a real possibility that operators will be unable to use the devices in the majority of testing situations. The Petitioners note that the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 did not apply to the pipeline industry, and therefore RSPA is not constrained by the Act in promulgating alcohol regulations. The Petitioners also note that DOT's regulations attempt to protect employees from the invasiveness of blood testing, by requiring the use of EBTs. Petitioners contend, however, that the need for protection is most necessary in a random test, where the employee has done nothing to warrant being singled out for testing. In contrast, Petitioners state that, in the case of a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test, employee protection ``is counterbalanced by the need to establish if alcohol use is a threat to safety or has played a role in an accident.''
