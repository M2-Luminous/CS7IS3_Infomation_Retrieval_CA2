For decades there had never been any double-digit losses for any party at German Landtag elections. The first time this happened was at the elections in Bremen in September 1991, when the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] plummeted from 50.5 to 38.8 percent, a decline of 11.7 percent. Two years later the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] lost 10 percent in the elections in Hamburg. Now virtually devastating defeats are in the offing for the CDU in eastern Germany. In all likelihood, it will sink like a plane whose engines have failed at the Landtag elections there. At the moment its losses, compared with the Landtag elections of 14 October 1990, are between 13 percent in Brandenburg and 21 percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, as a poll conducted by the Bielefeld Emnid Institute for DER SPIEGEL at the beginning of February showed. According to this poll, the CDU has lost 1.2 million voters. In three laender the party lost half of its followers. It keeps only meager remnants of 20 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, 17 percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and 16 percent in Brandenburg. There is no western land where the CDU is as weak; even in Hamburg it gets as much as 25.1 percent. In Thuringia, too, where the CDU missed the absolute majority in the Landtag by only one seat in the 1990 elections, it has now fallen behind the SPD. Only in Saxony, where in 1990 one out of two people voted for the CDU and just one out of five for the SPD, the CDU is the strongest party, according to Emnid. However, the distance between CDU and SPD has shrunk from 34.7 percent at the previous elections to 8 percent now. The reason for this debacle: Too many people trusted Chancellor Kohl, who won the election campaigns in 1990 with the promise that the former GDR would turn into "flourishing landscapes within four or five years." Already a few weeks later the mood sobered. At the beginning of March the CDU had sunk to 24 percent in eastern Germany, and even though there have been a few fluctuations since then, it has never recovered from this low. In Saxony Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf has not been able to prevent his party's losses, only reduce them. And he managed that only because he is one of the most popular German heads of government. Saxony's CDU voters revere him like their compatriots used to revere August the Strong [1670-1733, elector of Saxony]. He reached plus 4.1 on the plus 5/minus 5 popularity scale -- more is hardly possible, not even President von Weizsaecker gets such excellent marks. Even Saxony's SPD voters like the CDU head of government better than the head of the SPD opposition in the Landtag. For many Saxons the head of government is rather removed from everyday politics. If one asks about Biedenkopf's policy, far more men and women express a positive view than if one asks about the policy of the land government -- as if the minister-president did not sit in government but rested on a throne above it. According to Emnid, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] declined from 8 percent in July 1993 to 5 percent in October 1993 and to 3 percent now. However, even if it got into the Landtag again, the CDU and the FDP together would not get the majority. From today's point of view, Biedenkopf could only enter into a grand coalition with the SPD; unless he allied himself with the Greens -- which is more a subject for soothsayers than for analysts at the moment. In Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania a change of power will very likely take place after the elections. In Brandenburg, where Manfred Stolpe is as popular as Biedenkopf in Saxony, the SPD won so many new followers that it will probably no longer need two partners for a majority but can choose between the Greens and the FDP. Not only in Saxony is the FDP worse off in 1994 than it was in 1990. Apart from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg, it has lost strongly everywhere. While it seems to be certain that it will remain in the Bundestag (currently 8 percent each in east and west), it must struggle for survival in at least two Landtag elections. In contrast to general assumption, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] does not have far more followers than in the past all over the former GDR but only in Brandenburg. The Greens have improved their position and can hope for double-digit results in all laender. It is also new that the Republikaner are slightly below or above 5 percent in four laender. Polls such as the current one -- with 2,500 people polled, distributed equally and representatively across the five laender -- do not allow for precise forecasts for smaller parties. Therefore, 3 percent does not mean the certain end of the FDP in Saxony, and 5 percent for the Republikaner in Thuringia and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania does not mean certain success. Some results of the poll even permit the conclusion that the Republikaner have more or less exhausted their potential and will, in the end, fail in all five Landtag elections: Only a few isolated followers of other parties cited the Republikaner, when they were asked which party they like "second best." Large majorities put it in "the last place." Apart from their own followers, only a very few of those polled would "welcome" the success of the Republikaner. And, in the east, the PDS is the protest party; it collects many dissatisfied and disappointed people, in addition to ultrareactionaries. The only alarm signal: Among the younger voters between 18 and 30 there are far more followers and sympathizers of Schoenhuber's party than there are among the older voters. The election campaign has not yet begun in the five laender. The Landtage will be elected in Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June, in Saxony and probably also in Brandenburg on 11 September, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia (just a the Bundestag) on 16 October. However, things will probably not change very much until then, because "right now there is not the slightest indication of new developments," Emnid expert Klaus-Peter Schoeppner notes. For many months unemployment has been the main topic in the east; in contrast to the west, no other problem -- such as the large number of asylum-seekers -- has been accorded similar importance. And for quite some time it has not been the CDU but the SPD that is considered to be the party "best able to combat unemployment."
