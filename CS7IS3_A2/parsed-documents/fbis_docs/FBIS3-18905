We are continuously coordinating with UN mediator Cyrus Vance and European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek. We have good faith, a desire to achieve a solution, and optimism. This is how Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed the European Parliament [EP] plenary session in Strasbourg, presenting the latest developments in Skopje [The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Papoulias was speaking just a few hours before his important meeting with Vance tomorrow. The foreign minister briefed the deputies on the issue of Skopje and clearly presented the Greek positions and the reasons that led the government to adopt measures against Skopje. Referring to Skopje's continuing aggression, Papoulias described the measures as an extreme means of self-defense toward this Republic's intransigence and expansionist designs. Van Den Broek, who has taken over the effort to approach Athens and Skopje, stressed he is in continuous contact with the two sides. He added that in coordination with the United Nations, efforts are being made for a peaceful settlement of the problem. Referring to the measures that the government adopted unilaterally against Skopje, Van Den Broek stressed that they equal trade sanctions and concern the EU. The commissioner said he hopes the measures will be lifted soon and that both sides will make efforts to resolve the problem. Concluding, Van Den Broek said that Skopje depends on Greece financially but that stability in Skopje is in Greece's best interest. In their majority, the representatives of the political groups said they oppose the Greek measures and asked the Greek Government to lift them. They also asked Skopje to remove the symbols from the flag and change its Constitution. Replying to questions from the deputies, Papoulias stressed that Greece does not want tension in the area, and that it has always been and continues to be a factor of stability in the Balkans. He said: Our side is ready to overcome the current tension with preliminary discussions, but [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov must also show goodwill.
