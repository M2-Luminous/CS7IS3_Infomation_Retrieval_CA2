Klaus considers the high state revenue of about 357 billion crowns "an extraordinary success," especially since 1993 was the country's first year of existence, and during the year radical tax reforms were instituted. He cautioned that the data are not yet definitive because until January 15 the state can receive bills for 1993, but only for relatively small sums. He added that the gross national product (GNP) growth for 1993 was about zero percent. Klaus stated that the funds from the budget surplus would not be used for advances on reparations for Czech victims of the Nazis, as proposed by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. That proposal has not yet been submitted for "serious" discussion, Klaus said.
