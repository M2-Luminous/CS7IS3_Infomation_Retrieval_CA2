FR940616-0-00003 FR940616-0-00001 (c) If an appellant or an intervenor files a petition or cross petition for review of an initial decision ordering interim relief, upon order of the Clerk of the Board the agency must submit evidence that it has provided the interim relief required (or, where applicable, the evidence specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and it must submit the name of the official responsible for compliance. The agency's failure to submit acceptable evidence of compliance with the interim relief order is a basis for the Board to order the withholding of the salary of the responsible official pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(A) and 5 CFR 1201.183(c). This sanction is in addition to the dismissal of an agency petition or cross petition for review provided for in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. * * * * * 3. Sections 1201.116 through 1201.119 are redesignated as §§1201.117 through 1201.120, and a new §1201.116 is added to read as follows: §1201.116 Appellant requests for enforcement of interim relief. (a) Before a final decision is issued. If the agency files a petition for review or a cross petition for review and has not provided required interim relief, the appellant may request dismissal of the agency's petition. Any such request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board within 25 days of the date of service of the agency's petition. A copy of the response must be served on the agency at the same time it is filed with the Board. The agency may respond with evidence and argument to the appellant's request to dismiss within 15 days of the date of service of the request. If the appellant files a motion to dismiss beyond the time limit, the Board will dismiss the motion as untimely unless the appellant shows that it is based on information not readily available before the close of the time limit. (b) After a final decision is issued. If the appellant is not the prevailing party in the final Board order, and if the appellant believes that the agency has not provided full interim relief, the appellant may file an enforcement petition with the regional office under §1201.182. The appellant must file this petition within 20 days of learning of the agency's failure to provide full interim relief. If the appellant prevails in the final Board order, then any interim relief enforcement motion filed will be treated as a motion for enforcement of the final decision. Petitions under this subsection will be processed under §1201.183. Dated: June 10, 1994. Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board.
