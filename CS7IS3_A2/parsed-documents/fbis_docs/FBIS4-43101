It has also been established that the Hizballah organization secures the funds it needs from the donations made to the mosques, the charges for Koranic courses, and the fees paid for Koranic recitations and requiems for the deceased. It also selects its recruits from among the students who attend the Koranic courses and fundamentalist individuals who live in the organization's boarding houses. The operations that have been carried out against the Hizballah organization, which has become known for the unresolved crimes in southeastern Anatolia, have recently begun to yield results. The Diyarbakir State Security Court has established that the Hizballah has selected the mosques as its individual centers. Meanwhile, the Turkish Grand National Assembly Commission on Unresolved Crimes has decided to ask the Directorate of Religious Affairs to inform the commission on Hizballah's organization plan. The commission will meet today to be briefed by one of the directorate's officials on how Hizballah uses the mosques to get organized and the measures that have been taken against its activities. The indictments made by the Diyarbakir State Security Court Prosecutor's Office have outlined in detail Hizballah's objectives, the plan it applies to get organized, and the methods it uses to acquire funds and recruit new militants. The indictments 1994/309 and 1994/318, which have been drawn up against the militants arrested by the security forces in their recent operations, disclosed that the Hizballah organization appeared on the scene for the first time in al-Biqa' Valley in 1982. It adopted the model of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The indictments said the Hizballah is sympathetic not only to the followers of the Shiite sect but also to those of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Maliki orders. They described that organization as having a "heterogeneous" structure. The indictments noted that one objective of the Hizballah organization is to establish a theocratic Kurdish State in several provinces in eastern and southeastern Turkey. Regarding that organization's structure, the indictments outlined the following: "It has been established that the person responsible in each mosque describes the militants as the `mosque community;' the militants are recruited from among those who attend the mosques and the students who follow the Koranic courses; the religious training given to the militants under the guise of `religious discussions' is aimed at informing them of the structure and functions of a fundamentalist state; the Hizballah has organized itself in mosques in several provinces and districts; the head of a Hizballah committee in a mosque is named as the `person in charge of that mosque' and he is also in charge of the area where that mosque is located; the Hizballah militia are named as `community members;' a strict hierarchy system and discipline exists among the militants; the organization maintains continuity; and the person in charge of the largest mosque in a province or district is the most authoritative Hizballah member in that province or district." According to the Diyarbakir State Security Court, the Hizballah organization acquires the funds it needs as follows: "The organization receives a share from the donations that are made to the mosques and the Koranic courses. It also secures funds from the organization's publications, donations from the families of deceased people, charitable activities, fees paid for Koranic recitations and requiems for the deceased, and extortion from businessmen." The Diyarbakir State Security Court has established that the Hizballah organization recruits its militants from among the young men who attend the Koranic courses and the profundamentalist individuals who live in the organization's boarding houses.
