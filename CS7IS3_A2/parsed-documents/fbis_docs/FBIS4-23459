According to the high-placed ECOMOG sources, the motive behind the secret agenda is to effect the arrest of several key NPFL officials in Monrovia, including Vice Chairman Isaac Musa, NPFL chief negotiator John T. Richardson, and others, falsely associating them with the hidden arms racket. According to ECOMOG sources, these diabolical lies were brought to their attention by a certain official of the NPFL cabinet within the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government], who continues to demonstrate insincerity in disguise to undermine the NPFL. The NPFL says it has identified this minister in question and is questioning his motives for continuously promulgating lies and deception against the interests of the NPFL. The leader of the NPFL, President Charles Gankay Taylor has strongly warned that if such a diabolical plan is carried out with the view of keeping Liberia continuously occupied by Nigeria, and its officials arrested in Monrovia, this will lead to the immediate resumption of war in Liberia.
