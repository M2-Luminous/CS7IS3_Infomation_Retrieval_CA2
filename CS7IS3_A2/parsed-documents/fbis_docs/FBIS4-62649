A. Starikov, general director of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgy Combine joint-stock company, and Professor M. Isayev, a prominent Urals economist, were elected to the upper chamber of the Russian legislature. Unfortunately, Army General V. Varennikov, Hero of the Soviet Union, who was nominated by the oblast's communists, could not garner the requisite number of votes. But the southern Urals' voters were wise enough to vote down the candidate of the extreme right -- Conservative Republican Party Chairman L. Ubozhko, a staunch anti-communist. In the oblast Duma elections, supporters of the "For Urals Revival" opposition movement under P. Sumin, former Russian people's deputy and chairman of the oblast council, won a majority of votes. The oblast legislature will be clearly Soviet both in its lineup and its spirit.
