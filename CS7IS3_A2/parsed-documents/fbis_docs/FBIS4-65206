Dh.: "Celso Amorim's Visit in France: Brazilian Foreign Minister Wants His Country To Become a Member of the Security Council"] [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, on an official visit in Paris from 6 to 8 May, argued that "expansion" of the UN Security Council [UNSC] should not be limited to "northern developed countries" such as Germany and Japan. Mr. Amorim felt that Brasilia's wish was well received in Paris. France now recognizes that the Germans and the Japanese must one day be given a permanent seat. Would it therefore not be time to take in the world's 11th economic power on behalf of the developing countries in the southern hemisphere? [French Foreign Minister] Juppe turned a willing ear to Mr. Amorim's arguments. It may be that Paris is only trying to delay as much as possible the inevitable expansion process by increasing the number of candidates, thus making the process more complex. Paris believes that while permanent member status confers a number of rights as well as increased international prestige, it also implies "duties." One such "duty" is obviously to take part in peacekeeping operations whenever possible. To begin with, the two "natural" candidates (Germany and Japan) must meet certain criteria, including constitutional ones. Nevertheless, France believes that including a major Third World country would make for a more balanced council. What remains to be done then is selecting the lucky one. Other northern and southern "major developing countries" have applied for membership as well.
