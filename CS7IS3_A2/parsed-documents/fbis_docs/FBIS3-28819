FBIS3-28819 "dreas030__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-030-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Rejects Clinton Remark on Exchange Rate OW1302120794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Feb 94 Evening Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1302120794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] President Clinton reportedly said on 11 February that foreign exchange rates will be included in the "objective criteria," designed to measure Japan's progress in liberalizing its market. In this regard, the Japanese Government and the Bank of Japan [BOJ] are strongly denying the possibility of introducing the objective criteria, saying: "The exchange rate should be determined according to the fundamentals (basic economic conditions) and the U.S. monetary authorities share the same idea." Saying that "we will fulfill our role as the monetary authorities if the exchange rate significantly responds to political factors," the BOJ is prepared to intervene in the market by selling yen and buying dollars should the value of the yen increase further at the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market. Regarding the President's remark, the BOJ points out that the President "merely explained a general view that the exchange rate has an impact on the trade imbalance." In this way, the BOJ is saying that it is impossible to introduce the objective criteria. The President's remark implicitly indicates his intention to induce Japan's concession by hinting at the possibility of using the card called "inducing sharp appreciation of the yen" once again because the Japan-U.S. summit talks failed to produce any progress. Officially, the government and the BOJ are faking calm, saying that it is also undesirable for the United States to incite further increase in the yen's value against the dollar because it will eventually lead to "a rise in long-term interest rates in the United States." However, a further increase in yen's value will also decrease business confidence and might negate the effect of the economic stimulus package.
