Stanek was commenting in reaction to the decision by the American EX-IM Bank to provide guarantees for the completion of Temelin. Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia, started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are involved in the project. The Ministry's positive attitude is conditioned by the passing of a nuclear law, an energy law, and laws on the plant's decommissioning, insurance against possible nuclear damage and state supervision of nuclear material, Stanek announced. The EX-IM Bank does not observe the rules it requires in other cases, Jindrich Petrlik, a representative of the environmental groups Duha (Rainbow) and Deti Zeme (Children of the Earth), stated. The projects for which the loans were granted should be in line with Americans standards, he said, adding that Temelin plant does not comply with them. The activities against granting the guarantees for the loan to complete Temelin plant will be continued also in the United States and Greenpeace hopes that the congress will not recommend providing guarantee for the loan, Vera Frankova, the Greenpeace spokeswoman, told CTK. The board of the EX-IM Bank approved guarantees for loans on American export worth $317 million for the completion and modernization of the safety equipment for Temelin plant, originally Soviet-designed. The EX-IM Bank must hand the whole project to congress which has 35 days to assess any transaction of the bank regarding nuclear energy before.
