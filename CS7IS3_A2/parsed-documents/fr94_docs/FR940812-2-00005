FR940812-2-00005 FR940812-2-00004 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: 1995 Census Test &hyph; Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) Independent Listing. Form Number(s): DG&hyph;1302, DG&hyph;1314, DG&hyph;31. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 750 hours. Number of Respondents: 30,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 1.5 minutes. Needs and Uses: Prompted by the need to improve estimation techniques during the decennial census, the Census Bureau has developed the Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) approach. This approach will be tested in the 1995 Census Test. The ICM test will utilize a separately sampled group of blocks within the test sites which will be independently listed before the census test is conducted. The results of the independent listing will be compared to the housing unit list resulting from the census test in a 3&hyph;step process: first, computer matching, next, clerical matching, and finally, a reinterview to reconcile differences between the two lists. This reconciliation will identify both housing units missed and those erroneously included in the census test. This request is for OMB clearance of the listing phase of the ICM test. The remainder of the ICM approach&hyph;&hyph;the reinterview phase&hyph;&hyph;will be submitted to OMB separately. The ICM approach supports one of the 1995 Census Test objectives&hyph;&hyph;to use sampling and statistical estimation to reduce the differential undercount and census costs. Results of this test of the ICM approach will be applied to the Year 2000 Decennial Census. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: August 8, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
