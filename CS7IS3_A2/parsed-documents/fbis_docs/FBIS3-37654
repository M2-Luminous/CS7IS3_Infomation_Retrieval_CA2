The press service of the Russian Federation president has reported that Boris Yeltsin mentioned "a certain normalization of the situation around Sarajevo which is due, among other things, to the deployment of a contingent of the Russian blue helmets in the area." The Russian president and the chancellor of the FRG said it was important that the states interested in a settlement in Bosnia should come out with political initiatives. They expressed a hope that concrete suggestions on developing the settlement process will be drawn up at the meeting of the heads of diplomatic departments of Russia, the European Union, and the United States on 22 February 1994 in Bonn. According to Boris Yeltsin, Russia sees the following three main tasks in Bosnia: - to strengthen positive developments in Sarajevo and work toward transferring the town to UN administration; - to take measures aimed at strengthening other security zones in Bosnia; - to achieve the signing of an agreement on peaceful settlement throughout Bosnia on the basis of the EC plan by three Bosnian sides. The telephone conversation was initiated by Helmut Kohl.
