This instrument, developed as an ``863-308'' State High-Tech Plan (Information Expert Topical Area) project, will provide a key new measurement and monitoring means for atmospheric comprehensive peace [i.e. nuclear test-ban] monitoring. Compared to the differential satellite imagery moving monitoring (DIMM) instrument developed by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the Chinese instrument meets late-8Os international standards. The instrument is designed to measure atmospheric coherence length r by a double-optical-path satellite imagery moving differential method and to measure isoplanatic angle theta by a satellite light scintillation method. The prototype AIOFM instrument, completed in July 1992 and incorporating advanced technologies such as CCD detectors and real-time computerized data processing, has been in trial use at the Yunnan Observatory. Scientists there obtained over 2000 sets of data (measurements of r and theta) on 20 different nights. Recently, measurements of r and theta via integration of Cn(h) data obtained by a temperature ripple sonde were taken in Hefei simultaneously with measurements taken in Yunnan via the new method: the average values of the two sets of data differed by only 7 percent.
