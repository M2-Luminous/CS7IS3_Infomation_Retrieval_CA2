Research support should be extended to the use of new ideas in pilot products. This was the view of Guenter Rexrodt, Federal Minister for Economics, and Hans Wohlfart, the president of the Working Association of Industrial Research Associations (AiF). Technology policy of the traditional pattern has often been inadequate, said Rexrodt. A comprehensive innovation policy must include the entire sequence of the innovation process from the discovery of the idea up to market readiness, he said. Speaking at the annual AiF meeting in Cologne, the FDP politician Rexrodt advocated a basically new approach in this direction in order to facilitate the conversion of research results into new products. Wohlfart too said that the efforts of the state and industry must lead to usable innovations. He urged that pre-competitve organized industrial cooperative research should be supplemented by supporting applications research, related to products and processes, in small and medium companies. This support could start from the results of cooperative research and extend as far as pilot applications. Moreover, Wohlfart appealed to politicians to raise the support for cooperative research from the current 170 million German marks [DM] to the actual need of about DM250 million, and to eliminate the freeze on expenditures for 1994. Rexrodt said that the budget freeze would not burden cooperative research. In view of the forty-year existence of the AiF, Rexrodt, Wohlfart, and Tyll Necker, the president of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), stressed how this instrument of industrial cooperative research has proven itself. In 1950, Ludwig Erhard, then the Minister for Economics, provided DMl million in his budget for the first time for "strengthening the capability of small and medium industry." In 1954, 20 research association of various industrial branches joined to form the autonomous organization AiF. During the past four decades, more than 10,000 projects have been financed with more than two billion marks of public funds and at least twice as many from industry's own funds, Wohlfart said. The basic elements of cooperative research--cooperation of companies in research associations and availability of the results without charge--have proven themselves in the new laender as well, according to Wohlfart. In the new laender, 3000 medium and small enterprises and 34 research institutes have become members of AiF associations. Four new research associations from eastern Germany have broadened the spectrum of industrial branches. As a project manager, the AiF administers one-third of the federal government's subsidies for the new laender. The federal research aid for the new laender was well received by small firms in particular, according to AiF. Stabilization at a low level was unmistakable, said Wohlfart, who himself is the business manager of a textile company in Saxony. However, eastern German small business had too little capital to be able to do research themselves. For this reason, continuity of state research aid was all the more necessary, he said. Rexrodt feels that a critical examination of AiF processes and instruments is necessary. He asked whether the right research projects are being supported and whether the distribution of means is still flexible enough to keep up with the rapid pace of worldwide innovation. Wohlfart also felt that it was important to simplify and streamline AiF administrative procedures. Important progress has already been made in this area, he said.
