At a cabinet meeting in the afternoon, the government decided to send a 20-strong advance team in early August if things go well after the National Assembly approves the decision. The main body is scheduled to be dispatched in mid-September, according to ministry officials. The medical unit will replace a Swiss Medical Service Unit that has operated there since September 1992, establishing a central medical office in the Laayoune region where the West Sahara PKO (Minurso) headquarters are located. The ministry was asked by the United Nations to send a medical unit to the West Sahara last February, and it has since carried out a joint on-the-spot survey with the Foreign Ministry to report to related ministries. The United Nations established the West Sahara PKO headquarters in September 1992. Currently, 490 people from 27 countries are engaged in PKO activities, supervising the truce in the region and preparing a referendum. The West Sahara was under the rule of the Moroccan royal family until 1884, when Spain colonized the region. As soon as the Spanish withdrew in 1976, the Moroccan Government claimed dominion over the region while the West Sahara Liberation Front sought independence, leading to a dispute.
