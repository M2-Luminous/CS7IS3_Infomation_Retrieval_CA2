FR940404-0-00037 FR940404-0-00015 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL 4855&hyph;5] North Carolina; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate Final Rule. SUMMARY: North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions contained in rules promulgated between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster II. These requirements are listed in Section B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the North Carolina hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for North Carolina's program revisions shall be effective June 3, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on North Carolina's program revision application must be received by the close of business, May 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of North Carolina's program revision application are available during normal business hours at the following addresses for inspection and copying: North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources, Hazardous Waste Branch, PO Box 27687, Raleigh, North Carolina 27611&hyph;7687; U.S. EPA Region IV, Library, 345 Courtland Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;4216. Written comments should be sent to Al Hanke at the address listed below. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Al Hanke, Chief, State Programs Section, Waste Programs Branch, Waste Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;2234. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270. B. North Carolina North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984, (49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final authorization effective March 28, 1994, for RCRA I (59 FR 3791, January 27, 1994). On September 27, 1993, North Carolina submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, North Carolina is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Carolina. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 4, 1994. Copies of North Carolina's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective June 3, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements promulgated between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, for the requirements of RCRA Cluster II. This would include all rules except for the Technical Amendments and Administrative Stay for the Boilers and Industrial Furnaces rule noted at the end of this section.
