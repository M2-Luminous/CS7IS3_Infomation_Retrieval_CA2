Dispute on Outside Control Continues"] [Text] The Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety (RF Gosatomnadzor) held a news conference devoted to the state and problems of ensuring safety at facilities around Russia that constitute a nuclear and radiation hazard (according to Gosatomnadzor, they number 14,500 today). The major part of RF Gosatomnadzor chairman Yuriy Vishnevskiy's address dealt with problems that had arisen in relations between the organization he heads and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. According to Yu. Vishnevskiy, the problems boil down to the fact that, despite the repeatedly confirmed decisions made by the Russian Federation president, Defense Ministry chiefs are preventing the establishment of state oversight over the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's nuclear and radiation hazardous facilities. The situation at these facilities, Yuriy Vishnevskiy believes, is very serious: There have been instances of nuclear materials having been stolen and people overexposed. Rear Admiral Nikolay Yurasov, chief of the Russian Navy nuclear safety inspection, commented in an exclusive interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Defense Ministry's stance on the given question. [Vaganov] The commander in chief of Russia's armed forces -- the Russian Federation president -- made a political decision: to provide for nondepartmental control at Defense Ministry nuclear facilities. Why is Gosatomnadzor not allowed in these facilities? [Yurasov] From the moment the RF Gosatomnadzor was formed, we invited their specialists right away, and they worked at our facilities. But when the process of approving documents began, a number of problems cropped up. [Vaganov] With what are they connected? [Yurasov] These questions affect not only the Defense Ministry as a departmental organ. In the first place, they are connected with state security problems, problems of breaking up the Russian Federation Defense Ministry structures already created for these same purposes. We also disagree with those requirements on provision of information put forward by Gosatomnadzor. But we are working with them, and, I think, will come to an agreement after all. [Vaganov] The Gosatomnadzor chairman has stated he still does not know the details of the theft of one kg of fissionable materials from a military base in Murmansk in 1993. What do you know about this? [Yurasov] We do not know the details either. The prosecuting bodies taking part in investigating this case have not given us any additional information. [Vaganov] How would you comment on yet another statement of the Gosatomnadzor chairman: departmental control in principle cannot be more effective than state control. [Yurasov] Mr. Vishnevskiy expressed himself somewhat differently: Owing to the fact that departmental control exists and the nuclear fleet's problems have (he said) not been solved. I radically disagree with him. The fleet's problems have been known to everyone and for a long time. Beginning in 1988 -- I state it with all responsibility -- the CPSU Central Committee general secretary, the USSR president, and all chairmen of governments were aware of these problems. In accordance with Russian Federation president's directive No. 224 of 9 April 1993 on the incident in Tomsk-7, Gosatomnadzor was directed to conduct an inspection of all hazardous zones at nuclear facilities of all agencies, including those of the Defense Ministry. An interdepartmental commission was set up with RF Gosatomnadzor representatives also as its members. A report was elaborated on the results of this commission's work that was signed by Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. This report is now being looked at in the government. Unfortunately, Mr. Vishnevskiy refused to add his signature to this document for formal reasons. Let the respected Mr. Vishnevskiy say, which question in the area of nuclear safety of Russian Federation Defense Ministry facilities are unknown in the government? Should there be financial means, we will do all that depends on us. The thing is that out of the two directives adopted in connection with ensuring safety of nuclear facilities last year, one received no financial backing at all, and the other as little as 15 percent.
