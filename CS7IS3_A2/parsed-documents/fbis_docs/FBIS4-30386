He said that although the idea of GTs, aimed at accelerating sub-regional economic growth, has not progressed in these areas, it was a matter of time before there was greater collaboration and collective action with ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. Most regional trade and investment links had been chiefly among countries in ASEAN and North-East Asia and a lot more needed to be done within the non-ASEAN Southeast Asian countries, he said when opening the fourth Southeast Asia roundtable on economic development growth triangles in South-east Asia, organised by the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) here Monday. Mustapa said while ASEAN was home to some of the fastest growing economies, it was also home for a number of poorer states, thus there was a need to step up growth in the slower regions as the faster ones surge ahead. ASEAN has, within a short span of time, seen the emergence of several successful GTs such as the Batam Triangle or Sijori involving Singapore, Malaysia's southern Johor state and Indonesia's Riau, the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand GT (IMT-GT) as well as the recently agreed East-ASEAN Growth Triangle comprising Brunei, Kalimantan, East Malaysia and southern Philippines. Nevertheless, Mustapa said ASEAN was heartened to see the few seed-beds of regional growth zones beginning to take more concrete forms such as among southern Laos, west Cambodia and eastern Thailand.
