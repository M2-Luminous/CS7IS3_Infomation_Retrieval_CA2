"This is very important for fulfilling the tasks of this NPC session," he said at a group discussion on his government work report by Beijing deputies. When deputy Huang Da, president of Chinese People's University, expressed his view that Chinese realities require a correct handling of reform, development and stability, Li Peng said, "local governments should have the national interests in mind, and the mass media should guide public opinion correctly, providing complete and accurate information about central authorities' policies to avoid misunderstandings by the people." For the nation, he said, 1994 is a year of heavy reform tasks and economic development. The introduction of many reform programs represents an important step toward the establishment of a socialist market economy. He called for carrying out the reform programs firmly, adopting prudent attitudes and solving questions timely to ensure a smooth progression of reform and open policy implementation. Li noted prices are an important factor for social stability. Experience has shown that it is correct to reform the country's price system step by step. "The government has lifted price control over 90 percent of goods," he said. "But lifting price control doesn't mean forgoing macro-controls." He expressed the hope that local governments would make efforts to keep price index at a tolerable level. While conceding that a shifting of labor is inevitable now that there is a growing labor market in China, the premier called for strengthened management of the army of migrating laborers seeking jobs. "The government should provide guidance over the flowing labor force," he said. He asked local governments to pay attention to improving urban housing and accelerating the renewal of old residential quarters. He also urged Beijing to set an example in ideological and cultural progress, better management of the social order and create a good work and living environment for citizens in the capital. A deputy from the suburbs urged the government to stabilize its rural policies and provide protective prices for farm products. Another deputy, Doctor Hu Yamei, urged the government to crack down on feasting at public expense, cheating by sham doctors and superstitious activities. Premier Li Peng listened attentively to the views and took notes.
