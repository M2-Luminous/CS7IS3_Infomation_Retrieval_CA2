This is due to the fact that these talks dealt with practical issues and outlined the features of future relations between Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule during the interim period. It seems that the high level Jordanian-Palestinian talks went beyond headlines and into details. This is a wide practical step toward reinforcing coordination between the two fraternal peoples. These talks and their results acquire their importance from the fact that they coincided with the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and came after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli security agreement. We hope that these talks tackled vital political, economic, trade, and security issues in a manner that forms the basis for frank and clear future relations between Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule. Based on statements by Jordanian and Palestinian officials taking part in the talks, it is clear that these talks were crowned with success. This affirms that the two sides enjoy a spirit of responsibility and believe in a joint future of brotherly relations between the two fraternal people. It is noteworthy that the emphasis placed on the need to implement programs to enhance the Arab Islamic character of holy Jerusalem is an important practical step and an accomplishment that deserves to be appreciated Moreover, agreement to continue serious coordination and cooperation on the level of the peace process shows how aware the two sides are of the need to reinforce the Palestinian negotiating position. In any case, the brotherly talks between Jordan and the Palestinian delegation within the higher committee were successful. If coordination and cooperation between the two parties continues throughout the course of the peace process, this will be useful to both parties and to national and pan-Arab issues as well.
