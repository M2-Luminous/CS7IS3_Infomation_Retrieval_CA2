Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman are discussing three problems: halting the conflict between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia, access to the sea near Neum, and the status of Mostar. We have learned from sources in our delegation that some new initiatives have been proposed, primarily regarding access to the sea near Neum. We have learned that, according to the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation's proposal, both Neum and Mostar will be under European control for a period of two years. This means in practice that access to the sea near Neum will be joint, neither Croatian nor Bosnian, but both Croatian and Bosnian. Mostar, like Sarajevo, will be an open city, but under European control. Under no circumstances can Mostar be the capital of the so-called Herceg-Bosnia or Croatian republic. The Croats will be allowed to have the seats of some of their (?institutions) in it. However, let me repeat, Mostar will not be the capital of the Croatian republic. This means that it will formally not be a part of any of the republics in the Bosnia-Herzegovina union, but it will belong to everyone. This is actually the solution recently proposed in Vienna by Prime Minister Silajdzic when he said: Mostar for Mostar's citizens. If the European governors manage to organize their authority in a satisfactory way, this will mean exactly that: All Mostar citizens will be able to return to their Mostar. Let me just mention that, in addition to the two presidents, Izetbegovic and Tudjman, the other members of the Croatian-Bosnian delegations are Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, Presidency member Ivo Komsic, and Muhamed Sacirebey, Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to the United Nations, on the Bosnian side, and Foreign Minister Mate Granic on the Croatian side. The so-called Herceg-Bosnia is being represented by Mile Akmadzic. Therefore, Mate Boban is not present. Does this mean that a great obstacle to the peace negotiations has been removed? Well-informed sources and politicians claim that Mr. Boban is already an ex-politician and Zagreb's ex-pet. This has been Nada al-Isa reporting from Germany for Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina.
