The Czech Republic intended to enter the EU well prepared and use up none of the funds, he said. Indeed, the Czech Republic wanted to become one of the richest countries in the Union and itself contribute to the funds, said Zieleniec, who began a two-day visit to Portugal today. It emerged from the meeting that Portugal is prepared to support the Czech Republic in its efforts to join the EU, he said. Portugal was looking for a way into Europe for the Czech Republic with the understanding that results from its similar historical and geopolitical situation: a country of approximately the same size and number of inhabitants, which has recently shaken off a totalitarian regime, he said. Pragmatically speaking, Czech admission to the EU might assure Portugal of an ally which would defend the joint interests of smaller nations in the EU, he said. The agenda of Zieleniec's visit includes discussions tomorrow with Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barros and Premier Anibal Cavaco Silva. An autumn visit to Prague by Portuguese President Maria Soares and Czech Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy's planned visit to Lisbon in July should contribute to the closer relations being fostered between Portugal and the Czech Republic.
