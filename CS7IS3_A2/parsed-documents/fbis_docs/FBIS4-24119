Our correspondent Rogerio Chisolo has more details. The convoy [words indistinct] in Bocoio District, was escorted by three battalions made up of the Angolan Armed Forces, the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA], and the emergency police. The convoy could not withstand the momentum of our glorious forces, which in 45 minutes of clashes put the enemy troops to flight, leaving behind more than 25 of their comrades dead and many more captured. Our forces also destroyed all the vehicles and a large quantity of war materiel. The residents in the area have been capturing and handing over to our positions FAPLA soldiers, who in their shameful flight try to reach safer places.
