FBIS4-3089 "drchi074_n_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural State Enterprise Files for Bankruptcy in Shanghai State Enterprise Files for Bankruptcy in Shanghai HK1804070594 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) in English 17-23 Apr 94 p 4 HK1804070594 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) English BFN [Daily News: "State Firm Files for Bankruptcy"] [Text] For the first time a State factory in Shanghai has filed for bankruptcy, and 10 more enterprises, including a joint venture, are expected to follow suit. Shanghai No 2 Webbing Factory recently filed for bankruptcy in a local court, marking the start of a readjustment of State-owned assets. This is a crucial step in the deepening of economic reform, designed to increase the value of State property. The factory is the first State enterprise in the city to ask for bankruptcy. In the 1980s, local courts heard the first case of bankruptcy involving a collective enterprise. From 1992 to 1993, more than 50 township enterprises and service ventures filed for bankruptcy. In the last few years, some State enterprises in the city have continued to lose money despite the thriving economy. From January to November last year, according to the Municipal Economic Commission, the State-owned assets of local industrial enterprises totalled 118.8 billion yuan ($13.66 billion) and their gross liabilities totalled 87.8 billion yuan ($10.1 billion). This liabilities ratio of 73.9 per cent is much higher than the world level for industrial enterprises of 50 per cent. Local economic analysts believe the time is ripe for the bankruptcy law to be applied to industrial money losers. This will guarantee the real value of national assets by accelerating property transfers and exchanges, they say.
