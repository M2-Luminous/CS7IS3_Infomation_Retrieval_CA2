FBIS4-21096 "jptdd015__l94057" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 11 April 1994 CHINA Drug Trafficking, Usage in Western Provinces Described Drug Trafficking, Usage in Western Provinces Described 94P30036A 94P30036A CSO [Editorial Report] An article in Beijing XIAOFEI SHIBAO in Chinese on 24 January 1994 presents an overview of drug use in China's western provinces. The article begins with statistics indicating the scope of the drug problem in China's western cities. In Xining, there are over 1,000 registered drug users. Xian has over 1,000 addicts, and in a railroad engineer school in Lanzhou, one class has over 48 students that use drugs. According to the article, with so many overt drug users, the number of secret users is undoubtedly much greater. A survey of over 400 drug users revealed that 72.6 percent were under the age of 25, while 22.3 percent were between the ages of 25 and 35. Of those surveyed, 62.89 percent had a middle-school education, 23.23 percent had completed high school, and 12.8 percent had only been to primary school. The article's introduction also touches on the money associated with drug trafficking. In Yunnan, 1 kg of heroin is worth 5,000-10,000 yuan. In Guangdong, 1 kg is worth 30,000-50,000 yuan, and in Hong Kong, US$30,000-50,000. The next section of the article discusses various methods used to smuggle drugs, such as concealing them in tires, gas tanks, hollowed-out books, and other devices. To pass through customs, smugglers also conceal drugs in various body cavities, such as the stomach or vagina. In one case a woman hollowed out the chest of a dead infant and concealed drugs within it. The article then moves on to the social costs associated with the use of heroin: broken homes, theft, murder, and prostitution. Users often begin using drugs and later get involved in trafficking and other crimes. One 19-year-old woman became involved in prostitution to support her drug habit. By the time public security caught her, she had three different venereal diseases. The next section sketches the personality types of drug users. Many of the users aged 15-25 are "experimenters"--people who know very little about heroin and are not aware of what they are getting into. Others succumb to peer pressure. Drug users, the article asserts, love company, and any given user will have three to eight companions. The new affluence has produced another group of users; drug use is seen as the "consumption of the rich" and "high class enjoyment." However, people often spend themselves back into poverty and destroy their households. The misguided use of heroin as a medicinal drug has produced yet another category of user, as some who attempt to cure disease with it end up addicted. A related delusion occasionally afflicts young women, who see heroin as an effective agent for weight loss. A final category, according to the article, consists of people who turn to drugs after divorce in an effort to restore their emotional balance. The final section of the article briefly discusses worldwide statistics on drug use, noting that China was a "drug-free nation" until the 1970s, when drug use began to become a problem in border regions. Currently, China has 148,000 registered drug users. However, in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Guangdong, the actual number of users far exceeds 150,000, according to a random survey.
