Although nothing has been disclosed about the details of these talks, the statements made by the Palestinian and Israeli parties demonstrate that the main differences and pending issues remain unresolved. Reaching a solution will require very prolonged talks. The latest 'Arafat- Peres meeting, the third over the past two months, focused on extricating bilateral talks on the Gaza-Jericho agreement from an impasse. It is well-known that Israeli stalling prevented implementation of the agreement's clauses, which should have taken effect on 13 December 1993. Israel put forward its own interpretations and analyses of the clauses of the agreement, which practically blocked its implementation. Political observers believe that despite the fact that both Palestinian and Israeli parties declared that they reached a limited accord, Zionist officials have reneged on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement by putting forward new interpretations of its articles. Under the latest agreement the Zionists imposed Israeli military supervision of the crossing points and border points in Gaza and Jericho with the participation of Palestinian police. This means that Zionist forces will continue to impose their control over the self-rule areas, albeit with a Palestinian police cover. According to the Gaza-Jericho agreement signed in Washington, control of the crossing points, bridges, and border points separating Gaza and Jericho from Egypt and Jordan is the responsibility of the interim government in the self-rule area. From the outset of the negotiations, the Palestinian party emphasized the Palestinians' sole right to control the crossing and border posts along with other tasks in their occupied homeland. The Zionist entity, as usual, resorted to blatant stalling, refusing to implement the agreement's clauses on the scheduled date in order to impose conditions on the Palestinians and to shake the PLO leader's standing among the Palestinian people. These complications have further darkened the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere in the occupied lands regarding the agreement and the possibility of implementing it. The Palestinians, who were at first enthusiastic and pinned hopes on the United States, have now begun to wonder if it is really possible to regain their usurped rights through diplomatic means from the usurper Zionist entity.
