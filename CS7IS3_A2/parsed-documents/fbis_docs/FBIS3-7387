The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,800-word article by correspondent Kim Cha-un from UN Headquarters under the headline, "The Significance of the Alternative Plan on the 'Statement in the Name of the President of the UN Security Council.'" Noting that with the "new alternative plan" proposed by China on 25 March regarding the UN Security Council moves for adoption of a resolution on North Korea, discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue at the council has entered "a new phase," the article predicts that this proposal will bring about "a temporary stumbling block" in the West's plan to cope with North Korea in the future, and shows doubt as to whether North Korea will "obediently follow" the statement of the president of the UN Security Council which has no "binding force," unlike the resolution. The article also points out a possibility that this plan may "spoil" the atmosphere of the international community's "hardline measures" against the North Korean nuclear issue by giving North Korea time to drag on the issue. In spite of this, the article notes the recent Chinese proposal is winning "more affirmative reaction" by the West, and illustrates the reason for this as follows: First, with this proposal, one can sense that China's basic position on the North Korean nuclear issue is "changing" and that China agrees with the UN Security Council's "interference in and action" for the North Korean nuclear issue. Second, the West is hoping that such a change in China's attitude will exercise "a decisive influence" on North Korea, because China's supoport for a statement by the president of the UN Security Council means that China raises the "same voice" with the United States and other Western countries "opposing" North Korean nuclear development. Third, Western diplomats believe that China's "joining" in the efforts of the security council for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue is "more important" than anything else. Thus, it is highly likely that the West will "accept" the Chinese proposal for adopting the statement of the council president during negotiations with the Chinese side next week. The article predicts, however, that the two sides will have a "tug of war" over the "contents" to be included in the statement. The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article by reporter Kim Cha-su, entitled "The Government's Position on the 'Alternative Plan Proposed by China.'" The article notes that the government showed an "affirmative reaction" to the Chinese proposal for adopting a statement to be issued in the name of the UN Security Council president because it believes that "winning support from China" is "more important" than anything else. The government hopes, the article writes, that the "same voice" raised not only by the five permanent committee members of the security council, including China, but also the 10 non-permanent committee members, will work as even "greater pressure" on North Korea. The article observes that the purpose of the Chinese side in proposing the statement is to give North Korea "room" to accept an "additional inspection" and that by doing this, China will be able to explain to North Korea that if North Korea does not "comply with" the demand of the international community, China can "no longer" stand only on the side of North Korea. The government, however, maintains that the "contents" of the statement proposed by China should not be "remarkably" different from "a draft resolution" pushed by the security council's permanent members including the United States, and that the statement should include a content clarifying that "next-stage steps" will be taken according to the North Korean "attitude," referring to the remarks of the IAEA director-general that if another inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities is not conducted within six weeks, safeguards are highly likely to be "suspended." The article points out that during the ROK-PRC summit in Beijing, the ROK will ask China to support the security council's resolution in return for the ROK's acceptance of the Chinese proposal. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will bring the result of his talks with Chinese leaders to the United States and based on this, will discuss "measures" henceforth with the security council's permanent members, including the United States. The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline, "A Pitfall in the Resumption of Dialogue." Pointing to "affirmative" moves of the UN Security Council and the ROK Government concerning the new Chinese proposal, the editorial writes that with emphasis put only on the nuclear issue, the issue regarding "tension" between the North and the South Korea has been "put aside," and denounces North Korea's "persistent refusal" of inter-Korean dialogue and recent remarks on "Seoul becoming a sea of fire." The editorial says that there is a "high possibility" that North Korea's "antinational, menacing act" may be "overlooked" if North Korea expresses "readiness" to accept additional inspection, changing its attitude. But the editorial urges the North to "apologize" for its "abnormal acts" and to basically change its attitude, so that it may be recognized as "a dialogue partner." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial under the headline, "How Long Should We Put Up With the Statement of the Security Council's President?" The editorial notes that with China's proposal for a security council president's statement, the North Korean nuclear issue will likely return to the "condition of one year ago" because the North has not shown any change in its attitude, and expresses "doubt" as to whether the ROK Government's support for the Chinese proposal is "appropriate." Criticizing the government's "excessive appeasement attitude," the editorial stresses that the "stick," while not necessarily meaning "confrontation," is more effective for bringing North Korea to the dialogue table.
