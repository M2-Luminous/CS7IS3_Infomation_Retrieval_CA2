In a statement distributed today, G. Zemribo recalls that according to the Latvian Constitution, Latvia is an independent democratic state recognized by many countries of the world, that it is sovereign, and that "only the institutions of the Republic of Latvia have legislative, executive, and judicial power on the territory of Latvia and the power of any other state on it is absolutely excluded." The establishment of the principles of law in Latvia is the prerogative of the Latvian Government and other executive institutions. Nobody has granted such rights to the Russian Army. DIENA has already written that the commander-in-chief of the North-Western Army Group has issued an order which states that "in the event of an assault or any other illegal action against Russian soldiers or military structures, they should be solved by all possible means, including the use of weapons. In the event of an attempt to occupy a military object, one should open fire" [na porozenije]. As the chairman of the High Court therefore concludes, the order of the North-Western Army Group commander foresees that the decision about whether or not the action is lawful will be made by a soldier. "How dangerous this is and where it can take us, we can see in the examples of many bloody events on the territory of the former Soviet Union". After having read this statement at a press conference, G. Zemribo recalled that the Russian Army is stationed on the territory of Latvia illegally, and that Latvia has no agreement with Russia stating that the soldiers of the Russian Army are not submitted to Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore they will have to answer for their deeds in accordance with the Latvian laws -- and this concerns the users of the weapons as well as those who have given them the respective orders. These crimes will be investigated by Latvian investigation institutions, not by the Russian military prosecution. According to G. Zemribo, he is distributing this statement as the chairman of the High Court, and he does not wish to pay attention to the political aspect of this matter because "the court stays above politics". His only aim is to call Russia's attention to the possible juridical consequences of the announcement of the North- Western Army Group. DIENA already wrote that the order of the chief of the North-Western Army Group was given after the incident that took place on 10 January between former president of Vidzeme District People's Deputies Council in Riga, Andrejs Rucs, and two generals of the Russian Army. Until now, only Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has publicly expressed at a press conference his personal opinion that this order cannot be regarded as a correct answer to the president's correct behavior during the 10 January incident.
