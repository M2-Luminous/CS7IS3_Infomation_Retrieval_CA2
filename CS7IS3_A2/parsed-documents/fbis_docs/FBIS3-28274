While calling for the prime minister's understanding of and support for the early enactment of a law on special measures for use of military bases after their return, which is still pending, Governor Ota appealed for settling issues regarding the U.S. military bases in Okinawa. In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa mentioned such facts as details of his recent meetings with former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and U.S. Forces Pacific Commander-in-Chief Larson, and said: "I have a good understanding of the present situation in Okinawa. I have talked over the issues (on the U.S. military bases) with the U.S. ambassador to Japan and the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces on every possible occasion." In this way, he stressed his positive approach toward the military base issues. Meanwhile, Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Okinawa Development Agency, who accompanied Governor Ota, called on Hosokawa "to bring up the Okinawa issue for discussion during his visit to the United States." In response, Hosokawa said: "Yes. I understand." Thus, he hinted that the Okinawa issue may be brought as one of the topics for discussions at the summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton. This was the first face-to-face talks between Governor Ota and Prime Minister Hosokawa. In addition to the issue on legislation of a law on special measures for use of military bases after their return, Governor Ota asked Prime Minister Hosokawa for his support in settling three other major issues that have to be solved urgently. They are: the return of Naha Naval Port; abolition of live-fire exercises conducted across Prefectural Highway 104; and the return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield and abolition of parachuting exercises conducted at this airfield. Moreover, concerning the handling of misfired shells, Ota asked Hosokawa to understand that this issue has to be settled too, and said: "There are misfired shells left over from the battle on Okinawa, and also misfired shells from the live-fire exercises conducted by U.S. Forces. However, we are concerned with the danger involved in the disposal of misfired shells at the exercise sites." Prime Minister Hosokawa stated his profound understanding of the base-connected issues, and said: "I understand the present situation in Okinawa very well, and I also understand that Okinawa residents were forced to suffer many problems during and after the last war. I would like to make the situation in Okinawa (concerning the Okinawa-related issues) turn for the better." Moreover, in response to the request made by Director General Uehara, who stated that "the prime minister would certainly have a hard time in dealing with many problems" but asked that "the Okinawa issue be brought up during his visit to the United States," Prime Minister Hosokawa promised he would do his best, saying, "I understand your points quite well." In addition to Director General Uehara, Noboru Shimajiri, head of the Okinawa General Chapter of the Japan New Party, attended the meeting. As viewed from his standpoint as part of the ruling coalition, Shimajiri urged the prime minister to understand the Okinawa-related issues and support their settlement. They met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura at 1020 and made the same requests. As part of its mission to appeal for settlement of base-related issues and the legislation of the law on special measures on the use of military land after their return, the governor's party plans to call at the concerned ministries and agencies, including the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, as well as concerned Diet members in the afternoon.
