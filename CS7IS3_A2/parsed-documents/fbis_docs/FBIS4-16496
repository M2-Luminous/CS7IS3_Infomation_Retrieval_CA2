Group of Belarus Deputies Demands Criminal Proceedings Against Participants in the Signing of Treaty With Russia"] [Text] The agreement on merging the monetary systems of Belorussia [Belarus] and Russia signed in Moscow has provoked a mixed reaction among the country's political forces. A group of Supreme Soviet deputies representing the Social Democratic Party turned to parliament's presidium with a demand for "carrying out without delay an investigation and, if necessary, instituting criminal proceedings against the participants in preparing and signing this treaty," which contravenes the constitution currently in force. A number of opposition parliamentarians also demanded that the agenda of an extraordinary session should include the question of resignation of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich and members of his government "for unconstitutional activities." The extraordinary session of parliament will take place on 27 April. At its closed session, which ended in the evening of 13 April, the Supreme Soviet presidium, however, declined to include in its agenda a revision of the Constitution articles with which the signed Belarus-Russia treaty is at variance. The session will be devoted to electing the country's constitutional court. The parliament head is refraining from comment on the agreement Prime Minister Kebich signed in Moscow on the plea that the question needs to be studied additionally: Pressing for an urgent conclusion of a financial alliance at any price, Mr. Kebich clearly went beyond the bounds he had set himself and that were agreed on by parliament leaders. The upcoming presidential elections introduce an added nuance. It is still unknown whether Speaker Mechislaw Hryb is going to run. He was restrained about the signed agreement and instructed parliamentary commissions to see to which extent it corresponds with the Constitution. The deputies will inevitably raise the problem of merging the two countries' monetary systems at the 27 April extraordinary parliament session. The majority in the Supreme Soviet will clearly back the agreement and will be ready to amend the Constitution then and there. The examination of this question will be postponed, however, (most probably on the prime minister's insistence) to see what the people think about it. The voting is planned to coincide with the 23 June presidential elections. Vyacheslav Kebich hopes that the elections will demonstrate sweeping popular support for his course of convergence with Russia, and therefore, whatever their upshot, he would remain at the helm of the Executive Branch for at least as long as this parliament's powers last. The election campaign for potential presidential candidates will officially start in Belorussia on 15 April. Already under way is the registration of initiative groups that are gathering signatures, and the formation of electoral commissions.
