"We have identified 10 countries categorized as big emerging markets, and we are going to come forward with a specific export strategy for all of those countries," Brown said. Speaking at a press conference attended by foreign reporters, the secretary stressed that the country's specific strategies are "very focused" and "very targeted." The secretary said that in doing so, the U.S. "doesn't mean the exclusion of any that aren't on that list of ten. It just means that we're going to be giving some special attention" to them. He disclosed that his department has completed the work of planning export strategies to two of the 10 countries. India, Poland, Indonesia and Turkey are on the list, and Russia is not, he said, adding that there are no countries from the Middle East. "I agree that too little attention has been given to India as a market. I intend to end that era of neglect and to give India significant attention in that regard," Brown said. The secretary explained that the new list is an important part of the national export strategy put forward by the Clinton Administration late last year. The criteria for emerging markets, Brown said, include economic strength, population size, opportunity for American exports, the market-drive nature of the economy, economic reform and privatization. The government's policy towards investment and the protection of intellectual property rights are also important criteria, the secretary said.
