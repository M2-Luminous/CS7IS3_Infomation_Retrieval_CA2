Introduction On March 15, 1994, the Commission solicited comments on proposed amendments to the net capital rule relating to capital charges for listed options and related positions. 1 In the release, the Commission also solicited comments on the applicability of the proposed theoretical pricing haircut methodology to assess the market risk for over-the-counter (``OTC'') options. The Commission requested that comments be received on or before May 16, 1994. 1 Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 33761 (Mar. 15, 1994), 59 FR 13275. The Commission already has received several letters commenting on the release. Broker-dealers, however, have requested from the staff of the Division of Market Regulation an extension of the comment period. Specifically, industry members have requested additional time to respond to the Commission's request for comments relating to the net capital treatment of OTC options. II. Discussion The Commission appreciates the complexity of the issues addressed by the Commission's proposed amendments to the net capital rule, particularly with respect to OTC options. Therefore, in order to receive additional serious and well-reasoned responses from the industry participants, the Commission is extending the comment period for all commenters to September 16, 1994. Nevertheless, the Commission is eager to address these important issues in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the Commission staff will continue to develop rulemaking in this area while it is awaiting further responses from the industry. III. Conclusion The comment period for responding to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33761 is extended until September 16, 1994. Dated: June 29, 1994. By the Commission. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
