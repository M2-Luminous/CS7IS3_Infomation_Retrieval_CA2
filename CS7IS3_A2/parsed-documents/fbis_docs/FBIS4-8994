At a press briefing held after the departure of his counterparts, the president hailed, in particular, the congenial course of the in camera meetings. Vaclav Havel granted an interview to LIDOVE NOVINY immediately after the meeting. [Dudek] Will the results of the Litomysl meeting manifest themselves in the everyday lives of citizens in Central Europe, or is this merely the start of a specific process and we will just have to wait for it to bear fruit? [Havel] I do not think we have initiated a definite political process because the concept of a political process usually means the preparation of something--for example, a specific resolution, a declaration, a treaty, and so on. It is not a process in this sense; it is something else. It is, as I have already said several times, the creation or joint creation of a good regional atmosphere. The more politicians get to know one another, the more they exchange views, and the more often they meet, the better they see into each other's souls and thus create a more favorable environment for the political processes about which you are asking. [Dudek] In Saturday's [16 April] debate, President Klestil commented that the opening of long impermeable borders has also brought certain problems--mass migration, for example. Is the Czech taxpayer prepared to bear part of the burden that migration may bring to the Central European region in the near future? [Havel] Of course, migration may cause various problems, and it is causing them. Two tasks lie ahead of us. First, it is necessary to somehow regulate migration because certain countries may be prepared to a varying degree to accept refugees. Each of them must gauge its potential; it cannot open itself to everyone without limit. Not only the country's citizens, but also the refugees would be the worse for this. The second task is to remind our public again and again that there were times when hundreds of thousands of people fled from our country and found a warm reception in Switzerland, Canada, and many other countries. The fundamental issue--I would say directly that it is an issue of universal solidarity--is that we must be capable here and there of taking in someone in need, someone fleeing from somewhere, especially if he is fleeing from armed conflict, poverty, and suffering. We must understand and somehow help him. It is impossible for us to keep on wanting someone to help us and be unable ourselves to help anyone and turn up our noses at those who are, at the moment, in a worse situation than we are. There were times when even we did not have it so good. I admit that, following decades of total isolation, migration is a new phenomenon that our society is not used to. It may provoke all sorts of social tensions, but we must work on ourselves in this issue. [Dudek] Do the Czechs still have the capacity to make sacrifices? Are we not at risk from the affluent indifference your counterpart Weizsaecker referred to in Litomysl in connection with the Germans? [Havel] Thousands of the most multifarious good and bad traits slumber in the soul of society. We can be at risk from anything--good and bad. It is up to us which of our qualities we activate, which ones we rely on, which ones we develop, and for which ones we create favorable scope. [Dudek] Western Europe, despite the fact that it officially recognizes the integration of East and Central Europe, remains, to put it mildly, hesitant about opening up its own markets. During your talks, did your partners from Germany and Austria show any sign of adopting a more accommodating stance? [Havel] This was quite a topical subject, let us say, a year ago. It seems to me that the situation has improved a little since then--for example, certain quotas and restrictions applied by the Austrian side to our goods have gradually been removed. Our association agreement with the European Union is even asymmetrical in our favor. It seems to me that this protectionism is ceasing to be the most pressing problem. Of course, it nevertheless holds true that all barriers should be removed more and as much as possible and that we should become part of a free economic environment. Allowance should also be made for our specific situation. Allowance should be made for the fact that our entire former--in essence, artificial--market has collapsed and, therefore, that we are in a more trying situation than other democratic countries that were not so completely tied to an abnormal market. [Dudek] When will a settlement be reached in mutual Czech-German relations, as has already happened between Germany and Poland? What is preventing an honorable solution to this problem, a problem that is holding back Czech-German cooperation? Did you discuss this with President Weizsaecker? [Havel] Of course, we discussed this. We discussed it privately, during unofficial occasions, at dinner, and so on. I would say two things about this. First, the impression is sometimes given that the two obstacles that lie between us, the Sudeten-German issue and compensation, have prevented good relations with Germany. There are a whole host of contacts and ties--political, economic, cultural, and others--and these two issues should be afforded the place commensurate to them. We should not, as sometimes happens, turn this situation into something more serious--more so on our side than on the German side--than it actually is. Second, I personally feel that the situation will turn out well. After the German elections in particular, no matter who wins them, some of the issues that have hitherto been blocked will move forward very rapidly. [Dudek] When I was following your debate on Saturday [16 April], it seemed to me that this was a discussion among sovereign intellectuals. The meeting of intellectuals was supposed to begin on Sunday. Did you have a similar impression, and, if so, is this, in your opinion, in order? [Havel] I do not know exactly how an intellectual is distinguished from a nonintellectual. For this reason, I cannot tell exactly which of the presidents present are intellectuals and which are not. The purpose of this meeting was not to resolve the specific political issues of the day but, rather, to ponder the longer-term issues, prospects, or problems. Understandably, the result of this was that the debate was perhaps more general and perhaps less dramatic than many a televised discussion. However, no one was obliged to watch it.
