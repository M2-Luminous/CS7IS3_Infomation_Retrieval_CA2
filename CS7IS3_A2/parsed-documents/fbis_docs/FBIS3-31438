Ganic was asked for his reaction to Thursday's agreement for the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo, following Russian mediation. In return, the Russians are to send peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Ganic said: "The Russians are not neutral and have never agreed with NATO on the demilitarisation process of Sarajevo. Therefore, they are not welcome." Ganic said that if the Russian troops were deployed in the Sarajevo region, he would prefer "to see them guarding Bosnian heavy weapons placed under UN control rather than Serb weapons." The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has threatened to bomb the Serb artillery from 2400 GMT Sunday if it were not withdrawn from around Sarajevo or put under control of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Bosnian army is mainly Moslem. The Russian government has come under domestic pressure to support the Serbs who are fellow Slavs and orthodox Christians. Ganic added that the Russian initiative was "clumsy from a diplomatic point of view because it shows a lack of trust in the UNPROFOR", the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking in Athens on Thursday, said the Moslem side should now make concessions. "The time has come for the West to prove that it knows how to do something better than an ultimatum, by encouraging the other side to undertake what we have obtained from the Serbs," he told journalists before holding talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel.
