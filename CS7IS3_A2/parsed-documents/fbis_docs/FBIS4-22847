A. Maltsev; UDC 621.396.96] [Abstract]An experiment is conducted to determine the directions from which broad band signals arrive when the data recording time is short in duration. It was shown that when the number of affecting sources is exceeded by the dimensions of the signal subspace, this leads to a significant deterioration of resolution of the signal group classification method. An efficient procedure of direction finding is proposed for the indicated conditions. 3 figures and 3 references
