The fighting broke out after Hizballah attacked an SLA outpost on the edge of Israel's self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon with machine guns and B-7 rocket-propelled grenades, police in the southern port of Tyre said. A group of guerrillas advanced close to the South Lebanese Army (SLA) outpost at al-Qantarah at mid-morning firing and as they pulled back the position came under a hail of mortar fire. The SLA retaliated with a heavy artillery barrage on villages just north of the security zone, sending several shells crashing into civilian homes and killing a 50-year-old woman and wounding four other people, police added. They fired more than 20 shells on the villages of Qabrikha, Tulin and Wadi al-Saluqi which face the al-Qantarah outpost and fires were reported in the region. Two Israeli Cobra helicopters gunships also went into action, strafing a ravine used by the guerrillas to attack the security zone, police said. On Thursday Israeli warplanes blasted a Hizballah base in the Iqlim al-Tuffah hills in south Lebanon. Two planes fired a missile at Mlita without causing any casualties. Up to 45 guerrillas were killed on June 2 in an Israeli helicopter raid on a Hizballah training camp in the Syrian-controlled eastern Ba'labakk region. Since then Israel has flown daily sorties over Lebanon searching to wipe out Hizballah resistance fighters.
