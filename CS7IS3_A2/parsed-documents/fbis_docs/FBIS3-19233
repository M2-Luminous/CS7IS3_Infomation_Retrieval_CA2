The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set for fish last year as well, from February to December. The spokesman said there were no data showing that the market is destabilized at present by cheap fish imports. But if it is, the Commission "is prepared to re-establish the minimum prices". Last week, France asked the Commission to extend the minimum prices. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU countries that drive down prices of French fish. The Commission spokesman said that the general situation on the market for fish products and its "structural weaknesses," especially in France, will be studied on the basis of a report at a fishing ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on April 12.
