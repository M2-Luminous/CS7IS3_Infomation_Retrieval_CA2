Just as the document says, these are changes that current Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar intends to implement and that will affect the traditional way Bolivia has faced and carried out the nation's foreign affairs. This is one of the new Foreign Ministry conclusions provoked by the realization that "the world is going through a process of a general reorganization of relations between countries, regions, continents, and hemispheres." The document says this period is characterized by a growing interdependence that "is not always free of asymmetrical situations that sometimes are quite contrasting" and usually are not mentioned. The document says Bolivia must adopt, now and in the future, positions that have been proven successful recently and were based on peace policies implemented after World War II. Aranibar's administration admits that since the recovery of democracy in 1982 the country has made "significant political and economic progress, which are determinant factors for Bolivia's insertion into the international community and reflect "an understanding of generalized trends." The document points out that, consequently, the government's foreign policies are based on respect for the democratic system and human rights, preservation of and respect for the pluralistic identity of peoples, and the need for economic cooperation between nations. These decisions have paved the way for "the logic of coalition and integration," replacing "the logic of confrontation. The latter being the basic tone that characterized "Bolivia's old international policy," which must be overcome. The document also points out that the Foreign Ministry has embarked on the task of "professionalizing" its services in order to overcome "improvisations" as part of the new Foreign Ministry responsibility to help attract investments and establish beneficial trade agreements. The document finally lists Foreign Ministry goals based on reality and "operational" possibilities as follows: 1) Give preference to relations with neighboring countries and the other Latin American and Caribbean nations and 2) Participate in the reconstruction of relations with the United States. The third point refers to improving relations with the EC. The fourth and last point refers to national participation in subregional integration efforts, as well as in GATT and other international organizations. The document cites the United States and Chile as areas of crucial problems for the country. It indicates that the "basic guidelines have the purpose of replacing the concept of 'reciprocal suspicion' with a more cooperative concept and to diversify, with a true and advantageous number of issues, the possibilities for exchange and integration beyond the issues of drug trafficking and the landlocked problem, which have become real obsessions."
