FBIS4-5859 "dreas072_h_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Opposition Leader Questions Central Bank Losses Opposition Leader Questions Central Bank Losses BK1404115394 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES in English 13 Apr 94 p 4 BK1404115394 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES English BFN [Text] Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang (DAP-Tanjong) [Democratic Action Party member of parliament from Tanjong] said the "colossal forex [foreign exchange] losses in the last two years had knocked out a big black hole in Bank Negara [Central Bank], not only making it insolvent but also destroying its credibility and authority as a banker and guardian of banks in Malaysia". He said when Bank Negara's 1992 report was released last year, its Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein denied there was any hole in the bank. "The report was prepared to admit that the [Malaysian ringgit] RM9.3 billion forex losses were mere 'paper losses' and that Bank Negara's loss was the nation's gain," he said when debating the motion of thanks on the Royal address. Lim claimed that when Bank Negara's 1993 report was released two weeks ago, there was another exercise to cover up the fact the "hole in Bank Negara had become bigger, and it still denied that there was any hole at all". Lim said there was a conspiracy of disinformation and misinformation to cover up the real nature, cause and magnitude of Bank Negara's forex losses in the past two years. "It is not only the greatest financial scandal in Malaysia but also a world-class financial scandal." Elaborating on his motion which was allowed this afternoon, Lim said the 1992 forex losses were not RM1O.1 billion but likely to be RM13.1 billion. "In 1993, Bank Negara suffered RM5.7 billion in forex losses and RM711 million in net operating loss. Taking into account the RM6.1 billion loss that could be hidden by the revaluation of quoted investments, Bank Negara losses could range from RM6.4 billion to RM12.5 billion." Taking both years together, he said, Bank Negara could have suffered forex losses ranging from RM16.5 billion to RM25.6 billion. Lim said Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim should not be misled by Bank Negara officials that it could afford up to RM25.6 billion losses in two years because its assets exceeded RM100 billion. "It is such wrong advice that caused Anwar to come out openly to state last year that the RM10.1 billion in foreign exchange losses suffered by Bank Negara in 1992 were paper losses. "The additional RM6.4 billion to RM12.5 billion losses suffered by Bank Negara in 1993 have proven Anwar to be wrong that the RM10.1 billion losses are not 'paper losses' but real losses." Lim called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry to be set up to inquire whether the total Bank Negara forex losses since 1992 could exceed RM30 billion. He said there was an urgent need for the appointment of a Public Accounts Committee chairman, who should be an opposition Member of Parliament, to inquire into Bank Negara's forex losses.
