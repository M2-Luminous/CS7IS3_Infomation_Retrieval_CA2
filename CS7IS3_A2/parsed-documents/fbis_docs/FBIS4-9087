Lajos Fur thinks that most issues will be decided between the two rounds of elections. He hopes that the uncertain voters will eventually vote for the MDF. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people say today that the MDF remained alone before the elections also because it deviated from the spirit of Lakitelek. Do you think this is true? [Fur] If we look at the Lakitelek documents, it transpires that we have not deviated from any of the statements. It was clear at the time too that we did not call for radical changes, but we were for a gradual reform policy to avoid a radical change. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Then why are these accusations repeatedly coming up? [Fur] There can be individual offense or unfulfilled ambitions behind this, or even the fact that some people imagined something else behind the concepts and not what they really cover. I am convinced that the things formulated at Lakitelek are being carried out. Naturally, the best ideas do not appear crystal clear in everyday politics. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] People with a national commitment find it difficult to accept that the political forces committed to national values are so much divided that they almost lack a chance. While their opponents created election alliances, the forces that call themselves national forces are divided and present everywhere, from the MDF and up to the tiny extremist parties, on the political arena. [Fur] Unfortunately, this is true, and it is very sad. The situation is similar to the one prevailing in Poland, where the national forces are scattered. I can only guess the reason behind this. National feelings appear in many different ways in the political thinking. Of course, the liberal and leftist blocs are also split. In the case of nationally-commited parties, individual groups emerged more spectacularly. This is not a positive development, because if many people vote for these small parties, the national forces will lose many votes. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Have you already made any attempts to create unity? [Fur] This is impossible until the first round of elections, but one cannot tell what will happen between the two rounds, because it is obvious that most of the issues will be decided between the two rounds. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] According to some opinion polls, the national and liberal parties, as well as the leftist parties, enjoy one-third of the votes each. At the same time, the trenches are very deep and an increasing number of people fear that it will be difficult to form a government. [Fur] If I look at those who already decided to vote and also decided whom to vote for, these percentages generally reflect the truth. We also enjoy the support of at least 3 million voters who have not yet decided even whether to go to vote at all. If this 40 percent can be mobilized, this might upset the forecasts and change the uncertain situation in our favor. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is it not strange that the least politically- informed people will decide on the elections results? [Fur] They are also citizens of this country, only that they are not interested in the political life. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Political analysts often say that the fact that you constantly warn the citizens of a leftist danger only increases the socialists' popularity. [Fur] I do not think that our warning awoke the citizens' leftist attraction. The measurable sociological factors that induce the fear of a possible leftist danger can also be scientifically demonstrated. In my opinion, in such a situation, we can defeat the leftist danger if we try to draw the people's attention to this and win over the uncertain voters. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In that case, this is only a power that lasts for one cycle. The fact that you are present on the political arena signals that this is not a real danger. [Fur] There are people who claim that this danger will only last one year, because they will not be able to govern after that. In my opinion, there is greater danger in such a turn, because the economy and the political mood will improve in the immediate future because they will not be able to spoil completely everything we have done so far. But there is a danger in the leftist method prone to administrative measures, namely that they will rebuild their own power with such a determination that it will not leave any scope for the other forces. However, this is only a supposition. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With whom would you be willing to hold coalition talks? [Fur] This will be the most difficult thing. And not only for us. Many people ask whether it is enough for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to form a coalition with [Workers Party chairman] Thurmer to set up a socialist government. Will Horn's left wing talk to the Workers Party at all? How will a social-liberal coalition disintegrate the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]? We have natural allies, the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Smallholders' Party. I do not think that it is possible to hold coalition talks with Torgyan's smallholders. With Csurka's party? I cannot envisage this either. With Pozsgay? They call themselves both leftist and national. Who is left? [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Federation of Young Democrats calls itself a national liberal party. [Fur] The big question is what results they will achieve in the elections. It is good if they call themselves national and exclude the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP. But their chairman speaks lightly of the MDF and the government; if they continue to do this, I do not know if there is any basis of cooperation. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] A lot of concern has been formulated here in the course of our discussion. Are you optimistic? [Fur] Yes, I am. Stalemate is the worst thing in politics. I hope that at least 1.5 million of the uncertain citizens will go to vote. They are the quiet and balanced people in private life and in the local public life who cannot give their votes to anyone else but to a balanced and sober national center party.
