FR940404-1-00047 FR940404-1-00020 In the June 14, 1991, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule to designate critical habitat on Guam. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A public hearing on the proposed rule was announced in the Federal Register on July 12, 1991, and was held on July 31, 1991 (56 FR 27485). The initial comment period for the proposed rule ended August 13, 1991. A request was received on August 8, 1991, by the Guam Urunao Resort Corporation, to reopen the comment period. The Service reopened the comment period from October 15, 1991, until October 31, 1991, to obtain additional information on the economic impacts of the proposed designation of critical habitat. This comment period was announced in the Federal Register (56 FR 51668) and in the Pacific Daily News. The comment period was reopened again from June 12, 1992, until July 15, 1992, due to the availability of an Environmental Assessment pertaining to the establishment of an overlay refuge on Guam and a request to reopen the comment period by the National Wildlife Federation. This comment period was announced in the Federal Register (57 FR 25007) and advertised in the Pacific Daily News. The Service reopened the comment period from March 1, 1993, until March 31, 1993, based on the availability of a revised Environmental Assessment pertaining to the establishment of an overlay refuge. This comment period was announced in the Federal Register (58 FR 11821) and also advertised in the Pacific Daily News. Summary of Comments The public comment period for the designation of critical habitat for endangered species on Guam was open a total of 140 days. During this time, a total of 85 comments were received from 75 commenters. Of the 85 comments, 59 (70 percent) supported the designation of critical habitat as proposed, 18 (21 percent) opposed the designation of critical habitat, and 8 (9 percent) had various opinions that neither expressly supported nor opposed the designation of critical habitat. Also, of the 85 comments, 13 (15 percent) supported the establishment of an overlay refuge, while 3 (4 percent) stated that an overlay refuge alone would not be sufficient to protect endangered species on Guam. Issue 1: Several respondents maintained that opposition to critical habitat revolves around a few local families and their economic interests in their property, that Guam's forests are worth more than additional development, and that most of Guam's people support protection of Guam's forests over commercial development. Service Response: The endangered species problems on Guam are complex, and the Service believes that a cooperative, proactive approach to both species and habitat management will yield the best chances for the long-term survival and recovery of these species in the wild. To meet these shared goals and to more effectively manage the essential habitat needed for the recovery of all of Guam's endangered species, the Service established a National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) on most of the Federal lands proposed as critical habitat and certain waters of Guam to be managed by the Service, the Government of Guam, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. The Service believes that the establishment of the Refuge adequately protects Guam's forests and the species that depend on them. Issue 2: Some respondents expressed the need for both the designation of critical habitat and an overlay refuge to adequately protect endangered species and their habitats on Guam. The overlay refuge alone, they maintained, will not provide the controls necessary to protect endangered species, and, at a minimum, critical habitat needs to be designated. Service Response: The designation of critical habitat would have provided some extra assurances that actions funded, authorized, or carried out by the Federal government would not destroy or adversely modify habitat needed by Guam forest species. Unless there is such Federal involvement, the designation of critical habitat does not affect actions of private landowners or local government activities. The establishment of a National Wildlife Refuge, on the other hand, allows for the protection and active management of Refuge lands. Therefore, the Service has determined that the designation of critical habitat would yield no net benefits above those provided by the Refuge and the designation of critical habitat in conjunction with the establishment of the Refuge is not required for the protection of Guam's endangered species. Issue 3: Support was expressed for critical habitat as a deterrent to development. Comments maintained that development has improved Guam's economy and destroyed much of its ecology, that there is a huge need to curtail development and military expansion on Guam and that critical habitat designation will help indigenous people to protect their natural heritage and honor the memory of their ancestors.
