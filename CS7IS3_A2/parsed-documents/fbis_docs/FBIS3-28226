"We can't change the schedule... and we will continue our utmost efforts" to draft the budget in time for the summit, the Budget Bureau official told reporters. His comments came amid confusion in the ministry after the coalition parties decided to reconsider the tax plan decided by Hosokawa early Thursday. The official said the budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, depends on a report on fiscal 1994 tax reform scheduled to be issued by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, early next week. Asked about the third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget, which is slated for compilation together with the fiscal 1994 budget, the official said, "I have no idea...it all depends on the stimulus package." The package was to be announced Thursday but was delayed due to the political dispute. The supplementary budget will finance the package. Meanwhile, other senior ministry officials, who were apparently holding emergency meetings, told reporters that the ministry is waiting for the coalition to settle the tax issue, and voiced uncertainty about what might happen.
