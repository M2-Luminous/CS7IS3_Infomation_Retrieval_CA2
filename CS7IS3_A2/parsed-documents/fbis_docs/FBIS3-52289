The reshuffle will involve 90 percent of the officers and undercover detectives in the State Security and Criminal Investigation Departments. The changes were approved after it was confirmed that terrorists know the names of most of the police officers operating in Asyut and can identify them. The changes will be made in light of a new security strategy to confront terrorism. It involves staging intensive mobile patrols and fixed and mobile ambushes throughout the governorate and reinforcing the undercover police presence in the streets of the city of Asyut. The new plan will change the locations of fixed civilian police ambushes. One plainclothes policeman will stand guard in front of the target that is being protected, while the other members of the ambush team will scatter over a 10-meter distance around the target so that they will not be easily hunted, like the victims of the recent terrorist attack were. This plan was being developed at the same time that a large number of officers from the criminal investigation and special operation departments from the various governorates were arriving in Asyut. In reaction to these security measures to crack down on the terrorist dens and the terrorist leaders, the Islamic Group in Upper Egypt has proclaimed its defiance, claiming that it has a strategy to confront them.
