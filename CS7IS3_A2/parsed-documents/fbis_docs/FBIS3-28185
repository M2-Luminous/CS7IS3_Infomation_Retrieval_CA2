Korean Authorities Urged To Stop War Provocation Moves Against North" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Tokyo, February 2 (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, in a statement February 2 said that the scheme of the United States to introduce a military intelligence team and a large quantity of latest weapons into South Korea and stage massive military exercises are an unpardonable criminal act to further reduce South Korea not only to a colony and military base but also to a nuclear forward base and military intelligence centre of the United States and, for the present, bar the DPRK-USA talks and bring the situation on the Korean peninsula to the grave brink of war. Noting that the United States has no intention at all to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by peaceful means and still seek to stifle the DPRK with strength, he said: "This is a shameless perfidy to the dialogue partner. The United States must immediately stop the reckless new war provocation moves and get out of South Korea without delay and the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime must unconditionally discontinue its flunkeyist treacheries and stop seeking North-South confrontation."
