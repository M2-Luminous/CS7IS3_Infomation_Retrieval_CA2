So far, ministries have the richest experience in it. They have an experience in cooperation in its comprehensive meaning, in relations with other countries and cooperation within the country, within the republic. Therefore, as far as I know a move toward contract relations has been observed in many ministries, in the Ministry of Industries for example. A certain group of people has purchased a certain enterprise like a shop, a production workshop or an agricultural facility. However, it has not broken away from the state, from the ministry and it begins a new sort of relations with similar organizations on the basis of reciprocal payment, of course. These relations should be beneficial for the ministries and ten times more beneficial for this privatized enterprise. Otherwise, the majority of enterprises will not be able to survive competitiveness in, say, the Central Asian market, or the Russian market, and so on, to say nothing of the West European market. Each enterprise needs to be developed daily and annually. To be developed technically, to develop technology and administration and so on. An individual enterprise will find it very difficult. It will take a long time for an enterprise to establish links and relations with Europe, Asia, and other countries and enterprises and they will not have enough possibilities. Therefore, ministries may become indispensable as partners of enterprises like this. If our ministries take up a principle of partnership with such enterprises, they will be needed in future by the country and especially by these enterprises. Underground privatization is an issue to be considered separately. I think a special group should be created within the Cabinet of Ministers in this respect, of course on the basis of your ministry and involving, in my opinion, representatives of the prosecutor's office, Ministry of Justice, lawyers and our lawmakers and some of these cases should be legalized. Who are the participants in this underground privatization? [passage omitted] The principal participants in so-called underground privatization are those who work at the enterprise. These are managers, chief engineers, and others. This is a collective. I think that we have to change our hostile attitude toward this corps of managers which has an inclination to transfer enterprises to a new concept. Because, regardless of our desire, these people are the best professionals and they are capable of transferring a certain enterprise or a certain facility to a new concept relatively painlessly. Someone will find illegal benefits in it, someone will become rich but I think even a newcomer should become rich, anyway. [passage omitted] When a plant or a factory or any other facility transfers to market economy, it will test its abilities itself. If they do not fit new requirements they will be filtered by the life. Natural selection will take place. [passage omitted] There should apparently be a list of systems and organizations which are required by the state as something to rely on and a source of its power and which cannot be subjected to privatization. I cannot agree with the public view that a collective should not have an advantage in privatizing its enterprise. [passage omitted] I do not want us to be enslaved by the idea that the state must own 51 percent of all enterprises. I do not support this idea. Its share may be 60 percent, or 10 percent. To establish obligatory share for every enterprise and facility means to create obstacles along the way we want to take. [passage omitted] In order to secure the basis for normal development of privatization we need rather a labor-consuming process of taking inventory on all our property, everything possessed by us, I mean the state. When we know what is in our possession we will be able to act with more courage. [passage omitted] I would not delay the process of introducing vouchers. I am also in a way sceptical in this respect but later a redistribution of the property will take place. For instance, I can buy some property for, say, 100,000 coupons and if I fail to use it I will sell it for a higher or lower price. A redistribution, which is essential in the society developing in the way of market economy, will take place. [passage omitted] Now, the issue of selling property for coupons. If we decide to sacrifice Georgia to the coupon, let us do it. I do not consider it a sin to regard the dollar as a principal criterion for the evaluation. The evaluation has to be done in dollars and then, if we insist that the coupon remain the only legal tender, let us accept the payment in the coupon equivalent of the dollar price. [passage omitted] The best way to save the coupon is the revitlization of the economy. The best form is the development of entrepreneurship, proprietorship. [passage omitted] But I think that when we speak about the state property, the dollar must be considered as the principal unit of valuation. About the concentration of the means received as a result of privatization. I am against including these in the general budget. I would back up an idea that these means should be accumulated in a fund created at the Ministry of State Property Management or in some other shape. The sum should accumulate at the bank. In case the sum freezes, it will not be worth a penny. The sum must be in circulation. And, in the first instance, I would return the money to entrepreneurs, to private business and I would give a new momentum to the business. [passage omitted] Yet another point to be discussed. A law on bankruptcy must be initiated. I do not know when this will happen because now, with the current energy crisis, everyone is bankrupt and all enterprises must be sold. But it will not keep on like that, I suppose. I believe, the situation will improve in some time and then this law will be passed. It must be done by all means. Generally, laws that are passed, must be implemented and the bankruptcy law in particular. Finally, a few words about the press. The press is not represented well here. There are some here but it is insufficient. [passage indistinct] We speak about reforms frantically. This is a reform. What else is a reform? This is one of the most important parts of the reform. How can you blame the government for not implementing reforms when you yourself do not know what a reform is? If you do not know, come and let us learn together. I cannot say that Avtandil [Silagadze] has presented an ideal report but it is the best that can be presented today. There will be a new one, a better one in a year's time, because he will gain something from me, I will gain something from him. We are learning from each other. If we work jointly, we will advance along the road of reforms. Otherwise, only slogans remain. [Some say] we are the party which has a program of national salvation and something like this. This is a sheer paper and nothing else. These are empty phrases and nothing else. Programs of national salvation can be drafted only during a process of relations like this. I mean a process of learning and working together, criticizing one another, helping one another and looking for a way out of a political or economic crisis together. [passage omitted]
