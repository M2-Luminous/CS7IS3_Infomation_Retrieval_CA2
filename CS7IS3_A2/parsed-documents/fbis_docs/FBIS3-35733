PDAM candidate Nicolae Andronic said that the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) members are directly influenced by FPCDM followers. Talking about the basic problems of the electorate, Lucinschi declared that the eventual unification of Moldova and Romania, by a Parliament's decision, would be the "sure way to war" and would mean the losing of the Dniester and the Gagauz regions, causing interethnic conflicts in urban centers, most of whose population is not local. Under such circumstances, the menace of separatism in the republic's north could appear. In addition, Moldova could lose the support of the international community. Lucinschi believes that the return to power of the current leaders, in case PDAM wins the elections, will be for the world community a guarantee that Moldova will follow the course initiated in Chisinau. The parliament speaker added that Moldova has yet no document to confirm its independence. The declarations on sovereignty and independence, adopted in parliament, should be confirmed by a referendum to show the people's will, said Lucinschi. Commenting the idea of a referendum on the unification, organized in both Romanian states, Lucinschi considers that in this case "we will unite with Yugoslavia" and "the war will not be limited between Prut and Dniester." The parliament speaker and another PDAM leader, Dumitru Diacov, asserted that the absolute majority of the population, both in Moldova and Romania, are against the unification. Lucinschi said that during the electoral campaign he does not plan any visit to the left bank of the Dniester River or meetings with Tiraspol leaders.
