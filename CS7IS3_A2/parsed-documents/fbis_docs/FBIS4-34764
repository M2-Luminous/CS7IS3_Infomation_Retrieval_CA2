The Vitro Group plans to invest $300 million in 1994 to modernize and expand its plants' capacity. It is also willing to invest in Mexico's telecommunications sector if there are attractive projects, Martens Rebolledo added. As for the sale of Cuban companies, Martens Rebolledo pointed out that the National Foreign Trade Bank [Bancomext] will offer Mexican investors the factories' assets, which the Cuban Government will use to pay some of its debt to Mexico. In that sense, Vitro might sign a purchase agreement with Bancomext in the short run and thus extend its presence in international markets. Thus far, Monterrey businessmen Mauricio Fernandez, Danny Tafich, and Javier Garcia Sepulveda have been heavily investing in Cuba through the establishment of the International Textile Corporation, which consists of 15 plants which employ 33,000 Cubans. Meanwhile, Martens Rebolledo noted that Vitro's annual sales amount to 10.9 billion new pesos, and its annual exports amount to some $500 million. At the end of 1993, Vitro's total assets were approximately 17.159 billion new pesos, and its total liabilities reached 9.638 billion new pesos. Martens Rebolledo emphasized that in the past few years, Vitro has made investments in fixed assets amounting to approximately 1 billion new pesos a year. In 1992, Vitro invested 1.106 billion, while in 1993 it invested 802 million new pesos in this type of investment. Since it generates 38,538 jobs, the Vitro Group constitutes a key source of jobs at the national level. It is worth noting, however, that in the past years the economic slowdown adversely affected Vitro's operational results. This is reflected in its annual sales, which grew by a measly 0.4 percent in 1993, while its total assets decreased 1.8 percent in contrast with its total liabilities, which increased 1.9 percent. According to its latest annual reports sent to the Mexican Stock Exchange, Vitro's staff was reduced 14 percent, while its investment in fixed assets were reduced 27 percent. Both reductions took place during the 1992-93 period.
