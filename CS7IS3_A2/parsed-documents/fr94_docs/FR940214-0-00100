Par. 11. Sections 178.130 and 178.131 are added to Subpart H to read as follows: §178.130 Statement of intent to obtain a handgun after February 27, 1994, and before November 30, 1998. (a)(1) Except as provided in §§178.102(b) and 178.131, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer shall not sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun unless the licensee has received from the transferee a statement of intent to obtain a handgun on Form 5300.35 in duplicate. The statement shall contain the transferee's name, address, and date of birth. The transferee must date and execute the sworn statement contained on the form showing that the transferee is not under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year; has not been convicted in any court of such a crime; is not a fugitive from justice; is not an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance; has not been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to a mental institution; is not an alien who is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; has not been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; and is not a person who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced such citizenship. (2) In order to facilitate the transfer of a handgun and enable the chief law enforcement officer to verify the identity of the person acquiring the handgun, Form 5300.35 requests certain additional optional information. This information includes the social security number, height, weight, sex, and place of birth of the transferee. Such information may help avoid the possibility of the transferee being misidentified as a felon or other prohibited person. (b) Upon receipt of Form 5300.35 from the transferee, the licensee shall: (1) Verify the identity of the transferee by examining the identification document presented and note on Form 5300.35 the type of identification used; and (2) Complete Form 5300.35 to show that notice of the transferee's statement of intent to obtain a handgun and a copy of the form have been provided to the chief law enforcement officer in compliance with §178.102(a). (c) The licensee shall retain the original Form 5300.35 as part of the records required to be kept under this subpart. If the sale, delivery, or transfer of the handgun to the transferee is made, Form 5300.35 shall be attached to the firearms transaction record, Form 4473, executed upon delivery of the handgun as provided in §178.124. If the sale, delivery, or transfer is not made, the licensee shall retain Form 5300.35 as part of the records required to be kept under this subpart. Forms 5300.35 with respect to which a sale, delivery, or transfer did not take place shall be retained in alphabetical (by name of transferee) or chronological (by date of transferee's sworn statement) order. (d) The requirements of this section shall be in addition to any other recordkeeping requirements contained in this part. (e) A licensee may obtain, upon request, an emergency supply of Forms 5300.35 from any regional director (compliance).
