[Martinazzoli] I have tried to keep my reading of this message free from considerations of short-term interest or even partisan interpretations. I am sure that the most accurate interpretations are those that underline the European dimension, which I think was the connecting thread and at the same time the key to understanding the orientation of the message. Be that as it may, taking proper account of the differences, this was the approach of my own report to the assembly in July. I added in that report that the corollary of all this was the reconstruction of the national sense of community. [Luzi] But in his letter to the bishops the pope also addressed the Italian voters; that is, he intervened directly in politics. [Martinazzoli] The pope's viewpoint, which I obviously share, is, more or less, that this European building must not be impoverished by the absence of a Christian mark of identity. In my reading, precisely in order to remain faithful to this exhortation, I reject any petty interpretation -- that is, the idea of somebody else resolving for us the problems that we face as a political force. [Luzi] But almost everyone has interpreted the pope's remarks as an outright appeal for people to vote for the Catholic party. [Martinazzoli] That does not mean that their interpretation is correct. The appeal for people to believe that enhanced unity -- not passive or forcible, but active and convinced -- bears witness to these duties is one thing; and to interpret the remarks as saying that it is necessary to support one hypothesis rather than another, is a different matter. Of course, the challenge that I have set myself is to gather as much support as possible, but I do not attack this claim to that message. I would add that our endeavor -- which, through no coincidence, is inspired by Sturzo -- must of course take account of the contributions of the Catholic world, but it also aspires to build a nonconfessional home inhabited by Catholics, but by nonconfessionals too, who share the principles and the policies that we are putting forward. [Luzi] At the moment, however, the Catholic inhabitants of this home, still under construction, seem very quarrelsome. Bindi, Casini.... How will you make them get along? [Martinazzoli] I am not only unenthusiastic about, but now totally opposed to, the idea that the issues facing us entail daily mediation between the assertions of the various sides. [Luzi] Yes, but behind the verbal disputes there lies the problem of alliances, of the choice of camp. [Martinazzoli] I think that it is wrong to believe that in Italy there is a clear and sharply defined polarity between left and right, conservatives and progressives. For instance, the scenario presented by "Milano Italia" with reference to a certain opinion poll is of considerable interest. It shows that our idea of a rotation not confined to the two most extreme poles is correct. This, because it is emerging that a force representing a program and a government leadership proposal involving us and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni will win most of the votes that do not go to the left-wing alliance. [Luzi] But it will not be enough to govern with. [Martinazzoli] But it will be enough to be able to draw on, and not to betray, a whole political heritage. [Luzi] Be that as it may, then the problem of government alliances will begin. [Martinazzoli] Of course. Not only after the elections, but even now, during the pre-election stage. [Luzi] So let us talk about alliances. You described Bossi's latest turnabout as "interesting" and said that Berlusconi is right when he says that the Left is competing with no rivals. Will they be your allies, together with Segni? [Martinazzoli] I was asked whether there was a danger of a victory by a left-wing alliance, and I do not think that that is a discovery of Berlusconi's. It is what many people hope for, an obvious fact. But it raises certain questions. This, because -- apart from the arrogance of Mr. D'Alema [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary], who tries to pretend many things -- I think I perceive certain difficulties in building this alliance. The PDS' separation from its history is gainsaid by the encumbrance of Communist Renaissance. Then there is Orlando's Rete movement, of which all you can perceive is its extreme language. Are these insignificant problems? Will they pass unobserved by the voters, who will have to choose? I think not. [Luzi] But that applies to your political adversaries. What about your allies? [Martinazzoli] It is necessary to have pride in your proposal, and the conviction that it is an apposite one; the rest is a matter for political calculations and maneuvering. Let me give you an example: After the elections -- however they may go, and whatever positions the political forces may assume -- what could the League do in Parliament if it remains on its own? I will not use the word "hegemony," which I do not like, but I do say that a proposal that is made visible and authoritative and that wins support, such as ours, is a force with a great power of attraction. This is a political fact. The aspect of how it is experienced, interpreted, and managed belongs to the sphere of the dynamism of politics, to our actions, to those of others, to everything happening around us.
