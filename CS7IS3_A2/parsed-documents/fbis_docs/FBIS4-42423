He has never even given official confirmation that he has any ambitions for this post. However, following the recent French-German summit, it looks more and more as if those two countries intend to venture out on European waters under Dehaene's captaincy. It is not yet clear who might become head of the federal government after Dehaene's departure. The CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] is only permitting itself the observation that it would feel flattered if one of its members was asked to take on the EC leadership. However, more than this, CVP headquarters simply will not say. Who should be Dehaene's successor? "Only if Dehaene should decide to go away, which is still not necessarily the case, will the question of his succession figure on the agenda." So far, the CVP has two hotly tipped candidates: Herman van Rompuy and Leo Delcroix. However, strangely enough, neither of these two appears to be raring to lead the government. Earlier on, Leo Delcroix humbly admitted that he still lacked the competence to perform such a duty. Was that genuine modesty on the part of the politician, or merely tactics? Herman van Rompuy, too, has repeatedly made it known that he has no great enthusiasm for taking on the leadership of the government. Here again, the question as to genuine or false modesty must be asked. Could the CVP suddenly let the leadership of the government slip out of its hands? Influential members of the CVP in the chamber say that this cannot happen. Whispers in the corridors of Parliament would suggest that the CVP must not be allowed to relinquish the presidency of the federal government, especially now that the fruits of the restructuring policy are slowly beginning to ripen. Within the CVP, not everyone is convinced that this viewpoint is correct. It is pointed out that it is precisely the group that turned down the prime minister post in 1992 for the CVP in March 1992 that is now demanding it. So it does not look as if we have a dogfight on our hands here. However, even if there is no such fight, there is a third party which is certainly hungry for one. Gerard Deprez, the president of the PSC [Walloon Christian Socialist Party] has already on more than one occasion thrown some encouragement in the direction of Deputy Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet. Wathelet speaks excellent Dutch and is therefore, even if he increasingly answers in French questions put to him in Dutch, an acceptable candidate in this respect. However, the disadvantage is Wathelet's reputation as an eternal skeptic. So far the Citizens' Charter has had no success, but that criticism is partly unjustified, because security cannot be guaranteed by laws and decrees. Should Wathelet succeed Dehaene, there might be a problem of parity. According to the Constitution, there must be an equal number of Flemish and Walloon ministers. Nonetheless, as far as this parity goes, no account has been taken of the community to which the head of the government belongs, who is assumed to be above any Flemish-Walloon differences. Ever since this parity has come about, there has been an equal number of Flemish and Walloon ministers, but Wilfried Martens and Jean-Luc Dehaene were not counted. Were the rule implemented, Wathelet's place as Dehaene's potential successor would have to be taken by a Walloon minister, as opposed to a Fleming. However, people say there is no need for this. The Constitution says that the government must number as many Dutch-speaking as French-speaking ministers "perhaps with the exception of the prime minister." So the word "perhaps" could be taken to mean that Wathelet can be included for the purposes of parity. However, with 15 ministers, it will become impossible to maintain parity if Wathelet is counted as a Walloon. Unless he is divided down the middle.
