He pointed out the great tasks facing the TNC which should ensure that the principles of the National Concord [document] are respected. The head of state added that the members of the TNC bureau should try and enhance the government's agenda. It should also, given the fact that it is representative of all society's strata, supervise, guarantee, and follow up the concerns of all classes of the society. We will be encouraging you to do so, the head of state affirmed. Concerning the absence of some parties from the TNC, the head of state pointed out that this should not mean that they are excluded from the management of the country's affairs. The latter is facing a very difficult period in its history and therefore it needs all its sincere sons to rebuild Algeria upon sound bases which will meet the country's higher interest.
