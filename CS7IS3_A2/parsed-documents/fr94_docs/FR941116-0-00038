FR941116-0-00038 FR941116-0-00006 (ii) Visually inspect the service panel drain valve outer cap seal and the inner seal (if the valve has an inner door/closure device with a second positive seal), and the seal mating surfaces, for wear or damage that may allow leakage. Prior to further flight, replace any worn or damaged seal, and repair or replace any damaged seal mating surfaces, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual. (2) For each lavatory drain system that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0032; or Shaw Aero Devices part number 1010100C&hyph;N (or higher dash number); or Shaw Aero Devices part number 1010100B&hyph;A&hyph;1, serial numbers 0115 through 0121, 0146 through 0164, and &hyph;0180 and higher; or Pneudraulics part number series 9527: Within 1,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the dump valve and drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the valve. Both the inner door/closure device and the outer cap/door must be leak checked. (3) For each lavatory drain system that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0026, or Shaw Aero Devices part number series 1010100C (except as called out in paragraph (a)(2) above), or Shaw Aero Devices part number 1010100B (except as called out in paragraph (a)(2) above): Within 600 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 600 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the dump valve and the service panel drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve. Both the inner door/closure device and the outer cap/door must be leak checked. (4) For each lavatory drain system not addressed in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this AD: Within 200 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the dump valve and the service panel drain valve. The service panel drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve. If the service panel drain valve has an inner door with a second positive seal, both the inner door and the outer cap/door must be leak checked. (5) For flush/fill lines: Within 5,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight hours, accomplish either of the following procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this AD: (i) Conduct a leak check of the flush/fill line cap. This leak check must be made with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the cap. Or (ii) Replace the seals on the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve and the flush/fill line cap. Additionally, perform a leak check of the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve with a minimum of 3 PSID across the valve. Note 2: The leak test procedure specified in Boeing Service Letter 737&hyph;SL&hyph;38&hyph;3&hyph;A, dated March 19, 1990, may be referred to as guidance for the procedures required by this paragraph. (6) If a leak is discovered during any leak check required by paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, accomplish one of the following procedures: (i) Repair the leak; or (ii) Drain the affected lavatory system and placard the lavatory inoperative until repairs can be accomplished. (b) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to include the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this AD. (1) Replace the valve seals in accordance with the applicable schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this AD. Any revision to this replacement schedule must be approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (i) For each lavatory drain system that has an in-line drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 2651&hyph;329, 2651&hyph;334, or 2651&hyph;278: Replace the seals within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 52 months. (ii) For each lavatory drain system that has any other type of drain valve: Replace the seals within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 18 months. (2) Conduct periodic leak checks of the lavatory drain systems in accordance with the applicable schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), and (b)(2)(iv) of this AD. If the waste drain system incorporates more than one type of valve, only one of the waste drain system leak check procedures (the one that applies to the equipment with the longest leak check interval) must be conducted at each service panel location. Any revision to the leak check schedule must be approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (i) For each lavatory drain system that has an in-line drain valve, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 2651&hyph;278, 2651&hyph;329, or 2651&hyph;334: Within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 24 months or 5,000 flight hours, whichever occurs later, accomplish the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this AD:
