This mobilization may take the form of a people's demonstration within the next few days, according to Eugene, who plans to call on other political groupings to reinforce the defensive line. In his opinion, we are in complete anarchy, and without the courage of the Haitian people the country would sink as conditions coalesce into social explosion. [passage omitted]
