This order was issued "in line with the 24 December 1993 letter by the Russian Federation Finance Ministry" and in execution of the Russian Federation Government decree on approving of the Statute on the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice. According to this statute, the Justice Ministry is tasked with ensuring the requisite conditions for the functioning of general jurisdiction and military courts. As has become known, however, this decision has come as a total surprise for the ministry's leadership because the statute says nothing about financing military courts.
