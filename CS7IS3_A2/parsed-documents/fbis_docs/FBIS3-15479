Attention should be focused primarily on what is happening in the CIA, not on Russia -- this, in rough terms, is the leitmotiv of statements heard in recent days from a number of American politicians and intelligence experts. Ames should have been exposed during lie detector tests, THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER writes. Apparently Ames underwent two such tests -- in 1986 and in 1991 -- during which he was asked whether he had unauthorized contacts with foreign intelligence services. It is not impossible that the slight sobering of public opinion in the United States is connected with the fragility of the accusation. In the opinion of the influential WALL STREET JOURNAL, it will be quite difficult to reach a guilty verdict insofar as all evidence of the Ames' guilt is circumstantial. The only weak link in the Ames' defense is their financial position, William Cummings, legal adviser for the accused, believes. However, even here things are not so bad for the Ames. For instance, the house which cost them over $500,000 was bought back in 1987. Our experts consider it unlikely that Ames could have obtained such a sum at that time, even taking account of the value of the information he may have obtained and sold. Provided, of course, it was indeed in 1985 that he started to work for a foreign intelligence service, and not before. A highly original version was put forward by the American newspaper DAILY NEWS. Its journalists concluded that Ames was an agent for the Cuban intelligence services since his time in Mexico at the start of the 1980's coincided with a series of failures by American agents working against Havana.
