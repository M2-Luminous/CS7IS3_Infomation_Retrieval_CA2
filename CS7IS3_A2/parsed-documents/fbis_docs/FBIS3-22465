The highest standards of accountability, probity and financial control must operate in the NHS, said Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, yesterday. The new guidelines have been introduced following the Cadbury report on corporate governance and financial scandals in the Wessex and West Midlands health authorities which drew criticism from the Audit Commission and the Public Accounts Committee. As predicted, the codes call for the setting up of a special committee by each health board to consider thee remuneration of chief executives and other senior officers. A recent study criticised the pay of some chief executives, with reports that the chief executive of one trust hospital in London received a package worth around Â£130,000 a year. Health authority and trust members are reminded to keep a strict curb on using taxpayers' money for hospitality, and to refuse excessive hospitality from suppliers. "Chairmen and board members should act impartially and should not be influenced by social and business relationships," say the guidelines. The codes set down clearer definitions of the functions of chairmen and non-executive board members, a requirement to establish remuneration committees, and a duty by members of NHS boards to declare private interests relevant to NHS business. The remuneration of chairman, executive and non-executive board members must be published in annual reports. At a press conference to launch the guidelines, Mrs. Bottomley said excessive pay deals to chief executives would not be tolerated, but in some cases it might be possible to justify high salaries if better care to patients resulted. David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the new rules would do little to raise standards to accountability in the NHS. "Most right-thinking people would have assumed that all the suggestions being made would already be in place. They will be appalled to discover they are not," he said.
