They Have Set Up Their Own Club for This"] [Text] "Transformations meeting the interests of society are possible only with nationwide accord based on a clear understanding of the aims, with a quest for ways to achieve them, and, most importantly, with the determination of the price which the country and its people will agree to pay for reforms, without running the risk of facing a national catastrophe," the "Statement on the Creation and Aims of the `Realists' Club" states. The club was established in Moscow on 14 March. The board of the new organization includes Aleksandr Vladislavlev, first vice president of the RUIE [Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]; Valeriy Neverov, president of the "Germes" Concern; State Duma Deputy Yekaterina Lakhova; Yuriy Petrov, chairman of the State Investment Corporation; Nikolay Fedorov, president of the Chuvash Republic; Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia]; and a number of other well-known politicians, regional leaders, entrepreneurs, and arts figures who adhere to the concept of political realism. Supporting the quest for a mechanism to formulate accord "for the sake of supreme national interests," they proposed convening a Russian congress "For Civil Accord in the Name of Russia's Revival" to adopt the appropriate document. The main aim of the "Realists" Club has been proclaimed as pooling efforts to resolve the problems facing the country and promoting mutual understanding and cooperation between political and public forces. The creation of the "Realists" Political Club may be regarded as one more response from society's political elite to the president's initiative with regard to signing the Memorandum on Civil Peace. In a broader context this event may also be defined as a regrouping of society's "summit" forces in the search for a response to the political, social, and spiritual-moral realities of life today. Time will show what kind of response these initiatives will elicit -- not only in the political establishment but also in broad sections of the population. Composition of the "Realists" Club Board 1.
