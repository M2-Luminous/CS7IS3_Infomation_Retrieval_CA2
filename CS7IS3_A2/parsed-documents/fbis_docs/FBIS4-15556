They referred to Friday's statement that Latvian ambassador Janis Peters made to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. President Yeltsin on Thursday issued a decree supporting proposals by the defence and foreign ministries to set up Russian military bases in other CIS states and Latvia. Officials of both ministries later spoke of "technical mistakes" being made in drafting the paper and Russian Ambassador to Riga Aleksandr Rannikh made a formal apology to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. Latvian Embassy officials said Churkin had suggested that the two countries should maintain their relations as usual working on the assumption that the Yeltsin decree did not exist. He was also quoted as having promised a thorough investigation into the origin of the paper "which is out of line with bilateral agreements, already initialled."
