Economists hold that while enterprises in the mid-1980's suffered from low economic efficiency largely as a result of the "lingering effects" of the planned economy, their "inability to adapt to markets" today has obviously intensified and become the major contradiction hampering the economic efficiency of enterprises in the process of shifting from a product to market economy. The results of surveys can fully explain the problem. During the past two years, along with the progress in the economic structural reform in all fields and the implementation of the "regulations [on changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises]," and along with the strengthening of the regulatory role of markets, the primary factors affecting enterprises' economic efficiency have undergone conspicuous changes. According to a survey of 50 deficit-ridden enterprises in Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin in 1991, the policy, macro-economic, and enterprise operational factors accounted for 19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent, respectively, of the causes for the losses. However, another survey, conducted two years later in 1993, of 2,586 enterprises operating in the red in eight provinces and municipalities -- including Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin -- showed that the causes for losses by the policy and macroeconomic factors both dropped to around 9 percent, while the factor of enterprise operations rose to 81.7 percent as the cause. The differences in the survey results explain that in raising economic efficiency, enterprises should give top priority to focusing attention on internal operation. As we know, the continuous deepening of reform has resulted in the gradually rationalized relations between the state and enterprises and has greatly improved the external environment for enterprise production and operation. To further improve economic efficiency, it is necessary for enterprises to focus reforms of the managerial system and operating mechanisms on rationalizing the relations between enterprises and their workers and among various internal departments, reinforcing the incentive mechanisms and improving the supervisory mechanisms of enterprises so as to adapt themselves to new market situations with new systems. This year is crucial for an all-out effort at reform. Along with the implementation of numerous measures for establishing a market economy, enterprises may experience greater "inability to adapt to markets." The State Statistical Bureau, in analyzing this year's enterprise economic efficiency trend, has noted the coexistence of factors for both promoting and hampering enterprises' economic efficiency while efforts are made to advance comprehensive reform and to achieve breakthroughs in key areas this year. Judging from the unfavorable factor, as speed will remain the major factor affecting the economic efficiency trend, decrease in the economic growth will, to a certain degree, lead to a drop in economic efficiency. Judging from favorable factors, the strengthening of the intensity of reform in state enterprises, the accelerating of the banking reforms, and other reform measures will contribute to the overall improvement of enterprises' economic efficiency. Enterprises' "inability to adapt to markets" is a normal phenomenon in economic reform. An enterprise which can seize the opportunity to promptly overcome the "inability to adapt to markets" will take the lead in the market and raise the economic efficiency to a new height. Conversely, one which continues to suffer from the lingering effects will be eliminated. This explains the coexistence of opportunities and challenges for Chinese enterprises in the new era.
