With the support of student groups and of the powerful United Workers Front (FUT), the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), which comprises the majority of the nation's Indian groups, initiated a 48-hour peaceful uprising to protest the "unpopular" economic measures adopted by the administration of right-wing President Sixto Duran-Ballen. On 28 January, the president ordered a gasoline price increase that hiked the price on a gallon of regular gasoline from 1,460 sucres to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22). Government spokesmen have explained that the price adjustment will generate revenue to compensate for a $260 million budget deficit prompted by a surprising drop in Ecuadoran oil prices on the international market, where Ecuadoran oil traded at less than $11 a barrel in December and January. The increased fuel prices led to strong protests in Ecuador, where a tense calm has been reigning for the past two weeks because of street demonstrations carried out by students who have stoned vehicles and government buildings, as well as burned tires in the streets. The disturbances have become violent in the port city of Guayaquil, southwest of Quito. In Cuenca, in the Andean province of Azuay, attempts were made to torch the governor's office with "Molotov" cocktails. While the workers showed their opposition to the gasoline price increase by calling for a general strike last Thursday, the Indians joined the protest today with a peaceful uprising, which is blocking the country's overland traffic. According to initial reports received in Quito, the Indians -- who comprise about 3.5 million of Ecuador's population of 11 million people -- blocked the Panamerican Highway in several areas north of the capital. These demonstrations have practically paralyzed all traffic, which could adversely affect trade with neighboring Colombia. Numerous communities in the provinces of Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Chimborazo, Canar, and Azuay, south of the Ecuadoran capital, also witnessed the blocking of roads with barricades, some of which were removed by police and Armed Forces personnel deployed to preserve public order. Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the Indian uprising is attempting to destabilize the economy by preventing normal business activities. He added this is why the public forces will work to guarantee the free flow of vehicles. Santos also talked about the need to hold a national dialogue in which, he said, "we should attend with tabulae rasae, without conditions" in the search for solutions to Ecuador's problems. Defense Minister Jose Gallardo, meanwhile, said he was concerned because the Indian protest is paralyzing exports of Ecuadoran flowers, which have increased in the past few days because of Valentine's Day in the United States. According to Gallardo, the Army and the police will do everything possible to clear the roads, and he said exact instructions have been given to avoid possible confrontations. President Sixto Duran-Ballen yesterday spoke about the possibility of ordering a state of emergency to prevent public disturbances. "We are not going to allow the country to be paralyzed," he said in a meeting with journalists. The Indians staged a two-month-long uprising in 1990 against Rodrigo Borja's social democratic administration (1988-92). At that time, the Indians demands included autonomy for territories in the Amazon region, the site of rich oil fields. Borja rejected the demand, saying the Indians were trying to create a state within the Ecuadoran state itself.
