Hagen is showing no inclination toward reconciliation and sees no need for the clarification the Progress Party Youth [FrPU] is asking for. This could lead to mass resignations from the party or a further escalation of the conflict between the mother party and its youth organization. Yesterday the FrPU held a national executive meeting to discuss its turbulent relationship with its mother party. The meeting did not reach any final conclusions, but it did decide to call an extraordinary national conference before 3 July. In a resolution the FrPU asked the party chairman to clarify whether he adheres to statements that the FrPU and leading officials in the FrPU are not wanted in the Progress Party [FrP] movement. The resolution states that Carl I. Hagen and the majority in the party must assume the responsibility for the growing number of resignations in the youth movement. The resolution was adopted by 26 votes against the single vote of Ulf Leirstein of Ostfold FrPU. "The minority in the FrP are dissatisfied with the way in which we are being treated by the majority. The only thing we want is to be given a little more respect and space, especially on questions of values. Hagen has made remarks about us that are less than pleasant, and has hinted that he wants us out of the party. Now we want an answer from him about whether we can continue to work as a radical youth party in line with our political manifesto or whether we are to be subjected to total and slavish discipline," FrPU chairman Lars Erik Gronntun said after yesterday's national executive meeting. He will use the time up to the national conference to clarify his future role in the party, and he rejected the suggestion that participation in the formation of a new party is on the agenda as far as he is concerned. At the same time he confirmed that Hagen's response to the youth organization will be important for the outcome of the extraordinary national conference. Several centrally placed officials in the FrPU are now looking at their links with the party, but the national executive adopted a resolution yesterday urging all its members to stay on in their posts in the FrP and the FrPU and wait for the outcome of the extraordinary national conference. Gronntun confirmed that there are divergent views in the youth organization about whether or not there is any point in staying. Party chairman Carl I. Hagen was unwilling yesterday to offer an outstretched hand to those in the FrPU who are frustrated. "There is no need for the FrP to clarify anything at all. This was something that happened at the national conference. It is up to each individual member of the party to decide whether he or she wants to continue to work on the basis of the guidelines drawn up at the national conference. If anyone has any doubts about what they want, they will have to start behaving like adults and reach a decision. We have to put this behind us now," Hagen said. Do you think that it would be regrettable if many centrally placed officials in the FrPU see no option other than to leave the party after the national conference? "I choose not to have any views on that," Hagen said. He added that if the youth organization has anything to tell the party, it should address itself to the central executive. He merely notes the FrPU resolution, adding that there are many youth organizations that adopt resolutions. Terje Nyberget, who was the mother party's observer at the national executive meeting, said yesterday that he will now resign from his post as member of the FrP central executive. He seemed somewhat disappointed that the youth organization had not reached a final decision at yesterday's meeting and said that personally he cannot wait any longer before reaching a decision about what is happening. At the same time he praised the youth organization and said that politically he feels much more at home in it than in the FrP. Nyberget was unwilling to comment on the question of resigning from the party. But it is possible that after the FrPU national conference he could become a member of the youth party, because the national executive backed a proposal to end the age limit for FrPU membership. This is a reaction to a series of requests from FrP members who have passed the current age limit of 30 but who nevertheless feel more in line with the youth party.
