He hoped that the Airport Authority experts group could call a meeting this month. Guo Fengmin made these remarks while attending a Lunar New Year gathering sponsored by the Heung Yu Kuk [local consultative bodies in the New Territories]. He pointed out: On the airport issue, not long ago, some people from the British side said that the Chinese side had not raised comprehensive suggestions at all, but subsequently they said that the British side's proposals completely met the Chinese side's demands. This is contradictory. Guo Fengmin further explained: Since the Chinese side did not raise any comprehensive suggestions, why did the British side say that its proposals completely met the Chinese side's demand? As a matter of fact, at an Airport Authority meeting in August last year, the Chinese side had already systematically put forward its suggestions. It took almost six months for the British side to raise its proposals. Who is delaying after all? On granting land approvals, he said that the Airport Authority would certainly discuss land approvals, but some detailed questions would have to be discussed by the Land Commission [Sino-British Land Commission]. Guo Fengmin said that the defense experts group meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group had been delayed too long by the British side. He hoped that major progress would be made at this meeting.
