This was made clear when Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said recently at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that he had no intention to define the war waged by Japan against Asian nations in the past as "a war of aggression" and Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito brought forward the doctrine of "ordinary state", the analyst says, and continues: Immeasurable are the misfortunes and disasters imposed on the Korean and other Asian peoples by the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression and their policy of colonial looting. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities and reactionaries refuse to properly admit Japan's past crimes. This well shows how shameless they are. Just voices demanding the liquidation of the Japanese imperialists' past doings are growing louder not only among the Asian people but also among the world people. The Japanese authorities and reactionaries, far from lending an ear to their just demand and honestly responding to it, are now racing headlong toward the conversion of Japan into a military power, denying that the war started by Japan was "a war of aggression." Yet the Japanese authorities are coveting a permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council. The acts of the Japanese authorities and reactionaries can never be tolerated. The Japanese authorities should act with discretion, mindful that their acts are an intolerable challenge to the people in Asia and the rest of the world.
