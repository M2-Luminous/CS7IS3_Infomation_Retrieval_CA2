It is only by starting from a study of the system, rules, policies, regulations, and safeguards that we can acquire a deep knowledge of the causes of corruption and perfect these things through deeper reform; it is only in this way that we can accomplish dealing with both the objective and its causes, implement comprehensive administration, and fill in all the loopholes. There is no other way out. "Financial Border" Existed Early On The rapid economic development of Mainland China has attracted the world's attention, but so has the expansion of corruption in every industry and circle. So, investigating graft and other anti-corruption work, and encouraging clear and honest administration has become a major item on the Chinese Government's agenda. The "lifeblood" of mainland economic operations, the financial industry, has over 17,000 grass-roots units, over 800,000 employees throughout urban and rural China, controlling the currency circulation business of all units on the China mainland. It is just because this industry is in such an important and special position that on 16 January 1990 Premier Li Peng issued this warning at the National Bank Presidents Conference concerning a group of cases of graft, accepting bribes, and theft which had appeared in financial circles. The Premier said that: "Information from every locality shows that money worship is growing among some cadres and employees on bank staffs... Some people inside the banks have been corrupted by money, with frequent occurrences of graft, theft, bribe-taking, and fund diversion. This kind of corruption phenomenon deserves the strong attention of leaders at every level. To push the anti-corruption struggle, they must adopt efficient measures, conduct inspections, and deal with specific cases, to expose a group of big and key cases..." This has been going on for more than three years. The presidency of the People's Bank of China was changed from Li Guixian [2621 6311 7639] to a concurrent appointment for Vice Premier Zhu Rongji; during that time, has the unhealthy tendency of "financial termites" been stopped efficiently? The answer is disappointing. Although the leaders of the Chinese Government have worried so much, issued repeated warnings at all sorts of conferences, and urged them time and again with good intentions to investigate graft and clean up corruption, still, at the National Financial Order Reorganization Conference in July of this year, it was authoritatively disclosed that the corruption phenomenon of some persons in the bank system taking advantage of the industry to embezzle public funds was still expanding, and the case of the "silver dragon" was quite prominent, leading to extreme public dissatisfaction. Therefore, high ranking leaders in China have repeatedly ordered the launching of another anti-corruption struggle in financial circles in 1993: "We must determine to give considerable attention to making major achievements," and "lead the anti-corruption struggle into a deeper level." "Silver Dragon" Shows New Characteristics If we say that in the earlier years the "thieves inside the banks" had grafted or taken bribes amounting for the most part to several thousand yuan, or several ten thousand yuan, while under the affects of the "gold wind" of "seeking money" by every possible means in society, it has now developed to several hundred thousand, several million, and even up to the insane degree of several ten million yuan, which shows that the corruption problem inside Mainland China's banks has indeed reached a degree more serious than ever before. A document issued jointly by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China and The Central Discipline Inspection Committee disclosed that in the past three years, 37 new cases of graft were discovered and handled within the banking system, involving a total of 220 million yuan. For ordinary graft, bribe-taking, embezzlement of several thousands or several ten thousands, however, is flowing in an endless stream, and it is hard to count the total amount of money involved. The People's Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, urban credit unions, rural credit unions, and insurance companies of financial units--none of these have been involved in cases of this kind. For some "silver dragons," their "fierce mouths," which are swallowing huge sums of the nation's prosperity, tend to be bigger each passing year, and the records they have created grow more shocking year by year. In 1990 there were nine especially large cases of graft, with embezzlement of over 5 million yuan. The biggest case was the Huzhou Industrial and Commercial Bank's Fenyang graft case in Zhejiang, with graft amounting to 5 million yuan; in 1991, it rose to 12 cases, an increase of three cases over the year before. This time the person with the "fierce mouth" was Guo Tingfeng [6753 1694 1496]: In his graft case in Cangnan County Agricultural Bank in Zhejiang, the graft amounted to 14.28 million yuan. In 1992, it rose to 15 cases, an increase of three cases over the year before; this time, the "champion" was Xue Genhe [5641 2704 0735] of the Haikou Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bank, with a graft amount of 33.44 million yuan. Compared to him, criminals of the past two years suddenly look like "small wizards meeting big wizards." The current problem is, while these especially big criminals have been discovered or dealt with, there are still a considerable number of banking corruption phenomena of wide scope which have yet to be discovered. The perpetrators continue to change their strategems, pursuing personal gain through their authority, exchanging that authority for money, extorting money by means of their authority, falsifying records for the benefit of relatives or friends, embezzling to make themselves rich, taking sales commissions which are highly duplicitous, and engaging in corruption. Here are some examples: First, under the rubric of invigorating the economy and supporting enterprises which invigorate capital, those who extort money have developed from operating underground to semi-overt. Many mainland enterprises lack capital and have to pay "labor fees" in the thousands, even tens of thousands of yuan when banks conduct "inquiries"; this is then remitted into the small treasuries of bank units, and is then distributed underground under a collective title. In this way, time and time again, units and their employees are tempted. A lot of "first to be rich" employees of banks made more than 1,000 yuan a month from various sources of income. No wonder a bank cadre told a good friend privately that he "only need use a little authority, and we needn't worry about lack of money." Second, if benefits are not offered to those who want to trade their authority for money, then they won't do business with you. As a monopoly financial trader, such matters as fixing project capital, giving loans, fund raising, collecting and distributing foreign exchange, allocating circulating money, issuing securities to the market, and discounting are all inside its business scope. Since these units alone offer these services, and no other agency, so they are sought out by everyone. They charge for approving a document, and take "labor fees" sales commissions for a signature, giving "information," and stamping documents. If you do not give some side benefits to bank representatives, even though your business is completely legal and your reasons are abundant, it is still hard to pass. So, exchange of authority for money has continued to rise in recent years. It has risen from asking for dishes or sending cigarettes to accepting valuable securities and financial gift cards, and has now risen to take thousands and tens of thousands in cash. There is a great deal of anger in enterprise circles, but they find it difficult to speak out. Third, the covert occupations of extortion and blackmail. With the development of the mainland economy in recent years, there has been an expanded demand for capital requirement from all sides, with a growing tendency to ask for credit loans, short term rebate loans, and fund raising in which banks serve as representatives. Once an enterprise is able to get an amount of money, the banks then demand one-thousandth of the amount in cash as a "service fee," which actually is a type of disguised confiscation, with the excuse for collecting it as so-called bank employee welfare. The mass of the people are strongly dissatisfied with this kind of extortion activity. Fourth, embezzlement of public funds for use in stock, land, and real estate speculation. This is the most outstanding phenomenon taking place in "trust investment corporations" and "security services corporations" which are attached to banks. Fifth, investment in established companies, in the attempt to make money in every way possible. In recent years, there has been a "craze for engaging in business nationally" on the Chinese mainland. This has also caused confusion and disorientation among banking system cadres, who feel "they can't be rich if they don't engage in business," and it became their way to "pursue wealth." So, all over the nation, banks have gone into operating all kinds of "companies" and "centers" by using public funds; a lot of these suddenly established companies got a "lucky open." Of these people who "plunged into the sea," some are current cadres, some are retired cadres, or even their relatives and children. They not only get the wages due them, which are perfectly justified, but they also obtain various "subsidies," "labor fees," or "profits," which arouses jealousy among ordinary factory employees. It is hard to determine the exact number of these front companies, or just how many bank employees are involved with them, even for high level leaders of the People's Bank of China. "Inside Job" Thieves Tend To Be Younger An upsetting trend is that criminals in mainland financial circles tend to be younger. In the last five years, the mainland bank business has developed rapidly, absorbing many young workers who usually come to the bank through school allocation or by social employment, filling their retired parents' positions. They have not been subjected to strict examination, training, or intensified education, so the quality of their business and their work ethic is not satisfactory. The rapid development of domestic and overseas financial business put some of them in certain leadership positions early, while some of them never worked as leaders before, and now undertake independent work assignments in a particular department. In addition, although they lack social experience and a work ethic, they deal with money every day, just at the time "money worship" is popular on the Chinese mainland. They always want to "be wealthy first of all." It can be said that the greedy desire for and pursuit of money are the most fundamental roots of increased instances of corruption among young criminals in banks. Among the 37 especially large cases mentioned above, over four-fifths involved people less than 35 years old. The youngest one was surnamed Jia [6328], a cashier at the International Trade Agency of the Shenzhen Construction Bank, who when only 17 years old grafted a total of more than US$27,000, HK$1.07 million, and over 400,000 yuan. After the crime was discovered, the criminal fled with this huge amount of money, and so far is still at large. A cashier named Wu [0702], of the Rongqi Agency of the Bank of China in Suide, Guangdong, only 26 years old, at one time or another within a 40 day period stole over 500,000 yuan RMB and HK$570,000, all of which went for gambling and leading a life of debauchery. He was deserving of the term "big termite." Weak Laws and Regulations Financial work is done by accepting deposits, extending credit, and settling accounts; it does these things by means of currency, account matters, and documents. What is involved are such forms of hard currency as currency, gold, and foreign exchange. It is therefore extremely important to establish perfect laws and regulations, efficient administrative rules, and a strong system of administration. What upsets people is that in the mainland banking system, which should be very strictly managed, such phenomena as rules violations, ignoring instances of these violations, lax management, and weak supervision are common occurrences, shortcomings which can be exploited in many places. An example is an accountant named Xue [5641] of the Dongfeng Agency of the Haikou Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bank, who took advantage of leadership trust, chaotic management in the industry, and a lack of strict rules to swallow up 250,000 yuan through three blank drafts. Initial success made him bolder, so he took advantage of his position in checking receipts, and arranged for a sealed secret escort. Over time, he stole more than 20 blank bank drafts, as well as the associated bank seal which was kept by a colleague. He then gave these bogus bank drafts to outside criminals allied with him, to secure payments from over 20 banks in more than 10 provinces and municipalities, ultimately grafting funds totalling 33.44 million yuan. A cashier named Gu [7357] was Section Chief of the No 1 Business Department of the Fuyang branch of the Anhui Industrial and Commercial Bank, who shared the privilege of entering and exiting the treasury house at will; even the rule "two people must be in charge of the treasury house," usually absolute, was no restriction on him. After he acquired the bad habit of gambling, he began thinking about the treasury house and embezzled 7.70 million yuan. After the crime was discovered, he said, very upset, "If the bank management were a bit more strict, I couldn't have pulled it off so smoothly." So, we can tell what degree of laxity exists in the mainland bank management and supervision system. Corruption Developed in Relationship Network Although there has been definite reform of the banking personnel system on the mainland in recent years, and there has been a start on publishing invitations for jobs; still, director-level positions at the provincial, municipal, and county level are still assigned by higher level authorities. Many people have done everything they can to remain in this "land of wealth" after becoming financial officers, installing their children and good friends in banking positions. Even if they have received a public invitation for a job, some people make certain arrangements under the table to let their relatives, friends, or children of their superiors get through the financial gate smoothly. From this, they form a network of authority and money which influences mutual benefits, a network in which if one is injured, all will be injured; if one goes boom, all will, so much of the graft and corruption cannot be exposed and dealt with efficiently. When several banks in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Baotou were looking into questionable persons, they all received telephone calls on these people's behalf, hinting that there might be consequences for the banks. So, behind some cases, there is not only just the ethics problem of crime itself; the bigger problem of the relationship network of appointing people by favoritism also plays a role here, and this has developed their recklessness. Obviously, as the mainland is in a transitional period of changing from a planned to a market economy, the supporting laws and regulations are not perfected yet, some policies are not correct, and there are many weak links and shortcomings in the work. All these things give "bank termites" a host of opportunities to exploit for their own advantages, and the anti-corruption struggle is facing a new, more serious situation. It is only by starting from a perfected system of rules, policies, laws and regulations and preventative measures that we can then learn the deep-rooted causes which produce corruption. Then we can make it perfect through deeper reform, dealing with both the cause and the effect, and reorganize comprehensively to block all loopholes. There is no alternative.
