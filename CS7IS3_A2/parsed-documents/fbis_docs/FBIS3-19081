FYROM Foreign Affairs Minister Krste Crvenkovski, will meet with Mr. Vance in the afternoon. The goal of the UN mediator is to renew the dialogue between Greece and FYROM which was cut off after Athens' decision to force a commercial blockade on FYROM. Just before the meeting with the Greek foreign affairs minister, Mr. Vance said he hoped to reach an agreement. Greece decided on the blockade in order to defend itself from "the aggressive attitudes" of FYROM, Mr. Papoulias reminded the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. The European Commission repeated that the Greek measures are in contradiction with the right of the European Union [EU], which is currently being presided by Greece. On 16 February, Athens refused the transit of goods to FYROM from its harbor of Saloniki and closed its consulate in Skopje, capital of FYROM. In order to lift the blockade, Greece wants FYROM to renounce its name. It estimates that the name "Macedonia" implies territorial claims on a northern province in Greece which has been called Macedonia for centuries. The United States declared to the government of Athens that they wish to see the economic embargo against FYROM lifted because it "does not contribute to stability" in the Balkans. Washington favors a renewal of the dialogue between Athens and Skopje under the protection of the United Nations. But Washington will not put forward "an American solution."
