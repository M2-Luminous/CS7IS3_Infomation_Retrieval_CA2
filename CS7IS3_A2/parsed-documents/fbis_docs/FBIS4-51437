C. Renoir in Guangzhou] [Text] A nationwide disobedience campaign appears to be gathering steam among China's underground Christian churches in the wake of new religion laws passed in January. A renewed order to register all unauthorised places of worship has been ignored by virtually every one of the underground "house churches", according to the Reverend Samuel Lamb Xiangao, the head of the Damazhan house church in Guangzhou. "On the surface the new laws say we can control ourselves. But we hear that every locality has its own laws so nobody wants to register," Lamb, 69, said at his cramped two-floor church in central Guangzhou. House church leaders from Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and northern China who visited the Damazhan church this month told Lamb they knew of no churches which have registered. Beijing's best known house church leader, the Reverend Yuan Xiangchen, who has spent time in jail for refusing government controls on his church, also pledged defiance, according to Lamb. But with Beijing apparently determined to control the mushrooming underground churches--which have an estimated 30 to 60 million regular members compared to only 7 million for the official "Three Self" Protestant Christian church--Lamb believes it may only be a matter of time before a crackdown comes. The local Three Self church in Guangzhou began handing out copies of the new law on the street last week, an ominous sign in Lamb's view. "I have heard the local PSB (public security bureau) is planning another attack on our church," he says. "But if it comes, it won't be until after the June decision," he said, referring to the US government decision on renewing trade benefits for China due to be announced on June 3. Sixty PSB officers raided the Damazhan church in February 1990, confiscating all bibles and setting up a 24hour encirclement to prevent further services. The church was not silent for long though. Two months after the raid it was again serving a weekly complement of about 800 worshippers. Damazhan, where Lamb has lived since 1930, is perhaps the best-known house church in China. The narrow, rickety building has seen a steady stream of foreign worshippers, diplomats and reporters since gaining prominence after the 1990 shutdown. The US assistant secretary of state for human rights, John Shattuck, squeezed into a wooden pew for a half-hour chat with Lamb last October. The church has faced a standing threat of demolition of the Damazhan Lane buildings since 1991. But Lamb says this is unlikely for a year or more, and he has already began scouting future sites. He said the congregation now numbers about 1,400. While defiance reigns with respect to the new registration order, it also appears that the new law governing the religious activities of foreigners in China has won veiled but widespread support among the underground Christian movement. "It's not so good for foreigners to preach. If a Chinese can preach, then we should do it ourselves," said Lamb. Lamb said the recent case of an American, Dennis Balcombe--who was expelled from Henan province in February along with six other members of his Hong Kong-based church--"had an effect around the world. Foreigners should not be so active. If everyone were as active as Balcombe, then the police would not allow us to continue," he said. But as the underground movement operates mainly without foreign involvement, Lamb says the issue of foreign preachers does not pose a great threat. "The government always accuses us of relying on foreigners. But we say this is not true," he said. "One of the Three Selfs (doctrines) is self-preaching, and that is what we do. We are a Three Selfs church, but an unregistered one."
