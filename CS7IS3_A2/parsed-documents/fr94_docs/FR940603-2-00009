The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 23, 1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal under Section 288.36, Florida Statutes Annotated (1991). The proposed zone would be the second general-purpose zone in the West Palm Beach Customs port of entry area. The existing zone, FTZ 135, is located at the Port of Palm Beach (Grantee: Port of Palm Beach, Board Order 348, 52 FR 9903, 3/27/87). The proposed foreign-trade zone would consist of sites (306 acres) at the Palm Beach International Airport and at the new North Palm Beach County Airport, both located in Palm Beach County, Florida. Site 1 (24 acres) is at the Palm Beach International Airport, and includes the Air Cargo Facility (Site 1a-3 acres); a proposed air cargo facility (Site 1b-5 acres); and a future industrial park type site (Site 1c-16 acres). Site 2 (282 acres-3 parcels) is at the North Palm Beach County Airport, Beeline Highway and Route 786. The sites are owned by Palm Beach County. The application contains evidence of the need for additional zone services in the Palm Beach County area. Several firms have indicated an interest in using zone procedures within the proposed project for warehousing/distribution of such items as electronic components, peripherals of data processing machines, lock components and ceramic tile. Specific manufacturing approvals are not being sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10-8-91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.
