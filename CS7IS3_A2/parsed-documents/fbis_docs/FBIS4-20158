Asked to comment on the possible division of the Interior Ministry, Bossi says: "Local government need not be run by the same ministry that runs the police, the country's security. These two things are different, which is how they should be. What is being discussed is not the separation of the ministry's local government sector from its security sector. The Interior Ministry is what we are discussing. We believe it is essential, it is in the League's hands to offer the country and ourselves guarantees. In the government coalition, there are parties that have their origins in the Christian Democratic Party, and if they are given the Interior Ministry, this would mean complete continuity with the old government." Bossi confirms this is why the Northern League is opposed to the idea of former President Francesco Cossiga becoming interior minister. He says that if the League does not obtain the Interior Ministry, he would be happy with the Ministry of the Autonomous Regions. He says: "If the League does not obtain the guarantee that it can carry out certain checks -- I say this again and stress it in the country's interest -- in the interest of democracy, we could, we would still support the government, but we would do this from the outside." Bossi says he is completely opposed to Radical leader Marco Pannella being appointed foreign minister. He says that Forza Italia is wrong to see Pannella as some sort of bridge with the Left, and that he is not the right man for such an important and sensitive post. Bossi also stresses what he saw as the need for an anti-trust law: "The situation is difficult with a prime minister like Berlusconi, who is an eminent businessman. I do not mean that eminent businessman should not be politicians or become prime ministers. They can, but on certain conditions, that is, on condition that there is no conflict of private and public interest. It is clear and easy to understand why this should be. A series of legal complaints could be made, which could bring the government to a standstill." Bossi says that the Northern League also wants the Treasury Ministry: "Without exaggerating, the League believes that it is very important we have the Treasury Ministry and not the Budget Ministry, which is what we have been offered, because the Treasury Ministry controls spending. If we do not have control over spending and the country's security, it would be like asking the League to sign a blank check. In a situation where the prime minister is an eminent businessman, in a country without a serious, real anti-trust law -- there is an anti-trust law; we started off with an anti-trust law based on sectors, and four or five years ago, for the first time, we voted in an anti-trust law; but it is controlled politically -- there is a political guarantor rather than the ordinary judiciary. The results of this anti-trust law are plain to see: they are the bankruptcy of important sectors such as steel and chemicals." Bossi says he believes a privatization policy should be aimed at creating widespread ownership and not selling state assets to a few powerful families.
