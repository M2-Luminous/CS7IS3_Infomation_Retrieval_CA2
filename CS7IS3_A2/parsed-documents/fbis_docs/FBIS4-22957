Zh. Chayzhunusova, Kazakh Scientific Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and Ecology, Semipalatinsk; UDC 616-092:612.014.481//482] [Text] Abstract: A study was conducted of the frequency of congenital developmental defects and monogenic genetic diseases in children residing in Beskaragayskiy, Zhanasemeyskiy and Abayskiy rayons, Semipalatinsk Oblast adjacent to the nuclear test range. It was established that the frequency of occurrence of congenital developmental defects in children was elevated in these regions. Four bibliographic reference, two tables. Key Words: congenital developmental defects, chromosome aberration, nuclear radiation. The mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation have been illuminated rather extensively in the literature [2,4,6,8]. Their registration is one of the approaches to biological dosimetry [3,5,9,10]. At the same time the structure and occurrence of genetic pathology in the population of a region within which nuclear explosions were actually carried out over the course of four decades have not been addressed by researchers. Nor has there been any research on the frequency of detection of different types of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes of the blood of persons living in direct proximity to a test range. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this blank. The need for it was brought about by the absence of dependable information on the dose loads experienced by people who suffered from nuclear weapon tests. These dose loads may be estimated indirectly using the results of research on the frequency of detection of chromosome aberrations in different age groups. Materials and Methods We analyzed statistical reporting materials of public health agencies, the birth and developmental histories of newborn infants, and records of autopsies of children who died at an age of up to 1 year in Semipalatinsk. We took account of cases of congenital developmental defects and diagnosis of hereditary diseases. We studied the frequency of detection of congenital developmental defects and monogenic genetically caused diseases in Beskaragayskiy, Zhanasemeyskiy and Abayskiy rayons, which suffered the most from the effects of ionizing radiation, and Kokpektinskiy Rayon as a control. Cytogenetic research was conducted on material from 31 clinically healthy students of the Semipalatinsk Medical Institute, 11 of whom (21.4 years old on the average) lived outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan prior to entering the VUZ and who had resided for not more than 2 years in Semipalatinsk before the time of their examination. They made up the first group of subjects. The second included 11 students (20.8 years old on the average) who were indigenous inhabitants of Semipalatinsk. A third group was made up of nine students in their first and second years, who lived in Mayskiy Rayon, Pavlodar Oblast, which is directly adjacent to the test area, prior to entering the institute. The frequency of chromosome aberrations was determined by cytological analysis of preparations of metaphasic chromosomes obtained by culturing lymphocytes from peripheral blood by the micromethod [7]. One hundred metaphase plates, selected according to criteria recommended in [1], were analyzed for each individual. A total of 3,100 metaphase plates were studied. Research Results and Discussion Data on the occurrence and structure of genetic pathology in the child population of different rayons adjacent to the test range are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Occurrence and Structure of Genetic Pathology in the Child Population of Rayons Adjacent to the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range. Form of Frequency of Detection of Genetic Abnormalities Pathology Revealed Beskaragayskiy Zhanasemeyskiy Abayskiy Rayon Kokpektinskiy Rayon Rayon Rayon Congenital 0.73 +/- 0.007, 0.47 +/- 0.006, 0.29 +/- 0.006, 0.22 +/- 0.005 developmental P[.sub]1[/]<0.001 P[.sub]2[/]<0.001 P[.sub]3[/]<0.001 defects Monogenic 0.02 +/- 0.002 0.29 +/-0.006 0.07 +/- 0.003 diseases Total 0.49 +/- 0.006 0.58 +/- 0.007 0.29 +/- 0.066 Note: P[.sub]1[/]--significance of differences between indicators of Beskaragayskiy and Kokpektinskiy rayons; P[.sub]2[/] --significance of differences between indicators of Zhanasemeyskiy and Kokpektinskiy rayons; P[.sub]3[/]--significance of differences between indicators of Abayskiy and Kokpektinskiy rayons. As we can see, the frequency of detection of congenital developmental defects was highest in Beskaragayskiy Rayon--1.5 +/-0.004 percent--that is 10.47 per 1,000 population. This indicator was 3.3 times higher than that for children residing in Kokpektinskiy Rayon (control), it was 1.6 times higher than that found in Zhanasemeyskiy, and 2.6 times higher than the indicator in Abayskiy Rayon. These differences were statistically highly significant (P[.sub]1[/]<0.001, P[.sub]2[/]<0.001, P[.sub]3[/]<0.001). One of the most important causes of the appearance of congenital developmental defects in children is chromosome abnormalities, the frequency of which typically rises in response to ionizing radiation [4,5,6]. The results of research on the frequency of different types of aberrations in chromosomes in the lymphocytes of the blood of persons residing in the region adjacent to the test range are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Frequency of Different Types of Aberrations of Chromosomes in Lymphocytes of the Blood of Persons Residing in a Region Adjacent to the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range Group of n Aberrant Total Number Chromosome Chromatid Subjects cells, /% of Type Type Aberrations Aberrations Aberrations per 100 Cells First 11 1.9 +/- 2.0 +/- 0.24 0.94 +/-0.31 1.06 +/- group 0.23 0.33 Second 11 3.2 +/- 3.2 +/- 1.2 2.41 +/-0.69 0.79 +/- group 1.2 0.29 Third 9 3.7 +/- 3.8 +/- 0.35 1.9 +/-0.36 1.9 +/- 0.29 group 0.3 P[.sub]1[/] <0.001 <0.001 <0.05 <0.05 P[.sub]2[/] > 0.1 > 0.1 > 0.1 <0.05 P[.sub]3[/] > 0.1 > 0.1 > 0.1 > 0.1 Note: P[.sub]1[/]--significance of differences between indicators for subjects in the first and third groups; P[.sub]2[/] --significance of differences between indicators for subjects in the second and third groups; P[.sub]3[/]--significance of differences between indicators for subjects in the first and second groups. As we can see, the frequency of detection of aberrant cells was 1.9 +/- 0.3 percent for students from outside the city prior to entering the medical institute (first group), it was 3.2 +/- 1.2 percent for students who were indigenous inhabitants of Semipalatinsk (second group), which was 1.5 times higher than for the first group, although this difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.1). This indicator was 3.7 +/- 0.3 percent for students who had resided in Mayskiy Rayon, Pavlodar Oblast prior to entering the VUZ (third group), which was 1.95 times higher than for subjects of the first group. This difference was statistically highly significant (P<0.001). A tendency for the frequency of detection of aberrant cells in students of the third group to rise in comparison with the second was also detected, although this difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.1). The total number of chromosome aberrations in students of the first group was 2.0 +/- 0.24 per 100 cells--that is 1.6 times lower than in the second group (3.2 +/- 1.2 per 100 cells). This difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.1). However, the number of chromosome aberrations in students of the second group was found to be 1.9 times higher than for students of the first, with the statistical significance of the indicated differences being high (P<0.001). When we studied the types of aberrations we found that the chromosome type was encountered significantly more often in persons of the third group than in persons of the first (P<0.05). Chromatid aberrations were encountered significantly more often in persons of the third group than in the second (P<0.5) and first (P<0.05) groups. We know that the frequency of spontaneous aberrations of chromosomes in lymphocytes in human peripheral blood, determined in special research using large samples, is sufficiently low, varying on the average from 1.0 to 1.2 percent [1]. In this case it does not depend on the sex of the subjects, but it increases with age, attaining 5-6 percent in persons over 60 years old. In this connection we selected groups that were homogeneous with respect to age for our research. Thus our research established that the frequency of chromosome aberrations in students who were inhabitants of Mayskiy Rayon, which is directly adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test range, was the highest. Moreover we also discovered a tendency for the frequency of detection of chromosome aberrations in students who were indigenous inhabitants of Semipalatinsk to increase in comparison with students who lived outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan prior to entering the medical institute. It is evident from Table 1 that the frequency of detection of monogenic genetically caused diseases was highest in Beskaragayskiy Rayon (0.31 +/- 0.007 percent), while in Zhanasemeyskiy Rayon it was 3.5 times lower that the indicator for Kokpektinskiy Rayon, the population of which suffered to a relatively lesser degree from ionizing radiation as a result of the test range's operation. This can apparently be explained by the fact that point mutations play the dominant role in the advent of monogenic diseases, and according to some data [6,8] their frequency changes insignificantly in response to small doses of ionizing radiation. Thus our research established a rise in frequency of occurrence of congenital developmental defects in the child population residing in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test range. This pattern is explained by the higher frequency of chromosome aberrations detected in persons residing permanently in the region; a tendency for this frequency to rise with decreasing distance from the test range was also observed. The influence of its factors on the frequency of occurrence of monogenic genetically caused diseases could not be established dependably in this research; this question does need additional study.
