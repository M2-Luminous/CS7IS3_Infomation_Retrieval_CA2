The man, who is in custody, said he drew the gun to fend off an assault. The PRD, an opposition party, issued a communique describing the incident as "a foiled attempt" on Perez Balladares, whom opinion polls show as the favorite in next Sunday's general elections. Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Dennis Allen, however, said the policeman, whom the PRD identified as Maritime Service Corporal Juan Bautista Zapata, said after being detained that he was just trying to repel an attacker who assaulted him while he was attending the PRD rally in downtown Panama City. Bautista Zapata was wearing civilian clothes at the time of the incident.
