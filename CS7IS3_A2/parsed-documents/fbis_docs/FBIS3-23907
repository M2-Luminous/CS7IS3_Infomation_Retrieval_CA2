This is the main news following from Decree No. 131-r of the St. Petersburg Mayor. On 16 February Anatoliy Sobchak made new changes in and additions to the Statute of Elections to the City Assembly he had authored. In the event more than two candidates are on the ballot in an electoral district and none is elected (that is, does not get more than 50 percent of the ballots cast by the voters participating in the elections), the city electoral commission must make a decision on holding a runoff election in the district, placing on the ballot the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes. The runoff election is held no later than two weeks after the first round. The candidate who receives the greater number of ballots cast by the voters participating in the elections is considered elected. Elections are considered invalid if the number of valid ballots is less than 25 percent of the number of eligible voters, as well as in the event no more than two candidates were on the ballot in the district and neither was elected. In addition, Sobchak made an amendment to Point 4 of Article 2 of the statute, bringing it into compliance with the Russian Constitution. Let us recall that in keeping with this point, members of the Federal Assembly could not be elected to the assembly, while the Constitution applies this prohibition only to State Duma deputies but not to members of the Federation Council, who carry out their duties on a part-time basis. The ban on Federation Council members' becoming assembly deputies was the subject of a complaint by the former city soviet chairman, Aleksandr Belyayev, which is currently being considered by the city court. By making changes in the statute on elections, the mayor partially took into account the pertinent suggestions of the electoral coalitions. The two-round election system will allow to avoid the incidents that occurred in the course of elections to the Federal Assembly.
