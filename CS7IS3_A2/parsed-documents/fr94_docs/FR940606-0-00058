FR940606-0-00058 FR940606-0-00019 (e) Appeals. A person who disagrees with the PHA's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the PHA. A person who is dissatisfied with the PHA's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office responsible for administering the URA requirements in the jurisdiction. (f) Responsibility of PHA. (1) The PHA must provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24 that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the PHA to comply with these provisions. (2) The cost of required relocation assistance may be paid for by the owner, or with local public funds, or with funds available from other sources. The cost of PHA advisory services for temporary relocation of tenants may be paid from preliminary fees or ongoing administrative fees. (3) The PHA must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The PHA must maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and disability status of displaced persons. (g) Definition of displaced person. (1) For purposes of this section, the term displaced person means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to: (i) A person who moves permanently from the real property after receiving a notice from the Owner requiring such move, if the move occurs on or after the date of the submission of the Owner application to the PHA; (ii) A person, including a person who moves permanently before the submission of the Owner application to the PHA, if the PHA or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after execution of the Agreement between the Owner and the PHA, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of: (A) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or (B) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 813.107, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit and any increased housing costs; or (B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the rehabilitation or construction, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable; or (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if: (i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the PHA determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance; (ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the Owner application to the PHA and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the Owner application, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance provided under this section) if the Owner application is approved; (iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or (iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project. (3) The PHA may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section. (h) Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of determining the formula for computing a replacement housing payment to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term initiation of negotiations means the execution of the Agreement between the Owner and the PHA.
