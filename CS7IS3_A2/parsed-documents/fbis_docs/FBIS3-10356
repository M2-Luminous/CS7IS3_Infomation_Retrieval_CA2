Quiroga had to admit the La Paz Civic Committee's power and the extent of the strike: [Begin Quiroga recording] Services have been reduced because of the pressures and the vehicles that blocked the streets. We have stated that the strike has thus begun and that it continued to increase. Approximately 70 percent of the banks opened but all of them are now closed because of the pressures by the Civic Committee brigades. The same thing occurred with transportation in the Achachicala and Vino Tinto areas, where public buses were stoned and microbus windows broken. The bus owners, obviously, decided to suspend services. Markets on Buenos Aires Avenue and even on Bilinquentes Comunes Street were looted in the name of the Civic Committee. Such actions by criminals caused fear, and the city of La Paz probably will be completely paralyzed this afternoon. [end recording] Quiroga said the La Paz Civic Committee did not have to declare this strike: [Begin Quiroga recording] All the points proposed to the government by the Civic Committee have been positively answered, including the budget issue. They asked the government not to reduce the department's budget. La Paz Department's total budget was increased more than 8 million bolivianos under a system of equal participation for the number of people in the department in order to match the revenues of the cities with those of the rural areas. This was explained in detail to La Paz Civic Committee President Freire, but he stated that it was not possible to suspend the strike at the time this was explained, that is, at 8 p.m. [end recording] [passage omitted] Quiroga concluded by saying that no confrontations occurred in La Paz, and civic strikes were not observed in Beni and Pando Departments.
