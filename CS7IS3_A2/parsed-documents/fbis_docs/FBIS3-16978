Speaker Ivan Rybkin told lawmakers the committee for organization of the Duma's activities discovered during the lunch-break that many of the amendments moved by people's deputies before discussing the working procedure in the second reading were not taken into account. Meanwhile, the first half of today's plenary meeting of the State Duma was focused on this issue. Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] made another attempt to talk lawmakers into approving the amendment moved by his party about the so-called "imperative mandate". Under this amendment, a deputy quitting a parliamentary faction is to be stripped of his credentials and replaced by the next member on the party list. To push this amendment through parliament, Zhirinovskiy promised to the deputies' groups "December 12 Union" and "Russian Path", which were denied registration because of insufficient numerical strength, that the Liberal Democratic faction would vote for an amendment reducing the number of deputies required for registration. The Liberal Democrat leader suggested that the two amendments be voted as a "package", but lawmakers rejected the suggestion.
