He hopes that the current changes in Russia will not translate into a freeze or halt the reforms. "If they (the reforms) were to stop halfway, it could be worse than if they were not implemented at all," he emphasized. Havel, who assumed the post of president of the Czech Republic just a year ago, was also asked what developments he would wish for. "Regarding our Republic, I would like the economic transformation to be successfully completed, our country to be politically stable and quickly integrated into the European structures. I would like a civic society to flourish here, and decency, gentlemanliness, and political culture be enhanced here," Havel answered.
