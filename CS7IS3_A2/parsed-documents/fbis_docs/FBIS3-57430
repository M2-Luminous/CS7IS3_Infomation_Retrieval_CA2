The article envisages a prison term from three to eight years. The criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with a letter of noted human rights activist and deputy editor-in-chief of the "New Times" weekly Kronid Lyubarskiy to Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik in which he said that Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last Leap to the South" contains open appeals to war. "The author of the book advocates the unleashing of an aggressive war against countries neighbouring on Russia -- Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan", Lyubarskiy said. "In connection with received statements and appeals and with the examination of facts cited there the office of the prosecutor general instituted criminal proceedings on Wednesday against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on charges envisaged by Article 712 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation -- the propaganda of war", the press service of the prosecutor's office said. Zhirinovskiy is a member of the State Duma and possesses immunity, however Lyubarskiy said this cannot free him from criminal proceedings as the crime was committed before he was elected. Lyubarskiy recalled that two organisers of the abortive Soviet 1991 coup who were elected to the new parliament still face trial and the court refused to drop the criminal proceedings against them while the prosecutor's office did not appeal against the court ruling.
