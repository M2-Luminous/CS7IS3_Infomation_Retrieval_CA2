The meeting will be attended by chairman of the Belarusian Parliament, Mechyslaw Hryb. This was declared at a meeting of the Belarusian parliament chairman with a peace-keeping group of the CIS intreparliamentary assembly which arrived in Minsk from Yerevan on Sunday morning, following trips to Baku and Nagorno-Karabakh. "The arrival of the peace-keeping group in Minsk and a meeting with the head of the Belarusian parliament was not spontaneous," Medetkan Sherimkulov, head of the CIS intreparlaimentary delegation and chairman of the Kyrgyz Parliament, told ITAR-TASS on Sunday night after the delegation returned from Minsk to Moscow. "Belarus is one of active participants of the CIS interparliamentary assembly." He said, according to Sherimkulov, in order to establish peace in the Karabakh region, all CIS countries should be interested in the mediatory mission. In Sherimkulov's opinion, Belarus has concrete proposals which will be discussed in Bishkek early in May. Commenting on the results of the visit by the CIS interparliamentary peace-keeping delegation to the Caucasus, Sherimkulov said that heads of the Azeri and Armenian Parliaments agreed to take part in the Bishkek meeting. Sherimkulov did not rule out the possibility of Karabakh officials taking part in the meeting. Shermkulov said that the main condition for the settlement of the Karabakh crisis is "a total ceasefire in the zone of the conflict." Sherimklov said that CIS parliamentarians are interested in the solution of the problem of the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh, removal of blockade, restoration of Karabakh infrastructure, including a gas pipe-line, railways and highways and the return of refugees to their homes. Asked by ITAR-TASS about prospects for the participation of CIS peace-keeping forces in the disengagement of warring sides, Sherimkulov pointed out that "we cannot put the responsibility for peace-keeping efforts on Russia alone." "The number of peace-keepers and a degree of participation of CIS peace-keeping units has not been discussed yet," Sherimkulov said. "What is important at the present stage is that all CIS member-states express readiness to promote the establishment of peace in Nagorno-Karabakh," he added.
