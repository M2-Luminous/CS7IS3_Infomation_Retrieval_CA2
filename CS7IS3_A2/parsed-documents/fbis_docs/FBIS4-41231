As we have already reported, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev monitored [kontrolirovali] the exercise. [Correspondent Mikhail Zotov] During the command and staff exercise of strategic missile troops in the area of test range No. 53 in Plesetsk today, a training launch of the Topol strategic intercontinental solid fuel missile was carried out. Its projected target area was Kamchatka. Adjacent countries were informed about the planned launch, and the flight of the missile was tracked by nine ground radars, which transmitted the data to a computer center in Plesetsk. The Russian defense minister and the commander in chief monitored the exercise. In the opinion of military observers, the 100-tonne, RS-12M Topol launcher has shown once again the reliability and high quality of operation of all the systems and of the missile launch crew. Despite the fact that the strategic missile troops are experiencing many of the problems that are characteristic of the Army, the strategic missile troops still remain a reliable guarantor of Russia's security and independence. The number of training launches, however, is dwindling with each passing year. The families of the servicemen who have decided to give up the difficult job of officer in the Russian Army are leaving the garrisons. For the time being, a few 35- or 40-year-old officers, who have not given up the protection of Russian borders in a difficult moment, ensure the combat training of missile troops.
