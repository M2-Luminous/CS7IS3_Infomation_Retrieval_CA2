The dielectric gas breakdown[.sup]1[/] creates a plasma and subsequent chemical reaction even where a resonant condition does not exist. The CO[.sub]2[/] laser beam (wavelength: 9.6 �m, pulsewidth: 2 �sec, pulse energy: 0.4-1.5 J) was focused by a BaF[.sub]2[/] lens through a KBr window into a glass reaction cell filled with raw material gas. B, TiB[.sub]2[/], and B[.sub]4[/]C powders were prepared from BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/], BCl[.sub]3[/]+TiCl[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/], and BBr[.sub]3[/]+CH[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture respectively. The particulate materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, ICP atomic emission spectroscopy, and X-ray and electron diffraction. It was found that the short-range order structure of boron powders deposited on a cold reaction wall was similar to that of _b_-rhombohedral.[.sup]2[/] Produced TiB[.sub]2[/] and B[.sub]4[/]C were crystalline. The particles were monodispersed and the particle sizes of the powders were 0.1-0.3 �m. The yields of powder were increased linearly with increasing laser pulse energy, whereas average particle size was independent of energy. The threshold of breakdown in the gas mixture of total pressure of 250 Torr was about 600 J/cm[.sup]2[/] and was inversely proportional to the total pressure of the gas in a logarithmic scale, and the proportional constant was -0.52 for BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/]. About 90% of incident pulse energy was absorbed by plasma in the reactant gas. References 1. C. DeMichelis, IEEE J. QUANTUM ELECTRON. Vol 5, 1969, p 188. 2. M. Kobayashi, T. Oyama, H. Nishizawa, T.
