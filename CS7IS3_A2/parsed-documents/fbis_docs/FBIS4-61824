Heading the delegation is Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and chairman of the council. Vlastimir Mijovic has the details: [Begin Mijovic recording] The main goal of the Serbian Civic Council delegation is to acquaint Russian officials with the real situation in which the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have found themselves. So far, Moscow has only been visited by representatives of the group that rejected the idea of a united Bosnia-Herzegovina and with arms and crimes tried to draw (word indistinct] ethnic borders. Through grave manipulations and disinformation, the impression has been created in Russia that all Bosnian Serbs support such an option (?embodied) in Karadzic's (policy). In the scheduled talks, the delegation headed by Mirko Pejanovic will try to acquaint Russian officials with the concept that the Serbian Civic Council advocates, which is the survival of the Serbian population that is true to joint life and a united state. Our delegation will be received tomorrow by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign Committee of the Russian Duma and a very influential person of Russian foreign policy. The delegation will later meet with members of the Foreign Committee and representatives of all parliamentary groups. It is still not known whether our delegation will attend the parliamentary debate on the Bosnian crisis initiated in the Duma. The Duma leadership has still not decided whether it will hold an open debate or behind closed doors. If the session is open, our representatives will also be given an opportunity to speak. In the next two days, the Serbian Civic Council delegation will hold talks at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will also visit the patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. Its main task is to present the situation in which the Bosnian Serbs have found themselves, as well as the overall political views of the government in Sarajevo. As Mirko Pejanovic and Miro Lazovic have told us, they are going to convey an official invitation to Boris Yeltsin to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina. They will also try to arrange a visit by a high-level Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation to Russia. In any case, through the representatives of the Serbian Civic Council, Russian top politicians will have an opportunity to learn about another option that is entirely opposite to the one on the Serbian issue that representatives of [word indistinct] the Belgrade authorities have been presenting to them. It is difficult to expect a major advance overnight, but it is certain that this visit will contribute to Russian circles attaining a better view of the Bosnian crisis. [end recording]
