Masaru Hashimoto received more shady political donations during the election campaign last September in addition to the one already revealed, well-placed sources said Wednesday [6 April]. Hashimoto received a total of 1.05 million yen from a surveying company and the president of a construction firm, both in Ibaraki Prefecture, which had obtained contracts from the prefecture. Hashimoto was criticized at the prefectural assembly last month for receiving 1.5 million yen from Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd., which was involved in a bribery scandal concerning the garbage disposal facilities in Tsukuba. The Sumitomo contribution was suspected to be illegal since the Tokyo-based company was a contractor for the prefecture's public works projects. Hashimoto later donated 1.5 million yen to a public organization and revised his report on political funds during the election campaign. According to an investigation by the prefecture, Hashimoto received 50,000 yen from the Ibaraki surveying firm, which received contracts from the prefecture. He also received a contribution of 1 million yen from a construction company president, but this was apparently not illegal because it was made by an individual. Hashimoto said it was a "simple, elementary mistake," and has already revised the declarations concerning the two donations in his campaign financial report. Hashimoto was elected governor last September to succeed Fujio Takeuchi, who was indicted on charges of taking bribes from Hazama Corp., a major construction firm.
