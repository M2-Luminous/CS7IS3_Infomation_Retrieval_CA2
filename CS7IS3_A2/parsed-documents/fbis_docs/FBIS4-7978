[sentence as published] [Moravcik] On integration. We want to eliminate our lag within the framework of the Visegrad Four group, especially in the sphere of security systems, where we have been evidently assigned the last rank of late or even a place outside the group. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] What course do you intend to pursue in the economy? [Moravcik] The previous government can be reproached for lack of concept. And, even when certain concepts were approved, poor emphasis was placed on their implementation. The government was improvising, more or less. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Do you think that in the six months the interim government has at its disposal you will manage to be more consistent? [Moravcik] We want to set a clear program and clear targets and implement them consistently. We realize that we will not be able to fulfill any major program in this brief period, but we want to lay the foundations for long-term development. We reckon that we have some chances of continuing after the elections. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Does this mean that the time frame of your policy will be limited by the election date? [Moravcik] No. We want to look further ahead, even though, after the elections, our policy might be represented by different people than today. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] In which regard would you not want to follow in the footsteps of the previous government? [Moravcik] In its improvisation. Even though it is possible to resolve some burning problem by this method, the extinguishing of fire in one place, without precise targeting, can cause a fire elsewhere, which could lead society into a state of permanent conflict. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] How will the approach of Moravcik's government to privatization differ from that of Meciar's government? [Moravcik] By the depoliticization of privatization. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] What guarantees do you offer that this depoliticization will be real? [Moravcik] Control by parliament and more clarity of the privatization process. It is high time for the principle of professionalism to assert itself at the ministries. We are not going to make any changes that would violate this principle. However, some changes are inevitable in the interest of a good operation of state administration. [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Compromise was characteristic of the opposition's joint course of action against someone. Will it last until the elections? In this period, it will be necessary to address a number of practical and urgent social problems, on which the Christian Democratic Movement and the Party of the Democratic Left, for example, can have different opinions. [Moravcik] What is involved is a permanent process of achieving and renewing consensus? The mechanism is laid down in the coalition agreement. What determined the formation of the current government coalition were discussions on practical problems, on the solution to which we had agreed.
