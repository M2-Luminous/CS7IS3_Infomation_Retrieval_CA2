What would constitute the most serious threats at home and abroad? [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful, although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups. Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors, our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military forces is present. We should view their situation differently. In those areas, security is provided by others and for their own interests. We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and east of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot efface them fast. [passage omitted] In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity stemming from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations. Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran. The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States. The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the Europeans. The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States. If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the straying of their youth were not important for us, we could ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the eastern regions of the country would become completely safe. It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human rights violations. But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to narcotics. [passage omitted]
