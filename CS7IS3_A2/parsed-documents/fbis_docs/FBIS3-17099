A source close to Mutalibov's surrounding told SNARK that the ex-president considers Geydar Aliyev as main guilty person in Karabakh conflict. He claimed that Aliyev, while being the First Secretary of Azerbaijan Communist Party, pursued a policy of human rights infringement among the national minorities living in the republic: of Lezghins, Kurds, Talishes, Tats, Avars, and of Armenians. This policy resulted in the open confrontation. Escape from the crisis is seen by Mutalibov in account of interests of all national minorities living in Azerbaijan, namely in federalization of political system in the republic, with whom he never cut off his relations while living outside. Speaking about the Karabakh war, Mutalibov observed that it is lost due to policy of illegal, as he thinks, presidents Elchibey and Aliyev, who for the sake of their own ambitions had cast their people into a real slaughter.
