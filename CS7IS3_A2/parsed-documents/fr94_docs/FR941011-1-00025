FR941011-1-00025 FR941011-1-00012 (6) Contractor compensation systems must have adequate internal and administrative controls to ensure the integrity of the system and its data (see 42.1304(b) for minimum standards). (b) Reasonableness. The compensation for personal services paid or accrued to each employee must be reasonable for the work performed. Compensation will be considered reasonable if each of the allowable elements making up the employee's compensation package is reasonable. This paragraph addresses the reasonableness of compensation except when the compensation is set by provisions of a labor-management agreement under terms of the National Labor Relations Act or similar state statues. The tests for reasonableness of labor-management agreements are set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection. In addition to the provisions of 31.201&hyph;3, in testing the reasonableness of individual elements for particular employees or job classes of employees, consideration should be given to factors determined to be relevant by the contracting officer. (1) Among others, factors which may be relevant include the adequacy of the contractor's compensation system (see subpart 42.13), general conformity with the compensation paid by other firms of the same size, the compensation paid by other firms in the same industry, the compensation paid by firms in the same geographic area, the compensation paid by firms engaged in predominantly non-Government work, and the cost of comparable service obtainable from from outside sources. In addition to the adequacy of the compensation system, the relative significance of other factors in evaluating the reasonableness of compensation depends on the degree to which the factors are representative of the labor market for the job being evaluated. In administering this principle, it is recognized that not every compensation case need be subjected in detail to the tests described in this cost principle. The tests need be applied only when a general review reveals amounts or types of compensation that appear unreasonable or unjustified. Based on initial review of the facts, contracting officers or their representatives may challenge the reasonableness of any individual element or the sum of the individual elements of compensation paid or accrued to particular employees or job classes of employees. In such cases, there is no presumption of reasonableness and, upon challenge, the contractor must demonstrate the reasonableness of the compensation item in question. In doing so, the contractor may introduce, and the contracting officer will consider, not only any circumstances surrounding the compensation item challenged, but also the magnitude of other compensation elements which may be lower than would be considered reasonable in themselves. However, the contractor's right to introduce offsetting compensation elements into consideration is subject to the following limitations: (i) Offsets will be considered only between the allowable elements of an employee's (or a job class of employees') compensation package or between the compensation packages of employees in jobs within the same job grade or level. (ii) Offsets will be considered only between the allowable portion of the compensation elements of employees or job classes of employees. However, any of the compensation elements or portions thereof, whose amount is not measurable, shall not be introduced or considered as an offset item. Compensation elements include: (A) Wages and salaries. (B) Incentive bonuses. (C) Deferred compensation. (D) Pension and savings plan benefits. (E) Health insurance benefits. (F) Life insurance benefits. (G) Compensated personal absence benefits. (iii) In considering offsets, the magnitude of the compensation elements in question must be taken into account. In determining the magnitude of compensation elements, the timing of receipt by the employee must be considered. (2) Compensation costs under certain conditions give rise to the need for special consideration. Among such conditions are the following:
