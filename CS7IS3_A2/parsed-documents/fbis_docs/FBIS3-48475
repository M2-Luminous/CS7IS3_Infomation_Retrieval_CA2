So far, the government has persistently taken the view that it is difficult for Japan to cooperate with the UN Peaecekeeping Operations (PKO) in former Yugoslavia. The government has unequivocally explained that it has not sent the fact-finding team to study the possibility of dispatching Japan's military observers, (says a senior Foreign Ministry official). Raising questions about Mr. Yanai's real intentions, a top government official has said, "We need to pay attention to him." The same government official also has become cautious regarding the Foreign Ministry's "initiative." Yasushi Akashi, special representative of the UN Secretary General, who is in charge of UN affairs in former Yugoslavia, has expressed the hope that Japan will send its military observers to the UNPROFOR in Macedonia since assuming his post. At a meeting with Mr. Yanai on 8 January, Mr. Akashi said, "I hope Japan will explore the possibility of cooperating with the UNPROFOR." The UNPROFOR is a new form of the PKO which is being tested in Macedonia. The PKO Cooperation Law in Japan does not envision Japan's participation in the UNPROFOR and the Foreign Ministry has indicated it would be "difficult for Japan to dispatch its military observers to the UNPROFOR," (says a top government official). The government is baffled by Mr. Yanai's remark in view of this background. Defense Agency Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference on 17 January that "I do not think that Japan can send the military observers to Macedonia under the present legal system." It is true, however, that complaints are rising within the Foreign Ministry that "political constraints are standing in the way of fully using the PKO Cooperation Law," (says a senior Foreign Ministry official). Many officials in the Foreign Ministry, which has promoted Japan's cooperation with the PKO with an eye on Japan's seat on the UN Security Council, think that discussion on whether to send the military observers to former Yugoslavia should be continued. Mr. Yanai's remark is taken as a reflection of that mood in the Foreign Ministry and as an attempt to create a stir in the government and among the people. The same top government official revealed on 17 January his distrust in the Foreign Ministry's "way of handing things," citing the fact that the government's decision to "postpone" sending Self- Defense Forces personnel to Mozambique for the PKO was reversed after the Foreign Ministry's fact-finding team returned home. It is certain that once a high-ranking Japanese Government official speaks of a "study," his remark leads the United Nations, European nations, and other nations concerned to pin high hopes on Japan. Administrative Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito has said, "Mr. Yanai's duties were not to make a judgment, but to undertake a survey." Hence, Mr. Yanai may come under criticism for making a rash remark.
