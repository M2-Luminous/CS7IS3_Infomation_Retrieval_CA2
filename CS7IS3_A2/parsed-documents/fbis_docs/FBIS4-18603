[passage omitted] Florian Gerster, SPD defense expert and Rhineland-Palatinate Bundesrat minister, has called the White Paper a document of inadequacy. Decisive questions, such as how compulsory military service will be shaped in the future, what structures the armed forces will have in the future, and what has been changed about deployment, remain unanswered. Gerster added that the White Paper gives the impression that the central tasks of national defense are being treated by those responsible in politics as if they could be neglected. Instead of thinking about how the relationship between society and the armed forces could be improved, the White Paper concentrates completely on the establishment of highly mobile crisis reaction forces and of equipment that is conceived for missions outside Germany, and even outside Europe. In fact, in Gerster's view, the use of the armed forces outside the country has become the actual new main task and has thus been made virtually superior to national defense. This new priority leads to the conclusion that the authors of the White Paper have embarked upon a new course in security policy, Gerster said. It is their goal to establish an interventionist army consisting of five brigades and the air and naval forces that are necessary for its use all over the world. The money that the Bundeswehr still gets is concentrated on the investment necessary for this purpose. The large remainder of the armed forces, on the other hand, is treated without kindness and even neglected. Gerster said: "What is supposed to develop here is a new Bundeswehr, which the FRG does not need to defend its own country and which, in addition, would be based neither on the approval of the people nor on that of most of the young men eligible for military service who are supposed to serve in it." The lack of planning security, which has already existed for the troops and for the public so far, is not reduced by the White Paper but rather increased. "Only one thing is clear," Gerster said: "A Bundeswehr with 370,000 men cannot be maintained with these priorities and with financing that will probably hit an upper limit of about 47 billion German marks over the next few years."
