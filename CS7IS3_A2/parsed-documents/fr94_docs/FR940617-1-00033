FR940617-1-00033 FR940617-1-00012 The agency also has decided that OTC topical antimicrobial and topical antibiotic drug products should be included within the same monograph. Although an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical antibiotic drug products was published under part 342 (21 CFR part 342) on April 1, 1977 (42 FR 17642), the final monograph for those products was issued on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47312) as a new subpart of the OTC topical antimicrobial monograph, part 333, subpart B_Topical First Aid Antibiotic Drug Products. Subpart A will cover first aid antiseptic drug products; subpart C will cover antifungal drug products; subpart D covers acne drug products; and new subpart E will cover health-care antiseptic drug products. In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish subpart E of part 333, FDA states its position on the establishment of a monograph for OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. This document addresses only those comments and data concerning the previous antimicrobial tentative final monograph that are related to ``non-first aid uses,'' including products for personal use in the home and products used by health-care professionals. This proposal constitutes FDA's reevaluation of the January 6, 1978 tentative final monograph based on the comments received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Miscellaneous External Panel's reports on OTC alcohol and mercury-containing drug products and the comments received. The following sections of the January 6, 1978 tentative final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products are being addressed in this document: §§333.1, 333.3, 333.30, 333.50, 333.85, 333.87, 333.97, and 333.99. The following sections of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products are being addressed in this document: §§333.55 and 333.98. Modifications have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary of the comments and FDA's responses to them. (See section I.) The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage. In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II and III, the term ``nonmonograph conditions'' is used. This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage. The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12 months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the Federal Register . On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition, i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application). Further, any OTC drug product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date. In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (39 FR 33103), the agency suggested that the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph in the Federal Register and that the conditions excluded from the monograph (Category II) be eliminated from OTC drug products effective 6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph, regardless of whether further testing was undertaken to justify their future use. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered by the monograph is necessary in order for manufacturers to comply with the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written, ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. The agency has determined that it is impractical to expect new labeling to be in effect 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph. Experience has shown also that if the deadline for relabeling is too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and related paperwork.
