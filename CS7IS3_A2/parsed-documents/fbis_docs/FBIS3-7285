In a joint press conference with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after a second round of summit talks, Kim said that South Korea and Japan share a common interest in developing economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Peace and security on the Korean peninsula are essential to stability in the region, but vestiges of the Cold War still linger on the peninsula, Kim said. Kim stated that it is "imperative that neighboring countries work together toward making North Korea discard its isolationist policy." He also said it is "imperative that North Korea give up its suspected nuclear arms development program and return to the South-North dialogue." Reporting his agreement with Hosokawa on economic cooperation in the East Asian region, Kim noted that both sides agreed the lopsided bilateral trade imbalance must be resolved. The president ends a three-day visit to Japan Saturday afternoon, leaving for Shanghai for talks with Chinese leaders. Kim said it was "the insincerity of North Korea that brought about the referral" of the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. "Measures should be taken in accordance with the North's attitude," the president said, suggesting a flexible stance toward Pyongyang. Hosokawa stressed the need for a firm and unified response of international society to the issue while leaving open a window for dialogue with North Korea. The president, in his meeting with Hosokawa on Saturday [26 March], said that instead of suddenly imposing sanctions on North Korea, countries should begin by calling for the inspections and promoting the resumption of inter-Korean dialogue. "I hope we don't follow the path of isolating the North," the officials quoted him as saying. Kim told Hosokawa that he was aware that Pyongyang had conducted some military exercises on February 3, but added that there did not appear to be anything unusual in the current situation in North Korea. Hosokawa, speaking on bilateral trade issues, said he would do his best to redress the current trade imbalance and will consider the dispatch on an investment study team to South Korea.
