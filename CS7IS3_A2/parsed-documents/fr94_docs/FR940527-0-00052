FR940527-0-00052 FR940527-0-00018 Comment: One commenter disagrees with USEPA's proposed finding that Ohio's rules do not require timely implementation of RACM at Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant. The comments focus on the cupolas, stating that control options previously under consideration are beyond what controls should be considered reasonably available. Nevertheless, the commenter states that ``Ford has already submitted to Ohio EPA an alternative control strategy that would provide for all reductions necessary for attainment to occur by December 10, 1993.'' Response: Although the commenter believes that further control of the cupolas are not reasonably available, the commenter has not provided any detailed information to support its view. Also, the commenter does not address other emission points identified as not demonstrated to have RACM by December 10, 1993. No revised rules have been submitted, and so USEPA must conclude that the submitted rules do not satisfy the requirement in section 189(a)(1)(C) for RACM in Cuyahoga County. The notice of proposed rulemaking notes that one alternative for satisfying section 189(a)(1)(C) would be to advance the post-1993 control requirements so as to assure attainment by December 1993. Ford has apparently recommended State rule revisions which would satisfy the RACM requirement in this manner. If Ohio adopts and submits rule revisions which require that all measures necessary for attainment be implemented by December 1993, and no substantive new issues are raised by the submittal, USEPA would be able to publish final rulemaking approving such a revision and concluding that the RACM requirement is satisfied. Comment: A commenter notes that Ford has challenged various provisions of the State rules, including the open dust limits, the reduced exemptions from the general stack opacity limit for startup and shutdown, the procedure for establishing equivalent visible emission limits, and the provision that contingency measures could be triggered based on air quality data collected before all SIP control measures are implemented. Response: The commenter has not provided a basis for USEPA to disapprove these provisions which were proposed for approval. If the State adopts and submits revisions to these aspects of its plan, USEPA will conduct prompt rulemaking on the submittal. It should be noted that Ford's revised compliance schedule will provide that all measures shown necessary for attainment will be implemented prior to the first year of monitoring data (i.e. 1994) which under Section 188(d) is to be used to judge attainment. Comment: Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel provides extensive discussion of a modeling reanalysis it plans to conduct both to reassess emissions from its facility and to reassess the impact of these emissions. Response: These comments do not provide any modeling results or other information to indicate that the current rules provide for attainment. These comments also propose several modeling techniques which differ from standard practice (e.g., the use of plume rise for the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) based on the Buoyant Line Plume Model) that have not been justified. In the absence of detailed documentation of a modeling analysis properly demonstrating that attainment is assured, USEPA must continue to conclude that the requirement in Section 189(a)(1)(B) for assuring attainment has not been satisfied. Comment: A commenter identifies several reasons to believe that the BOF at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel does not have a high fugitive emission rate. First, no exceedances have been monitored since 1989. Second, these emissions have been in compliance with the 20 percent/3-minute average opacity limit. Third, evidence included in the State's SIP submittal indicates that modeling more closely reproduces monitored concentrations if a relatively modest emission rate is assumed. This commenter expresses concern that this portion of the SIP submittal may have been overlooked. Response: Each of the commenter's reasons for expecting low BOF fugitive emissions may be addressed individually. First, the commenter is correct that no exceedances have been observed after 1989. However, monitoring data provide only a limited indication of fugitive emissions from the BOF, since monitoring data reflect the impact of multiple sources and reflect actual emissions rather than allowable emissions. More generally, in order to assure attainment, the State's plan must establish limits such that attainment would occur even if all sources were emitting at full allowable emissions. (See Guidelines on Air Quality Models. ) Thus, the absence of monitored exceedances does not indicate that emissions at the BOF or at other nearby sources are sufficiently limited to assure attainment.
