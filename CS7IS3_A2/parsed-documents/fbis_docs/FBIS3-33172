Yesterday, the third Friendship Caravan sponsored by Pastors for Peace got under way. Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel is drafting a bill to be introduced in the next Congress to counter the Torricelli Law. [Begin recording] [Cavada] Minister, there is a bill against the blockade by Congressmen Charles Rangel. What is your opinion? Are you aware of what it contains, exactly? [Robaina] Yes, we are aware. It is another way of ....[changes thought] From within U.S. society, spokesmen of that society are realizing the absurdity, unfairness, and anachronic nature of that measure which not only blockades Cuba economically, but also blockades Americans -- in a country calling itself the land of liberty. Americans are blockaded in travel and investment. It seems to me that it is only fair and proper, logical and intelligent that representatives of the American people should be the ones bringing the issue to the attention of international public opinion. The fact that congressmen like Rangel are doing this is simply another step in a road we need many others to travel. This is why we stress that there is no number one foreign policy priority other than continuing to condemn the unfairness of the blockade. This is separate from any conditions set for Cuba. It is not a question of conditions for Cuba. The blockade is unfair, independently of whatever Cuba decides to do or not to do. This is gaining support each day. It has the important support of a number of countries. The breaches being made in the blockade within the U.S. society are very interesting. [end recording]
