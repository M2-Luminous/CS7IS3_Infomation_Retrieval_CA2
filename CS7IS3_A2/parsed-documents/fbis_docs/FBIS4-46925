He "inherited" a number of unresolved public proceedings against the property fund and joint ventures and arbitration proceedings involving numerous commercial structures that had filed lawsuits over what they viewed as illegitimate punitive sanctions by the tax inspectorate. The introduction of new federal taxes and the vigorous creation of norms by the local authorities were fraught with new conflicts involving the tax organs. However, it blew over. In the first quarter of the new year, the revenues of the budget increased by 4.5 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In April, the budget took in 382 million [as published], the assignment being 340 million [as published]. In total, 1.080 trillion rubles [R] were taken in during the four months. Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov discusses the reserves that were tapped in order to invigorate the intake of budgetary receipts: [Zubkov] First, we made the rayon tax inspectorates completely independent: Their chiefs no longer rush to the head office over every trifle. Second, we established an economic council at the inspectorate. Issues of perfecting tax legislation are discussed at the meetings of the council. They are later considered by the mayor of the city, the government, or the State Tax Service. The developed decisions concern the making of advance payments by small enterprises, specify procedures for tax relief on profits, control small-scale retail trade, and cancel unjustifiably harsh measures against the violators of tax legislation. For example, the edict of the president "On Offering a Tax Amnesty in 1993" envisions that enterprises and entrepreneurs who declared the underpayment of taxes before 30 November 1993 and paid the taxes before the same deadline shall not be subject to relevant sanctions. If the tax organs discover concealed receipts after the indicated deadlines, fines shall be collected at three times the rate. Those who have understated receipts frequently do not even suspect that they have done so. The use of the tripled rates of fines in the case of such taxpayers can hardly be considered correct. We propose to index the underpayment as of the moment of concealment or understatement of payments to the budget. The computerization of our inspectorate is among the measures taken which we always mention with pleasure. In early May, we signed a memorandum on the creation of a computer network at the Tax Inspectorate of St. Petersburg with the Government of Denmark. This is a large project, which is worth more than $3.5 million and is financed by the Government of Denmark. In addition to being outfitted with hardware and communications, it is intended to allocate large funds for the training of rayon inspectors and the improvement of computer programming. [Shestakova] So, you succeeded in doing something more than just reinforcing the fiscal authorities. The outflow of professional financiers from the inspectorate ceased; the audits of banks and commercial structures no longer look like guerrilla raids. The Finnish and Swedish governmental press, which clamored to the whole world over the undiplomatic approach of the Russian authorities to the economic operations of joint ventures, has finally fallen silent.... [Zubkov] I see what you are talking about. All the problems with joint ventures, the property fund, and other taxpayers which developed last year could have been solved quietly, without resorting to aggressive publicity. Indeed, a large amount of fines, $24 million, was assessed against the Grand Hotel Europe. There were also smaller amounts--the Lenraumamebel, Pizza-Express. The rayon financial services uncover financial violations. Subsequently, the penalized enterprises approach the Russian Tax Service and the government, and the latter examine the case with our participation. The financial standing of these organizations is analyzed, and a way is sought to punish the transgressors without bankrupting them. If the Lenraumamebel does close, how will it make things better for anybody? The enterprise will wind down production, and the 600 Russians it employs will be thrown out into the street. I think that in such cases a compromise should be found. This is not to say that such enterprises should be exempted from fines or penalties. However, the fines should not finish them off. As far as the property fund is concerned, 92 million rubles have been assessed against it rather than sums going into the billions, as was advertised. They have already remitted R9.3 million to the budget. And R69 million have been remitted from the accounts of the fund without recourse. We will definitely collect the balance. A special commission will monitor this. [Shestakova] The budget is demanding still new infusions, including yet another round of harsher taxation. Thus, by his Edict No. 2270, the president granted the local authorities the right to independently set the rates of taxes and introduce new taxes. St. Petersburg was quick to take advantage of this right and, next to Moscow, is a leader in tightening the taxes.... [Zubkov] We got three new taxes confirmed by a directive of the mayor: for the maintenance of the housing stock, facilities of the sociocultural sector, and law enforcement organs. The land fee increased 10-fold. Another three taxes are pending. As a large European city, St. Petersburg should introduce taxes on car parking, the passage of vessels along the Neva, and for entering the city. This should be done as soon as possible. A great many foreign-made cars are parked in the downtown area of the city for weeks, and private parking lots are getting organized. Their owners hardly pay anything to the budget. However, the city has been given the right not just to introduce taxes, but also to grant exemptions from them. If a certain company has been worn down by fees but its operation is a vital necessity for the city, we are entitled to seek an exemption from some local taxes for the enterprise through the economic council. The federal taxes are not our prerogative. The reserve sources of budgetary receipts have not been depleted yet. A special directorate that only handles large payers was created at the inspectorate. Most of them have not been audited once in the last three years. Large enterprises will now be monitored on an annual basis. Relief and reductions granted to the Lenenergo, the Vodokanal, and other enterprises of municipal services run up to about R30 billion; however, these infusions have not produced results for the city. It is much more feasible to make them count money and value every job. This year, we have already directed the tax personnel to step up work with individuals, including foreign citizens. All of this means extra money. Budgetary proceeds also increase in a stable manner due to the invigoration of the work of the state inspectorate, jointly with the Tax Police Department, on commercial structures, the trade sector, and large payers.
