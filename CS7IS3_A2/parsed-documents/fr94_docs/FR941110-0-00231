FR941110-0-00231 FR941110-0-00016 B. Affected Entities We expect that the implementation of these final regulations will significantly influence facilities to conform quickly with the Federal participation requirements in order to avoid remedies. We recognize that not all of the potential effects of this final rule can be definitely anticipated, especially in view of their interaction with other Federal, State, and local activities regarding adherence to requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid. In particular, considering the effects of our efforts to improve survey and certification activities, through both new survey procedures and instruments and the promulgation of regulations, it is impossible to quantify precisely the future effect of all of these regulations on facilities' compliance activities or costs. We also are unable to accurately project the frequency with which enforcement proceedings may occur in light of the options to apply a host of remedies short of termination. As a result of the 27,900 comments received in response to our proposed rule, virtually every aspect of the regulation was re-evaluated. Where warranted, changes were made and the details of those changes were discussed in detail in the preceding section of the preamble to this rule. In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most of the negative comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a law that applies to other facilities. We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until such rulemaking is carried out, and are leaving the existing appeals system in place for ICFs/MR. Thus, neither ICFs/MR nor their residents will experience any impact from this final rule. Also based on commenters' suggestions, we incorporate in this final rule the concept of substantial compliance as the standard that prospective providers and existing providers must meet in order to begin or continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. After evaluation of the comments received, and in consideration of the fact that, as noted earlier, only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed in 1992 were deficiency-free, we believe that total compliance with all requirements is unrealistic and, in fact, a standard that many providers or prospective providers would find impossible to meet. We note that the statute now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities have to meet in order to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, whereas before OBRA '87, facilities had to comply with approximately 15. With the seven-fold increase in statutory requirements, there is a greater likelihood that facilities will be found not to meet the statutory definition of a SNF or NF. We are convinced, however, based on experience and commenters' views, that many statutory deficiencies do not result in actual harm to residents, nor do they constitute the potential for anything more than minimal harm. We realized that under the provisions of our proposed rule, a facility could have been subject to the most severe remedies, including denial of payment for new admissions, termination of the provider agreement for SNFs and discontinuation of FFP for NFs, if any deficiency, no matter how minor, was identified at the time of the survey. We recognized that imposing a remedy in all cases would be contrary to our intention to correlate the severity of the remedy to the seriousness of the deficiency, and would have a negative effect on facilities and residents. Instead, this final rule provides that remedies will not be imposed when a facility is in substantial compliance with all participation requirements. We are removing the scope and severity scales from the regulation and are, instead, providing assessment factors which consider scope and severity to be used in evaluating the seriousness of deficiencies and determining whether an enforcement response is required. We continue to believe, as we proposed, that because remedies are tailored to reflect the seriousness of the violations, the use of the assessment factors will provide consistent remedy recommendations and enforcement actions among all facilities. Since facilities will be aware of the correlation between the seriousness of the noncompliance and the penalty imposed, we anticipate that remedies applied in this manner will deter violations and encourage immediate response and sustained compliance. Based on the large number of comments we received expressing concern over the imposition of civil money penalties, which can be imposed for past periods of noncompliance, we expect that the regulations will have the desired effect of motivating facilities to remain in substantial compliance at all times. Under these final rules, a facility with isolated deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm will be expected to correct the deficiencies and maintain compliance. However, a formal plan of correction is required for deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm if the deficiencies are widespread or if they constitute a pattern. A formal plan of correction is also required for all deficiencies that constitute noncompliance. Facilities with deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for no more than minimal harm will be considered in substantial compliance with the participation requirements and will have no remedy applied. We believe that the majority of the 86 percent of the facilities cited in 1992 with at least one Level B deficiency would fall within this range. We note, however, that some noncompliance categorized previously as Level B deficiencies could now result in remedies because of their effect on the residents.
