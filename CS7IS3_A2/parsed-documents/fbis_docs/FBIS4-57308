However, a large part of the hope of achieving these, or even better, goals depends on the series of sectorial agreements the government has decided to promote. Enzo del Bufalo, who heads the CORDIPLAN [Office of Coordination and Planning], says that this is not a matter of a disagreement. "It is, instead, a negotiation of an almost mercantile sort between the government and some of the economic actors. There is a chain in which macroeconomic problems and microeconomic actions are intermingled, and they will be discussed by those who have to deal with them. Because what the one provides not only benefits both parties, but also gives rise to positive effects for the other participants. For example, if the executive branch eliminates the fiscal deficit, this will allow the Central Bank of Venezuela to alter the monetary policy." [Saavedra] Would this mean elimination of the zero coupon bonds? [Del Bufalo] Among other things, there would be no reason to issue more zero coupons. It will then be able to finance a plan to improve the solvency of the financial system, instead of using the resources as is being done now, because the present monetary policy is a residual policy. In other words, this institution simply finds itself faced with an economic policy being pursued for its own sake. But if the executive branch eliminates the deficit, the pressure to effect a possible devaluation for fiscal reasons will disappear. And this also sets aside one of the reasons for the purchase of dollars. Nor would there be a need to impose high interest rates. [Saavedra] What contributions would the business sector have to make? [Del Bufalo] Two specific things will be asked of it in this negotiation. The first is at least partial absorption of the impact of inflation. This means refraining from passing on the increase in costs to the final prices, so that inertial inflation is eliminated. The other thing that will be required is that the reactivation of production be initiated. All of this would contribute to a change in what will be received as a benefit--a very low real interest rate. [Saavedra] And what will the workers be asked to do? To moderate their wage demands? [Del Bufalo] What can be required of the workers is something very concrete--that they be ready for a change in the social welfare system to a different mode--one better adapted to the enterprises, in exchange for receiving an increase in real wages. [Saavedra] Is there some concrete proposal in this regard? [Del Bufalo] There are various proposals. But the idea is not for the government to impose them, but for the workers to negotiate them to their full satisfaction. The executive branch will serve only as an intermediary. What we will contribute directly in this connection, however, is a real offer to create an entire overall social security system. [Saavedra] What will happen to the accumulated social allocations? [Del Bufalo] They represent an acquired right. What could be done is to pay off those who want to change the system they use. [Saavedra] When will the negotiations begin? [Del Bufalo] When the preliminary talks in which we are engaged with the interested parties have been concluded. I believe that this will actually occur within two or three weeks, at the latest. [Saavedra] What leads you to believe that progress will be made with these agreements? [Del Bufalo] These agreements have strictly economic goals. It is neither a question of supporting nor of opposing the government. What is intended is to stabilize five variable economic factors. [Saavedra] Is it your belief that this represents not only the last chance, but also the only possible formula? [Del Bufalo] This is the only way to proceed at a low social cost. And if Venezuela wants to avoid more suffering, this is the formula that will ensure less suffering. Because this alternative has the advantage of requiring no sacrifice in addition to those we have undergone, and it translates into direct benefits for each of the participants within a very short time. Now, if the economic sectors in Venezuela are not able to negotiate an agreement that makes it possible to stabilize the economic variables while at the same time obtaining net profits, we will have to have recourse to the traditional mechanisms. These are the mechanisms of the classic type that lead to foreign-exchange and price controls, resulting in a slowing of the structural change in the economy, without any certainty that it will proceed in the long run. Or, there are those of a neoliberal sort that mean drastic devaluation with high interest rates. This would also slow the growth of the economy and would cause the population more pain. [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch has considered avoiding the use of foreign financing for 1994 and 1995? [Del Bufalo] An effort will be made to avoid any increase in the debt. But a maximum indebtedness level for 1994 has already been approved in the national budget, and a comparable debt ceiling for 1995 is being analyzed. [Saavedra] What is the amount of each of these figures? [Del Bufalo] That for this year comes to approximately 275.455 billion bolivares, and that for 1995 to about 140 billion bolivares. However, the figure for 1994 represents the maximum for the fiscal deficit, which we hope will come to no more than 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product. [Saavedra] But is the government fearful of using foreign financing, or is this regarded as just another tool? [Del Bufalo] What we have is a policy of avoiding any increase in the net indebtedness. However, payments on the debts, as well as the contracting of others, will continue. The strategy of reducing indebtedness involves trying to reduce, to a minimum, the financing of expenditures through the use of this tool. [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch is going to propose an amendment to the Privatization Law that would limit the use of the funds obtained by this means exclusively to the reduction of the foreign debt? [Del Bufalo] A proposal that the privatization resources be used only to pay off debts and to invest in new assets has been put forth, and it seems a very sensible one to me. The problem is that rather than slowing privatization pending the passage of a new law, it would be better to continue working with the norms we have now, because the privatization program must be carried out with a certain speed.
