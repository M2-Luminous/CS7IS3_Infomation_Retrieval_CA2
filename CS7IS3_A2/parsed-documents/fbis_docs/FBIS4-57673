Colombian Foreign Ministry sources, quoted by Emisoras Caracol Network, said that the Colombian ambassador to the OAS, former Foreign Minister Julio Londono, has arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota for consultations with the government of President Cesar Gaviria on the issue of U.S. intervention in Haiti. The sources said that the official Colombian position will be stated on 6 June in Belem, Brazil, during the annual OAS assembly, which will be attended by the foreign ministers of OAS member countries. The Colombian Foreign Ministry last week rejected the designation of Jonassaint and stated that the only legitimate administration in Haiti is that of Aristide, who was democratically elected in 1991.
