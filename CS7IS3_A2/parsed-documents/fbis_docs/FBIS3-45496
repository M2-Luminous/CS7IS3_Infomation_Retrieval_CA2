This is a successful session of historical significance. The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted at the session specifies -- in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress -- the goals and basic principles for restructuring the economy set by the 14th CPC National Congress, further expands those goals and principles in some areas, and formulates the overall plan for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. This is our program of action ao restructure the economy in the nineties. It will surely exert a major and far-reaching impact on China's reform, opening, and socialist modernization drive. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to bring up some points with regard to the current situation, the implementation of the "decision," and ways to build up the party and exercise effective party leadership. I. On the Current Situation Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches in early 1992 and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, we have opened up a new situation in work in all sectors over the past year. The economy is growing vigorously, fresh progress has been made in implementing measures of reform and opening up aimed at establishing a socialist market economic system, and new achievements have been scored in all other undertakings. Today, the country enjoys economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. The overall situation is decidedly good. This year, the economy has maintained its momentum of fast growth on top of the breakneck growth recorded in 1992. The gross national product grew by 13.3 percent in the first three quarters. It is expected that this high growth rate will be maintained for the whole year. Industrial production by enterprises at the village level or higher is expected to grow by about 21 percent. A comparatively good harvest has been reported in the agricultural sector. As for some prominent contradictions and problems that have emerged in the course of the breakneck economic growth, the CPC Central Committee and State Council have taken a slew of measures to solve them. Particularly the measures we have taken since June to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify order in the banking and other economic sectors have -- thanks to the common efforts of all quarters over the past few months -- have yielded positive results. The situation in the banking sector is stabilizing. The overheated development in real estate and development zones as well as the excessive growth in investment have been brought under control. The construction of key state projects has picked up speed and inflation has, more or less, been brought under control. Prices in the foreign exchange swap market have decreased and have basically returned to normal. By and large, no IOU's were issued in procuring agricultural and sideline products harvested in the summer; funds for autumn-harvested crops have been allocated. Prices of major capital goods including steel products have come down again. The situation in terms of state revenues and expenditures has improved somewhat. Income has continued to increase in both urban and rural areas. The economy as a whole is developing in a sound manner. Facts have borne out that the measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and State Council to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control are absolutely correct and necessary. Judging from the current trends, we will still be able to maintain a rather fast economic growth rate and bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. Reform and opening up have picked up pace noticeably this year. Many major reform measures are either being carried out or will soon be promulgated. This year, we have seized the opportunity and taken big steps in implementing price reforms by freeing the prices of many industrial capital goods. Over 90 percent of the counties (cities) have lifted price controls over grain procurement and procurement and selling prices. The degree of the application of market prices has, on the whole, risen continuously. Opening up to the outside world has continued to develop both in scope and in depth, and there has been a new upsurge in foreign investment in China. One of the main characteristics for strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control is the idea of solving the contradictions and problems in the march forward by deepening reforms and by employing mostly economic and legal means supplemented, certainly, with the necessary administrative means. Practice has shown that this approach is successful. This has provided us with valuable experience, showing us that the fundamental way to solve the deep-seated problems in economic and social development lies in deepening reform. The present social and political situation in the country is also good. This year has seen the transition from the old leading bodies to the new, following the smooth change of terms in people's congresses, governments, and committees for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the central as well as local levels, and the convening of national congresses, one after another, for mass organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. New progress has been made in building a socialist democracy and legal system with the formulation of some major laws and regulations. Propaganda and ideological work have been strengthened. The central authorities have paid attention to promoting clean administration and the anticorruption struggle, with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Council having made specific arrangements which are currently being implemented in earnest by various localities and departments. Even closer ties have been forged between the party and the masses following the investigation and handling of some serious and major cases and the checking of some malpractice. The social and economic order has been maintained, thanks to the further strengthening of the comprehensive management of public security, the prompt defeat of domestic and foreign hostile forces' plots to create disturbances, and the proper handling of some emergencies. Generally speaking, developments and changes in the international situation also are favorable to us. The world will likely enjoy a relatively long period of peace following the end of the confrontation between the East and the West. The further improvement of our nation's relations with neighboring countries, in particular, is conducive to creating peaceful surroundings and an international environment favorable to economic construction. A worldwide economic structural readjustment would help us attract foreign investment and technology. The Asia-Pacific region's growing influence on the world also is favorable to us. In short, the present domestic and international situation is comparatively favorable, and we really are facing a great opportunity for reform and development. There are not many historical opportunities like this. We must seize the favorable opportunity; quicken the pace of reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization; and further enhance our composite national strength. It was based exactly on this consideration that the Central Committee Political Bureau had suggested that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee make a decision on the issue of establishing a socialist market economic system, seek a common understanding and uniform steps throughout the party, vigorously deepen reform, and promote economic development. We believe that our nation's reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization will take on a new aspect after this plenary session. II. Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the "Decision" Since the 14th CPC National Congress determined the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, comrades from different quarters have hoped for a further step forward in formulating a more complete and systematic argument on the socialist market economic system to facilitate the better organization and advancement of the reform of the economic structure. We all noticed that while market mechanisms are playing an increasingly important role in our economic life, the sluggishness of reform in certain fields has adversely affected the establishment of a new system and the healthy development of the national economy. We have made breakthroughs and accumulated experience in reforms in various fields over the past decade or so, and we also have conditions ready for bringing about the overall advancement of the reform. We now need to formulate an overall plan and to stress standardization in our system and policies. Although the basic framework outlined by the decision of this plenary session for the socialist market economic system still needs to be examined and continuously improved in practice, its existence can enhance our ability to anticipate the kind of guidance needed for the reform work and make the reform even more fruitful. The "decision" is rich and all-embracing in its contents, with all 50 of its articles being of great significance. Here I would like to present a few opinions on implementing the guidelines of the "decision": 1. Correctly handle the relations between reform and development. With fairly favorable conditions at home and abroad and with China's great potential for economic development, it is possible to maintain a comparatively high growth rate for a long period. It is necessary for us to focus on economic development, seize the current favorable opportunities, and concentrate our efforts on improving the economic situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is absolutely correct when he says that "development is the last word" and "the final resolution of the problems lies in developing the economy." We should follow the guiding spirit of the plenary meeting and waste no time in introducing various already-prepared reform measures so as to create a favorable structure and conditions for the economy. In arranging economic work, it is necessary to pay attention to creating a pliable environment for reform. New thinking is also needed for development, which should truly be directed at focusing on economic performance rather than on the same old road of extensive management which indiscriminately seeks greater output value and expands the extent of investment. The state can become rich and strong and the people's livelihood can be improved only when production is improved and more wealth is created. The experience of many years tell us that we should pay attention to two major things at all times: strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and improving state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. As for agricultural problems, the CPC Central Committee has already convened a meeting and formulated general and specific policies. It is imperative to conscientiously organize people to carry out these policies to ensure the stable development of agriculture and the overall rural economy. From now time, more efforts should be made to improve state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. The reinvigoration of China's economy depends mainly on state-owned large- and medium- sized enterprises. Many problems now facing us can be solved by deepening reforms. The reform of state-owned large- and medium- sized enterprises is a key and difficult point in China's efforts to reform its economic structure. The "decision" has been a big step forward in the thinking about reforming enterprises because it has distinctively pointed out the problems of building a modern enterprise system. The "decision" summarizes the basic characteristics of the modern enterprise system and points out the orientation for the reform of enterprises. It is imperative to thoroughly deepen the reform of enterprises in accordance with the requirements of the "decision" so as to truly improve state-owned enterprises and to enable it to play a guiding and backbone role in economic development. This is not only an important economic issue which affects the development of the national economy as a whole but also an important political issue which affects the destiny of socialism. We should work hard to resolve this issue. 2. Correctly handle the relations between strengthening macrocontrol and developing the role of the market. A socialist market economy is integrated with the basic system of socialism. The establishment of a socialist market economy seeks to enable the market to play a fundamental role in the allocation of resources, under the state's macrocontrol. The macrocontrol of the state and the role of the market mechanism, both of which are essential requirements of the socialist market economic structure, are integrated, mutually supplementary, and mutually promoting. To change the traditional planned economic system, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of fully permitting the market's fundamental role in allocating resources. If we fail to do so, there will be no socialist market economy. But, we should also see the negative aspects of spontaneity, rashness, and sluggishness existing in the market. Such weaknesses and inadequacies need to be amended and overcome by the state's macroguidance and -control of market activities. In today's world, there is not a single country whose economy is not under the government's control. Being a socialist country, China should do a good job and have better conditions for doing so in macroeconomic regulation and control. The current problems are: The market is not completely permitted to play its role in many respects, and there exist the phenomena of unbridled development and a chaotic economic order in the market. We should actively cultivate and develop the market system, continue to carry out the reform of the price and commodity circulation system, develop the factors of production market, and improve and strengthen the control, management, and supervision of the market. Practices in 1993 also show that to establish a socialist market economic structure, it is necessary to work hard both in giving full play to the role of market mechanisms and in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. The key points of the work for each period may be different. According to various actual conditions, sometimes more emphasis will be placed on the role of the market and sometimes on the macrocontrol by the state. But, while emphasizing one aspect, we must not neglect or pay no attention to the other side. 3. We must give equal emphasis to two fronts and do well in both. In the course of implementing reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, we must consistently persist in the principle of giving equal emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both. Having learned a profound lesson in this regard, we must never repeat the mistake of emphasizing one to the neglect of the other. At a time when everyone is focusing on promoting reform and opening up and developing the economy, we must not overlook the promotion of spiritual civilization. Emphasizing the principles and tasks of promoting socialist spiritual civilization, the "decision" sets out some requirements, particularly in pointing out that under a socialist market economy, we should actively propagate the need to persist in a correct outlook on life and a civilized, healthy style of life and work to promote public and professional ethics. All these remarks have specific aims. It is a fact of life that money worship, extreme individualism, decadent life-styles, and other social evils are spreading, some of which have developed to quite a serious extent. We must take resolute steps to combat them. We must unequivocally encourage what is right, overcome what is evil, and promote in the whole society a good social climate that is eminently healthy, progressive, and positive. We must carry forward our fine national culture and traditions, learn from the fruits of all advanced foreign civilizations and, however, never mistake their dregs for their best parts. Comrade Mao Zedong spoke this famous dictum: "The unification of the state, the unity of the people, and the solidarity of the nationalities in the country -- these are the fundamental guarantees of the success of our cause." Without political unity and stability, we will not be able to accomplish anything. Generally speaking, the situation today is good. We must be prepared for danger in times of peace and never lower our guard or become careless. We must strengthen judicial, procuratorial, and public security work and improve all facets of public security, strengthen the legal system, step up law enforcement, and punish according to the law all sorts of crimes. We must correctly handle the contradictions within the people and promptly remove all destabilizing factors to consolidate the political situation characterized by stability and unity. We must conscientiously carry out the party's policies on nationalities and religion and extensively carry out education featuring Marxist views on nationalities and religion. Continued efforts should be made to carry out the fight against corruption. Building a clean government and combating corruption constitute essential conditions for the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. These also have a great bearing on the destiny of the ongoing reform and on the destiny of the party and the country. The Central Committee's line, principles, and policies for the anticorruption struggle are clear and specific, and they enjoy the heartfelt support of the vast ranks of cadres and people. The focal points of this struggle are leading party and government organs, law-enforcement departments, and economic administrative departments, as well as the investigation and prosecution of major cases. Party members, high- and middle- ranking cadres in particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate or abet their wrongdoing. The fight against corruption is a long-term and arduous task and should be carried out with unremitting effort. We must see to it that the targets set by the Central Committee for the different periods of this struggle are attained. 4. Fully mobilize all positive factors and bring the initiatives of all sides into play. Whether in the past revolutionary war or during the current reform, opening, and modernization construction, only by closely relying on the broad mass of cadres and the masses, by fully bringing into play the initiatives of all sides, and by pooling the wisdom and efforts of everyone can we expect to achieve success. We have always stressed the need to bring into play the initiatives of both the central government and local governments. The "decision," by giving full consideration to our country's actual conditions and to work in localities, formulated the direction and principles of the reforms of the fiscal, taxation, and financial systems. The purpose of employing a tax-sharing system, of a rational division of jurisdiction between the central and local governments, and of determining the revenue-expense ratio between the central and local governments in a rational manner is to straighten out the economic relationship and to standardize economic activities. Strengthening the central bank's regulatory and supervisory functions over the currency, separating policy-related financing from commercial financing, and attaining a unified exchange rate constitute a major reform of the financial system which involves readjusting the relationship between the interests of the central government and those of localities. A reform of fiscal, taxation, and financial structures is required to develop a socialist market economy, which is not only compatible with accepted international practices but which also takes into account China's characteristics and reality. By so doing, it will be conducive to giving play to the initiatives of the central government and that of localities, to doing an even better job of economic construction, and to attaining coordinated socioeconomic development. When dealing with the relationship between the central government and localities, the central government should give consideration to localities' difficulties. As for localities, they should establish the concept of the national interest. Whereas the national interest should take care of local interests, local interests should subordinate themselves to the national interest. The fact that a consensus over the reform plan for fiscal, taxation, and financial structures has been reached through discussion and coordination shows that everyone has taken the national interest into consideration and that everyone upholds the concept of the national interest. We should fully understand the far-reaching significance of the reform, and with one heart and one mind and with joint efforts, we should accomplish the reform tasks. Our country is a vast country. Economic development in various regions is rather imbalanced. Because there are historical reasons for the regional imbalances, it will take time to narrow these gaps. The policy and principles of the party and the state are to bring two initiatives into play: the initiative of the economically developed regions and that of the less developed regions. Our basic principle in this respect is clear. It is advisable for economically developed regions to fully make use of their own advantageous conditions and existing foundation to achieve even faster development, to rapidly raise the economy to new heights, to help promote development in less-developed regions, and to make an even greater contribution to the country's modernization undertaking. To gradually realize the goal of common prosperity, the state has adopted policies to vigorously support economic development in less-developed regions of central and western China. With the deepening of reform and the expansion of reform, regions in central and western China have gradually improved their conditions for developing the economy. Through their own efforts and with the state's support, it is completely possible that they can gradually accelerate the pace of development by fully bringing into play their advantages, including natural resources and other advantages. When dealing with the relationship between the state, enterprises, and staff members and workers, it is necessary to bring initiatives into play. Within the enterprises, it is necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of the party organization, of management personnel, and of all staff members and workers. Among the people, it is necessary to bring into play the initiatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from various circles. It is necessary to enhance national unity and to bring into play the initiatives of all nationalities in the nation. We should develop the enthusiasm of trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's federations, and other mass organizations, as well as democratic parties. Mobilizing the initiatives of the broad mass of cadres and the masses depends on deepening reform and perfecting various systems; and it is also necessary to rely on ideological and political work to exploit our political advantages. All in all, our principle is to give full play to the initiatives of all sides, to mobilize all positive factors, to turn negative factors into positive ones, and to devote all our energy to the great undertaking of socialist modernization construction. By so doing, our reform, opening, and economic construction will be provided with the broadest and deepest mass foundation and will keep on developing with great vigor. III. On Strengthening Party Building and the Leadership of the Party Establishing a socialist market economic structure and accelerating the pace of modernization are great historical tasks in the new period. To lead this unprecedented pioneering work and to achieve success, our party must effectively strengthen its own ideology, organization, and work style. 1. It is necessary to strengthen the party's ideological construction and to arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. A party, a nation and a country, especially a big party like ours and a country composed of people of 56 different nationalities with a population of more than 1 billion, must have correct theoretical guidance and powerful spiritual support. Now we are in the midst of a profound social change in the course of reform, opening up, and modernization, and great changes are taking place in social relations and the social and economic outlooks. To assume the historical responsibility for leading this great change, our party must have correct theoretical guidance and powerful spiritual support. Otherwise, the whole party and the whole country cannot have strong rallying power, will lack unity as did the old China, and cannot have great strength. Ideological construction is the foundation for improving our organization and work style. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has brought forward and developed Mao Zedong Thought, and it is contemporary Marxism in China [dang dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yu -- 3981 0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 0344 0674 0031 5030]. We must use this theory to arm the whole party, the whole Army, and people of all nationalities of our country. The party Central Committee has made a decision about studying the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," and so comrades of the whole party, especially leading cadres at and above the county level, must conscientiously study it in light of actual conditions. We should carry forward the Marxist study style of combining theory with practice, seriously study the original works, have a good grasp of their essence, and implement the guidelines in line with the actual situation of various departments and localities. You comrades here are members and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee and responsible comrades of the party, government, Army, and masses organizations, and so you must take the lead in studying well the book to increase your political, ideological, and leadership quality and to enhance your consciousness of firmly implementing the party's basic line. This is a matter of fundamental importance to successfully promote reform, opening up and the modernization drive. 2. It is necessary to strengthen the building of the party organizationally. The strength of the party lies in the unity of the party and in good organization and strict discipline. To strengthen the party's organizational construction, we have to do many things. Here I only want to stress three points. First, it is imperative to firmly implement the party's principle of democratic centralism. Only by adhering to the principle of democratic centralism can we unify our understanding and steps. Party organizations at various levels must consciously place the interests of the party and state at the top spot; their local interests must be subordinated to the interests of the whole; their immediate interests must be subordinated to long- term interests; and they must take the overall situation into consideration, guarantee the implementation of various principles and policies of the party Central Committee, and maintain a high degree of unity politically, organizationally, and in their actions. The practices of not carrying out orders and not banning things which should be banned are extremely unfavorable to our cause and will not be tolerated by party discipline. Second, it is necessary to enhance the building of the party's grassroots organizations. Party's grassroots organizations are the party's foundation. Only with a solid foundation can the entire party be assured of having powerful fighting strength, can it withstand the test of any upheavals. Implementing the "decision" requires the joint efforts of all levels of party organizations. Grass-roots party organizations are also required to carry out hard and meticulous work and help translate the party's decision into the action of the masses. It is necessary to make great determination to build the party's grassroots organizations into a fighting force that will unite and lead the masses to realize the party's goals. Third, it is necessary to enhance the building of all levels of leading bodies. The key lies in following the principle of making the contingent of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, and professionally more competent, and in selecting and promoting cadres who meet the requirements of being able and having political integrity. To help our party organizations retain vigor and vitality, it is necessary to promote those cadres, particularly young and middle-aged cadres, who are loyal to the cause of the party, who vigorously promote reform, opening, and modernization construction, to all levels of leading posts. 3. Enhance investigation and study; improve work style and way of thinking. Time is advancing. The situation is evolving. New situations and new problems keep coming up. All levels of leading organs and leading cadres should strive to improve leadership styles and methods so as to keep up with the pace of the times. It is necessary to treat this matter from the high plane of improving the quality of leadership and governing [zhi zheng 1013 2398]. With so much work to do, all levels of party's leading cadres, senior-level cadres in particular, should comprehensively implement the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and the decision adopted at the present plenary session, improve their ability to master the overall situation, and arrange work in all respects. Since next year will be a very important year to promote reform and the tasks will be very arduous and demanding, we must properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability, and strive to maintain a stable political environment and a sound economic environment. All levels of leaders should not only know well their advantageous conditions and seize opportunities for development, but also forsee well contradictions and difficulties in the course of progress and do a good job in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to correctly grasp and handle well major theoretical and practical problems, to persist in materialist dialectics, avoid one-sidedness and metaphysics, remove interference, and always and unwaveringly adhere to party's basic line. We should go deep down to the front line of reform and construction; conduct serious investigation and study; discover problems in a timely manner; proceed from reality; work creatively; constantly sum up experiences; and be good at utilizing experiences created by the masses to guide their progress. The CPC Central Committee has on many occasions called on all levels of leading cadres to step up investigation and study. It will be impossible to perform well a leader's duty if he or she makes light of investigation and study, if he or she does not understand well their work, if he or she is blind to reality. If we can squeeze a little bit more time for studying, cut back time spent on socializing, do a little more investigation and study, refrain from acting subjectively, do more concrete things, and stop making empty speeches, then we will be able to greatly raise our leadership level. Comrades! Our country is now in a very important historical period. The burden on our shoulders is onerous. We carry enormous responsibilities. We should, in a spirit of bearing a high sense of responsibility toward the party, the state, and the Chinese nation, always and steadfastly follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and party's basic line; hold fast to the central task of the economic construction; unwaveringly develop a socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, and socialist spiritual civilization; emancipate the mind; seek truth from facts; work with one heart and one mind; display a pioneering and enterprising spirit; rely on our own efforts; build an enterprise through arduous effort; and strive to build our country into a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, and modern socialist country!
