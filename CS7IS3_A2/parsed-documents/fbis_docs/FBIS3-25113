Speaking at the DP's Natal annual congress, Dr. de Beer said: "If the IFP stays out (of elections) it benefits their enemies. We want them to take their proper part in the process." DP members from Natal's five sub-regions of the party gathered at the Durban Exhibition Centre on Saturday for a day-long meeting of the party's annual congress. There Dr. de Beer argued the case for federalism in South Africa and the need for a double ballot. He said devolution of power diminished the chance of tyrannical rule. Voters were urged to put their cross next to the party they really believed in, he said, because proportional representation meant every vote counted. He warned against "tactical voting", saying it was not necessary to vote for one party just to keep another out of power. Referring to the DP's lacklustre showing in recent opinion polls, Dr. de Beer said: "Let's face it, the polls have been depressing for the DP, but don't read too much into it though." The DP leader cautioned voters against trusting the African National Congress and the National Party [NP], which both had the tendency to "hold human rights in contempt". DP Natal Chairman and Umhlanga MP Kobus Jordaan echoed this, saying the interim constitution had elements of a liberal constitution, but was to an extent "shabby" because of private deals struck between the ANC and NP. University of Natal academic and DP member on the constitutional technical committee, George Devenish, said the interim constitution, although imperfect, was a liberal, democratic one. Prof Devenish said there was provision for an entrenched bill of rights, a human rights commission, and public protector, but negatively there was single ballot voting, a lack of unequivocal federal definition, and an unqualified anti-deflection clause. Various DP speakers were due to discuss numerous electioneering and campaigning issues later in the day, and hold annual elections for the leadership of the party in Natal. Results are expected to be announced later Saturday.
