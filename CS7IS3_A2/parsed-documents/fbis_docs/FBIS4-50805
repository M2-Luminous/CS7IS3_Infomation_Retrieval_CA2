Vice Premier Zou Jiahua called on leading cadres at various levels to set an example in treating it as an important task, so the safe production week campaign will be unfolded truly in an organized, well-guided, and down-to-earth way. Zou Jiahua said: Since liberation, particularly during the more than 10 years since the start of reform and opening up, China has made great achievements in economic construction and rapid progress in ensuring safe production. However, the situation of safety in production remains grim and bad accidents have occurred frequently over the last two years. Those accidents have caused great losses to the people's lives and property. They have also hurt our country's reputation. For this reason, we must not treat the production safety issue lightly, and must pay great attention to it at all times. All enterprises should regard production safety as very urgent work and do it well. Zou Jiahua emphasized: In launching the safe production week campaign, we must stress actual results and prevent formalism.
