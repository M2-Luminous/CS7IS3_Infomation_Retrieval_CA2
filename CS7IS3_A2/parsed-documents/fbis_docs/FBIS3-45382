This is what Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, repeatedly stressed while inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai recently. He pointed out: The introduction of a series of major economic reform measures this year is an important step in advancing toward the goals of establishing the socialist market economic system determined by the 14th CPC National Congress. Now we must pay particular attention to social stability, keep commodity prices down, do a further good job in the tasks of fighting corruption and promoting clean administration, and control the size of fixed asset investment to minimize risks so as to create a good external environment for accelerating reform. During his inspection, Li Lanqing highly praised the development of Zhejiang and Shanghai. He pointed out: Shanghai's reform and opening up bears strategic significance for the nation. The municipality has not failed to live up to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great expectations, and has made encouraging achievements in economic development, market establishment, Pudong's development, opening up to the outside world, and foreign economy and trade. It has truly achieved the goal of making changes every year. Zhejiang's overall situation is very good, and the province has made notable progress and development in various fields. In particular, it has made outstanding achievements in foreign economy and trade, the growth margin of which has topped the nation. There is great hope for Zhejiang to realize the goal of achieving a better living standard for the people ahead of time. Li Lanqing heard work reports from provincial and municipal leaders from Zhejiang and Shanghai, and conducted on-the-spot inspection in plants, schools, and markets. He held discussions with the people and heard opinions from all sides on grain and oil prices, market supply, educational reform, foreign economic and trade development, and anti-smuggling efforts. He stated: When introducing new comprehensive reform measures, we must pay particular attention to the inflation problem and keep prices within the limit bearable to the broad masses. The margin of fluctuation in grain and oil prices was previously rather large. The State Council has adopted some measures to tackle this problem, and localities should also sacrifice a little of their immediate and partial interests. They should apply macroeconomic control and regulation methods to quickly bring commodity prices which closely affect the people's life down to a reasonable level. Meanwhile, it is crucial to develop agriculture and to continue to effectively implement the "vegetable basket" and "grain bag" projects to ensure sufficient total supply of agricultural products. As long as there is an abundant supply of agricultural sideline products there will be no panic, and our tasks in implementing the measures will be made easier. Li Lanqing asked Shanghai and Zhejiang, the two most forward regions in our country's opening up to the outside world, to make new contributions in using foreign funds as well as in developing domestic and foreign trade. He said: It is currently necessary to focus on the study of changing operational methods and operating mechanisms as well as enhancing the cohesive power of foreign trade enterprises. In addition, enterprises should establish the incentive and self-control mechanisms as well as carry out earnest experiments in modern enterprise systems to boost more foreign exchange earnings and upgrade economic efficiency. Enterprise system reform should be standardized and should proceed in accordance with relevant state stipulations to prevent losses in state assets. State-owned businesses and enterprises should be developed along the line of establishing chain commercial organizations which combine group operations and retailing. They should utilize foreign capital and adopt various ways for key development by combining actual local conditions. For example, Shanghai should focus on attracting investment from transnational corporations, introducing new and high technology industries, as well as adopting advanced operations and management methods to raise the quality and level of foreign capital utilization. In utilizing foreign capital, all localities should attach importance to improving investment environment, and should not blindly establish development zones. Efforts should be made to link the construction of approved development zones with the restructuring of old cities and old enterprises. Educational work is an important aspect of Li Lanqing's inspection. He successively visited several institutes of higher learning, vocational schools, secondary schools, and elementary schools in Zhejiang and Shanghai, as well as held discussion meetings with leading comrades of institutes of higher learning in Hangzhou and Shanghai. After hearing the opinions of teachers and staff, he stressed: It is necessary to truly enhance the understanding in the issue of "respect for teachers and importance of education." He said: Comrade Xiaoping has attached great importance to educational work, and discussed it rather comprehensively and thoroughly in as many as 27 chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and practice his advocation. The saying "education is fundamental for a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as merely an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the entire party, society, and people to show concern, support, and participate in promoting educational reform and development. Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his appreciation to Zhejiang provincial party committee for its promise not to delay payment of teachers' salaries. Zhejiang has specified that counties and cities that owe teachers' salaries will not be permitted to construct school buildings and purchase small automobiles, or even send personnel abroad, or pay salaries with advance from provincial funds to be deducted later from monies payable to them. Li Lanqing also expressed his appreciation to Ningbo City for its plan to solve teachers' housing problems. Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform for higher education. Apart from these, while implementing educational reform, we should ask the people not to merely seek a higher college entrance rate and advise students not to confine themselves to the difficult path of seeking entrance to college. We should vigorously develop vocational education and adult education to enable more people exploit their skills through various channels and contribute to society. He hoped that Shanghai and Zhejiang would actively explore new ways to vigorously develop vocational education. He fully affirmed attempts by Shanghai's institutes of higher learning in educational reform. He specially praised concerned schools for making full use of social resources in joint educational undertakings and in upgrading school efficiency. As for the issue of some institutes of higher learning seeking to be placed on the "211" project, Li Lanqing asked them not to rush into making an evaluation as the placement is a development process. Apart from standards stipulated by the State Education Commission, institutes of higher learning should meet the following three criteria: first, institutes of higher learning of provinces (cities) that have not implemented basic education efficiently cannot be placed on the "211" project. Second, institutes of higher learning that have not undertaken major reform measures cannot be placed on the "211" project. Third, institutes of higher education should supplement one another with their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project. While inspecting local customs departments in Shanghai and Hangzhou, Li Lanqing pointed out: Anti-smuggling is a long-term struggle, aimed at improving the investment environment, which we should earnestly address. He said: The party committees and governments of Zhejiang and Shanghai should be commended for their strong support for attaching great importance to cracking down on smuggling. Although the vicious waves of nationwide smuggling crimes have been curbed, we should not lower our guard and should continue to realize the importance of anti-smuggling struggle. We should tighten our investigation and prosecution of major smuggling cases, as well as comprehensively implement the principle of curbing and penalizing smuggling crimes on sea, at coastal ports, on highways, and in markets. We should make overall plans to snatch repeated victories in anti-smuggling struggle before the Spring Festival.
