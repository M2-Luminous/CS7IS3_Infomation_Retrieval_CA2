"Suspicions (on this issue) are extremely serious from the standpoint of the public," said Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Diet Affairs Committee at a news conference in the Diet building. Ozato was speaking about the donation allegedly received last August by two of Fujii's officially registered political fund- raising organizations from the Enyu-kai, an industry association of salt wholesalers. The Enyu-kai is affiliated with the Association of Salt Dealers Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a long-time adviser. Fujii, now a House of Representatives member of Shinseito, was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and dozens of other LDP lawmakers bolted from the scandal-marred LDP to form Shinseito. Ozato expressed the LDP's readiness to bring up the fact that Fujii returned the money a day after the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's leading daily, reported the industry group made the donation to congratulate him on assuming the post of finance minister last August. Japan's law on political funding bars a politician from accepting a donation of more than 1.5 million yen a year from a single source. Shinseito secured a huge electoral success and came under the national spotlight at the 1993 general election by concentrating on the theme of cleaning up the Japanese political system.
