It brought disaster to the people of Xieng Khouang as never before in history. The name of the campaign, "Redeem Honor," does not indicate how violent and fierce it was. We might think that the meaning of "redeem honor" was that the imperialists and their lackeys would concentrate all their forces to redeem their honor and dignity. In fact this campaign came about after the imperialist invaders and their subordinates suffered a major defeat in the "O-D-N" solidarity campaign and other campaigns in Xieng Khouang Province and throughout the liberated areas. They assembled all their forces, including modern weapons, and poured them into the area of the Plain of Jars on a large scale. They hoped to redeem themselves from their defeats. They used more than 50 battalions, including mercenary soldiers from other countries which they assembled to wage war. These forces received air support from the imperialists who flew no less than 300 sorties per day and some days up to 500 sorties. They brutally poured bombs on the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang. It was in this campaign that they first used strategic B-52 bombers to destroy the liberated areas of Laos and that they first applied the strategic military theory of their leadership in Laos. This made the "Redeem Honor" campaign one of the most fierce, life-or-death struggles between the revolutionary forces and the enemy in the almost 30-year history of the resistance against invasion. They used the scheme of total destruction in hopes of making the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang a white zone [area with no Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) presence] and seizing this strategic area. They used all types of aircraft to drop time-delay bombs, cluster bombs, napalm etc. in conjunction with artillery in support of a large-scale attack by ground forces to clear the area. They used aircraft to drop soldiers to seize the important high areas by threat and encirclement. They used aircraft equiped with loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda from the air to threaten the people and revolutionary forces and make them surrender. This destructive war brought great losses to the people of Xieng Khouang. In addition to the loss of life and property, many thousands of the people of Xieng Khouang suffered the misfortune of being forced to flee from their home villages and become refugees living in areas under enemy control. This left Xieng Khouang an overgrown, abandoned place where it was difficult to find a house standing. Nevertheless in this campaign the imperialists and their lackeys were not able to redeem themselves from their defeats. The patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang, because of their patriotism and in order to redeem the honor of Laos, were brave and willing to sacrifice lives for their beloved fatherland. They counterattacked fiercely and kept advancing. From the beginning of August 1969 to 10 February 1970 the attacks of the patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang grew steadily fiercer so that the enemy was cornered and his forces were destroyed. During just 13 days and nights at the end of this campaign the armed forces and the people of Xieng Khouang put 7,000 of the enemy out of action, took almost 1,000 who surrendered, and seized and destroyed more than 2,000 weapons. Of these 25 were artillery pieces. They seized and destroyed 70 vehicles. They shot down and destroyed a number of aircraft. They seized and destroyed more than 100 [radio] telegraphs. This campaign ended on 22 February 1970. In total the enemy lost 6,246 of its forces who were killed, captured or who surrendered. More than 1,000 deserted, and 2,723 of various sorts of weapons were seized and destroyed. They seized and destroyed 121 military vehicles and shot down and destroyed a number of aircraft. They took back the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang completely. As a result the "Redeem Honor" campaign of the imperialist invaders was another shameful disgrace.
