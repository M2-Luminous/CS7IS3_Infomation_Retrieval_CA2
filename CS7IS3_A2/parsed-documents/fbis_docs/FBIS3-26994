The call came from the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). September's election looks set to be a litmus test of democracy in Hong Kong, with a close contest between the liberal and pro-China factions. The United Democrats, Meeting Point and the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood have already struck an unprecedented electoral deal to avoid putting up competing candidates. Now, pro-China factions are looking at similar measures. The DAB's vice-chairman, legislator Tam Yiu-chung, said yesterday he would welcome the co-operation of other pro-China candidates or parties intending to contest the election. He added that his party had not yet canvassed support for the idea. "This is not just to counter the liberal forces, but to avoid clashes within the pro-China camp," he said. Despite successes in the previous election, the liberals might have difficulty coordinating a pact to maximise their vote, Mr Tam predicted. "It's not easy to compromise since there are so many liberal factions competing." He revealed that the DAB itself was facing some internal friction over candidates. Meeting Point legislator Zachary Wong predicted a bitter battle in each constituency between liberal and pro-China candidates. "I believe most of the constituencies will be a one-to-one battlefield with a pro-China and a liberal candidate fighting each other," he said.
