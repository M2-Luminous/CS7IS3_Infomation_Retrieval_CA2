KYODO NEWS SERVICE recently conducted the survey on 100 rice sellers nationwide by picking two to three wholesalers and retailers in each of the country's 47 prefectural capitals. Of the respondents, 16 percent replied they have already decided to sell domestic and foreign rice separately, while 10 percent said they have not made a final decision but do not want to sell "blended" rice. Another 49 percent answered they have not yet decided whether they will sell the "blended" rice. Only 22 percent of respondents said they will follow the Food Agency's policy of selling the foreign rice blended with the domestic product. The agency will start test sales of foreign rice this month -- 20,000 tons imported from Thailand, 16,000 tons from China and 14,000 tons from the United States. An agency official, commenting on the results of the survey, said, "The quality of imported rice has been underestimated." The government has decided to import more than one million tons of foreign rice to make up for a supply shortfall resulting from the country's poor 1993 harvest, the worst in the postwar period.
