During the CIS Heads of State Conference in the Russian Capital Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk Visited INTERFAX Moscow Headquarters and Answered the Agency Journalists' Questions"] [Text] [INTERFAX] Leonid Makarovich! Ukraine has signed an agreement on joining the CIS Economic Union as an associate member. Why that status in particular, and what will that status provide for Ukraine? [Kravchuk] I think that the division into "full" and "associate" membership of the Economic Union is currently a negative thing. I will explain why. While the CIS as a structure is in the formation stage, it does not seem possible to make a clear distinction between full and associate members of the union. For instance, we have signed all the economic documents which were put to the CIS Heads of State Council. Thus, I believe that in actual fact there is no difference between those classed as full members and us associate members of the Economic Union. We realize that this may be an artificial distinction at the moment, but there is still a "but." The fact is that the Ukrainian parliament, when it examined the Treaty on the Formation of the CIS, made some appropriate comments and stipulations. These are in force to this day. And I as president cannot sign any documents ignoring those stipulations. This is the explanation for our legal status of associate member of the Economic Union. But I would repeat that we are playing and will continue to play the most full and active role in the Economic Union. [INTERFAX] The second question is also partly connected with the form of cooperation. There has been talk about the Kazakhstan president's proposal to set up a Eurasian union. A number of politicians, not least in Russia -- Sergey Shakhray, for instance -- are even calling for an international group of experts to be set up to elaborate an overall concept for the economic integration of the former Union republics (those which want to participate, of course). What is your attitude to these proposals? [Kravchuk] I could reply in the words of the sages of old: "Do today what can be done today; what cannot be done today (if the time is not ripe), postpone until tomorrow." The conditions for integration on the broad scale that certain politicians are assuming (taking the EC as their model, presumably) are not yet in place here. I do not believe that as soon as you sign any decision it starts being implemented all by itself; that we signed a decision and the CIS started operating; or that we can sign another and the Eurasian union will start operating tomorrow.... For this union to work and operate properly the conditions for it must be prepared. Step by step. What goals and tasks are we setting? How should we approach such goals and tasks? After all, it is no secret that the EC has taken 35 years to reach its current position. We have only been in the CIS for a few years so far, and we have been unable to elaborate the mechanisms for the Commonwealth's activity during this period. Many other questions have not been resolved either. Not because we have no desire to do so, but because we have no opportunity, no conditions. You need to have the right conditions to solve any problem -- all the more so when it comes to solving such major problems. Second, we must ultimately resolve them in a civilized fashion. We need to instruct experts to work seriously on the whole range of issues and then consult with the people. Look how tolerantly and respectfully the population is treated by the European states, where a whole variety of opinion polls are carried out. But our mentality is to say that we have met and signed another agreement, so it should start operating! That the people will see the results later. Actually, this is probably not quite correct. That is, I do not reject the idea itself; I merely do not want it to immediately become a subject of a political decision, because then it will end badly. We cannot yet answer all the questions which will be of concern to people in connection with the implementation of this proposal. [INTERFAX] It seems that there is currently a certain amount of concern among Russian social and official circles about the results of the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. The gist of this concern is that different political forces with diametrically opposed views won in different parts of your country. This presupposes a potential either for sharp confrontation or, conversely, for state power -- in its desire to consolidate society -- to try to play the nationalist card. Events in Odessa and all the problems connected with the Black Sea Fleet can partly be explained by this theory. What is your view on this? [Kravchuk] We need to ask the question as follows: Consolidation around what, or confrontation with whom and against what? After all, profoundly different forces were also victorious in the December elections in Russia, but nobody in Russia is yet proposing that that state join with Ukraine. Moreover, if some Russian parliamentary deputies allowed themselves to suggest as much, they would probably be considered not very serious people, to put it quite politely. More accurately, the question would arise of whether Ukraine would be an independent state in friendship and alliance with Russia or whether it would come under Russia. As president I say that I want to be in friendship, cooperation, and partnership with Russia. But I do not want to be under Russia. Certain people claim that it is wrong to argue in this way, on the grounds that such a thing could not happen. Well, unfortunately, history has shown that when two states unite, tendencies toward a strong ethnic thrust are victorious in the historical aspect and in development. That is inevitable. The 340 years of unification with Russia and the 70 years in the USSR confirmed that the Ukrainian language has already started to disappear from Ukraine and certain traditions of our national culture have begun to die off. That is a real fact. It is the reason why we need to elaborate a mechanism to ensure that Ukraine and Russia live in friendship and partnership as two good-neighborly states. To this end we need to resolve some acute issues hampering good-neighborliness. For instance, one of these is the nuclear issue. It strikes me that we have already resolved it one way or another. I personally am glad that the tripartite agreement on issues relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory are beginning to be fulfilled, albeit with difficulty. Then there is the Black Sea Fleet problem. I think that, on the basis of the agreements that have been reached, we will be able to solve this problem as well. I want the Odessa incident -- without going into details or analyzing who was right or wrong -- to be seen as a signal for the immediate and constructive resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. I want to stress that when such complex issues are being resolved we must all be guided by good intentions. There can be no other approach. If the Russian military say that the entire fleet and its entire infrastructure should go to Russia, while the Ukrainians strive to give nothing, then it is clear that both of these positions are both wrong and unrealistic. In confirmation of this I myself would raise the following question -- in 1992 prices, the entire Black Sea naval structure is worth 35 trillion rubles [R] (the ruble-dollar rate being 1-1,000 at the time); consequently, the value of the fleet is $35 billion (made up of $17.5 billion for Russia and the same amount for Ukraine). Ukraine's debt to Russia is $2.5 billion. Thus, Russia should pay Ukraine $15 billion and then the ships could go to Russia. But this must be done in such a way as to ensure that the cost of the ships is paid for first. If we recall Ostap Bender, he reaffirmed that we should not first hand the ships over and get the money for them 10 years later. But is Russia capable of paying this amount of money at the moment? It is important to realize that this is not a question of nationalistic or imperial aspirations. It is simple economics -- will Russia be able to transfer $15 billion to Ukraine? Of course not. So we need to proceed on the basis of the actual situation and the actual interests of both countries. The Black Sea Fleet problem can be resolved, but it has to be in a phased manner. We should begin by dividing up the fleet and separating it into different bases. If there are two commanders in the same "galley" they are bound to quarrel. I recall the period when the Black Sea Fleet was commanded by Admiral Igor Kasatonov and the Ukrainian Navy by Admiral B. Kozhin. Initially, all was sweetness and light between them. But they lived together for a month and the fighting started. I. Kasatonov was replaced by E. Baltin, while B. Kozhin was replaced by V. Beskaravaynyy. The first month went well, but then the fighting began again. Thus, if the fleets are not split up, I am sure that no good will come of it. In the second phase we need to settle the question of the Russian naval base, proceeding on the basis of international principles. But if the Russian military say that the base means not just Sevastopol but Feodosiya, Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev, all the airfields, and so forth, then I in my turn will say: "Do you seriously believe that?" Twelve Russian naval bases in Ukraine?! Can that be taken seriously? I think not. In any case, this decision is parliament's prerogative. In other words, the question should be viewed not from the standpoint of the navy which the Soviet Union had, but from the standpoint solely of the Russian Navy. But the military are unwilling to come to terms with this approach; they are pressuring the political leadership on both sides. And, under this pressure, the political leadership has been constantly postponing the task of finding a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem. For instance, Ukraine has already said several times: "Yes, we agree to give up part of our navy, since we do not need such a big navy." But, in order to define how to sell it or transfer it to Russia, we must be able to examine all the fleet's documents. We must know how much it is currently worth, what its initial cost was, where the ships are, and what condition they are in. We are not trying to monitor every ship, but merely to study the necessary documents. But we have not had that opportunity. Why is Ukraine being deprived of the right to know what it is giving up? There can be no avoiding a political decision in this area. Moreover, nor should we be guided by the intentions of the naval leaders and the military, because each naval leader wants to be a great man. And they see their greatness in simple terms: The more ships they have under their command, the more important they are. I am convinced that the Russian president understands me perfectly. And that is already quite an important first step. [INTERFAX] A conflict between Russia and Ukraine is the most terrible thing that could happen. Presumably you too have given some thought as to how to prevent even small conflicts, not to mention big ones? [Kravchuk] That is the main question for us. We must not quarrel even over the Black Sea Fleet -- although this is a painful issue for Russia. I understand that. Particularly Sevastopol. It is a painful and historical issue for the Russian mentality and the Russian leadership. Russia's leadership cannot get away from the Russian mentality because, if it did, it would not be the Russian leadership. And the Russian leadership should defend Russians, as I must defend Ukraine. But we must not go our separate ways and end up in a state of mutual enmity. We must not allow our peoples to quarrel. Ultimately, this is the most important point. This has never happened in the past 340 years. God forbid we should ever quarrel. But to prevent this we need to display incredible willpower to avoid getting drawn into conflict. We need to remember that conflicts are almost always started by armed people. Politicians are becoming hostages. All of us must prevent this from happening! [INTERFAX] But surely, it is not only armed people who can bring about a conflict. Take the problem of energy sources. It is no less painful.... [Kravchuk] True, but that is a different sphere. We can also include the banking system and loans, and there are international norms. We are not confronting one another here either, just because we have weapons. After all, weapons can be fired! A single shot can cause so many complex problems and exacerbate them to such an extent that it may later be not just hard but sometimes even impossible to stop a snowballing conflict. There are examples of this -- Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Unfortunately, we already have lessons from which we should learn. That is why I advocate that everything should be resolved swiftly, without delay. I understand those military men who are trying to delay resolution of the issue. They are doing this in the expectation that their flag will be raised on some ship and that this ship will then de facto go to one or other side. Others are counting on the new Crimean leadership to conduct its policy in such a way as to "help" to unilaterally resolve the Black Sea Fleet problem. But this "help," I am convinced, could turn into a tragedy for the two peoples. We have no right to quarrel, even over the Crimea. Although I also understand the Crimea's role and importance for both parties. We need to ensure that the Crimea does not drive us or our peoples apart. Because leaders come and go, but peoples remain. [INTERFAX] We get the impression that, when you start working together with the Russian president on the most acute issues, you find acceptable solutions. Tell us, do you find it easy to work with Boris Yeltsin on a purely personal level? [Kravchuk] When I talk about this subject the main thing for me is that each people chooses the leader it wants. The Russians chose B. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainians chose L. Kravchuk. Whether we match each other in character or not, we have to find the ability to work together. As for Boris Nikolayevich personally, I am able to resolve questions with him, I am able to raise problems and to meet with an appropriate reaction -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but always clear-cut and precise. Yes, when we are together we resolve the tasks facing us. [INTERFAX] Do you often contact the Kremlin by phone? [Kravchuk] Of course, and not only Boris Nikolayevich. For instance, when the Russian president was in Spain and the "Odessa incident" occurred, I contacted Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin several times. And I can also reach mutual understanding with him. But, unfortunately, our mutual understanding with the top Russian leadership is sometimes eroded in the structures "under us." And it is at those levels that people start quoting arguments, finding legal norms of some kind, remembering some international principles that are by no means to our mutual advantage, and making a huge number of proposals of all kinds. And the main task facing both sides is sometimes lost sight of under such a huge pile of documentation.... That is why I would reiterate that the Ukrainian and Russian leaderships need above all political will, patience, and determination.
