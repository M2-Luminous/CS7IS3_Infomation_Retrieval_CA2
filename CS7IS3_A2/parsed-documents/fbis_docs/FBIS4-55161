The new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik canceled on March 29, due to legal and factual shortcomings, 13 of the 45 privatization projects approved by the government of ex-premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar at a time when its remaining at power was already questionable. At that time the projects were also questioned by the media because the ex-premier's co-workers and their relatives were to participate in the projects. However, "the harmed entrepreneurs" at today's meeting maintained that the privatization projects were legally correct and were canceled for political reasons on minor pretexts.
