Contacts on this Syrian announcement have been held since last night at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. This was told to HA'ARETZ by a Lebanese diplomat in Geneva. The announcement reportedly will be handed over to the Americans today, but will not be publicized. According to the Lebanese diplomat, the Syrians have prepared an initial draft stipulating that they "will suspend or stop supporting elements operating against the peace process." The Americans, however, are demanding a more detailed and explicit commitment, including mentioning Hizballah by name. In return, the State Department may strike Syria off the list of terror supporting countries. [passage omitted] The Lebanese diplomat estimated that the Syrian-Israeli rapprochement will be similar to the Israel-PLO mutual recognition, which followed 'Arafat's public renouncement of terrorism. The Lebanese diplomat believes this will be the main achievement of the summit, which is to be held this morning at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. The meeting is scheduled to last some three hours. A joint news conference may be held at the end of the meeting.
