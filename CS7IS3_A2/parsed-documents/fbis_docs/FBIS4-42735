Major said on BBC television that such a veto was "risky." The British attitude means that Lubbers' chances of getting the EC presidency have become extremely small. Yesterday, in an unusual declaration, the parliamentary leaders of the four major Netherlands parties supported outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers' candidacy for the EC presidency. Kok (PvdA [Labor Party]), Brinkman (CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]), Bolkestein (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]), and Van Mierlo (D66 [Democrats 66]) announced that they supported Lubbers "with conviction." The race for the EC presidency is still formally entirely open, but if the rumors emanating from the European Union [EU] capitals are true, then a large majority of countries favor Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene. Lubbers' few remaining chances depended on Major's support. In Brussels there was speculation on this possibility. The threat of a British veto probably could have led to a turnaround in the considerations of the other EU leaders. Now that Major is refusing to use such drastic means at the European Council on Corfu, Lubbers has lost his international supporters. It had been assumed up to now that London had serious objections to Dehaene as EC president. But, according to the FINANCIAL TIMES, the Major government does not view Dehaene as the great advocate of a European superstate. The Belgian prime minister has more of a reputation in government circles as a "political fixer," the Belgians call him "the plumber," rather than a "European visionary." [passage omitted] Outgoing Foreign Minister Kooijmans praised the initiative of the four parliamentary leaders at a CDA meeting on Monday evening. He praised Lubbers as the best candidate for Europe because "extreme adroitness will be required to keep the countries in the heart and on the edges of Europe together." "Considering that the Netherlands, which is the only founding country of the European Community that has not provided a president, has put forward such an excellent candidate, can you tell me what is wrong with this candidate?" Kooijmans asked, almost desperately. [passage omitted]
