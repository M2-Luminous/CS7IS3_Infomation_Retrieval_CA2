The information and electronics industries were hard hit by a worldwide economic recession in 1992, and many companies in the fields went bankrupt. However, the two industries rebounded strongly last year, with the information industry registering an average profit rate of 4.9 percent and electronics makers achieving an even more impressive 8.3 percent profit rate, the Chinese-language business magazine said in its June issue. The average profit rates for the information and electronics industries were 1.4 percent and 3.9 percent respectively in 1992. The magazine said aggregate business turnover of Taiwan's top 1,000 manufacturing companies totaled NT$3 trillion (us$111.11 billion) in 1993, up 11 percent from the year-earlier level. About 54 percent of the increased turnover came from the information and electronics industries, the magazine added. A total of 257 information and electronics firms made the "COMMONWEALTH top 1,000" list. The magazine said the top 1,000 firms' business turnover accounted for 65 percent of the manufacturing industry's total production for 1993, compared with 51 percent recorded in 1987. The figures show large enterprises have gradually become the mainstay of Taiwan's manufacturing industry following an exodus of small and medium sized companies in recent years, the magazine noted. It added that although cumulative turnover of the top 1,000 firms rose only 11 percent in 1993, their net profits increased by an average of 30 percent, indicating their efforts to streamline management and control operational costs have paid off. The commonwealth survey also found non-metal furniture and wooden product manufacturers saw 69 percent growth in their business turnover last year, the highest among the 24 industries under study. On the other hand, chemical, paper and automaking industries suffered turnover declines.
