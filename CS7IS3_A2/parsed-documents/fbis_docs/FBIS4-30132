However, will Japanese politics really be greatly improved by this? I think that it is best not to expect too much. Far from the fact that we ought not expect too much, I fear that if it goes poorly, this will be the demarcation point where Japanese politics loses its dynamics, slides into an endlessly fluid situation and, as a result, we depart from party politics. Development Cannot Be Expected Just by Introduction of a System There are people who advocate that party politics based on policy will be carried out by this new electoral system with the parallel system of a single-seat electoral district and proportional representation system, and a two major party system capable of alternating political power will be realized in Japan also. That, however, will probably end up as an illusion. That is to say, it is because a series of cultural and historical conditions must be present for party politics to function well, notwithstanding the contents of the electoral system. Conversely, even if changes are seen just by introduction of the system, the development of stable party politics should not be expected when the proper base for that is meager. That is to say, the more we are a nation with a shallow tradition of party politics, the more it is necessary to be mindful of cautious, gradual progress with sufficient consideration of the nation's cultural and historical conditions. Just by viewing the circumstances of their approval, I have to think that it is very doubtful that the recent political reforms were formed on such mature consideration. When the cold war ended, "the end of history" was mentioned in the sense of the final victory of the West European form of democracy, and a dominant mood of optimism that the West European form of democracy would probably quickly spread throughout the world in the future. However, optimism had to turn to pessimism before many years passed. [passage omitted] Clear Division in Western Camp However, the end of the cold war made clear not just that it would be difficult to introduce the West European form of politics into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet nations. Ironically, the end of the cold war exposed to the light of day in a brutal form the division between the nations that have really acquired the West European form of party politics and the nations that have not within the Western camp which was supposed to have gained victory in this war. The politics of the various advanced nations of Western Europe were greatly shocked by the end of the cold war, but if observed closely, the way that they reacted to it differed according to the nation. In the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, the partial rise of a new political force (at times, a radical force attacking the status quo) was seen, but in general, so far it has not gone to the point of fundamentally overturning the framework of existing party politics. [passage omitted] Strange Coincidence Between Japan and Italy Different from these West European nations, it has been none other than Italy and Japan whose framework of existing party politics was fundamentally overturned along with the end of the cold war. Both these countries belonged to the Western camp in the cold war era and adopted an apparent party politics form on the surface, but once the cold war ended, they inevitably slid into great political chaos upon receiving the full shock. These two nations have shown a strange coincidence to the point of political scandals exposed by prosecution authorities having become the direct trigger for that. [passage omitted] Even with just a brief glance like this at the recent trends of domestic politics in various nations of the world, the character of recent political reforms in Japan should become visible. At one time, the domestic politics of various nations in the world was very shaky amidst the chaos brought by world panic with 1929 as the starting point and, ultimately, the split into two camps became decisive between the various democratic nations of Western Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which maintained a framework of party politics in some fashion, and the various axis nations of Japan, Germany, and Italy, which departed from a party politics basis. As history repeats itself to an uncanny extent in certain aspects, today in the 1990's, after about 60 years have passed, within the political and economic chaos of the post-cold war era, again it seems that the domestic politics of the various advanced nations are beginning to branch into two directions. In other words, into nations that are trying to maintain at any cost the continuity of party politics, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and nations such as Japan and Italy that are striving for "a reorganization of the political world" by sweeping clean the existing framework of party politics. Unfamiliar "Departure From Zero" in Party Politics I want to remind you, speaking for myself, that Japan and Italy do not appear to be proceeding directly to dictatorships as they did between the two world wars. However, it appears at first glance that the "political reform" or "reorganization of the political world" which these two nations are attempting right now should welcome the reform of all politics, but actually that is not the case. The very idea of striving for a completely fresh start once former political party relationships have been swept clean is not familiar to party politics. The reason is that party politics has the healthy character of, on the one hand, continuing to adhere obstinately to the continuity of history and, on the other hand, causing a blast of small revolutionary changes in the form of alternating political power. Starting everything over again from zero by simply abandoning adherence to the history of parties themselves is an idea far away from party politics. Look at the United States or the United Kingdom. In the case of these countries which have a long tradition of party politics, people are wary about changing the framework of parties to the extent that it can be called timidity. In the United Kingdom, with World War I at the beginning of this century as the demarcation point, a switch was seen from the two major party system of the Conservative Party and Liberal Party to the two major party system of the Conservative Party and Labor Party. However, the switch in this party system was achieved after a very long preparation process. Labor union activities developed for a long time chiefly under the shadow of the Liberal Party until the Labor Party came to shoulder one pole of the two major party system, and moreover, even after the Labor Party was born as an independent party, there was a cooperative relationship period between the Liberal Party and Labor Party that was known as "Lib equals Lab." Thus, the switch in party political systems in the United Kingdom actually was finally realized after patiently waiting for the maturation of conditions. This is probably not the exception even in a case where the Labor Party might wane in the United Kingdom in the future and a party comes to perform a role in the two major party system in its place. More than anything else, that a political party in this country that was born as the Tory Party in the 17th century continues to exist as heir to that tradition today at the end of the 20th century is a fact that makes us Japanese swoon. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, this adherence to history to the point of obstinacy is said to have caused the continuation of party politics over many eras of history and not been a hindrance. Consideration of Inheritance of History and Tradition Necessary It follows from the foregoing that in the countries of Japan and Italy where the tradition of party politics is shallow, it is much more necessary to cultivate cautiously what seem to be the buds of party politics that have rarely shown their face in the past and to tend to the continuity of party politics. Inherently, particularly in the case of Japan, there have been scant differences in culture within society to be enough to support the distinction of several parties. For that alone, it is necessary to set great value on the history and tradition of parties once there has been an attempt to create them in the past, and on the other hand, even if political reform is carried out, to give adequate care to the inheritance of history and tradition. If that is not done, even the precious buds of party politics that have tried with much effort to raise their heads will inevitably be lost in a single stroke. In the past, Japan had tried, little by little, to cultivate something resembling party politics from the end of the Taisho period [1912-1925] to the beginning of the Showa period [1926-1988]. However, once dictatorships appeared in Italy and Germany, we followed after them with loud cries about the corruption of existing party politics and the need for "reform" and, finally, the situation leaned rapidly in the direction of "a new system" and "support politics." At that time also, it was preached that everything existing was corrupt and liquidation was necessary, but even in the recent political reform, the same logic of eliminating essentially all that exists has gone unchallenged. So, the adherence to the history of political parties to the point of obstinacy which the people have shown in various Anglo-Saxon countries, the birthplace of political parties, can be called completely lacking. It has not been that no criticism at all has been heard in the media about these reforms, but I think that the view that preaches the necessity of care about the continuity of history which I have pointed out here has not appeared at all. If you are a sharp reader, undoubtedly you have already noticed a striking fact in reading my treatise so far. Although Japan, Germany, and Italy advocated reform of politics and similarly turned to the denial of existing politics between the two world wars, this time only Japan and Italy are acting in concert, and Germany has been very wary about changing the framework of existing politics. Certainly, this fact has very important significance in considering the character of recent Japanese political reform. In Japanese political reform, there was probably awareness of the West German or German system when it began to be discussed several years ago. In the end, however, the Japanese electoral system that is supposed to be introduced by the recent political reform has settled into the form of a so-called coexisting system, not a combination of a single-seat electoral district system and proportional representation system as in Germany. In other words, the new electoral system of Japan is not one that gives substantial priority to a proportional representation system like Germany, and has become something with an incomplete, halfway character which is neither proportional representation nor a single-seat electoral district system. (On that point, Japanese political reform closely resembles the case of Italy which introduced a single-seat electoral district for three-fourths of the parliamentary seats and a proportional representation system for the remaining one-fourth.) However, on the point of providing assistance to political parties through public funds, it can be said that Japan is close to the German system to a certain extent. The reason is that public assistance to political parties corresponding to the number of votes won in the election has been offered in Germany since the era of West Germany. No Study of Germany on Important Points The problem, however, is that Japanese political reform, while picking at the German system like this, has not tried to study Germany on more important points like strengthening the position of the prime minister, for example. I have introduced it several times so far, but under the basic laws (Constitution) of Germany, a system of so-called "constructive nonconfidence" has been adopted concerning the chancellor and it has become a mechanism whereby so long as a majority of parliament does not agree on the next chancellor, the incumbent chancellor cannot be made to resign by nonconfidence. This is the system that was introduced by West Germany after World War II, in consideration of the painful experience where successive administrations in the Weimar era after World War I alternated, politics became unstable, and ultimately invited seizure of power by the Nazis. Thanks to this system, the regimes of West Germany, or Germany since unification, have all been able to be comparatively stable long-term regimes, and the evil of frequent change of cabinets as in the Weimar era have been avoided. It must not be forgotten that this system is behind the Kohl administration that was born in 1982 and which overcame the rough seas of the collapse of the "Berlin Wall" and unification of Germany and has maintained its long life until today. The incorporation of a German-style "constructive nonconfidence" system instead of adopting an incomplete electoral system and heading in the direction of destroying the framework of existing political parties for Japanese political reform also probably would have brought a much more desirable effect over the long term. Of course, regardless of various systematic devices under the Bonn basic laws, how long in the future German party politics can continue to exist in peace is a question that is rather difficult to foresee. At least up until now, however, German party politics has succeeded in maintaining continuity without experiencing a decisive interruption on the occasion of the shift from the cold war period to the post-cold war period. That probably merits admiration considering that the shock which this nation sustained by the conclusion of the cold war was much more enormous than for Japan. Therefore, the foolish, dangerous matter of frivolous changing regimes and changing the framework of party politics has been learned as a lesson from its own history between the two world wars. Japan, however, has not consulted this valuable example of Germany and, along with Italy, is once agaom trying to follow the track of its own history between the two world wars when it simply got rid of the existing political framework. Just like the respective splits which the Christian Democratic Party and Socialist Party realized before the general election based on the new electoral system in Italy, if a general election were conducted under the new election system in Japan also, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] would probably split and we would see the birth of a series of new parties. However, would a party politics system capable of stable change of power be generated after that? If Viewed With Detachment, It Is First Step Toward Dissolution In the case of Italy, it is said that a power distribution largely of a moderate coalition, leftwing coalition, and rightwing coalition will appear after the collapse of the existing political parties. However, it can be easily surmised from outside observation that Italian party politics does not seem to be stable based on this new power distribution. Similar to that, even though the recent political reform of Japan seems to have some hope for that result so long as it is viewed domestically, if viewed from outside with a little detachment, it actually can be perceived comparatively easily that it is the first step directed to dissolution of party politics. I previously stated that adherence to history was indispensable for the development of party politics. However, that does not mean that I want to advocate that we should protect the so-called 1955 order of the cold war comprised of the LDP and SDPJ. A change of power between political parties based on this system has never occurred, and consequently, there is no need to remind you again that this system is not a healthy form of party politics. Moreover, since the SDPJ which shoulders one pole in this system has a different constitution than the socialist political parties of other West European nations, it will be difficult for it to avoid losing its life force along with the demise of the cold war. However, it is again necessary to recall on this occasion that the sham change of power between political parties in the form of competition between factions within the LDP has just barely been conducted under the 1955 order. That has been a precious experience of political competition cultivated spontaneously somehow or other within the Japanese political climate of high conformity. Of course, the previous lively competitive relationship between factions has been lost, such as the creation of a general mainstream faction within the LDP at the end of its regime and the creation of an inflexible seniority system concerning minister posts. Consequently, various reforms within the party will probably be necessary such as, for example, expansion of a primary election system for election of president or making the term of president at least four years and strengthening that position. However, if political reform is carried out, it should probably shift to implementation in a form joining it in some way with the experience of the LDP which has continued for many years in the past. That is to say, as repeatedly stated, it is because the more that one is a nation with a meager tradition of party politics, the more necessary it is to hold dear the buds of past party politics. Indeed, if a general election is implemented under the new electoral system, it is very likely that several significant new political parties will probably be born. However, enough differences in culture to support the opposition of permanent political parties like in Europe and the United States do not exist in Japanese society today. (Previously, the differences of rural culture represented by Kakuei Tanaka and the urban culture represented by Ryokichi Minobe existed to a certain extent.) Nevertheless, under the situation today where ideology has waned when there has been an attempt to establish distinctions in political parties, even though difficult, in the platform, the platforms of all parties will probably end up being indistinguishably noncommittal. If this happens, politicians will repeat the past, nonchalantly crossing the fences between parties to seek the position of prime minister or minister and, within several years, the distinction between the new political parties will probably lose its meaning. Not only will such degeneration occur in central politics, but also a general ruling party surrounding influential legislators who have won election from the various single-seat electoral districts will undoubtedly be built at local politics level. Seeing that a general ruling party system centered on governors is today already being created in many prefectures, it must be said that such a probability is very high. As a test, you should open a recent local newspaper and try to gather what is occurring on the stage of local politics today. In the central political world, Diet members are separating into various parties such as the LDP, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and the Japan New Party and are moving around, but when it comes down to the level of prefectures or municipalities, examples have been created here and there where local legislators who previously belonged to the LDP have mutually separated and dispersed into several parties, or one legislator is sitting on the fence, belonging to both a coalition ruling party and the LDP. Why has this happened? Local politicians are trying to prepare for any kind of change that may occur in the central political world no matter how much tearful effort they put in. Then, whatever form of regime appears centrally, they will protect their own political careers as local legislators, and moreover, they are eager not to interrupt derivative benefits from the center to their own region. However, the recent reality of such local politics, turned the other way, tells only that the distinction of Japanese political parties on the grassroots level is at most vague. Are New Parties Worthy of the Name Political Party? Are the political parties Shinseito, Japan New Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger] that were born one after the other because of the change in government in the summer of last year really worthy of the name political party? For example, the political party Japan New Party could not have been formed apart from the politician Morihiro Hosokawa and, if he loses his political career, it will probably inevitably be headed for extinction in almost no time. The same thing can be said about the relationship of Sakigake and Masayoshi Takemura. The political groups with this character are no more than political groups for the purpose of putting one politician in the seat of prime minister and are probably not worthy to be called political parties at all. Shinseito, which was born last summer, is no more than a group within a powerful faction of the LDP which split, became independent, and is called a political party. When you consider this, it must be said that the series of new parties that appeared along with the change of government in the summer of 1993 are actually not political parties and their constitution has not left the realm of LDP faction. Many advocates forecast that, if political reorganization gradually proceeds with the introduction of the new electoral system, many of the current political parties will be consolidated in big blocs such as "conservative" or "liberal," and those blocs will respectively become genuine political parties. However, I do not believe these kinds of predictions at all. Even if such a political map should be maintained for a while, neither "conservatives" or "liberals" will be able to extricate themselves from the character of a faction coalition. Then, factions within the various political parties will easily cross over such political walls of "conservative" and "liberal" to participate in an administration and will probably develop complicated bargaining of alliances and confederations. After inherently incompatible political parties like Shinseito and the SDPJ joined hands under the Hosokawa coalition regime, the creation of any combination of political forces except for the Japan Communist Party would not be strange at all. No More Than Expanding Scope of Faction Struggles As far as political reorganization which should be called political reform is concerned, after all, the actual state of Japanese politics in the future will essentially not change from the struggles among factions surrounding the posts of prime minister and minister which have unfolded within the LDP until now. If there is something different from the past, it will be no more than just an expansion of the scope of faction struggles from just the LDP to include the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist Party, and other political parties. Then, the bargaining among factions will become more complicated than it was previously just within the LDP in proportion to the expanded scope of faction struggles. It will be saturated with a behind-closed-doors character and then become something difficult for the general public to understand. Indeed, viewing the process up to approval of the recent political reform-related bill, wasn't it more difficult to understand the behind-closed-doors character than the previous process of making up their minds within the LDP? That is believed to be an omen that the principles and actual state of Japanese politics under the new system will be more disparate than before. Finally, I would like to point out that it is a fact that recent political reform has progressed almost completely cut off from foreign policy issues. In the inauguration of the Hosokawa coalition regime, the realization of political reform was cited as the task with the highest priority, and they inherited the course of the LDP administration on foreign policy and security policy. That is to say, the ruling coalition, which included parties from Shinseito to the SDPJ, actually did nothing but put off as much as possible important decisions concerning foreign policy and security policy because they could agree only on the task of promoting political reform. As a result, other than approving in principle the deregulation of rice in connection with the Uruguay Round compromise, the Hosokawa regime spent its first six months almost idle regarding foreign policy and security. This fact will undoubtedly become a large point of contention on par with the contents of political reform in later discussions on the successes and faults of the Hosokawa regime. That is to say, it is because the international political situation surrounding Japan in this six-month period was decidedly not so calm that the government could put off important decisions. Rather, it is no exaggeration to say that a grim international situation, requiring the most attention by Japan since the end of the cold war and featuring the North Korean nuclear problem and economic negotiations between Japan and the United States, appeared during this period. If by chance the Japanese Government neglected to devise appropriate measures concerning the North Korean nuclear problem or U.S.-Japan economic relations in this period, it may become most regrettable when looking back over it later. To begin with, the concept of "deal with domestic political reform first and then international politics" indicates inadequate awareness of international politics in the post-cold war period which has been intensely fluid. In addition to having already spent the last six months idle for the most part while the international situation in Asia surrounding Japan has been moving rapidly, if the next half year or year is spent on political reorganization along with political reform, there is probably even a danger of the international isolation of Japan in that period. Moreover, if prospects are slim for domestic political reform and political reorganization to be able to produce enough clear-cut results worth that much of a sacrifice in the foreign policy aspect, it is believed that an unlucky turn in Japanese politics is not far off in the future. Danger of Dropping Out From Western Europe Camp Many Japanese view as none of their business the condition that Russia and the East European nations are suffering in the move to a West European form of party politics after having been freed from the control of communist regimes, and they are under the false impression that their own nation is an advanced nation concerning party politics. However, if Japanese party politics cannot break loose at all from the confusion and, moreover, if Japanese isolation in international politics becomes obvious after this political reform, the dissolution of Japan's party politics is probably a matter of time. Aren't the people, exasperated by political reorganization that never makes much progress, abandoning party politics that cannot deal with international politics and beginning to look forward to supraparty nationwide politics depending greatly on the bureaucracy? Although Japan is supposed to belong to the West European democratic camp which triumphed in the cold war, there is a great danger that we will drop out from this camp along with Italy before we realize it. We must persist in remembering the history of the first half of the 20th century when we drank a bitter cup in that, while becoming a victor nation along with the United States and the United Kingdom in World War I, we ultimately were unable to cultivate party politics patiently and turned to the anti-Western Europe camp in international politics and the domestic political system.
