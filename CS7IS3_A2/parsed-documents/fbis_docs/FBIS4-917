The draft bill provides for the creation of a regional assembly in Principe and a five-member regional government under the authority of a minister appointed by the president of the Republic. The bill also authorizes Principe to have bonds of cooperation with foreign local governments. This volcanic island, which measures 128 square km, is located 300 km off the Gabonese coast. It has only one town, San-Antonio, with 1,000 inhabitants. The people of Principe believe they have been neglected by the Sao Tome Government since they gained independence in 1975, so they are now asking for "balanced development" of the archipelago.
