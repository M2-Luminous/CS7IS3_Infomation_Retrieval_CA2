At a joint press conference at the White House, they said the two sides were committed to continuing to work for a resolution of the 22-month ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic. Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Major also discussed the issues concerning Russia, world trade, Northern Ireland and Hong Kong. They agreed to bring forward to January 1, 1995, the start date for implementation of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement. "We'll need to consult with other people to see if that's practicable," Major said. On Japan, they agreed to pressure Tokyo to further open its markets to U.S. and European goods and services. Northern Ireland had been a sticking point in U.S.-British relations, the latest incident being Washington's issuance of visa to leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, a move angered London. Major, however, stressed today he would rather look forward and see how "we produce a solution to the Northern Ireland problem." "I'm not interested in looking back," Major said. For his part, Clinton criticized as a great mistake to "overstate the occasional disagreement and understate the incredible depth and breadth of our shared interest and our shared values." The two leaders also discussed the Middle East peace process and developments in South Africa.
