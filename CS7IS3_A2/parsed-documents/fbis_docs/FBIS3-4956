Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and industry, speaking at a regular press conference, made the warning following news reports that Clinton is ready to reinstate the controversial trade law, which would give him broad authority to impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan over trade disputes. "Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will result in a shrinkage of world trade. From the viewpoint of GATT rules, a revival would be problematic," Kumano said. U.S. dailies, including THE NEW YORK TIMES, reported Wednesday that Clinton has decided to reinstate the "Super 301" provision of the 1988 trade law by executive order. "Japan is cautiously watching the U.S. move. The U.S. should act sensibly," Kumano said.
