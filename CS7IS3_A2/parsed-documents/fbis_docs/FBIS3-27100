A senior official at the State Administration of Taxation in Beijing said the detailed regulations of the tax on capital gains on land sales--due out in late February or early March--would differ significantly from the central government's original announcement of the basic tax law last month. "New problems came up when we talked with Guangdong and other provinces about this, [so] adjustments will be made to take account of their views," he said. But the official denied statements by provincial authorities in Guangdong and Shanghai suggesting the tax may be delayed for one or two years. "I have heard this, but it is not correct. The State Council has already announced the tax, so it cannot be reversed," he said. Coastal regions have given Beijing an earful about its plans to levy the new tax, which would have assessed real estate investment profits at rates of 30 to 60 per cent under the original scheme. Even though local governments would have retained all the proceeds, there was concern that the tax would drive away foreign investment. "The tax was too high. We told the central government this was not correct," said Liang Yixi, deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Land Bureau. Beijing finally backed down on implementation of the new tax only after numerous meetings with provincial leaders, Liang said. "The local role will be increased," she said. Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, had made at least two trips to Beijing to protest against the tax in the past month, an official at the municipal Foreign Investment Commission said. "There have been too many complaints. The central government could not just carry on," he said. Details of the centre's retreat have been leaked to foreign economists and property consultants in the past few weeks as Beijing sought to allay the unease of foreign investors. "The new regulations will be much more relaxed," said Chen Xingdong, chief economist for Crosby Securities in Beijing. Chen said the changes would probably allow developers to deduct interest charges and inflation from their capital gains. Gains of under 20 or 30 per cent would also be exempted from the tax, Chen said. In addition, local governments would be allowed to exempt certain types of property developments. But Beijing would not change the basic rate of the new tax or the January 1 implementation date, Chen said. "This would show their inability to manage," he said. Local governments will also be allowed to rebate a significant portion of the tax to developers in certain circumstances, according to Harry Chan of the property consultants Francis Lau & Co in Hong Kong. "We were told by Beijing that local governments will be given a lot of decision-making power in order to soften the effects," he said. The backdown on the land tax is a blow to the central government, which was counting on it to boost local revenues in compensation for taking a larger share of the total fiscal pie under the new national tax system. Only weeks ago the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, stated publicly that any adjustments or modifications to the tax made by local authorities would be considered invalid. "Local governments have no choice but to obey the regulations laid down by the central government," Liu said.
