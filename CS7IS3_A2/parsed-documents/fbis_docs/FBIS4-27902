Economic interdependence of the two countries has become so strong that relations are not about to be undermined merely because of a hiatus in intergovernmental discussions. However, if the suspension should persist too long, it will have an adverse impact on areas other than the economy. There's also the risk of worsening emotional attitudes between the peoples of the two nations. The resumption of the talks is welcomed in terms of the fact they represent the avoidance of such a serious situation. We would like to see the two governments engage in constructive talks, but an evaluation of the agreement reached on the resumption of talks indicates that we cannot assume an optimistic outlook for the talks. In reference to the key aspect of the agreement, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor explained, "Japan obtained the clear commitment that the United States will not seek numerical goals and the United States obtained the commitment that it would place emphasis on results." The agreement was phrased so that the goal "to increase participation and sales in Japan of competitive foreign products" would be evaluated by each sector, such as "automobiles and related parts." This language is being construed as pointing to emphasis on results. The Japanese Government persisted in its objection to numerical goals as being managed trade. However, there is a very fine distinction between emphasis on results and managed trade. We cannot deny that an element of vagueness remains about the distinction. The question now is how the agreement will be concretely reflected in the individual sectors on the basis of future negotiations. We imagine that both governments foresee difficult negotiations. The original deadline for negotiations, "July 1994" has been eliminated. In its "external economic reform outline" approved at the end of March, the Japanese Government announced that it would compile specific plans by the end of June to conduct negotiations in three specific sectors, to open markets through deregulation, and to administer the economy led primarily through domestic demand. Deregulation measures are being studied by three working committees covering areas such as "housing and land." Among issues being considered in the area of expansion of domestic demand are income tax reductions after next year and the revision of the 10-year 130 trillion yen basic public works program. The program must be revised to reflect projects of substance. A key to plans for expansion of domestic demand is the revision of the tax system. Although the Hata government is controlled by a minority coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan must be thoughtful and refrain from using that fact as a political issue. One wonders why the Clinton administration has softened its stance on trade negotiations with Japan. Although there is the aspect of learning that unyielding Asian policies are not working well as a whole, the foremost issue affecting the policy change is probably the "turbulence of market forces." Just as the threat was posed in the stance that a strong yen was welcomed if Japan did not make concessions, market skepticism prevailed in respect to the fragility of the U.S. economy and distrust of its economic policies, resulting in a weak dollar. Attacks on Japan using attorney-like tactics cannot inspire sudden reversals of economic trends. Forceful policies that disregard economic fundamentals can bring about results which are contrary to hoped-for objectives. That lesson must be garnered from market turbulence by the U.S. authorities. A similar statement can be made about Japan. Delays in market-opening measures and the slowness of economic recovery have caused an extension of the stubborn balance-of-payments surplus. On the other hand, increased exports to maintain optimum factory operating rates have given a boost to the strong yen. It's a case of exacerbating one's own problems. I feel that both politicians and bureaucrats are excessively insensitive to the current situation. The Japanese Government, which had said "No" without any particular idea about what it was going to do to resolve the problem, has managed to gain resumption of the talks by what might be considered a default by the U.S. Government, but what takes place in the future is more important. We would like to see politicians and bureaucrats resolutely grapple with the issues at hand, mindful of the fact that economic reform is essential not for the United States but for the recovery of the Japanese economy.
