Speaking to the NOTICIAS reporter in that part of the country, they described as "absurd" the decision that has been made by the provincial trade authorities and have demanded "serious and plausible explanations" from those responsible. In addition to demanding high indemnification for the maintenance, rehabilitation, and restoration work done to those buildings over the course of the years, they questioned the legality of the measures being taken by the state. In that context, they wondered how it was possible that the state, which is now selling houses, should take measures whereby such buildings are returned to people turning up claiming to be their rightful owners. They also accused some Trade Ministry workers of forging documents without the knowledge of their superiors for the benefit of those who left the country for political and other reasons after independence but who, now that the war is over, are back and claiming ownership. In the opinion of those economic agents, documents authorizing the return of such buildings to their former owners are not produced in accordance with legal procedures but arise, rather, from devious procedures. [passage omitted] The Trade Director's Response When he was approached by our reporter, Manica Provincial Trade Director Jose Gabriel Cuna said that "the whole process concerning the handing over of the buildings in question was authorized by Prime Minister Mario Machungo. The other dispatch came from the Trade Ministry." Referring specifically to the dispatch by the Trade Ministry, Jose Cuna noted that that document contains instructions that must be followed when buildings are returned so that there is no friction with their current lessees. He admitted that the first documents dealing with the case had not come via official routes, but he stated that "the whole process is being carried out in accordance with the law so as not to harm current occupants who have invested a great deal of money to maintain those buildings." He added that the implementation of the process to return that company had begun long ago, but he failed to provide the date or the year when it had begun. [passage omitted]
