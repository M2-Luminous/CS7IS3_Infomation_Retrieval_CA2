The Foreign Relations Secretariat -- through the Mexican Consulates in Los Angeles, San Diego, Oxnard, Santa Ana, and San Bernardino -- is assessing aid needs. Contacts have also been made with Mexican-American leaders to study how greater support can be given to Mexican victims of the earthquake; that is, those who reside in that part of the United States.
