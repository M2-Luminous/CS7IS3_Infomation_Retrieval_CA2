Earlier this year, the waterways administration of the Chang Jiang River agreed to let the use of six signal stations in the Three Gorges to the Chongqing-based New Century Advertisement Company. The signal stations were built at eye-catching positions in the Three Gorges to alert vessels at river bends. When the Chang Jiang River is dammed in 1997 as planned, the first of the six signal stations will be submerged beneath the waters. The last will be flooded in the year 2003 when the first generating unit of the Three Gorges Power Station goes into operation. An official of the New Century Company said they would choose six best-sellers in China's alcoholic drinks industry as their clients. The six signal stations will be equipped with aluminium dioxide display boards which will have an area of 160-180 sq m each, according to the company's plan. The company also plans to put 99 bottles of drinks of the six enterprises into vessels carrying small signal transmitters, and sink them where the river runs relatively slowly. The aim is for them to be salvaged after 100 years, a company official said.
