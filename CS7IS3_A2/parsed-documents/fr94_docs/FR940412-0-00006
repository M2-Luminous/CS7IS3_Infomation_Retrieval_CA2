FR940412-0-00006 FR940412-0-00002 Some commenters on both the 1992 and the current NPRM noted that this rulemaking implicates protected first amendment rights, and that any infringement on these rights is subject to strict scrutiny by reviewing courts. However, it is well established that first amendment rights are not absolute when balanced against the government's interest in protecting the integrity of the electoral process. ``Even a `significant interference' with protected rights [‚ê£] may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment'' of those rights. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1975) (citations omitted). The Common Cause court deferred to the Commission's judgment that literal adherence to the language of section 432(e)(4), coupled with the disclaimer requirements of 2 U.S.C. 441d(a), struck the proper balance at that time. 842 F.2d at 440. Section 441d(a)(3) requires that communications by unauthorized committees include a disclaimer that clearly identifies who paid for the communication, and states whether it was authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. The Common Cause decision grew out of the 1980 presidential election. Since that time, the Commission has become increasingly concerned over the possibility for confusion or abuse under the interpretation upheld in that case, that is, limiting the FECA's ``name'' prohibition to a committee's registered name. Aware of these constitutional concerns, the 1992 NPRM sought comments on two modifications to the rules then in effect that fell short of an overall ban. Under the first proposal, the political committee sponsoring the project would have been required to include in the required disclaimer the name of the committee paying for the project, as well as a statement whether the project had been authorized by the candidate whose name appeared in the title, or by any other candidate. As part of this proposal, the Commission also sought comments on whether disclaimer size and/or location requirements should be imposed in this situation. Second, a committee would not have been allowed to accept checks received in response to a special project solicitation, unless the checks were made payable to the registered name of the committee. However, the Commission also sought comments on a proposed total bar on the use of a candidate's name in the project title of an unauthorized committee's special fundraising project; and several commenters endorsed this approach. After considering all comments received in response to that Notice, the Commission decided that the total ban was justified. The rulemaking record contains substantial evidence that potential contributors often confuse an unauthorized committee's registered name with the names of its fundraising projects, and wrongly believe that their contributions will be used in support of the candidate(s) named in the project titles. Although one commenter on the present rulemaking stated that the Commission had overstated the potential for fraud and abuse in this area, no comment provided information to refute this earlier determination. This rule is narrowly designed to further the legitimate governmental interest in minimizing the possibility of fraud and abuse in this situation. Committees are not barred from establishing specially designated projects: They are free to choose whatever project title they desire, as long as it does not include the name of a federal candidate. Also, committees may freely discuss any number of candidates, by name, in the body of a communication. The newly-revised rule further enhances unauthorized committees' constitutional rights by exempting from the ban those titles that clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate. It is clear from the rulemaking record that the situation today differs significantly from that of the early 1980's, when the Common Cause case was litigated. Prior to the adoption of the 1992 rules, the use of candidate names in the titles of projects or other unauthorized communications had increasingly become a device for unauthorized committees to raise funds or disseminate information. Under the former interpretation, a candidate who objected to the use of his or her name in this manner, who shared in none of the funds received in response to the solicitation, and/or who disagreed with the views expressed in the communication, was largely powerless to stop it. For example, in 1984 a United States Senator requested, and received, permission to obtain from Commission records the names and addresses of those who had responded to unauthorized solicitations made in his name, to inform these contributors that he had not authorized the solicitation. However, he could not suggest that contributors send donations instead to his campaign committee. See Advisory Opinion 1984&hyph;2.
