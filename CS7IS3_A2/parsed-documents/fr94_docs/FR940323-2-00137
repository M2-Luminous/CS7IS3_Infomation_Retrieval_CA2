Upon Written Request Copy Available From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings and Information Services, Washington, DC 20549. Proposed Amendments: Rule 15c2&hyph;12; File No. 270&hyph;330. Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for Office of Management and Budget approval proposed amendments to rule 15c2&hyph;12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78 et seq. ). The proposed amendments to rule 15c2&hyph;12 would make it unlawful for a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer to act as an underwriter of an issue of municipal securities unless the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository, and would require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, prior to recommending a transaction in a municipal security, to review the information the issuer of the municipal security has undertaken to provide. It is anticipated that approximately 12,003 brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, issuers of municipal securities, and nationally recognized municipal securities information repositories will spend a total of 65,050 hours complying with rule 15c2&hyph;12. Direct general comments to Gary Waxman at the address below. Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules and forms to John J.
