In a Bundestag debate, requested by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], only CDU/CSU speakers were ready to advocate, like Schaeuble, the idea of using the Armed Forces for missions at home. As far as the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was concerned, ostentatiously no leading party or group members took the floor in the debate. FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said he did not see a need for decision on the matter. Schaeuble himself did not take part in the debate, because he had to attend a CDU Presidium meeting. On behalf of the CDU, Minister in the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl cautiously supported Schaeuble. He said that under certain and precisely defined conditions, an internal mission of the Armed Forces could make sense. Bohl criticized the "emotional discussion" and stressed that one certainly could discuss the "idea of rejecting the proposal," but he did not understand why "people should come with a big hammer." Under the impression of epochal changes, the option of a Bundeswehr mission inside the country's borders must be examined. Rupert Scholz, a constitutional expert and former defense minister (CDU), and Johannes Gerster, deputy CDU/CSU floor leader, expressed the most favorable opinions on Schaeuble's proposal. Scholz said that the term of external security had changed; it now also included migration movements, terrorism, and ecological situations. Security policy and the Bundeswehr mandate had to be reoriented to this new definition. Gerster said the Bundeswehr should defend the borders. FDP Secretary-General Hoyer said he was not happy with the discussion. He stressed that "at least since the emergency laws became effective, clarity has been created on the issue of Bundeswehr missions at home," and stated categorically: "There is no need for decision." Hoyer said it was true that absolutely new circumstances could require new decisions, but he did not see that this also required a constitutional amendment. The Bundeswehr could already help in disasters. Hoyer warned that the debate, touched off by Schaeuble, would be counterproductive because it burdened the discussion on an amendment to the Basic Law for out-of-area missions. In addition, there was the danger that the Bundeswehr's anchoring in society and the citizens' trust in the armed forces could suffer harm. Both were based on the fact that the Bundeswehr averted dangers from outside and did not appear as a power protecting law and order at home. FDP deputy Juergen Koppelin said that for the liberals, Schaeuble's proposal amounted to an "erosion of the constitution." SPD politician Erwin Horn said that "those who want such missions want a different republic." Horn called Schaeuble's proposals absurd, and insinuated that for tactical considerations, Schaeuble wanted to sacrifice the consensus among the political parties. He added that even Defense Minister Volker Ruehe had rejected the proposals. One could not call upon the citizens to respect the constitution, and at the same time deal with the Basic Law as if it were a tear-off calendar.
