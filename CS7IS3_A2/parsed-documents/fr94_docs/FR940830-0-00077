FR940830-0-00077 FR940830-0-00013 The Act requires the development-by-development analysis of whether the improvements will reasonably ensure the long-term viability of the development at a reasonable cost. HUD has added the alternative of maintaining habitability where reasonable cost cannot be met and an interim period is needed to provide housing until relocation for the residents can be arranged. When providing ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability'', a HA is required to do so in the most efficient and economical manner and within the eligibility guidelines of the CGP. Routine maintenance costs are ineligible. However, work items that would ordinarily be performed on a regular basis but have become substantial in scope because they have been put off, and involve expenditures that would otherwise materially distort the level trend of maintenance expenses are eligible CGP costs under the definition of nonroutine maintenance. §§905.675 and 968.325␣Effect of HUD Approval of Comprehensive Plan Comment: Commenters supported the elimination of approval of amendments to the annual statement, but were confused by the mechanics in the process. Similar questions as previously raised above were expressed on the fungibility of work items between years and the requirement for HAs to consult to the extent practicable with residents on significant changes. One HA noted that based on their experience with HUD, the term practicable imposed an impossibly high standard of performance. The HA again requested that each HA should have the discretion to develop appropriate means of resident communications. Response: HAs have the responsibility to keep residents informed as they exercise fungibility. When a HA amends the Five-Year Action Plan by adding work not previously included, the HA is required to consult with residents and obtain HUD approval. §§905.678 and 968.330␣Annual Submission of Activities and Expenditures Comment: Commenters raised the same issues on the annual submission procedures as they did for the Five-Year Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan. Most HAs agreed that they would prefer to develop their preliminary plans based upon the amount of money they had received in the prior year, and not finalize these plans until HUD announces the final amounts for the current year. The public notice, advance meetings, public hearing, and level of detail concerned many commenters. Commenters also suggested that either some parameters be defined regarding the time allotment for corrections or that some other mechanism be defined by which a HA may have recourse to unreasonable time constraints. Commenters supported the proposal authorizing HAs to self-execute an extension of target dates contained in the annual submission for fund obligation and expenditure when a delay outside of its control occurs. Penalties for missed target dates concerned the commenters. One HA suggested an option of a two-year application that eliminates one year of application. NAHRO suggested that the P&E Report be submitted at the same time as the annual submission of the Five-Year Action Plan. Commenters supported the proposal which requires only an annual report and its intent to involve HA residents. However, HUD was directed not to place a burden on HAs to create resident interest and councils. It was proposed that HUD should mandate that HAs make information available, and the methods and format should be left to local discretion. Only one hearing each year was recommended and advanced meetings were not needed because the residents should have been working on the plan and know what it contains. HUD was asked to develop a system by which it could certify that authorities with effective resident participation processes would not have to have an advance hearing. CLPHA agreed that HAs should be allowed the option of advance planning, to complete their annual updates before the final modernization awards are announced. However, they urged HUD not to require HAs to do this because local circumstances vary. Response: These comments have been addressed above. HUD again emphasizes that the Annual Statement is statutory. HUD reviews the P&E Report before approving the next year's submission in order to determine if corrective actions are needed. Therefore, NAHRO's suggestion for simultaneous submission could hinder early approval of the Annual Statement and access to funds. HAs must be accountable to the residents. There must be a partnership process which is documented. HAs must annually conduct both an advance meeting and a public hearing. The format has been left to HA discretion. Also, as previously mentioned, HUD is providing the option for advance planning. §§905.681 and 968.335␣Conduct of Modernization Activities Comment: One commenter requested that HUD clarify the statement that ``the HA shall comply with requirements prescribed by HUD.'' They interpreted this to apply only to the process by which funds are requisitioned and not to the actual administration of the CGP program by a HA. Any other interpretation could allow HUD to take away the flexibility that was granted in other sections of the rule. Response: HUD wishes to clarify that the purpose of the above-referenced statement is that there are other requirements regarding fund requisitions (through LOCCS/VRS) which are prescribed by HUD. Sections 905.681(b) and 968.335(b) only relate to fund requisitions.
