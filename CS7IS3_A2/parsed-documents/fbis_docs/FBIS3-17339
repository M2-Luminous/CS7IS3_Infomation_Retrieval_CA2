Let me remind those who missed our previous newscasts that the Azerbaijani Army shelled Armenia's northeast border last night. Fire was opened on the defensive positions around Berdavan in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon. There are wounded. Our border guards did not retaliate. Active military operations are continuing in the southeast of the Karabakh war front. Fierce battles continued in the direction of Fizuli yesterday for the control of hills overlooking Alkhanly. The Karabakh military units maintained all their positions in that sector. Some 40 enemy soldiers were killed and one tank and one artillery piece were destroyed. Two fighters were killed and 11 were wounded on the Karabakh side. The Azerbaijani Air Force planes bombed the Karabakh positions around Fizuli this morning. We have received no reports on the consequences. No substantial changes have taken place on the other fronts.
