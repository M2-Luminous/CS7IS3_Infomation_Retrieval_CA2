Kenneth Markle, convicted of murdering a Tongduchon bar hostess, will be turned over to Korean authorities Tuesday to be put in a Korean prison. The U.S. Forces in Korea notified Friday the Korean government of its decision to transfer the 22-year-old soldier from West Virginia on Tuesday in accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), a spokesman for the Prosecutor General's Office said yesterday. Markle, whose sentence of 15 years imprisonment was confirmed by the Supreme Court on April 29, will serve his term in Chonan Juvenile Prison some 100 km south of Seoul. Under SOFA, U.S. Forces authorities can reject Korean authorities' request for the transfer of American military personnel and their family members who "committed crime," and the former can reject it through "sympathetic consideration." But the military authorities are obligated to comply with any request for the transfer of "convicted criminals." Markle was sentenced last year to life imprisonment in the 1992 death of the bar hostess, Yun Kum-i, who was then 22, and the sentence was reduced to 15 years in jail by an appellate court.
