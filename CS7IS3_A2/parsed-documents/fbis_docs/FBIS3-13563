FBIS3-13563 "drnes051_j_94001" FBIS-NES-94-051 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Mar 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Saudi Arabia `Source' Condemns `Irresponsible' Remarks by Khamene'i LD1603004294 Riyadh SPA in Arabic 2242 GMT 15 Mar 94 LD1603004294 Riyadh SPA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Riyadh, 15 Mar (SPA) -- A responsible source made the following statement to SPA today: Many people were amazed by and even condemned the statement by Iranian religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i in his sermon of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr, in which he alleged that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was creating difficulties for the Iranian pilgrims. Everybody knows that the 17th meeting of the foreign ministers of the Islamic states, held in Amman in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan from 3 to 7 Sha'ban 1408 AH, corresponding to 21-25 March 1988, issued a resolution in which the numbers of pilgrims were fixed on the basis of the ratio of people from every state to the number of Muslims in the world. Thus, the number of Iranian pilgrims was fixed according to the text of the above-mentioned resolution, which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia abides by, as well as all the Islamic states that signed the resolution in the interest of all Muslims. If some people make allegations which are not objective, out of a personal motive in order to achieve purely local aims, then it is up to the Iranian people to assess and be aware of that. The source added: It is a blessing from God Almighty on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its king, government, and people that we are honored to serve the Two Holy Places and look after the comfort and safety of pilgrims, so they are able to perform the rites of pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage and visit with all ease. In order to achieve this noble aim and to allow capacity to go hand in hand permanently with the continuous increase in the number of pilgrims wishing to perform pilgrimage, it is necessary to lay down continuous programs for extending the Two Holy Places and provide additional space in the pilgrimage areas. Despite this, and because of the limitation in time and space, the capacity of accommodation requires that one stick to rules in order to give the opportunity to all Muslims from the East and West of the world according to just quotas, and we hope that everybody cooperates with us in the interest of all. [passage omitted] Regarding Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i, who said "the Muslim Iranian people should be given priority over the other peoples in performing this duty" i.e. the pilgrimage duty, the source stated all Muslims are equal before God and that there is no difference between an Arab and a non-Arab, or between a white and a black other than in piety. God Almighty said "The most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you." [Koranic verse]. The source said in his statement that shouldering the responsibility before God and the guests of His house [holy shrine of Ka'bah], and consequently before our conscience, was a matter which we were keen to preserve and endeavor to perform with all our strength "and we shall not pay attention to the low statements made by some or the fabricated media campaigns aimed at causing provocation, confusion, and sowing the seeds of sedition among the Muslims." The source further said: We are extremely astonished at the contradiction there is in the way the Iranian leaders are talking to us. While President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, continues to send his letters and his messengers to us with a view to improving relations and bringing closer viewpoints between the two countries, the spiritual leader 'Ali Khamene'i surprises us with improper and irresponsible statements followed by a frenzied media campaign. Which of the two teams should we rely on and which of the two men should we deal with? However, we reject and condemn the style used by the Iranian media and we also reject the statements made by Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri [representative of Khamene'i and supervisor of Iranian pilgrims] and quoted by the French news agency. We warn against the continued use of such a style which does not serve Islamic interests and does not achieve any good objective in this respect.
