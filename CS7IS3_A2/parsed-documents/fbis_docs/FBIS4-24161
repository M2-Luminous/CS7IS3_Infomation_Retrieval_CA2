Present at the meeting were six observers in the Angolan peace process, including the U.S. ambassador in South Africa. Alioune Blondin Beye briefed Nelson Mandela on the development of the peace talks in Lusaka. Manuel Augusto, Angolan charge d'affaires in South Africa, told Luanda Radio Nacional today that the meeting was positive. [Begin recording] [Augusto] As far as we know, President Mandela expressed gratitude for the briefing. He also expressed his readiness, at the request of the relevant parties, to render his contribution within the framework of the Lusaka talks. In other words, President Mandela made it clear that he will not take initiatives which are outside the Lusaka spirit or which could collide with the Lusaka spirit. [Unidentified correspondent] We have learned here in Luanda that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to join the group of mediators in the Angolan conflict, that he even expressed a readiness to meet very soon with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. When do you think these meetings will take place, particularly with the president of the Republic? [Augusto] In my understanding, I think it is not very correct to say that he agreed to join the group of mediators. In his capacity as the head of state at the present, President Mandela would not join anyone, because we have no mediators at the level of heads of state. It is correct to say, however, that President Mandela expressed a readiness to join efforts aimed at bringing peace to Angola. President Mandela also said at the end of the meeting this afternoon that, at the request of the UN mediators, he is ready to meet with all the parties involved in the process. It is important to clarify, however, that at no time was it said that there would be a summit meeting. As long as he is requested, President Mandela is ready to take part in or promote meetings with the Angolan Government and UNITA. Regarding the meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, President Mandela has just expressed his readiness to meet him. So, some contacts will be made through the appropriate levels and channels between the South African Government and the Angolan Government so that the Angolan Government can tell the South African Government in which areas it expects it to render its contribution.
