Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] [Text] The monetary mass is also put under special pressure by its totally unequal distribution among the various categories of the population, that is, by the accentuated polarization of the money. One of the poles consists by a restricted number of physical and, especially, juridical persons, who over the past four years have accumulated a huge amount of money. Above all this refers to state-owned public corporations and companies, various private firms, certain producers, and various Romanian and foreign businessmen. There are a few dozen billionaires and several tens of thousands of millionaires. Anticipating the catastrophic collapse of the leu, they placed their money into hard currencies, buildings, real estate, automobiles, and various other highly valuable goods. A significant part of the money they invested in such goods has never returned to the economic circuit. The other pole is represented by the almost 20 million people owning no money reserves at all, who can hardly afford to buy the most necessary things they need (food, clothes, shoes, and so on). Thus, all other goods manufactured by domestic industry are not intended for these layers of the population and therefore they cannot be sold, as they are not attractive for the rich either. This also aggravates inflation. The polarization of the money explains the paradox represented by the fact that there was a large monetary mass on the market, which meanwhile has been turned into goods, while the majority of the population still went down to the limit of absolute poverty. The polarization of money also caused the polarization of assets. The polarization of money is a factor causing the acute growth of inflation. As the indexation of salaries and pensions cannot keep pace with the rate of inflation, the polarization of money is intensifying dramatically, which generates social tension the consequences of which are hard to be predicted. The executive ignores this grave phenomenon of polarization of money and assets. The "evil" thing is not the fact that some persons have become billionaires or millionaires who could invest their money in productive activities, thus absorbing a significant part of the unemployed coming from the state-owned sector. The "evil" thing about it is the existence of 20 million people living in poverty, which was caused by stagnation in industrial production, agriculture, and investments. Thus, the polarization of the money is the consequence of the economic blockage, which permanently generates a financial and monetary blockage as well. The state budget deficit is a source of inflation, which it generates by spending money that is not properly covered by the state's incomes. Even if later they find ways to cover the deficit, until they do it the deficit makes them have uncovered money, that is, money printed without any economic foundation. Spending for consumption beyond the limits of the state budget is directly causing inflation, as the money they issue never returns to the circuit of production. Such is the case of the subsidies granted to the mining sector. The indexation of salaries made from the state budget (in the administration apparatus, education, health, culture, and so on) increases the state budget deficit, as the state has no other appropriate income sources to cover up for the money. The exceeding of the limits established in the state budget in areas other than that of investments also causes inflation. The negative consequences of such spending upon the monetary circulation can only be annihilated when the projects begin producing, which usually happens several years after the money was invested. This is the case of the Krivoy-Rog project, in Ukraine, in which over $600 million were invested until the end of 1992 and for which, in 1993, a further 120 billion lei and, in 1994, a further 120 billion lei were allotted. A similar situation is to be found in the case of the Bucharest--Constanta freeway, for which they spent 17 billion lei from the budget, after which work was halted owing to lack of funds. This will delay the inauguration of that freeway and, implicitly, the return to the economic circuit of the money that was already invested. The originally expected budget deficit of 430 billion lei in 1993, which was later modified to 800 billion lei, also means inflation. Regardless of whether one has to deal with the initially expected budget deficit, the modified one, or the one actually registered in the end, in all instances the state budget deficit causes inflation. Currently it is even the principal source of inflation. This is why both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank watch the evolution of the state budget deficits of the countries they offer assistance to so closely, including Romania. The state budget deficit is a key performance criteria reflecting the actual stage reached in the recovery of the economy or in its degradation, as in the case of Romania. The programmed deficit over 1994 amounts to 1.9 trillion lei and this continues to generate inflation. This is why it is not recommendable that parliament should try to further augment the budget deficit. Over the second half of 1993, the executive took certain measures that also increased inflation. First, they reintroduced the initial customs taxes, thus eliminating the tax reductions and exemptions on certain products. This made the price of those products go up. Beginning with 1 May 1993, even staple foodstuffs were subject to high customs taxes, usually 25 percent, which increased costs and their retail price. Let alone the fact that they also introduced customs taxes for products that are not manufactured in the country at all, which is clearly an aberrant thing. An important increase in costs and retail prices was caused by the introduction, beginning with July 1993, of the value-added tax [VAT]. In the case of a great number of products of services that previously used to be subject to turnover taxes of 1, 3, or 5 percent, the VAT, which amounts to 18 percent, significantly increased their costs and prices. Previously, under the circumstances of a 1-percent turnover tax, if a product changed hands five times, the total sum of taxes amounted to 5 percent. Even if the turnover tax amounted to 3 percent, in the end it amounted to 15 percent, which is still less than the VAT applied only once. The introduction of the VAT for imported products, including foodstuffs, made their prices skyrocket, thus aggravating inflation. The introduction of increased customs taxes and the subsequent introduction of the VAT had an inhibiting effect, as customs taxes of 25 percent plus the VAT amounting to 18 percent made the price of imported goods increase by 43 percent, which discouraged imports. Considering the current state of economic regression, the 18-percent level of the VAT is totally exaggerated, let alone the introduction of VAT in the domain of energy and fuel imports, which is wrong, as it further increased their already high prices so that both companies and the population find it increasingly difficult to pay for them. The same inflationist effect was caused by the introduction of very high profit taxes in the case of a large number of important products. If one added the 45-percent profit taxes to the customs taxes and the VAT, one will clearly see that the tax policy applied by the Vacaroiu government is a repressive, rather than a stimulating one. The grave consequences of the measures taken in 1993 are quite obvious, because as a consequence of them, the price of the great majority of products and services increased two or three times. Such products are: meat, sugar, edible oil, rice, wheat flour, coffee, cigarettes, electric power and heating, public transportation, and interurban transportation. In the years 1990 to 1992 there was no similar shock. For the population this was tantamount to a genuine disaster, as the 50-percent indexation of salaries and pensions could not reimburse the 300-percent increase in the prices of products and services weighing heavily on their household budgets. It was admitted unanimously that inflation got out of control beginning with the second half of 1993. As a matter of fact, a proportion of over three quarters of the 320-percent inflation registered in 1993 occurred during the second half of that year. By applying such measures, the state budget was partially salvaged, as the state income became higher. However, this was possible only by the unprecedented increase of prices that made the standard of living drop drastically and that impoverished large categories of the population.
