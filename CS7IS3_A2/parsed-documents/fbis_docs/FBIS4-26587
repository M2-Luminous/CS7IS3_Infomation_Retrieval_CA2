Earlier, the central government called a temporary halt to the operation of property rights exchanges for rectification. Meanwhile, fact-finding groups were sent by the state to local futures and property rights exchanges to collect information for making further decisions. Obviously, such measures are not intended to stifle the futures market or the trade in State enterprises' property. As a matter of fact, it is aimed at standardizing the operation of those exchanges and leading them to a healthy track. In the long run, the central government is encouraging futures development and trade in property rights. To open futures markets and property rights exchanges is a big step toward establishing a framework of the socialist market economy. It also shows China's determination to embrace a market economy. However, their development has been too hasty for the reforms. Local governments have been rushing headlong to set up exchanges. As a result, their operation very often fails to meet standard requirements. Nationally, there are more than 40 registered futures exchanges, over 500 brokerage firms, and 174 property rights exchanges. The central authorities have reaffirmed that the futures market and the trade of property rights are still in an experimental stage. It is necessary to mention that prudence is the key to their pace of development. Some local authorities are taking the wrong approach to futures and property rights exchanges. Some assume opening futures exchanges will boost their local coffers. Some tried to get rid of some money-losing state enterprises instead of trying to improve their management. Their view has fueled the overheated development of those exchanges. In addition, due to lack of relevant laws and regulations, profiteers take advantage of the loopholes to pocket illicit earnings in the fledgling markets. Some futures firms make money simply by swindling their customers. And some profiteers try to manipulate the selling price of state enterprises. Thus, profiteers are often the only beneficiaries while customers and the state lose out. As a Chinese saying goes, you cannot draw a circle and a square unless you have a compass and a ruler. The development of futures and trade of property rights will suffer setbacks unless they are placed under proper guidance. Relevant government departments are drafting regulations on the management of those exchanges. It is necessary and timely to lead these exchanges to a path of healthy growth.
