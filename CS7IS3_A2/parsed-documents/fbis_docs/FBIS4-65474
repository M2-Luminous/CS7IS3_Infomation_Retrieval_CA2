However, who benefits from this kind of mobilization? Answer: the prime minister, the three major parties, and the church. But, according to no logic does the country benefit at this time. With this note I will attempt, as briefly as possible, to support this position. First of all, the demonstrations on the Skopje problem benefit the leader [Andreas Papandreou] of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. Although he can see that making absolutely paramount the issue of the name [Macedonia], and insisting (in spite of intraparty pressures) on not accepting a hybrid name [Vardar Macedonia], has driven the country to unprecedented international isolation, he does not desire to finish his prime ministership in the same way as he began it: with a 180-degree turn similar to that which he made on the issue of the EEC and NATO. Seen from this vantage point, the mobilization in Salonica both reinforces his position in PASOK, and affords him yet another opportunity to avoid the bitter medicine of changing policy on the name issue--a change which must necessarily take place for us to get out of the dead end into which [Political Spring Party leader] Andonis Samaras and the leaders of the other two parties have lead our country, for clearly vote-getting reasons. Second, the three largest parties, which actively support this kind of populist mobilization, benefit by the demonstrations (in the short run, of course). Even if they do not manage to turn a popular upsurge into political capital for themselves, they at least avoid the possibility of being left outside the vote redistribution game at a time when, because of the nationalist upsurge, all things are in flux and everything is on the line. Thirdly, in an attempt to alter its marginal, almost exclusively ceremonial role in Greek society today, the church benefits by mass mobilizations through its active participation in the "national uprising." The church, which had already lost its autonomy from the middle of the last century (for reasons that I cannot explain here[.sup]1[/]) and was rendered an extension of public administration, finds in the Skopje question a unique opportunity to demonstrate that it is not just suited for baptisms, weddings, and funerals; that, its politicization aside (which has intesified in pace from the time of the dictatorship and afterward), it has a fundamental nonpartisan, patriotic role to play. So the prime minister, the three parties, and the church are the gainers--at least in the short run. The Greek people, however, who have never been apprised of the Skopje problem by means of an open, democratic dialog, are the big losers. They not only lost a unique opportunity to become the connecting link between the European Union and the Balkans, but were lead to unprecedented international isolation which, with mathematical precision, harms them economically and politically, because it eliminates the possibility for northern Greece in general, and Salonica specifically, to become the main pole for the development of the Balkans (something that would of course become the most substantive means of controlling the chauvinism of Skopje), and which pushes Skopje, especially after the embargo, into the embraces of Bulgaria and Turkey. Thus, we give Turkey a unique opportunity to increase its clout in the Balkans and in West Europe at a time when we have managed to be without any friends (except for Serbia, of course!). And while Turkey furiously strengthens its position, we expend all our energies, and divert all our attention to the clearly imaginary dangers contained in a "hybrid name" (which is the only democratic solution[.sup]2[/]). In other words we are concentrating on the Skopje flea, and ignoring the Turkish elephant--or rather, we are doing what we can to reinforce Turkey's position, and undermine our own, in an arena where Greece's interests and borders are truely at risk. Conclusion: the prime minister, the three largest parties, and the church--if they really desire what is good for the land--will have to do the following: a. The prime minister will make another 180-degree turn on the issue of the name, and will clearly declare that a hybrid name is a negotiable matter (e.g. we will accept a hybrid name in exchange for the three well-known conditions). b. The parties will cease putting, at such a critical moment, their party interests above the national interest. c. The church will fight for its autonomy from the system of state and party politics--something that will allow it to devote itself more to the cultural and religious problems of the modern Greeks, and less to the formation of the country's foreign policy.

The "maximalist" position (that is, our insistence on not allowing Skopje to use the term "Macedonia" and its "derivatives") is not possible, beneficial for the country, or democratic.
