Al-Ghaylan commended AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, saying that it was right when it its front-page headline on the eve of the "Cairo dialogue" said "Collapse of Dialogue Between Two Parties," as though it is reading the Yemeni war like an open book. Concerning what the southern delegation conveyed to the UN envoy, al-Ghaylan, who was Yemen's ambassador to Cairo when the war broke out, said: We stressed to Brahimi that the main mission is to discuss a cease-fire in compliance with Resolution 924, which stipulates two points: an immediate halt to the fighting and then engaging in negotiations without any conditions. When Brahimi called for dialogue he was seeking to achieve this. He said: But the brothers in the north said that the current dispute is within the framework of the Arab Republic of Yemen and thus a solution should be within this framework, and that the military committee should be within the same framework that existed before the war, or if it is to be expanded, this expansion should be on a limited scale by accepting the participation of both Syria and Morocco. He said that he and the UN envoy believe that there is no point in its [the northern delegation's] presence, and in addition there is the fact that the northern delegation to Cairo makes it a condition that negotiations be held within the framework of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. Ambassador al-Ghaylan revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the head of the northern delegation submitted a memorandum from Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah containing these points, saying that the north is willing to respond to the Security Council resolution within the partisan coalition framework that existed before the war. That is, a solution should be within the framework of the Republic of Yemen. He adds: The southern delegation's reply in this context was that the delegation came to Cairo to sincerely work to secure an immediate halt to the fighting. But it seems that the north has no desire to bring about an end to the fighting, and that the aim of their agreement to attend the meeting is to waste Brahimi's time so that his report would be delayed. Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil al-Ghaylan said that throughout his stay in Cairo Brahimi tried to persuade the north that the Arab Republic of Yemen question can be addressed at a later stage, and that this is not the time to address it, especially as he had called for the Cairo meeting to discuss two points: to draw up a mechanism to halt the fighting and to initiate a dialogue and negotiations. But the northern delegation did not listen to Brahimi and submitted Basindwah's memorandum to him. Concluding his statement, al-Ghaylan said: The outcome of the Cairo meeting is that the northern delegation refused to negotiate the terms for a cease-fire and the southern delegation agreed to halt the fighting first and then engage in a dialogue and negotiations.
