FR941206-0-00144 FR941206-0-00019 As described at proposal (56 FR 33496, July 22, 1991), the EPA decided in both the first and second phases to develop standards that control organic emissions as a class (as opposed to constituent-by-constituent). Implementation of these nationwide standards will achieve significant organic emission and cancer risk reductions. However, the EPA estimates the cancer risk at a few TSDF after implementation of these nationwide standards to remain at a level that is higher than the range of target risk levels for other promulgated RCRA standards (refer to section V.C of this preamble.) The third phase of this regulatory development program is to determine what other actions are necessary to attain the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n). To make this determination, the EPA is evaluating hazardous waste operations at those individual TSDF estimated to have MIR values greater than the historical RCRA target MIR levels. B. Public Participation in Rulemaking The EPA is promulgating today's final rule after careful consideration of public comments on the proposed rule (56 FR 33491, July 22, 1991). The preamble to the proposed rule discussed the availability of the background information document (BID) pertaining to the health effects of organic emissions from hazardous waste TSDF using tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. The EPA mailed copies of the Federal Register notice and the BID for the proposed rule to industry representatives, environmental groups, and State and Federal agencies. The EPA solicited comments from the public at the time of proposal and provided a 90-day comment period, from July 22, 1991 to October 21, 1991, for the public to prepare and submit written comments on the proposed rule. In addition, the EPA provided the opportunity for a public hearing to allow interested persons to present oral comments to the EPA concerning the proposed rule. However, no one requested that the EPA hold a public hearing on the proposed rule. The EPA did receive written comments from more than 80 companies, industrial trade associations, environmental groups, and State and Federal agencies. The BID for the final rule summarizes all of the comments on the proposed rule and presents the EPA's response to each of the comments. Section VI of this preamble presents responses to selected major comments. Following the EPA's review of public comments received on the proposed rule, the EPA revised the impact analysis used for its final determination regarding today's rulemaking. This analysis used additional TSDF industry data obtained by the EPA. The EPA provided an opportunity for public comment on the additional TSDF industry data used for the impact modeling revisions. A Federal Register Notice of Data Availability (57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) listed these additional data. The EPA also made the data available for public inspection at the EPA RCRA Docket Office. A 30-day comment period, from September 18, 1992 to October 19, 1992, provided the public the opportunity to comment on the additional data. The EPA received comments on the additional data from one industrial trade association. Section VI.B of this preamble presents a summary of these comments. C. Relationship to Other RCRA Standards 1. RCRA Rules for TSDF Owners and Operators Today's action establishes organic air emission control requirements for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and certain containers. Other types of waste management units operated at TSDF may be subject to these air emission control requirements as follows. a. Miscellaneous units. Under RCRA in 40 CFR 260.10, the EPA defines a ``miscellaneous unit'' as a hazardous waste management unit where waste is treated, stored, or disposed of that is not a container, tank, surface impoundment, wastepile, land treatment unit, landfill, incinerator, boiler, industrial furnace, underground injection well with appropriate technical standards under 40 CFR part 146, or a unit eligible for a research, development, and demonstration permit under 40 CFR 270.65. The EPA has established provisions under 40 CFR part 264, subpart X to allow TSDF owners and operators to obtain permits to operate miscellaneous units. The EPA permits miscellaneous units on a case-by-case basis with terms and provisions as needed to protect public health and the environment through generic performance standards specified in 40 CFR 264.601. Today's rule amends ยง264.601 to state that the air emission controls required by the standards under 40 CFR 264 subparts AA, BB, and CC are among the ``appropriate'' controls a permit writer may require for a miscellaneous unit ``to ensure protection of human health and the environment.'' Applicability of today's rule to miscellaneous units is discussed further in Section VII.B of this preamble. b. Land disposal restrictions. The RCRA LDR treatment standards under 40 CFR part 268 require TSDF owners and operators to treat hazardous waste to reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific constituents in the waste before the TSDF owner or operator can place the waste in a land disposal unit. Under certain conditions, the EPA may grant a TSDF owner or operator permission to land dispose a hazardous waste that does not meet the LDR treatment standards in a particular land treatment unit, landfill, wastepile, or surface impoundment. This action is referred to as the ``no migration'' variance. To obtain a ``no migration'' variance, a TSDF owner or operator must demonstrate in a petition to the EPA that, with a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous.
