Today's action is a proposal and comments are requested. The MWC regulations are complex, and the EPA expects to receive numerous comments on this proposal. The EPA has specifically requested comments on items fundamental to the proposal, including but not limited to the MACT floor, MACT performance levels, and a consideration of materials separation requirements for existing MWC's. The EPA seeks full public participation in arriving at its final decisions, and strongly encourages comments on all aspects of this proposal from all interested parties. Whenever applicable, full supporting data and detailed analyses should be submitted with all comments to allow the EPA to respond to the comments. Commenters wishing to submit proprietary information for consideration should clearly distinguish such information from other comments, and clearly label it ``Confidential Business Information.'' Submissions containing such proprietary information should be sent directly to the following address, and not to the public docket, to ensure that proprietary information is not inadvertently placed in the docket: Attention: Mr. Walter Stevenson, c/o Ms. Melva Toomer, U.S. EPA Confidential Business Manager, 411 W. Chapel Hill Street, Room 944, Durham, North Carolina 27701. Information covered by such a claim of confidentiality will be disclosed by the EPA only to the extent allowed and by the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. If no claim of confidentiality accompanies a submission when it is received by the EPA, it may be made available to the public without further notice to the commenter. Public Hearing . The public hearing will be held to provide interested parties an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed guidelines (see DATES for the hearing schedule). The public hearing will be held at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and will start at about 9 a.m. Persons wishing to present oral testimony at the public hearing should call Ms. Julia Latta at (919) 541&hyph;5578 at least 2 days in advance of the public hearing.
