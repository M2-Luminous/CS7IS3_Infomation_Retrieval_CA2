FR940610-1-00065 FR940610-1-00008 Corrective Action If it is indicated that the school food authority is not conducting NSMP accurately or properly applying ANSMP, if the school week's meals, as offered, do not comply with nutrition standards, or if the meal observation identified a significant number of meals that did not meet the definition of a reimbursable meal, the school food authority would be required to take appropriate corrective action to achieve compliance. However, at this time, no claim would be established if the failure to comply was not intentional. (Intentional violations are discussed later in this preamble.) Pursuant to section 16(b) of the CNA, 42 U.S.C. 1785(b), the Secretary of Agriculture is given authority to settle, adjust or waive any claims under both the NSLA or the CNA if to do so would serve the purposes of either Act. The Department recognizes that the transition to NSMP and ANSMP will not in every instance be completed without problems and unforeseen circumstances to be surmounted. The Department expects State agencies to act quickly to rectify any problems found and to monitor any corrective action undertaken. In the interests of facilitating the transition to NSMP/ANSMP, the Secretary is proposing to exercise his authority to settle, adjust and waive claims by not requiring State agencies to disallow payment or collect overpayments resulting from meals which do not meet the nutrition standards of the regulations as long as State agencies are satisfied that such deviations from the nutrition standards were not intentional and that the school food authority is working towards successful completion of a acceptable corrective action plan in a timely manner. The Department stresses that this proposal does not establish specific steps or time frames for corrective action. State agencies, as a result of their evaluation of the school food authority, are in the best position to establish corrective action goals and time frames, working in partnership with local school food authorities. The Department believes that State agencies and school food authorities need flexibility in developing a corrective action plan and is, therefore, providing such flexibility in this proposal. Further, in recognition of the fact that timely and effective corrective action is in the best interest of all, the Department intends to incorporate review of this area into its management evaluation activities at the State level. The Department would like to once again emphasize that, under this proposal, compliance with the updated nutrition standards is of paramount importance. First, corrective action will be required if a meal service does not meet the nutrition standards. The State agency cannot overlook these shortcomings and must ensure that the meal service is improved as stipulated in the corrective action plan. Secondly, the State will be required to monitor the school's corrective action efforts. In most cases, monitoring would include reviewing production records, menus and computer analyses submitted by the school food authority and providing any support indicated by such a review. When a school food authority refuses to make a good faith effort to comply with the terms of the corrective action plan, the State agency would be required to establish a claim. Exception to Claim Establishment Under this proposal, State agencies would require corrective action for meals not meeting the nutrition standards, but would receive reimbursement for those meals. This procedure represents a significant means of easing the transition to and operation of the updated nutrition standards. Section 8 of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1757, and section 4(b)(1)(D) of the CNA, 42 U.S.C. 1773 (b)(1)(D), clearly provide that reimbursement for meals served is available only for those meals that meet Program requirements. Further, section 12(g) of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1760(g), continues to provide for Federal criminal penalties for certain intentional Program violations under either the NSLA or the CNA. The Department is concerned that the corrective action provision not be construed by State agencies or school food authorities as an invitation to relax efforts to comply with the nutritional or administrative review requirements of §§210.10, 210.10a, 210.18 and 210.19. The institution of corrective action would not be a sufficient remedy by itself in an instance in which a State agency determined that school officials had intentionally failed to meet the nutrition standards required by NSMP. In these situations, while the State agency would initiate corrective action, it must also disallow claims for reimbursement for the substandard meals and, in very severe cases, consider referring the matter to the Department for criminal prosecution. While continued refusal to take corrective action could result in loss of Federal funding, this provision is not intended to be punitive when school food authorities are acting in good faith to comply with the nutrition standards. The Department is far more concerned about correcting these situations than it is with pursuing fiscal action. The Department's foremost goal is to ensure that children are provided with the most nutritious meals possible. Consequently, the emphasis in this process is on corrective action and technical assistance. If school food authorities implement appropriate corrective action and make satisfactory progress toward compliance, no fiscal action would be required. Streamlined Administration The Department is also proposing to streamline program administration by allowing State agencies and school food authorities flexibility in three important areas. The first provision would extend the Coordinated Review Effort (CRE) review cycle from 4 to 5 years. The Department's experience with CRE indicates that a one-year extension in the cycle would not adversely affect accountability, but it would result in a 20 percent decrease in the number of reviews currently conducted in any given year. While the exact reduction in burden would vary from State to State, the Department expects this decrease would provide the States with additional flexibility to enable them to continue to improve school meals. Section 210.18(c) is proposed to be amended to include this change.
