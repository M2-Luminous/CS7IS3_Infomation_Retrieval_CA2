The party will set a deadline for Cardoso. If the candidate does not "take off," the party will try to sponsor the candidacy of former President Jose Sarney, who would be running for the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. Sarney believes that if the PMDB chooses Orestes Quercia it will be committing "electoral suicide." After the last Datafolha poll on 6 May -- which showed that Sarney's popularity was almost at the same level of that of Cardoso -- Sarney changed his routine as ex-president into that of a candidate on campaign. There is an atmosphere of rebellion within the PFL. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes believes Cardoso has thus far "played badly" and "must begin talking about starvation and unemployment." The PSDB leadership is betting on Cardoso's recovery. This week he will begin touring the country.
