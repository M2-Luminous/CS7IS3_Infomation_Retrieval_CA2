D.: "Olivetti Prepares Multimedia Line"] [Text] Olivetti plans to take advantage of the IT Forum show to launch a line of multimedia PC's designed primarily for the general consumer market, as well as a communicating PC equipped with an integrated videoconferencing system. Two principal models of the "Domus Life" line will be on the market during the first quarter of 1994, in ready-to-use configurations. The PCS Television integrates a video card and tuner, and includes loudspeakers. The user can thus view television on the entire screen or in a Windows window, but can also capture images and construct video montages with the aid of the software provided. The PCS Educator offers a 16-bit Pro Audio Spectrum sound card, a single-speed multisession CD-ROM reader, loudspeakers, and a number of applications on CD-ROM. After a good takeoff in low-priced PC's for the mass market, but devoid of configurations aimed at the general public, Olivetti is supplementing its line with more sophisticated products capable of providing a real dimension of entertainment and education. Vis-a-vis Compaq and IBM, therefore, Olivetti's product line will now include, on the one hand, cheaper machines, and on the other, more complete and innovative models.
