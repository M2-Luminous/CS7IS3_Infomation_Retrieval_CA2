This decision, which was made around 4 PM [1400 GMT] during an audience in the Villa Vauban [residence of the Grand Duke], had been preceded in the morning and in the afternoon by separate consultative discussions between the Grand Duke and the party chairmen Ben Fayot (LSAP) [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg], Charles Goerens (DP) [Democratic Party], and Robert Mehlen (ADR) [Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], and with Jup Weber (GLEI-GAP) [Green Ecologist Initiative List/The Green Alternative]. This very afternoon Jacques Santer is holding exploratory talks first with the DP and then with the LSAP. Early this evening he will then convene the expanded CSV [Christian Social People's Party] national council in the metropolitan "Carrefour" (Convict Center) in order to decide which of the two parties is to be invited to enter into coalition negotiations. On Friday [17 June], the day after tomorrow, the Prime Minister will submit an interim report on the development to the Grand Duke, after which the actual coalition negotiations could start as early as Saturday. Despite certain timetable obligations on the part of various government members, these could be pushed ahead swiftly and brought to a conclusion towards the middle of July. [passage omitted]
