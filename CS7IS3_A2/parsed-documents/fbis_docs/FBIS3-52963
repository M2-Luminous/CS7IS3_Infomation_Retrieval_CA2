We are faithful and sincere in our stand on every Arab issue. These remarks were made when his excellency received the fighter members of the General Command of the Armed Forces and senior military commanders here today. They came to extend congratulations to him on the 73d anniversary of the establishment of the Iraqi Army. His excellency added: You must not commit historic mistakes. Everything can be amended, except history. On this occasion, President Saddam Husayn addressed fighters: the Americans are always deluded. They were deluded during their 30-state aggression, they were deluded in Somalia, and will be deluded again. This is because not only will the evil-minded suffer the consequences of his evil deeds, but also the conceited one. If such an individual is both evil-minded and conceited, he will inevitably suffer the consequences. His excellency said: Our plans were to be in the southern region of Iraq and to lure the enemy troops into urban Iraqi areas and cities so that we could put them through the worst. However, what happened was that the enemy did not enter our territory. Besides, some people did not give themselves and their people the chance to play this role. It is true that the enemy did not enter Iraq as we had planned for it, but a clash was possible. In such a case, it would have been possible to drag the enemy into the death traps that we had planned for it. At that time, the Iranians did their known misdeed, and the evil ones rallied around the treacherous Iranian act. Consequently, fires broke out in most areas in Iraq. His excellency said: The United States announced a unilateral cease-fire. I am saying the United States because it is actually the party that assembled the evil gathering along with its evil supporters, who bear Arab nationalities. It is the party that created that momentous evil gathering with its known intentions to commit its misdeed. President Saddam Husayn said: At that time, I recall, they said that we should confirm the cease-fire, which they announced unconditionally and unilaterally, except for self-defense if they were attacked by the Iraqis. We said: Okay, let us do that. They said: Send your envoys to a U.S. ship, the name of which I cannot remember. It was anchored in the Arabian Gulf. His excellency went on: These contacts were between diplomats. The idea was to spare military personnel the hassle of dealing with these details, in order to free them for their goals. The Foreign Ministry sent me a memorandum to the effect that the Americans asked the then Soviets, or rather ordered the then Soviets, to tell us through their foreign minister that the Americans want Iraqi military personnel who represented the Iraqi side against 28 armies to report to such-and-such a vessel in the Gulf. They used such language as to show that they were not making a suggestion to an equal but sending us a summons. I believe they specified the position of the ship. The Americans said they would arrange for our military personnel's transport to the ship. Here I want to remind them of a historic error, which they ought to have not made. His excellency added: At that time, through which all of you lived, and, therefore, remember, the state of our domestic front was the most difficult. As for our external front, the situation was not that difficult. They were foreigners with whom we were engaged in battle. We were not too concerned about whether they had more weapons than we did. What really disturbed us was to see an overlap of ditches and confusion between people who call themselves Iraqis but take orders from foreigners and [words indistinct] in the pain we felt in our hearts. We were confronted with such a memorandum, I mean the American asking us to report to them, and the Americans always submit to illusions. At that time, the Americans thought that an opportunity presented itself for them to make us commit a historic error. Just imagine Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad, operations assistant for the Army chief of staff, and Staff Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud, commander of the 3d Corps, who had the rank of major general then, and other military comrades and staff officers, appearing on American television screens... Imagine military footage showing your military comrades on their way to the American ship to conduct negotiations with the Americans. For our part, we said the negotiations will not take place on an American ship. I said: You have to choose between two sites where the negotiations may be held -- either in the Safwan region at the (?al-Julaydah) Airport or at any other point along the Iraqi-Saudi border. In the end, they settled for one of the two places. His excellency added: When they chose the place, it met with our approval. Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad, along with Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud and other staff officers, went there. When they were about to go into the tent where the negotiations were to be held, they were surprised... His excellency added: Let us pause here. Before Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad went to meet with the enemies, we contacted him and told him: You are the victors. I told the messenger who carried the message: Give my greetings to Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad and to all the comrades in the General Command. I think that Staff Gen. Husayn Rashid was the Army chief of staff and that 'Ali Hasan al-Majid was at the time engaged on the battlefield. Since there was no means to get in touch with you, I told the carrier of the message to tell our comrades that they are the victors. President Saddam Husayn went on: I have laid emphasis on this aspect for psychological reasons. I know how they think, but I chose to emphasize this point in case they might think that victory was not theirs or that victory was not as it should have been. Of course, victory as one plans and wishes it to be is one thing, and victory in the historical sense, which I mean here, is another. It was a third world war. Iraq was on one side and the world, save what God wished, was on the other. When I say the world, I mean the political leaders and administrations. I do not mean the peoples, even those who were made to believe that they were fighting for a good cause. I told him to stress that Iraq was the victor, that the Army of Iraq achieved victory, and that our comrade leaders who will go now to negotiate with the enemy have achieved victory. They will see how the enemy will bow their heads down, if they have any shame left as military commanders. When the representatives of 28 armies, three of which are superpowers, do not feel their defeat when the representatives of one army sit with them at the same table, then those who still cherish some of the meanings of the military code -- which basically stress manliness and knighthood -- will be ashamed of themselves, even if they have no humanitarian traits left. Those people will feel that they are drowning in shame as they sit on those chairs to represent 28 armies in the face of a single army. All these well-known countries, and others who were not probably revealed properly, stood in the face of one country, which is known in terms of its size, population, economy, industry, and agriculture. He added: Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad, who is known, along with his comrades, for sound military conduct, went to meet them. It should have been very clear to the enemy that Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan and his comrades were the victors. When he and his comrades arrived at the door of the tent, he was surprised when they asked him to take off his weapon before entering the negotiating tent. He replied: I will not take off my weapon before the other party removes its weapon. Who will speak on behalf of the 28 armies? Schwarzkopf answered him in apparent confusion, as Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan told me: I represent them. He said: Then take off your weapon. And he did. The came the turn of Staff Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud, who asked who the second man was. He was told that the man was Sultan. But how great a difference is there between Sultan and Sultan. They meant Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan, since the West calls a person by the name of his father or his title. So this Sultan was the second person who represents the state of his majesty. He told them: Tell Khalid Bin-Sultan to throw his weapon away before the second man in the Iraqi delegation throws his weapon away. Schwarzkopf called Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan and asked his men to send quickly for him. Then Khalid Bin-Sultan came hurriedly, and Schwarzkopf asked him to take his weapon off, even though he is a prince. So he did. Afterward, Staff Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud entered without his weapon. His excellency said: At that time, with its well-known atmosphere, I told them that the minutes of the meeting should be written down and officially signed, in addition to recording it on an audio tape. We are saying this in order that you pay attention to the details that may seem very trivial and may have no historical significance. We, however, did not forget to mention these details despite those circumstances. The comrades requested that the minutes of the meeting be recorded, and they received a copy of the recording. Speaking of this issue, I would like you to make 200 more copies, so there will not be a single copy. I do not know whether they wrote down official minutes or whether they were content with this recording. Of course, this is apart from the cease-fire minutes, which were also written down and signed. President Saddam Husayn added: Suppose that we now show two pictures of our comrades while heading for the U.S. ship, assuming that the historic mistake was actually made. Some may say that there is no harm in heading for this ship. They may also wonder: Why do you want to complicate the issue of holding that meeting aboard a ship or elsewhere? We, however, say: Such an issue is greatly significant and may have an impact for hundreds of years, if not for thousands of years. If we now show your children two pictures on the television screen, one having our own description, and the other having the description the enemy wanted at the very beginning, what impact would each of the two pictures have on the people's psychological makeup? I believe that this is understood. His excellency continued: Regrettably, among the painful matters in Arab politics is the fact that when an Arab ruler wants to resolve an issue, he asks the whole world to join him in signing a humiliating document. All right, you are in a weak position on a certain issue, and you decided to take a weak position. But you should let others be in a strong position as a guarantee for you if you later plan to retreat from this weak position and take a strong position, at which time you will find someone who will protect you, shelter you, back you, and understand you. Why does such a ruler want everyone to take the same position as his own position whenever he adopts a weak position? President Saddam Husayn pointed out that [former Egyptian President] al-Sadat used to say: Normalize relations with Israel. However, would it not have been better for al-Sadat, in the first place, to await what would be really achieved before urging others to adopt his position? Wait, brother, and see what will happen, what results your conduct achieves, and see whether there is any Arab who has been convinced of normalizing relations. Wait, at least to see where this path will take you, and what result this conduct achieves. It is not important if others have a different opinion; what is really important is whether you actually want to burn your bridges. They used to say loudly: Normalize relations with Israel, adopt this specific position. His excellency said: Some people just want an excuse to do what they want to do. They say that some people, whom they do not want to name, are moving very fast, running. But why do you run? Wait for some time to pass, wait for six months or a year. Are you so impatient that a period of a few months is too long for you? Responsible people should withstand pressure for several years for the sake of their cause. A responsible man should remain steadfast even if a dagger is lodged in his flesh. He must stand this pressure for five years while carrying out his duties, and must behave normally. Only after this can he remove the dagger. Why the hurry? They look as if they are awaiting the opportunity or are feeding on a single grain of wheat, as the saying goes. [sentence as received] His excellency said: They talk too much when they discuss Arab nationalism. They talk so much that they make us sleepy. They talk too much about history but when it comes to action, they shrink to the point of nothingness, why? They can become great. If someone wants to become great in their principles we will all support and follow him even if the Iraqis blame us. All we want is for him to raise his standards a little. Addressing the commanders, the president said: O comrades, make mistakes but may God lead you away from mistakes. Only God is free of errors. You cam make mistakes in anything but you must not make mistakes in history because anything can be corrected except history. If the ship's story materialized, would such a mistake be corrected? To correct this mistake would have required us to wage a second war with America so that we could bring them to negotiate with us on our own ship, otherwise the mistake of the first ship would not be forgotten but would remain so that each one of your children, when he goes to school with his pen and papers, would see this ship popping up between the lines. His excellency said: If they made Sultan Hashim Ahmad lay down his gun without him making them lay down theirs too, his gun would remain on the face of all the Iraqis and the Americans would show it on every occasion in their films. The Americans have not produced any such films so far, why? Aren't they the movie makers? They have not produced any film for some time because they have nothing to show. Wherever they look they face basic problems. Would they show their guided bombs hitting a building to bring it down it or a factory to destroy? President Saddam Husayn added: Thus, they could not show a single U.S. soldier facing an Iraqi soldier. They will not show this, nor will they show how the U.S. tanks faced the Iraqi tanks. Let them show the fighting against the Republican Guard in the south or the fighting that took place against the isolated heroes who fought them at Kuwait airport. A British commander appeared on the British television. He was fair when he said: If I were the commander of these fighters, I would be proud of them. During the meeting, his excellency reviewed the international positions, the circumstances that Iraq experienced during the glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah battle and the Mother of Battles, and Iraq's rejection of dishonest bargaining. He also reviewed Iraq's adherence to the friendship with the rulers of the former Soviet Union, who betrayed this friendship in the Mother of Battles and harmed it greatly in the al-Qadisiyah battle. His excellency recalled Iraq's rejection of the continued U.S. attempts to acquire the Soviet T-72 tank in return for supplying us with a package of shells and cannons, which we would pay for. The aim was to dismantle and examine the Soviet tank, so they could see it from the inside and become acquainted with it. President Saddam Husayn said: If we now go and sit with the Russians, who are the origin and base of the great [former] Soviet Union, we will not be ashamed because our positions can only raise the head of mankind high, knowing that those who are ruling Russia now are not the same as those who ruled the Soviet Union and who betrayed the friendship in the Mother of Battles. Concluding his speech, President Saddam Husayn said: In order not to make mistakes in historical issues when we face them, we should pause and think several times. Everyone of us should be ready to offer sacrifices, and we all should cooperate in order not to commit a historic mistake. Participating in the reception ceremony and in extending the congratulations were fighter Staff General 'Izzat Ibrahim, deputy commander in chief of the Armed Forces; fighter Staff General 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, defense minister; Hatim Hamdan al-'Azzawi, head of the Presidential Office; fighter Staff Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil Hasan, industry and minerals minister; and fighter Staff General 'Abd-al-Jabbar Shanshal, minister of state for military affairs.
