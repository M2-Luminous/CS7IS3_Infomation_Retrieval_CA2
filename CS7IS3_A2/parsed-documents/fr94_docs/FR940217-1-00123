Drafting Information The principal person involved in drafting this document is Ms. Jacqueline L. Sullivan, Project Counsel and Project Manager. Background and Purpose MARPOL 73/78 The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. ) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances. Regulation 26 The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above and every other ship of 400 gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by its flag state. This requirement entered into force for party states, including the United States, on April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force on April 4, 1995, for existing ships. The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis of this proposal.
