When one walks through the three iron gates, one finds that the active atmosphere inside the prison does not coincide with high walls, electric barbed-wire network, dark and worn prison cells: To the accompaniment of roaring motors, prisoners are found sewing, processing shirts; on the basketball court, prisoners in gray prison uniforms dash to and fro, contending for the ball; now and then, we see squads of prisoners moving along in formation. This is the Shanghai Municipal Prison, and its popular name has been "The Tilanqiao [the Basket Bridge 2251 4691 2890] Prison," which was first built in 1901. This offspring of colonialist rule over China was said in those days to be "the largest prison in the Far East." Over the years, it has come under the jurisdiction of Britain, Japan, the Wang Ching-wei Collaborationist Government, and the Kuomintang Government. In these prison cells were held such well-known figures as Zhang Tai-yan, Zou Yong, Ren Bishi, and Zhang Aiping. One finds such questions as "Who are you? What is this place? What are you doing here?" written everywhere on the prison walls. According to Warden Mai Linhua's briefings, most of the inmates held here are felons, serving prison sentences of 10 years or more. They are put in different cells, and they undergo different kinds of education and transformation according to their different inclinations, based on whether their offenses involve property, sex or violence. The inmates work eight hours each day; in the evening, they take part in cultural or technical studies. This reporter visits the rubber cell, the "pavilion for trouble- makers," and the "indoor execution ground," which were set up in the old days. They remind him of a commentary carried in "DONGFANG ZAZHI" [Oriental Journal], which was published in those years. The commentary read: "The maltreatment of inmates in the prison run by Westerners in Shanghai is the talk of the town. In recent years, cases of inmates' dying in prison have been numerous, and Chinese residents turn pale, even at the mention of the prison." Today, the inmates here manage their own affairs to a great extent. A committee for activists in transformation through labor is set up in every unit which is responsible for the inmates' study, food, and labor, and for safeguarding prison rules, regulations, and discipline. The committee is re-elected every year, and those found ineligible are removed. An assessment of each inmate is conducted at the end of each quarter, and is treated differently according to his/her behavior. In 1993, 966 inmates were granted commutation of sentence or parole. On each floor of cells, this reporter finds a "letterbox for procuratorial personnel," as well as a "letterbox for the Warden." This reporter is told that inmates may conduct accusations or appeals via the first letterbox so as to protect their own legitimate rights and interests. This letterbox can be opened only by the cadre from the procuratorial organization who is stationed in the prison. Through the second letterbox, inmates may offer opinions and suggestions on prison management and labor transformation. Each inmate spends 62 yuan on meals every month. Those who overfulfill their production quotas are given bonuses. In recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Prison has prepared its cafeteria in a scientific way, based on the general diseases surfacing among the inmates during their imprisonment. The cafeteria categorizes its meals into the following categories: regular, nutritious, elderly, minority nationality, medical treatment through diet, and birthday celebration. The prison authorities conduct scientific analysis of the menu each week, and in the following week, they improve certain dishes found to be less nourishing. Cultural and sports activities behind the iron bars are rich and colorful. There is a radio station, a television station, and a transformation-through-labor paper, in addition to a poetry society, a fashion-show team, and an artistic performance troupe. A large sports meet is held every three years, a theatrical festival every two years, and a fine arts exhibition each year. Bridge tournaments and flower and book exhibitions are held often. Owing to limited conditions, this classic prison has not gone through any significant transformation or expansion, and the 3.3 square meters floor space of each cell in the British design remains intact. To meet the needs of the situation, Shanghai Municipality has built a high-standard prison in suburban Qingpu. Qingpu Prison is one of the most modern prisons in China today, and will become a showcase for China in the transformation of criminals.
