According to local officials, Shenyang, an old industrial center, has got 8,000 rural and township enterprises. Last year, these enterprises created 20 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of output, accounting for one third of the city's total industrial output value. About 3,000 out of the 8,000 rural enterprises have been transformed into joint-stock ones, and funds from shares of farmers- turned employees have made up some 500 million yuan. The city began trial transformation of designated rural and township enterprises into joint-stock ones in 1985 and gained some positive experience. Last year, the city extended the transformation to the whole city and saw an emergence of 2,000 joint-stock firms in the city's rural areas. Rural enterprises run under a joint-stock system not only help enhance the sense of responsibility of workers, but also help stop up outside interference, said the officials, adding that the joint-stock system is an effective way to vitalize management and to build a modern enterprise system in rural enterprises.
