Good evening, Mr. Silajdzic. We have seen what the humanitarian situation in our country is like. [passage omitted] News has reached us from Croatia on the announcement of some kind of military intervention by the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warns that, as he puts it, the continued offensive by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia could call into question the continuation of the peace negotiations scheduled for 18 January. What do you think about that? [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, the Croatian Army has already been intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is well known to us and to international circles, to those who are interested in the truth. The Croatian Army is indeed present in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in central Bosnia. The Croatian armed forces, including people and resources, have been present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a long time. But even so, we are surprised by the openness of Croatian diplomacy regarding the preparations for the new intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They want to achieve two [as heard] things: They want to justify the intervention already under way, they want to justify possible future actions, and they want to distract the attention of the world public from the notorious fact that the Croatian extremists, with the help of some circles from Croatia and the Croatian Army, have committed a genocide, particularly in Herzegovina, starting in Prozor, against the Bosnian [word indistinct] population. This is an attempt to divert the world public's attention from that fact and from the fact that Croatia is intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think that [word indistinct] intervention....[pauses] I have information about a large-scale mobilization, that it will certainly not allow the preace process [words indistinct]. [Announcer] What is your message for those who are watching or listening to our program who are on the threshold of a new war year in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is less than four hours away? [Silajdzic] A new year is usually connected with wishes and greetings. My wish is for us to have peace next year, and I would like to extend greetings to all of you for all the achievements. I think that we have achieved a miracle and that we are achieving a miracle which the whole world is talking about. Greetings especially to our [word indistinct] who are in their (?trenches) this evening defending their country for their children and for all of us against the well armed enemy who keeps getting help, and who has enjoyed the support of [words indistinct] so far. The world community has intervened in Bosnia-Herzegovina in favor of the aggressor. The world community has failed to fulfill its promise as far as the victim is concerned and we are rightly asking ourselves, or better still we are asking those who make decisions in the world community: What right have they not to allow us to defend ourselves? To all the others in these countries we wish peace and a year of [word indistinct]. [passage omitted: greetings to families who lost their nearest and dearest; Silajdzic says it is an honor to die for one's country; mentions five victims of Sarajevo shelling today] To all in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which there will always be room for everyone, as before -- regardless of nationality and religion -- and to those outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, I wish peace above all.
