[passage omitted] Our correspondent Vladimir Solovyev spoke to Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin: [Begin recording] [Solovyev] Vitaliy Ivanovich, did Moscow know about the forthcoming airstrikes against Serb positions? [Churkin] All last week we were following closely the situation around Gorazde, especially when it became aggravated. But in the crucial hours we did not know about any aggravation. The UN people explain this by the fact that everything happened very quickly. Two hours passed between General Rose's first warning that he was going to ask for air support and the actual air strikes. In this situation we have certain complaints about UN people, and Bosnian Serbs, for that matter, because when in the last few days we drew their attention to the impermissible, very dangerous and critical aggravation of the situation, their response was rather slack, they kept saying that nothing special was going to happen there and that they did not have any military plans for Gorazde. I think that if Russia had been invited to tackle this crisis spot at the fateful moment, we could have directed the events in a different channel. [end recording] [passage omitted]
