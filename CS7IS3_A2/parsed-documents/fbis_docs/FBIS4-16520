On April 21, the party will start collecting signatures under a petition demanding a referendum to adopt a constitutional law dealing with illegal privatization, devaluated savings and company shares, as well as violations of the law. The party's board made the decision at its meeting Wednesday [13 April]. MP Gediminas Vagnorius, chairman of the board, said he is certain that such a law will be adopted. The conservatives expect the law to restore order in the process of state property privatization, to compensate people's savings, to stop artificial bankruptcies and the downfall of production, as well as to enhance law and order. 300,000 signatures are necessary for the parliament to announce a referendum. The conservatives intend to collect signatures for two months and expect the referendum to be held in September. At a press conference Thursday, Vagnorius said other questions may be included in the referendum, as well, but he declined to specify any of them. In Vagnorius' words, the property "privatized without privatization" is worth some 8 to 10 billion lits.
