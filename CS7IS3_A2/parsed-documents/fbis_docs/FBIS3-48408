In his address Lt. Gen. Tin U cited and explained Prime Minister Senior General Than Shwe's directive and guideline on administrative mechanism in detail. He said responsible personnel should not perform their jobs as usual during the revolutionary period in which the old system and era are being dismantled and a new system and era are being built in the country. Responsible personnel have to exert more effort in order to carry out their work and responsibilities with sharp and innovative minds, and with diligence and perseverance. He continued that the dignity of the people and the nation will be affected if Yangon City becomes dirty and there is an increase in robbery, muggings, pickpocket incidences, and other illegal activities. All of these activities run counter to the character of the city and result if there is a breakdown in the rule of law. That is why Yangon is being renovated from all sides to retain the character of the city. Moreover, it is very important to have discipline, to observe laws, and to establish local tranquillity effectively and efficiently. He also said there is a serious need for state employees from various public service organizations to understand the political situation during the change of system and era. They must also understand that they should use their authority, bestowed on them by the state, in a proper way and not to abuse their power. [passage omitted on objectives of law and order restoration council in various regions]. He continued that the SLORC will effectively prevent and defend any form of action that can cause the disappearance of rule of law and that will allow anarchy to prevail in the country. Law and order restoration councils have to take a leading role to implement local ty/ty and ensure the prevalence of rule of law in the respective regions. All public service organizations have to cooperate and work together to the benefit of regions and localities. He added that there is need to take effective action against those public service organizations which do not cooperate with others. The law and order restoration councils at ward level are basic administrative organizations; therefore, these councils should be supervised with the help of ward leaders in order to carry out their work honestly, bravely, and without corruption. He said the state administrative mechanism must be effective and efficient to establish a peaceful and modern country. It is also very important for the administrative mechanism to become an instrument which can support the all-around development of the country. He noted that it does not matter how good the systems and ideas to be practiced are if people disobey the law and have no discipline. This results in a lack of development for the country and the country then will face the greater danger of being wiped from the world map. He said the SLORC, for the long-term benefit of the state, is taking effective action against criminal acts that can destroy local ty/ty. He also warned that effective action will taken against public service personnel, who conduct themselves badly, and without any discrimination. In conclusion, he said various levels of law and order restoration councils in the respective regions have to take a leading role and supervise their areas bravely and properly for the development of the country and for peace and stability. He said the departments have to coordinate and cooperate amongst each other without employing discrimination as they carry out their responsibilities. He said responsible personnel have to disclose the names of those who take bribes from criminals and take effective action against them. He also reminded responsible personnel not to punish innocent people by mistake when handing down sentences to prevent the crimes. He urged responsible personnel to work hard to become a person who is respected by the people. He also told them to avoid accepting all gifts and bribes. [passage omitted on similar speeches by Lt.
