This new Zionist crime is a natural corollary of the capitulatory agreement signed by 'Arafat with the Zionists in Oslo and Cairo and a consequence of the policies of relinquishment and capitulation pursued by 'Arafat and his deviationist methods. We promise our people to remain faithful to our cause and national struggle and the martyrs' blood until all Palestinian territory is liberated.
