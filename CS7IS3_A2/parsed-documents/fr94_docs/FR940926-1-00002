Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. for further information contact: Tracy E. Spencer, (202) 606&hyph;0830, or fax (202) 606&hyph;2329. supplementary information: This proposal is the second step in OPM's program to simplify temporary hiring authorities and ensure their appropriate use. Regulations were proposed on February 1, 1994, (59 FR 4601) to set a uniform service limit for temporary appointments in both the competitive and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension. The regulations now proposed would revise and consolidate paragraphs (i) and (m) of ยง213.3102, which both cover temporary, intermittent, and seasonal employment in the excepted service. The revision would eliminate overlapping and obsolete appointing authorities. In July 1993, OPM advised all agencies that use Schedule A authorities which were established specifically for temporary or seasonal employment that, if they wished to retain the authorities, they would need to justify why examining for the positions is impracticable. Our intent was to identify the situations where excepted service hiring is appropriate and to replace individual agencies' authorities with a Governmentwide authority that could be used by any agency in those situations. However, agencies reported only one situation that would have general applicability and one that may have general applicability. The rest are so agency-specific that creation of a Governmentwide authority would serve no practical purpose. Temporary and less-than-full-time hiring in remote locations. Several agencies need to hire short-term or supplemental staff, often on short notice, in locations that are remote or isolated from a population center. Examining for these jobs is impracticable when: Only residents of the immediate area can be expected to reach the work site whenever they are needed; the amount of employment involved would not encourage outside applicants to move to the isolated area; and staff from an OPM or agency examining office could not readily reach the location to administer tests or conduct recruiting. We propose to establish a Schedule A authority that would define ``remote/isolated location'' and would limit excepted employment to 1,040 working hours in a service year. Any agency could use the authority, without prior OPM approval, for jobs that meet the conditions set out in the regulation. Urgent, short-term hiring needs. OPM is abolishing the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), as recommended by the National Performance Review. OPM has granted certain authorities to agencies through the FPM that are not specifically reflected in regulations. One of those authorities (set out in section 2&hyph;9 of FPM Chapter 316) allows agencies to make temporary appointments not to exceed 30 days and to extend those appointments for no more than 30 additional days without regard to normal appointment procedures. Unless that authority is incorporated in a regulation, it will be lost when FPM Chapter 316 is abolished in December 1994. We believe the special need authority serves a valid purpose and should be continued as an excepted service appointing authority. (Competitive requirements have never applied to special need appointments.) Service limits and conditions for use of the current special need authority would remain the same. The new Schedule A authority would be available for use by any agency without prior OPM approval. Fellowships and related programs. Three agencies suggested creation of a Governmentwide authority covering post-doctoral fellowships, internships, and similar programs designed to increase the pool of candidates in a particular specialty for all employers, not just the Federal Government. On May 13, 1994, we published proposed regulations that would create a consolidated authority for employment of students. However, several agencies have internship or fellowship programs that provide professional experience to individuals who have completed their formal education. We agree that a consolidated authority for those appointments would be appropriate. We expect to consider consolidation of most Schedule A and B appointing authorities_not only those covering temporary hiring_and may propose creation of a fellowship authority. In the meantime, however, we are not sure that such an authority should be restricted to temporary employment. Many appointments under existing programs are made for periods longer than 1 year. Consequently, we have not included a specific provision for internship or fellowship appointments in the proposed authority for temporary Schedule A appointments. We welcome your comments on this issue, however, and will add such a provision if there is sufficient interest. If there is not enough interest to justify a Governmentwide authority, we would entertain requests for single-agency exceptions from agencies wishing to establish temporary fellowship programs.
