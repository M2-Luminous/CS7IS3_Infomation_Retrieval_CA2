Industrial plants will also be relocated to restricted areas. Minister Sarwono was speaking at a coordinated meeting on environment and water polllution, which was chaired by Hartarto, coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs, on Pulau [Island] Air, near Jakarta recently. He said that the government will phase out the operational permits of pulp and paper companies that use chlorine, mercury, and sulphur in their productions. The government will also prohibit new investment in projects that are not environment-friendly. It is understandable that participants focussed their attention on ways to overcome the environmental impacts of toxic waste throughout the meeting. This is in line with the post-Uruguay Round talks on exports strategy, whereby products are highly competititive in the world market. Indonesian manufacturers are required to act together on environmental protection because the environment has become an important economic asset. They have to assure consumers in the developed countries that they are serious about dealing with environmental issues, otherwise their export products will be rejected by these countries. Indonesian exporters should pay serious attention to the demands of the world market for more environmentally-friendly products to take advantage of the new GATT rules on market access signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, last April. At the meeting, it was also mentioned that at least 51 percent of Indonesia's industrial products are targeted for countries that apply eco-labelling rules to their imports. Actually, Indonesian exporters can request the office of the minister of state for the environment to eco-label their products. Yet, to date not even one exporter has asked for his products to be inspected. We admit that all this while even without the eco-labelling rules being observed, some products were able to be exported; however, sooner or later their international competitiveness will decline. Indonesia's products are exported mostly to EC member countries, which are calling for the application of the eco-labelling rules on products sold to them. The pressures not only come from the importing countries, but also from consumers who are environmentally aware. We have to bear in mind that the manufacturers' commitment to environmental awareness is linked to the export of their products on the international market, otherwise their competitiveness could not be maintained. On the other hand, the closure of existing industries and the prohibition of new investment projects will decrease employment opportunities in the country. This situation will worsen social disparities because the manpower growth rate is higher than that of the growth rate of job opportunities. Can the restriction and closure of industries that produce toxic wastes be the only alternative to comply with the world trade regulations or are there any other alternatives? Indonesia should study the facts on production technology from other pulp and paper manufacturing countries that have stopped using chlorine in their productions. The papers that are manufactured from pulps contain chloride, causing hazards to health when they are used for wrapping up food. Waste water from the pulp and paper industries reaches danger level when it contains over 1.5 kilograms of chloride per ton. However, it is impossible to say that waste water from all industrial plants is free from chlorine because industries that produce toxic waste do exist. A plastics plant, for example, cannot replace the chlorine in its manufacturing process. When these industrial plants are equipped with water treatment [preceding two words in English] facilities, it is possible to neutralize the environmental impact of dangerous toxic waste. Now the only problem left to be looked into is the system of waste disposal, or how the toxic waste is being handled, so that it will not endanger the surrounding area. To cite an example, the construction of a paper factory in North Sumatera turned into a political issue because the local residents and the owners of the factory could not reach a common settlement on the method of waste disposal. It will take some time before the government can impose a law on all industries prohibiting them from using any toxic material, and this has to be implemented in stages. The government cannot force industrial plants to stop using the dangerous chemicals in their production within a short time because this will create a distortion in the country's industrial policy. Now that the government has shown its committment to coupling trade with the environment, obviously it will require wise and rational measures to cope with the circumstances so that industrial development in the country will not be jeopardized. The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) is expected to be more selective when issuing operational permits to companies or industries by taking into consideration the possibility that they may pollute the environment, the use of dangerous raw material in their productions, the type of machinery to be used, and the type of goods to be produced. In this way, industries that are hazardous to the environment will be cut out.
