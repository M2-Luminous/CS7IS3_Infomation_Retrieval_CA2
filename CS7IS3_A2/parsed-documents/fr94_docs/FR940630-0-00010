FR940630-0-00010 FR940630-0-00004 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA is aware that the subject water heaters and coffee makers are installed in various airplanes. There are approximately 300 of these airplanes in the worldwide fleet, the FAA estimates that 200 airplanes are of U.S. registry. It will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. (There are approximately 4 water heaters and/or coffee makers installed on each airplane.) The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $22,000, or $110 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;14&hyph;03‚ê£Nordskog Industries, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;8955. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;01&hyph;AD. Applicability: Nordskog water heaters and coffee makers, as listed in Nordskog Industries, Inc., Service Bulletin SB&hyph;93&hyph;35, dated October 21, 1993; as installed in, but not limited to, Boeing Model 727, 737, 747, 757, and 767 series airplanes; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, and MD&hyph;11 airplanes; Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011 series airplanes; Airbus Industrie Model A300, A310, and A320 series airplanes; Gulfstream Model G&hyph;1159 series airplanes and Model G-IV airplanes; de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes; Dassault-Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50, 200, and 900 series airplanes; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 (CL&hyph;600), CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 (CL&hyph;601), and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 (CL&hyph;601&hyph;3A and -3R) and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 series airplanes; and Fokker Model F27 and F28 series airplanes; certificated in any category. To prevent explosions of galley water heaters and coffee makers, and subsequent injuries to passengers or cabin crew members, accomplish the following: (a) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD, perform a one-time inspection to determine whether a NUPRO pressure relief valve having part number (P/N) SS&hyph;2C4&hyph;65 has been installed, in accordance with Nordskog Industries, Inc., Service Bulletin SB&hyph;93&hyph;35, dated October 21, 1993. If any NUPRO pressure relief valve having P/N SS&hyph;2C4&hyph;65 has been installed, prior to further flight, accomplish either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD. (1) Remove the NUPRO pressure relief valve having P/N SS&hyph;2C4&hyph;65 and install a new, improved NUPRO pressure relief valve having P/N SS-CHF2&hyph;65, in accordance with the service bulletin. Or (2) Deactivate any Nordskog water heater or coffee maker listed in the service bulletin on which a NUPRO pressure relief valve having P/N SS&hyph;2C4&hyph;65 has been installed, and install a placard stating, ``Not to be used.'' (b) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install a NUPRO pressure relief valve having P/N SS&hyph;2C4&hyph;65 on any airplane. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (e) The inspection and installation shall be done in accordance with Nordskog Industries, Inc., Service Bulletin SB&hyph;93&hyph;35, dated October 21, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
