FR941216-2-00160 FR941216-2-00092 •With the exception of a brief, market-wide period of volatility experienced by stocks traded on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange during the Spring, the volatility of Nasdaq securities appears to be unchanged in the period following implementation of the changes; and •A smaller percentage of Nasdaq stocks experienced extreme relative price volatility after implementation of the rules and that these modifications, in turn, suggest a reduction in relative volatilities since the rules were put into effect. The NASD also believes that its study of the effectiveness of the Interim SOES Rules lends credence to another NASD study that was submitted to the SEC in support of approval of the Interim SOES Rules. 17 In the May 1993 SOES Study, the NASD found that concentrated waves of orders entered into SOES by active order-entry firms resulted in discernible degradation to the quality of the Nasdaq market. Specifically, the study found, among other things, that: (1) Bursts of orders entered into SOES by active order entry firms frequently result in a decline in the bid price and a widening of the bid-ask spread; (2) that there is a significant positive relationship between increases in spreads and volume attributable to active order-entry firms as it related to total SOES volume per security; and (3) activity by active order-entry firms resulted in higher price volatility and less liquidity_higher price changes are associated with high active trading firm volume, even after controlling for normal price fluctuations. Given the positive market effects associated with the Interim SOES Rules, the NASD believes the findings of the May 1993 SOES Study as well as the economic assumptions, principles, and hypotheses underlying the study should not be dismissed by the Commission as ``inconclusive'' and that more weight should be given to the study. 17 See NASD Department of Economic Research: Impact of SOES Active Trading Firms on Nasdaq Market Quality (May 12, 1993) (``May 1993 SOES Study''). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32313 (May 17, 1993), 58 FR 29647 (publication of the study for comment). Therefore, in light of all the above-cited statutory findings made by the SEC when it approved the Interim SOES Rules, coupled with the NASD's findings that the interim rules have been associated with positive market developments in terms of lower spreads on Nasdaq and less stocks with extreme relative price volatility, the NASD believes it would be consistent with the Act for the Commission to extend the Interim SOES Rules for a brief three month period so that the interim rules can continue on an uninterrupted basis until May 1, 1995, the anticipated implementation date for NPROVE. In sum, the NASD believes its study affirms the validity and correctness of the SEC's prior statutory findings made in connection with the approval of the interim rules. Moreover, even if the Commission is unwilling to find positive significance in the NASD's statistical analyses, at the very least, these studies indicate that the market has not been harmed by implementation of the Interim SOES Rules. As a result, the Commission's rationale for the approval of the Interim SOES Rules for one year is equally compelling, if not more compelling given the apparent positive effects of the rules, to justify approval of the NASD's proposal to extend the rules for approximately three months. To do otherwise would require the SEC to refute its prior findings that the Interim SOES Rules are consistent with the Act. Given the absence of any evidence of unanticipated harm associated with implementation of the interim rules, the NASD believes the Commission would have no factual basis to justify such a refutation. Moreover, even if the Commission concludes that the Interim SOES Rules have had no impact on market quality, the NASD believes the Commission's approval of New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 80A on a permanent basis illustrates that the Commission would still have a sufficient basis to approve an extension of the Interim SOES Rules for a brief three month period. 18 When NYSE Rule 80A was proposed, the Commission received considerable adverse comment to the effect that there was no causal relationship between index arbitrage and market volatility and that activation of the rule during turbulent market conditions could have disastrous effects on related options and futures markets and actually exacerbate market volatility. Despite these comments, the Commission approved the proposal on a one-year pilot basis noting that ``the NYSE proposal represents a modest step, proposed on a pilot basis, to attempt to address the issue of market volatility.'' 19 After the one-year pilot, the NYSE prepared a report that, in the SEC's words, found that ``the standard measures of NYSE market quality appear largely unaffected by Rule 80A.'' Specifically, the NYSE Report indicated that: (1) Quotes on the NYSE did not widen after the 50 DJIA point trigger was reached; and (2) the imposition of Rule 80A did not have any negative effect on price continuity and depth in the market. 20 In addition, in approving Rule 80A on a permanent basis, the SEC noted that the rule ``represents a modest but useful step by the NYSE to attempt to address the issue of market volatility,'' 21 that the rule ``has not been disruptive to the marketplace,'' 22 and that there was a ``lack of evidence of any harmful effects of Rule 80A.'' 23 In sum, the SEC discussion of the statutory basis for approval of NYSE Rule 80A focused in large part on the fact that Rule 80A did not have any adverse impacts on market quality on the NYSE and that, as a result, the NYSE should be given the latitude to take reasonable steps to address excessive volatility in its marketplace. Accordingly, the NASD believes the SEC should afford the NASD the same regulatory flexibility that it afforded the NYSE to implement rules reasonably designed to enhance the quality of Nasdaq and minimize the effects of potentially disruptive trading practices. 18 Rule 80A provides that when the Dow Jones Industrial Average declines or advances by 50 points or more, all index arbitrage orders to sell or buy must be executed in a market stabilizing manner. 19 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28282 (July 30, 1990), 55 FR 31468, 31472 (Order approving File Nos. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;5 and SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;11). 20 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29854 (October 24, 1994), 56 FR 55963 (October 30, 1994) (order approving file SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;91&hyph;21) (``Rule 80A Approval Order''). 21 Id. 56 FR at 55967. 22 Id. 23 Id. 56 FR at 55967&hyph;68. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Among other things, Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD is proposing to retain the Interim SOES Rules for three months because of concerns that concentrated, aggressive use of SOES by a growing number of order entry firms has resulted in increased volatility in quotations and transaction prices, wider spreads, and the loss of liquidity for individual and institutional investor orders, all to the detriment of public investors and the public interest. The NASD believes the Interim SOES Rules have operated to rectify this situation while continuing to provide an effective opportunity for the prompt, reliable execution of small orders received from the investing public. With respect to the proposal to remove the short sale prohibition from SOES, by expanding the spectrum of retail orders that will be eligible to receive automatic executions through SOES, the NASD believes the proposal may enhance investor protection. Nonetheless, the NASD is very concerned that re-allowing the entry of short sales into SOES may contribute to destabilizing short term trading through SOES that could have adverse corollary effects throughout Nasdaq. 24 Accordingly, in order to protect investors and the public interest, the NASD believes the Interim SOES Rules should be extended until May 1, 1995, so that small investors' orders will continue to receive the fair and efficient executions that SOES was designed to provide. 24 The NASD will, therefore, review the volume and impact of short sales effected through SOES on an on-going basis to determine whether it is appropriate in the interests of maintaining fair and orderly markets to continue to allow short-sales through SOES. Section 15A(b)(9) provides that the rules of the Association may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Interim SOES Rules apply across the board and do not target any particular user or participant. For instance, all SOES orders must be for 500 shares or less, according to the tier size requirements, all dealers may set their exposure limits at two times the tier size, and all dealers may elect to utilize the automated quote update feature. Accordingly, the NASD believes that these rule changes are not anti-competitive, as they are uniform in application and they seek to preserve the ability of SOES to provide fair and efficient automated executions for small investor orders, while preserving market maker participation in SOES and market liquidity.
