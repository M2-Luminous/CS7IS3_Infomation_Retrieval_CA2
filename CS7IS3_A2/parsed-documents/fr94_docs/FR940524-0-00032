FR940524-0-00032 FR940524-0-00007 §24.440&hyph;24.442 [Reserved]. §24.443 Extension of time to complete construction. (a) If construction is not completed within the time period set forth in §24.103, the authorization will automatically expire. Before the period for construction expires an application for an extension of time to complete construction (FCC Form 489) may be filed. See paragraph (b) of this section. Within 30 days after the authorization expires an application for reinstatement may be filed on FCC Form 489. (b) An application for extension of time to complete construction may be made on FCC Form 489. Extension of time requests must be filed prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be granted only if the licensee shows that the failure to complete construction is due to causes beyond his control. An application for modification of an authorization (under construction) does not extend the initial construction period. If additional time to construct is required, an FCC Form 489 must be submitted. §24.444 Termination of authorization. (a) (1) All authorizations shall terminate on the date specified on the authorization or on the date specified by these rules, unless a timely application for renewal has been filed. (2) If no application for renewal has been made before the authorization's expiration date, a late application for renewal will only be considered if it is filed within 30 days of the expiration date and shows that the failure to file a timely application was due to causes beyond the applicant's control. During this 30 day period reinstatement applications must be filed on FCC Form 489. Service to subscribers need not be suspended while a late filed renewal application is pending, but such service shall be without prejudice to Commission action on the renewal application and any related sanctions. See also §24.16 (Criteria for Comparative Renewal Proceedings). (b) Special Temporary Authority. A special temporary authorization shall automatically terminate upon failure to comply with the conditions in the authorization.
