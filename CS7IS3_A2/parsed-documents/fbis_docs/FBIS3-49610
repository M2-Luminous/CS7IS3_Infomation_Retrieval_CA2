The prime minister criticized work on the district reform, stressing that the communes had not been consulted at all on whether districts were to be established. He said his cabinet was not aiming at the centralization of power and also stressed that the point was not to "centrally" shift responsibility on local governments. Pawlak denied press statements according to which his cabinet sent an expert analysis of the concordat signed by the previous government to the Secretariat of Poland's Episcopate. He stressed the government was not conducting any work on the document. Asked about possible changes at the posts of deputy ministers in the so-called presidential ministries, namely, the Ministries of Internal Affairs, National Defence and Foreign Affairs, the prime minister said the issue aroused too strong emotions. The prime minister also announced actions designed to limit the so-called grey zone.
