Official sources here said that preparations have started to make the 182 km section from Zhuzhou to Hengyang cities navigable in all seasons for ships under 1,000 tons. This requires the building of a dam 62 km from Hengyang, the dredging of the 120-km river channel from the dam to Zhuzhou, the building of six berths in the two river ports, and auxiliary telecommunications and navigation facilities. Feasibility studies to improve the water channel of the river, a major tributary of the Chang Jiang River, was started as early as 1986 by the State Council and the Hunan Provincial Government. The approved feasibility report proposed that the 439 km section between Yueyang and Hengyang should be made navigable for vessels up to 1,000 tons, through an investment of two billion yuan. The first phase of the work was finished some while ago, resulting in the passage capacity being raised from 300 tons to 1,000 tons on the 257 km section from Yueyang to Zhuzhou. The authorities believe that the project, a national model work in improving inland waterways, will be of great significance to the development of the many manufacturing centers along the Xiangjiang River.
