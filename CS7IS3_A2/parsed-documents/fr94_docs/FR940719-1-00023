FR940719-1-00023 FR940719-1-00009 40 CFR Part 230 [FRL&hyph;4886&hyph;3] Exception From Wetlands Mitigation Sequence for Alaska AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today withdrawing a proposed rule (57 FR 52716, November 4, 1992) that would have revised the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines to provide an exception from the wetlands mitigation sequence for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of Alaska. Under the proposed rule, discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in Alaska would have been excepted from current requirements that all proposed discharges represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative and that all practicable measures to compensate for unavoidable adverse impacts on the aquatic ecosystem be undertaken. After consideration of public comments, EPA has determined that it is appropriate to withdraw this proposed rule based on concerns that the rule would result in avoidable and unmitigated adverse impacts to Alaska's wetlands. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: EPA's Wetlands Hotline at (800) 832&hyph;7828 or Mr. Gregory Peck at (202) 260&hyph;8794 or Mr. John Goodin at (202) 260&hyph;9910, or write to: US EPA, Wetlands and Aquatic Resources Regulatory Branch, Wetlands Alaska Docket (4502F), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (renamed in 1977 as the Clean Water Act) established, in section 404, a regulatory program for the evaluation of permit applications for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. Section 404(a) authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to issue permits specifying disposal sites in waters of the U.S. in accordance with regulatory requirements of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines). The Guidelines, which were published as final regulations on December 24, 1980 (45 FR 85336), are the substantive environmental criteria used in evaluating discharges of dredged or fill material under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Guidelines provide four general restrictions in ยง230.10 that must be met before a permit can be issued authorizing the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. The proposed rulemaking focused on two of these restrictions: the prohibition in ยง230.10(a) of any discharge where there is a less damaging practicable alternative and the requirement in ยง230.10(d) that all appropriate and practicable steps be taken to minimize potential harm to the aquatic ecosystem. The mitigation process is designed to establish a consistent approach to be used in ensuring that all practicable measures have been taken to reduce potential adverse impacts associated with proposed projects in wetlands and other aquatic systems. The first step in the sequence requires the evaluation of potential alternative sites to locate the proposed project so that aquatic impacts are avoided to the maximum extent practicable. As the next step in the sequence, remaining impacts are minimized, by making changes in project design or construction methods that reduce overall project impacts. Lastly, after all practicable steps have been taken to avoid and minimize potential adverse effects, compensation for remaining unavoidable impacts is sought by such measures as wetlands creation or restoration in order to replace lost aquatic functions and values. The result is prevention of wetlands impacts where practicable; but where the actions necessary to prevent such impacts are not available and capable of being done, associated losses of wetland and aquatic functions and values are offset to the extent appropriate and practicable with compensatory mitigation. On August 9, 1991, the Bush Administration issued a plan for protecting wetlands that contained provisions to ``improve and streamline the current regulatory system.'' One element of the plan provided that ``States with less than a 1 percent historic rate of wetlands development will be able to satisfy permit requirements through minimization.'' Based on historic loss data (Dahl, T.E., 1990. ``Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's to 1980's'' U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC, 21 pp.), this provision was applicable only in the State of Alaska. According to this data, approximately 0.1 percent of the State's original wetland acreage has been lost.
