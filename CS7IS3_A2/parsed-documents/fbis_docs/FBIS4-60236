On Friday, there was a murderous event in which two IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers were killed at the Erez checkpoint after the IDF's redeployment -- an event we will not be able to ignore. Therefore, the exit from Gaza has been closed until units of the Palestinian police are stationed 200-300 meters from the passages used by the Palestinians. The Palestinian police will be responsible for making sure that nobody crosses its checkpoint bearing weapons. Moreover, the test of the Palestinians today is their takeover of Gaza and Jericho and their ability to demonstrate full control over those areas. If they do not prove it, it will be hard for us to continue to carry out the additional stages in the implementation of the Declaration of Principles we signed. Last night, the IDF carried out an operation -- an operation which the IDF, the State of Israel, and lovers of freedom and the fight against terror can be proud of. The operation was unanimously approved by all the members of the inner cabinet in a meeting on 19 May. Its purpose was to bring here the man who today heads a terrorist organization operating against us in the security zone -- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron Arad for at least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be able to give us information about the period during which he held him and perhaps about his condition later on. The operation was conducted on the basis of our responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al-Dirani. Our goal was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF, the intelligence community, the special units, the Air Force, the Intelligence Corps, and others who participated in an operation that once again proves the IDF's greatness as the Army responsible for the defense of Israel. To my regret, in the last six and a half years, the IDF has been carrying out policing duties and has been used as an Army imposing Israel's rule on another people. It has been carrying out tough policing duties which were unavoidable, escorting convoys, guarding roads, escorting school buses -- missions which could not supply a full answer in the face of a people's uprising. I would like to seize this occasion to point out that some right-wing extremists claim that the blood that is being shed is being shed for peace. There can be no grosser lie. The blood being shed is because of our rule over another foreign people. Peace is the only chance -- not a certainty -- of ever attaining an end to this bloodshed or definitely a significant reduction of it. As long as the occupation rule continues and as long as there is growing resistance to it by extreme elements, the murderers of Israelis and murderers of peace -- Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad -- we will have to pay a bloody price. The IDF and the security branches will do their best to reduce it, but the bloody price is the price of ruling over another people that is rebelling against our rule -- and this point must be understood. I am sorry that the IDF bears the tough mission of policing a large, rebelling population that is causing fatalities among civilians and soldiers. I hope that as the peace process continues, the IDF will go back to being a defense army rather than an army ruling over another people. [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to those who executed the operation, of course, could not such an operation have been carried out during the seven years that Ron Arad has been in captivity and to this day in order to extract information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive? [Rabin] As far as certainties go, I have no clear-cut proof that he is alive, and there is definitely no clear-cut proof that he is not alive. In the IDF, an MIA is any soldier or officer who is considered to be alive as long as it has not been proven otherwise. As for the second part of your question, we have taken people in the past. This operation could have been carried out a few months ago, but it was put off because of intelligence considerations and chances of obtaining information. It was designed to be carried out in a specific area -- in that area where the operation took place. Therefore, the timing chosen was the first possible time after another channel and hope of obtaining information through other means were blocked. [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar] Mr. Rabin, what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa al-Dirani confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians, is it now a question of international pressure on Tehran? What are the next moves? [Rabin] At the moment, I do not want to say what we will find out in the course of his interrogation. Furthermore, I should say that the unit, which carried out the operation admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of staff, the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air Force commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out the mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it a considerable amount of written material which will certainly throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively determined by Israel and the IDF. [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, this daring operation notwithstanding, did you take into account the possibility that the decision to carry it out could lead to a flare-up or perhaps a new war with Hizballah along the northern border? [Rabin] We took everything into consideration. I recommended it, and it was planned by the IDF. When it was ready, I presented it to the inner cabinet with the realization that we must take risks for the sake of the heavy responsibility we bear for the fate of the POW's and MIA's. The problem is not to put up bumper stickers [calling for Arad's release] but to do the things that give us a better chance of getting more information, even if they entail risks and uncertainties. [Unidentified Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el correspondent] Might this operation not affect the U.S. secretary of state's efforts to resume the peace talks? [Rabin] I do not see why. After he returned from Damascus, I asked the secretary of state what he had brought back as a result of President Clinton's appeal to President al-Asad in Geneva to take action to provide information, through the Americans, about the MIA's and the POW's -- not just about Ron Arad, but about all of them; about those about whom we have no information, particularly Ron Arad and the MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle: Baumel, Katz, and Feldman. The U.S. President again sent Dennis Ross to another meeting in Damascus, and we in fact received no additional information. The U.S. congressional delegation that visited Syria did not produce any trace of new information. Therefore, Syria has no right whatsoever to complain about it. It was not carried out on its soil. It is true, however, that it was carried out in an area controlled by the Syrian Army and where Syrian troops are deployed.
