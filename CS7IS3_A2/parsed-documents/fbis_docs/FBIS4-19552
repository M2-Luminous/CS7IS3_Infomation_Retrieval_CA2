It will be the largest parliamentary group, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate, despite having lost the Communist Renewal deputies on its left and the Socialist deputies on its right. In some people's thinking it is intended to be the founding nucleus of the future "Democratic Party." The old table has lost two legs but now has five: the PDS, Rete, the Greens, the Democratic Alliance [AD], and the Social Christians. The group's leader in the Chamber of Deputies will be [outgoing lower house Speaker] Giorgio Napolitano, and in the Senate -- in all likelihood -- [outgoing Italian Republican Party Chairman] Bruno Visentini. There will be five deputy leaders in each chamber, one for each party. It has been a back-breaking task, but was finally hammered out by deputies and senators who, in the first-past-the-post constituencies, won considerably more votes under the progressive banner than were available to the parties that had put them up for election [passage omitted]. There is also a general directing this battle: [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema. He strove for this solution, believed in it, and in order to see it come to fruition he sacrificed a part of himself for it: While favoring a unitary agreement he took two steps back by resigning from his position as floor leader -- before anyone could ask him to. He remains a general but has lost his stars. He is returning, as he points out, to the ranks of ordinary deputy, "the deputy for Gallipoli." Pressure from D'Alema, with grass-roots support, persuaded Occhetto. Occhetto's new stance persuaded the Greens and the AD. The unitary agreement was one that Rete and the Social Christians always wanted. [passage omitted].
