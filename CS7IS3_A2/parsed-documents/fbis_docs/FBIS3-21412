It has removed the reason--a pretext, really--for the artificial delay in appointing new generals to the general staff. Unless, that is, things are not as simple as they appear on the surface. When the government approved extending the chief of staff's term of service for an additional year, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq announced that he intends to complete his duties on January 1, 1995. Thus, he still has about 10 months in his post. What this means is that Baraq, in the final stages of his term, is about to decide who will make up most of the generals to serve on the general staff of his successor, who already is standing on the threshold. If this had been done a year or two ago--well and good. The custom has been to permit every chief of staff to choose some of the generals with whom he is interested in working as a team. This time, the next chief of staff will not have any possibility of influencing many key appointments. The face of his general staff will be set now for many years to come. The next chief of staff apparently will be Gen. Amnon Shahaq, currently the preferred candidate of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is also the Defense Minister. It would be worthwhile for Shahaq to have as much say as Baraq does on the next round of senior appointments. The Defense Minister will need advice on them from the man who will be the IDF's chief of staff in another 10 months, too. The prolonged delay in appointments because of the Tze'elim accident was excessive. The longer the Advocate-General's work took, the more onerous the delay seemed. The error lay not in the extended service of the current generals in their posts but in the connection that Rabin and Baraq formed between the Tze'elim accident and the appointment of new generals, which were completely unrelated. The problem is that this linkage has not been severed even now. In fairness, the Chief of Staff did not want to appoint Gen. 'Amiram Levine to a senior post immediately after he received an administrative reprimand. Accordingly, it was suggested that only a small round of appointments be made in the first stage. A "small round" of appointments could have been made only a while ago, before the Adjutant General presented his findings. The current round apparently will include appointments to Central Command, the National Defense College, and Ground Forces Command. If Baraq truly wants to appoint 'Amiram Levine to OC Northern Command, he will have to put off further exchanges in that command. That means that the "small round" is again delaying appointments. Once again, it will entangle officers who have no connection to the Tze'elim incident. Shortening the final year of service of the chief of staff has put an end to the possibility that another senior officer will fill the post of deputy chief of staff before the decision as to who will succeed Baraq is put into effect. Baraq has tried in recent weeks to convince Shahaq to take a year off, on leave or at study, which would permit another officer to perform his duties. Although Shahaq was not enthusiastic about that idea, he left the decision to the Defense Minister. Rabin is not accustomed to making drastic decisions in such personal matters, however, and because Shahaq has not asked to go study, the situation remains as it was. This plan has gone off the agenda, meanwhile, because there is no reason to appoint a chief of army intelligence and a deputy chief of staff for just nine months. Such an appointment must be made for a period of years; and if it is made, the general who wins it will also be the next deputy chief of staff. Appointments have always been a bumpy road for Baraq. Some of the senior appointments made during his term were done without his approval, as in the appointment of Yitzhaq Mordekhay to OC Northern Command. Others are not considered successful. In the next 10 months, not only will a new chief of staff be appointed but also three regional commanders, a deputy chief of staff, and a chief of military intelligence; and there may yet be new officers in other senior posts. There is no escaping the fact that two veteran generals will be disappointed. A new generation of brigadier generals, some of them very good and some of them less so, stands on the threshold. It is important to ensure that the next general staff is composed not only of talented officers, outstanding professionals, and men with a strategic-political grasp of the world; also, care must be taken so that the next general staff will be truly balanced. Reserve Gen. Yisr'ael Tal was correct in arguing long ago that above all else, the general staff must always be made up of men experienced in managing the large command structures that naturally develop from armored formations. The one who must oversee the job of this balancing is the Defense Minister, who has to see the appointment picture in its totality.
