Our correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report: [Begin Karzis recording] Good evening from our studios on Mourouzis Street. The prime minister's meeting with Ambassador of New Yugoslavia [as heard] Milan Milutinovic, which lasted approximately 25 minutes, ended few minutes ago in the Maximos Palace. Mr. Milutinovic was extremely sparing in his statement immediately after the meeting. He said that he had discussed the latest developments with the prime minister and that he had submitted a message from the Yugoslav Government but he did not want to disclose its details. Mr. Milutinovic also did not want to comment on how the Serbs would react to the bombings from the NATO aircraft in the past few days. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will arrive in Athens on Wednesday [13 April] and it is not ruled out that Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of new Yugoslavia, will also visit the Greek capital on Friday. We should also note that a short time ago National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said in the most categorical manner that no Greek crews would take part in the NATO operations in New Yugoslavia. Of course, there is concern in Athens over the latest developments on the Bosnian front. The government is following these developments closely, as all the parties favor a peaceful settlement of the crisis. [end recording]
