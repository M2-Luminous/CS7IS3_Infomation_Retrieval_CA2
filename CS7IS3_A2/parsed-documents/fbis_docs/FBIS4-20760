The local leader, or the elector in the Germany of the Holy Roman Empire, took under his protection the Jewish community that was subject to him, or the Jews who sought to come to the area under his rule. They were completely undefended. In exchange for payment (in the form of taxes or other means) he would "ensure" their safety from anti-Semitic attacks. The result of existence at the bottom of the ladder, this dependence was one of the elements, at the same time both spiritual and physical, that the Zionists sought to uproot. The shame of the /Schutzjuden/--whatever its form--was liquidated by a new generation of Jewish defense, which was founded at the beginning of the century in pogrom-stricken Czarist Russia. At that time, the Zionist pioneers in Eretz-Yisra'el established their "Hashomer." Thus arose the Jewish Brigades, which participated in the liberation of Eretz-Yisra'el from the Turks during World War I, a complete military tradition, that had slumbered for 1,800 years. Afterwards, it developed into armed resistance to the repressive rule of the British in Palestine; and it even flourished in the framework of the Israel Defence Forces--which is considered to be one of the best armies, if not the best army in the world. Today, in 1993 [as in source], suddenly (as the agreement between Prime Minister Rabin and President Bush in exchange for the American guarantees was cooked up only last year) the independent Government of Israel has included in its plans the revival of the situation of the /Schutzjuden/. According to this plan, foreign soldiers will "protect" Jews in Israel. The logic is absurd. Its implication: /Schutzjuden/ not out of the necessity of tragic historical circumstances, but /Schutzjuden/ out of choice. A naturally proud and independent Jewish community is forced by its government into a situation of dependence. No less shocking than the humiliation of morale and spirit inherent in the "peace with Syria" plan of the Rabin-Peres government is the lack of willpower and a line of thinking, which cannot withstand the critique of logic. The idea is that the Syrians will honor a peace treaty with Israel, if Israel relinquishes the Golan Heights. "Otherwise," so it is hinted, Syria will initiate a war. As a purely military issue, these things are not logical. Syria's strategic position, opposite the Golan, is inferior relative to that of Israel. And, indeed, the Golan is the strongest natural factor of deterrence that the State of Israel has. For that reason, Syria has been careful to observe the territorial conditions of the supposed "separation of forces" agreement, which was reached after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and which left Israel within sight of Damascus itself. But the Israeli Government clarifies, before the entire world, that it is so frightened by the threats of war that it is willing to sacrifice its security in the north, and to hand over to Syria--and especially to the hands of the bloodthirsty tyrant and the hands of whoever will be his successors--the very key to that security. And, indeed, we will be subject to the mercies of the Syrians, for when the security pearl of the Golan is in their hands--as they have declared--they will be able to decide that the time has come "for the final assault" on Israel, and then they will not hesitate to order the "promised" American forces to evacuate the area within 24 hours. Alternatively, if the American forces will resist, then the Syrians will attack them to an extent that will arouse the American public against the presence of their forces in the contested area, or Israel will be required to make additional concessions in order to prevent casualties among the Americans. There will be a great justification for the American call for a withdrawal of forces, and it will be heard from all quarters, both from friends of Israel and from hostile parties. From all quarters, with the same clarity as night follows day, it will be said: "If those Israelis, who could definitely have defended themselves, were so stupid as to relinquish territory to the Arabs who for two generations have been threatening and have twice tried to destroy them, why should the American youths risk their lives in order to defend them?" More knowledgeable Americans will add that the Israeli Government agreed to relinquish the Golan Heights in exchange for the Americans' promise of guarantees--and that they could have taken care of it themselves for five years from Israeli resources--even if at higher interest cost, but without political obligations. Must American youths endanger their lives in order to defend Israelis from the consequences of their government's stupidity? Moreover, Americans with a good memory will remember that the Israelis were always proud, and even insisted, that they did not want foreign soldiers to fight for them. No, "the guarantees," if they are ever given, will evaporate (as happened in Sinai in 1967). The feeling that the Americans will defend Jews has a special significance in light of the special affection that the American administration feels towards Syria. It is difficult to find a pragmatic reason for the treatment that the Syrian dictator receives. In the political sphere, Syria has nothing special to offer: it is a poor country and lacks oil reserves. It has no ideological charm and it continues to decorate the list of countries that encourage terrorism. But for years, especially since the days of President Carter, Syria has been spoiled and cultivated. Its interests were protected, even though they were illegitimate, and its crimes were swept under the carpet. Asad was the first foreign statesman that President Carter chose to meet in 1977. At that meeting, he said to Carter that Israel "must withdraw from all of the territories," etc., and added that Israel must allow the return of the refugees to Yaffo, Gaza, and Lod. Upon his return to the United States, Carter declared that Asad was "moderate." This love affair continued during the Gulf war, during which Syria joined officially the coalition against Iraq but did not lift a finger in combat, it won a grant of $2 billion (which were allocated immediately to arms purchases). And when Syria purchased Scud missiles from North Korea, Washington warned Israel--the intended target of the missiles--not to stop the ship that was bringing them to their Syrian destination. [Editorial note] Shmu'el Katz was the first commander of the IZL [National Military Organization--pre-1948 underground resistance organization. A former MK [member of Knesset], he has published a number of books on Zionist and Jewish history. He published recently a two-volume biography of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.
