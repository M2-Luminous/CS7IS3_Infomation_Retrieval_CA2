FR940204-0-00021 FR940204-0-00013 Background and Purpose The upper Ohio River Valley is experiencing one of the coldest winters on record. Unusually high precipitation levels and record low temperatures have led to significant ice accumulations along the region's navigable waterways. The icing problem is especially severe along the Allegheny River, where ice thicknesses of up to one foot have been reported. Vessels attempting to transit the Allegheny River have experienced difficulty in maintaining steerage and in making way on this river's ice clogged channels. By January 17, 1994, the Allegheny River's navigability had deteriorated (due to ice) to the point where several vessel operators elected not to move tank barge cargoes on this river. Since temperatures in this region are not expected to moderate in the short term, Captain of the Port Pittsburgh is establishing a safety zone on the Allegheny river to protect vessels from the risks posed by the river's ice clogged channels. Commencing at 4 p.m. on January 18, 1994, vessel traffic will not be permitted to transit any navigable portion of the Allegheny River unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh. Vessels intending to transit the Allegheny River may request Captain of the Port authorization to proceed by calling Marine Safety Office Pittsburgh at (412) 644&hyph;5808 or Coast Guard Ohio Valley via VHF marine band radio Channel 13 (156.650 MHz) at least 24 hours prior to the vessel's scheduled arrival time at Allegheny River mile 0.0. The Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will authorize Allegheny River transits on a case-by-case basis after considering the vessel's size (horsepower), tow composition, and destination on the river. This safety zone will remain in effect until 4 p.m. on February 15, 1994, unless terminated at an earlier date by the Captain of the Port, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions and the relative infrequency of commercial vessel transits along this navigable waterway. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action required to protect public safety.
