"By signing the Bishkek protocol together with Karen Baburyan, representative of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and thus effectively recognizing this entity, Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Chairman Rasul Guliyev committed an act of national treason that has drastically aggravated the sociopolitical situation in the country," the statement of the Republic's largest opposition movement says. It also emphasized: "Recognizing Russia as the sole mediator in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and signing the Bishkek protocol on 8 May, the Azerbaijani authorities have ratcheted up tensions in the Republic to a critical point. The signing of this document together with the so-called Nagorno- Karabakh Republic [NKR] will lead to international recognition of the NKR, the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict zone, and finally Azerbaijan's loss of control over part of its territory. Given that, the APNI states that it does not recognize the Bishkek protocol and requests that the National Assembly make a decision on the speediest possible dismissal of Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who has committed an unconstitutional act and overstepped his powers, and also that the president of the Republic express his attitude to the document.
