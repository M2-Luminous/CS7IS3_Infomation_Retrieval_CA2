FBIS4-14240 "drnes082cc_94001" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 Islamic Affairs Former Soviet Muslim Students Interviewed Former Soviet Muslim Students Interviewed NC2704082794 Cairo 'AQIDATI in Arabic 29 Mar 94 p 20 NC2704082794 Cairo 'AQIDATI Arabic BFN [Report by Jamal Salim and Tariq 'Abdallah] [Text] After 70 years, during which Muslims -- in what was once called the Soviet Union -- suffered from persecution and oppression under the yoke of the communist rule which imposed on them the principles of atheism, the new Islamic republics have shaken off the dust of humiliation and degradation and replaced it with the light of Islam, of which the majority know nothing other than the two testimonies. These republics are strenuously trying to find a place for themselves on the world's map, especially as they are being subjected to many cultures that are alien to them, each of which is trying to attract them to its ranks. Egypt started to help these republics get to know their Islamic roots as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed. Al-Azhar University President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh said that the number of students who came in 1990-91 for higher studies reached 7,204, while 39,708 such students came to the university during 1985-1992, and the overall number during the scholastic year 1991-92 reached 8,118. He added that 250 scholarships had been given to the new Islamic countries and there will be 250 this year. He said that the number of scholarships will be increased in the coming years. 'AQIDATI has met with the following students: Muhammad 'Ali Hakim Sharif from Tajikistan -- a fourth-year student in the Islamic Research Institute. He said: A group of Muslims from Tajikistan, including myself, have come to study in Egypt at the expense of the Islamic Relief Organization. He added: Muslims in our country suffer from weak religious awareness and many of them know nothing about Islam other than the two testimonies. This is why I have come to Egypt full of determination to try to fill this vacuum, which is increasing daily because the communists killed a large number of 'ulema and shaykhs. Muhammad Ahmad Qadi from Dagestan -- a second-year high school student at the Islamic Research Institute. He said: We Muslims in Dagestan are suffering from a struggle between the remnants of the collapsed communism and the new light of Islam. The population of Dagestan is three million, of whom 75 percent are Muslims. Regrettably, though the president of the republic is a Muslim he is also a communist. This is why we have suffered from much persecution, including a ban on prayers and on celebrating Muslim holy days. In these conditions, my father played a big role by setting up a secret office for teaching the Holy Koran and the Arabic language. Even though the 'ulema in our country are very few in number there are conflicts among them over trivial matters of jurisprudence. This is why we are in dire need of more Muslim 'ulema from all over the world, provided they are tolerant and well educated. The child Qutb-al-Din Tabari from Tajikistan gave us details of his visit to Egypt. He said: I came to Egypt to learn the Arabic language and memorize the holy Koran. Currently I am a student at the Ahmad Libi Elementary School in Madinat al-Nasr. Praise be to God, I have succeeded in memorizing five parts of the holy Koran. I am making diligent efforts to memorize the entire book. I am doing well in my Arabic lessons at the elementary institute. I will also attend the Islamic Research Institute and afterward al-Azhar University. Tabari added: When I go back to my country I will become an Islamic preacher and I will explain the concepts and fundamentals of Islam to my kinsfolk. I recall that when I returned to Tajikistan, I urged my friends to visit Egypt and learn Arabic and the fundamentals of Islam because al-Azhar is a scientific institute where Islam is well taught. Zaynatallah Habiballah from Tajikistan is still waiting for the results of her exams at the Islamic Research Institute. She said she will attend al-Azhar University. She added: I believe that my education at al-Azhar is a mission that I must accomplish well. I come from a Muslim family in Tajikistan who perform the Islamic religious duties. My grandfather was an ulema who was educated at al-Azhar. 'Abd-al-Qadir Amin from Eastern Turkmenistan is a first-year student at the Shari'ah and Law School. He said: I came to Egypt three years ago on a grant from al-Azhar. I am learning the fundamentals of true Islam in order to propagate it in Eastern Turkmenistan. No awareness of Islam exists there, even though there are 25 million Muslims in Turkmenistan. Muslims throughout the world are unaware of the situation in Eastern Turkmenistan, where Islam is threatened with complete extinction despite this huge population. Ramadan Shunshula from Dagestan is a student at the Islamic Research Institute. He said: The Muslims in Dagestan suffer from the communist rule of the country despite the collapse of communism. The Muslims are trying to regain their glories and the fundamentals of their religion. Hence, I urge the Islamic countries and organizations as well as all the Arab countries to keep the Muslims in mind and promote Islamic awareness in our country. Western missionaries are making intensive efforts to dominate the mentalities of the Muslim people in Dagestan. Muslims of the whole world should take responsibility for us. Mustafa Tabari from Uzbekistan said: Our country is currently witnessing a huge Islamic awakening due to its dire need for Islam. Accordingly, many mosques, Islamic schools, and religious institutes have been built since independence. Furthermore, a Religious Affairs Ministry has been established to supervise such activities. We look forward to the support of the Islamic countries, particularly Egypt, in terms of the religious education in our country. Tabari added: We learned the Arabic language in the first year through our mixing with the people and avid reading. Ya'qub Bin-Khalduf is from the Tatar Republic. He is in the second year of al-Azhar High School. He said that more attention should be paid to non-Arabic-speaking students, adding that these students should receive a one-year intensive courses in the fundamentals and basics of the Arabic language, in addition to the principles of Islam and its rulings regarding purity, prayers, fasting, and alms. He added: The students should take an exam at the end of the year, the results of which will determine the student's educational stage at al-Azhar. Muhammad Karim from Tajikistan had the following to say: Our country is currently witnessing a power struggle between the Communists and Islamists. Accordingly, religious activities have so far been banned. The Islamic organizations must increase the number of scholarships to overcome this ban and to end the lack of awareness of the Islamic religion. Ilyas Bin-Sulayman from Uzbekistan, a student at al-Azhar High School, says that Islam in Uzbekistan. [sentence incomplete as published] Alluding to the problems facing them in obtaining scholarships at al-Azhar, 'Abd-al-Halim Bin-Fadl al-Din from Uzbekistan, who is at the al-Azhar Preparatory Institute, said: Our main problem lies in insufficient knowledge of Arabic and the lack of funds required for our travel to Egypt. Firdaws Bin-'Abd-al-Hafiz from Uzbekistan said: I spent two years at the al-Bukhari Islamic Institute in Samarkand. I learned a certain amount of Arabic. I also learned the five foundations of Islam. But this is not sufficient for a graduate to propagate Islam in an affective and influential manner. Therefore, we decided to attend al-Azhar in order to learn Islam properly so we could carry out the propagation in our country. He added: Praise be to God, there are still good people in the world. Shaykh Sa'ud 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Butayni from Kuwait undertook to send 57 students from Uzbekistan to complete their studies at al-Azhar at his own expense. Shaykh al-Butayni also provided all the funds for the students' transportation and tuition fees until the end of our studies at al-Azhar. Anas Ya'qub from Tajikistan, a seventh grader at al-Azhar School, said: I joined al-Azhar fully determined to learn the true religion in order to convey my knowledge to my kinsfolk. To a question about the most prominent ulema and scholars in the Muslim world, Ya'qub said: I like to listen to Shaykh al-Husari, Shaykh Mahmud 'Ali al-Banna, and Shaykh al-Hudhayfi.
