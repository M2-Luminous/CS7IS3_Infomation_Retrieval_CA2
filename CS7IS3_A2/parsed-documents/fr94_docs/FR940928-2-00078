FR940928-2-00078 FR940928-2-00057 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;55 (Sub-No. 494X)] CSX Transportation, Inc._Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_Vanderburgh, Warrick, Gibson, and Pike Counties, IN CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Trackage Rights to discontinue its trackage rights over approximately 26.9 miles of rail line owned by Indiana Southern Railroad, Inc. (ISRR) (1) Extending from milepost 163.9, at Straight Line Junction near Evansville, to milepost 140.2, at Gray Junction, and (2) extending from milepost 0.0, at Gray Junction, to milepost 3.2, at Oakland City Junction, in Vanderburgh, Warrick, Gibson and Pike Counties, IN. 1 CSXT indicates that ISRR will continue to provide rail service over the line. 1 Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice tendered for filing August 24, 1994, indicated a proposed consummation date of October 17, 1994. Because the original filing fee was not received with that filing, a new filing date of September 8, 1994, was entered when a replacement check was received. Now the earliest possible consummation date is October 28, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after October 28, 1994. CSXT has certified with respect to the trackage rights involved here that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 2 2 No environmental or historical documentation is required here under 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(3). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on October 28, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by October 11, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by October 18, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 3 3 Because this is only a discontinuance proceeding and ISRR will continue to provide service over the line, the routine provisions for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions provided for in abandonment proceedings are not appropriate here. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Charles M. Rosenberger, 500 Water Street, J150, Jacksonville, FL 32202. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Decided: September 20, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24028 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
