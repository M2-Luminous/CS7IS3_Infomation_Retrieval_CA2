IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi objected to the new terms of reference, drafted with the government's participation on Tuesday, which explicitly state the election date is not an issue for mediation. [passage omitted] Asked what would take the mediation process forward in the light of the IFP's objection, Mr Buthelezi said he was not intent on "putting new terms of reference as if I am demanding ultimatums". "There is nothing I prescribe as Buthelezi." The IFP had already had to climb down on its original demands on mediation. KwaZulu health minister and chief negotiator Dr Ben Ngubane said there were a lot of things they had objected to but had carried on with negotiations. Mr Buthelezi said any further development in mediation would depend on the attitude of the mediators. He had had breakfast with former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Kissinger and former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington on Wednesday morning and had bid them goodbye. He did not know and would not want to speculate on how his supporters would react to the hitches that threatened to scupper the mediation efforts, he said In a statement issued later, Dr Kissinger and Lord Carrington said they had had "extremely useful" meetings with the leaders of the government, ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] subsequent to the opening reception of the international mediation forum. They said senior negotiators for the three parties would be meeting in Pretoria from 12PM on Wednesday (today) to finalise terms of reference for the mediation. The seven mediators and their advisors held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss matters that arose from the meetings with the three leaders earlier in the day. The mediation would commence once agreement on the terms of reference had been reached by the parties, the statement said.
