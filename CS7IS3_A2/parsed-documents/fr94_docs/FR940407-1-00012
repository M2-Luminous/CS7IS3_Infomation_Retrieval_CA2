FR940407-1-00012 FR940407-1-00005 21 CFR Parts 123 and 1240 [Docket No. 93N&hyph;0195] Proposal To Establish Procedures for the Safe Processing and Importing of Fish and Fishery Products; Extension of Comment Period AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to May 31, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142). The document proposed to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is taking this action in response to several requests for an extension of the comment period. DATES: Written comments by May 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments, data, or information to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Philip C. Spiller, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;401), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;3885. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with HACCP principles. Interested persons were given until April 28, 1994, to comment on the proposal. However, because of an inadvertent error, the date for submission of comments was incorrectly given as March 29, 1994. In the Federal Register of March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10085), FDA published a proposed rule to correct the comment period to April 28, 1994. FDA has received several requests from trade associations, State agencies, and university officials for an extension of the comment period in order to better review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 90-day extension, although one request is for an unspecified length and another is for about 120 days. FDA also received a request from a public advocacy organization that the comment period either not be extended at all or that it be extended no more than 30 days. After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow an additional 30 days for comment. With the additional period, the agency is providing a total of 120 days for comment. FDA considers that this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly, the agency is extending the comment period to May 31, 1994. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , FDA is publishing a notice extending the comment period of the ``Fish and Fish Products Hazards and Controls Guide'' until May 31, 1994. That guide has been developed to serve, among other things, as an adjunct to the proposed regulations. Interested persons may, on or before May 31, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 1, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
