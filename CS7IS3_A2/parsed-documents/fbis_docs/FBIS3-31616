Much attention was paid during talks to the possibilities of improving economic cooperation between our two countries. Attention was also drawn to the need to build a security system in this part of Europe. Andrzej Olechowski assessed relations between Poland and Switzerland very positively. [Begin Olechowski recording] It is a country whose friendship and will to help and cooperate with Poland is something we experience every day. Today too this willingness was expressed both in the interest shown by the minister in events in our region, in his understanding of the importance of this region for the future of Europe and in his understanding -- which we traditionally find among the Swiss -- for economic affairs, something which we also discussed for quite a while.
