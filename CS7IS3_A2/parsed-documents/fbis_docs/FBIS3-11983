As various governments and social sectors have found, he pulls no punches. Despite some disagreements, the president of the Republic has entrusted him with this difficult ministry and the mission of maintaining the macroeconomic balances and implementing the capitalization of state-owned enterprises, the main plank of his government's platform. Illanes has long lived in the spheres of power and is accustomed to exercising authority, a fact that sometimes subjects him to setbacks. He has twice been president of the CEPB [Bolivian Private Businessmen Confederation], ambassador to the United States, and minister of energy. PRESENCIA interviewed him in his office, and the hour he had allotted to the interview extended to almost two hours, during which he spoke "his mind, (because) we are not in a political arena." Space, however, prevents us from publishing the interview in its entirety. [PRESENCIA] During the electoral campaign, you were a harsh critic of capitalization. You even said that you knew nothing about it and that you were going to vote for Oscar Bonifaz. How did President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada manage to lure you? [Illanes] I did not say I was going to vote for Bonifaz. You media people still turn my words around at your convenience. I said that Bonifaz was the only one who openly said that the economy should be privatized. When the president invited me to be minister I had already spent some time working with him, because he first asked me to be part of an advisory team that, between June and August, cooperated with him on several matters, mainly the reorganization of the executive branch of the government and capitalization. At that point I stated to the president my objections especially to what I saw as not conducive to the attracting of investments, because, in the end, that is what it is all about. Some of those objections have been incorporated, to a certain extent, in the capitalization project. The original plan has undergone some changes, and now I am convinced that it is viable and will attract foreign investments. There have been substantial changes: stockholding, management contracts, and stock operations. I do not mean to say that I imposed those ideas. It was an enlightening dialogue with several experts and the president himself that convinced me that capitalization is a process that goes well beyond privatization. Capitalization has a very important social aspect, which is the inclusion of a universal pension plan that has no place in a privatization process. In the privatization case, one sells an enterprise, receives money, spends it one way or another, and there the process ends. It is a one-shot investment spanning one, two, or three years, and then there is nothing. [PRESENCIA] Why has the possibility opened that the TGN [National Treasury] will acquire creditors' rights, by subrogation, against the enterprises that are to be capitalized? [Illanes] One little word in the bill to be enacted needs to be underlined: It says that the Treasury "may" acquire such rights as subrogee, not that it "must" do so; and therein lies a subtle but big difference. "May" means yes or no. Everyone is assuming "yes"; I, on the contrary, assume "no." Between these two positions, there are many possibilities that will depend on the situation of each of the enterprises. Besides, one must analyze the reason why that article was incorporated. The object is to maximize the amount of the investment so as to create more jobs, more capital, more economic activity, more growth of the GNP (gross national product), and hence more funds that can be devoted to health, education, and basic housing. The more the liabilities the TGN can absorb, the more the book value of the enterprises' assets increases. Besides, there are assets that cannot be included in book value, such as reserves, contracts, trademarks, market, etc., but that are quantifiable in the acquisition of an enterprise; and these will be quantified in the capitalization process. There are two sides to the coin. If the TGN absorbs these liabilities, it will be affected, but only relatively because the credits are very soft; they are renegotiable; they will go to the Paris Club; etc. That is to say, there are many mechanisms that can lighten the load. And as I have said, if economic activity picks up, the Treasury will collect more revenue. There are also problems with leaving these liabilities on the books of the enterprises. First, foreign loans are always guaranteed by the state, and to the international lending institutions it makes very little difference whether the loan is to the enterprise or to the TGN, as long as the ultimate debtor is the state. Second, it places the enterprises in a disadvantageous or unfair competitive position with respect to others that may seek to enter the same field. A YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits] with very soft credits will be much better able to compete than an enterprise that has to resort to bank loans. The pros and cons must be balanced against each other, and it is for this reason that the article stipulates "may." We are going to consider case by case, in accordance with the degree and type of debt of the enterprise, the desire or needs of the provider of capital, etc. [PRESENCIA] Why was it decided to release 50 percent of the enterprises' stocks to investors, when initially it was to be 49 percent? [Illanes] In order to render their capitalization viable. Indeed this was precisely one of my major doubts concerning the Plan of Everyone. A private investor holding 50 percent of an enterprise's capital stock and a management contract that can only be revoked by 51 percent can sleep peacefully and manage and operate the enterprise. [PRESENCIA] Assume, for example, that within some 15 years the capitalized enterprise needs more money. Will it be injected by the provider of capital? If so, will parity of capital shares not be broken? [Illanes] We must paint things in their true colors; we are not in a political arena. The stocks belong to the Bolivians, but they are deposited in a trust fund managed by the pension fund management firms, which in turn are obliged to open savings accounts for each and every citizen. We believe there will be between five and 10 firms of this type. Assuming there are 10, each one will receive more than 300,000 shares, will open more than 300,000 accounts, and will be obliged to meet physically with its savers once a year to show them what they have in their account, issue them their individual passbooks, and certify the amounts entered therein. For example, if the value of the stock is $1,000--everyone refers to that figure, but the actual figure is not yet known--each citizen will receive his or her passbook, in which that figure has been entered. The following year, through capitalization, dividends, stock market transactions, etc., he or she will have, say, $1,200, and will be visited and informed of it in person. When the account is opened, the citizen will no longer be the owner of that stock, but rather of its value. And even if, on the following day, all of the shares are sold, the citizen will have benefited from 100 percent of the value of the state-owned enterprises as of the date of the transfer. The shares need to be traded in order to maximize the yield of the savings. In other words, if tomorrow, ENTEL [National Telecommunications Enterprise] begins to be a financially troubled enterprise, the citizen is safeguarded, because the pension fund manager will sell that stock and buy stock, say, in YPFB, or the Brewery, or General Motors, or what have you. Within certain limits, the fund manager could even transfer the managed stocks outside of Bolivia, as all individual-capitalization pension funds do, because the object is to maximize the yield. The same will occur when there is a capital increase. Let us suppose that, five years from now, ENFE [National Railway Enterprise] needs an influx of new capital. The decision will have to be made by the fund management firms in the name of the Bolivians, because it cannot possibly be made by 3.2 million Bolivians. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen this road. A physical distribution of the shares is an insoluble problem, a lunacy, because there are physical problems, problems of speculation, of abuse, and in sum, many things that have dissuaded us from that approach, which was the one I initially favored. But it cannot be done that way, and we have opted for the approach wherein the stockholders have representatives managing their money, whose objective is the same as that of the stockholders: maximizing the return on those savings. These representatives will attend stockholder meetings. Certainly some, representing all, will be members of the boards. It is they who will approve budgets, etc. The day that an enterprises goes into the red, they will leave it and move funds to another, because the enterprises will not be operating jointly, but individually. [PRESENCIA] Does this not contradict the example the president cites when he recounts how the idea of capitalization occurred to him? It is that of the small farmer who seeks a partner to invest in his land, and does not need to sell it. According to your explanation, the enterprises will no longer belong to the Bolivians. [Illanes] There will be a restriction as to those to whom stocks may be sold. It is hardly likely that there will even be a domestic market for those stocks for some time to come. We are going to have to create it with the funds that these pension managers put into those enterprises. It is like a bank: Its capital is the contribution made by its stockholders, and the money of the savings accounts is in trust under the bank's management. Pension funds operate in a similar manner, except that the savings are long-term deposits. In this case, the future direct or indirect profits of those firms belong to the Bolivians. [PRESENCIA] What happens if one of them goes bankrupt? [Illanes] How can it go bankrupt? In the first place, we are demanding that the fund management firms be of international class, highly experienced, and well capitalized, so that what they invest here will be 1 percent of their assets. Thus, we will have the backing of a parent company. Secondly, there will be regulations and a superintendency of pension funds--like that of banks--that will audit them continuously. In all of these financial entities, there are mechanisms for avoiding disasters. For example, since the Superintendency of Banks has been in operation, the banks have been doing just fine. Before, it was a travesty. There is only one way that the management firms could go bankrupt, and that is, for the six state-owned enterprises to do so. But that would mean that the country has gone to hell, that Bolivia has gone bankrupt. [PRESENCIA] If the stockholder dies, is the saving passed on to the stockholder's heirs? [Illanes] Of course. There will certainly be the alternative of either receiving a lump-sum settlement or an additional number of years of pension, because, by actuarial calculations, the value of the fund will grow. We are creating a new system of social security and, above all, an attitude toward saving that currently does not exist in Bolivia. Our level of saving is probably one of the world's lowest, and being a poor nation is not an excuse. Twenty or 25 years ago, countries as poor or poorer than we, like the Asiatic ones, had a level of saving equal to 35 percent of GDP [gross domestic product]--and they are maintaining it--because of the high value they place on the mentality of living frugally and saving for the future. I believe that we save 7 to 8 percent of our GDP. With this new mentality, we will begin to save voluntarily upon seeing that our parents have an adequate retirement pension. Thus, first we are going to raise the level of saving. We are going to create a social security that I believe is of utmost importance, perhaps the single most important thing. Second, Bolivia's big problem is that over the past six years its economy has grown at an average rate of 3.7 percent annually, and that is not sufficient to recover what we have lost. During the period of hyperinflation around the beginning of the 1980's, we lost 30 percent of our per capita production, and at our current rate of growth it will take us 35 years to reach where we were in 1980. We, therefore, have to break the vicious circle by means of investment, and the only way to do it is through capitalization. An investment of $3 billion cannot other than generate massive direct or indirect employment and further incremental investment. And our GDP will thus rise. I believe that by 1997, with that $3 billion, we should be growing at the rate of 8 percent annually. The economists express alarm: There will be an "overheating" of the economy, they say. Well, what do you know! I can only wish that were the problem on my hands, rather than the current depression and this snail-paced growth. [PRESENCIA] What is the reason for first forming a mixed state-and-private-owned corporation? [Illanes] It is a legal mechanism for transforming the enterprise into a corporation later. Otherwise, we would have to call for bids, obtain a proposal, then go to Congress and request approval. The reason is a practical one. Besides, there is the desire that the workers become stockholders in the enterprises that are to be capitalized. They will be able to do this through their social benefits. [PRESENCIA] What is going to be sold to investors? [Illanes] Under this plan, the state never sells anything. That is the big point. Let us say that a state-owned enterprise has a present-day worth of 1,000. With its transformation into a mixed corporation, the entry of workers adds 10, bring its worth to a total of 1,010. Then comes the third stage, that of its incorporation, in which the investor puts up 1,010, at which point the enterprise is worth 2,020. The original 1,000 goes to the people; that is, we have sacrificed nothing, we have sold nothing, assuming that the provider of capital is going to put up the enterprise's book value. Actually, however, the provider of capital will be investing more. The YPFB's books, for example, do not include as entries the contract with Brazil or the hydrocarbon reserves because the deposits do not belong to YPFB, but they can include the financial value of the expected exploitation of those deposits. [PRESENCIA] Who is going to set the value? [Illanes] The market. [PRESENCIA] Another question to which the proposed bill has given rise is: If the enterprise's objective is profit, how will the state address works of a social nature, such as rural electrification, for example? [Illanes] Two things can be done. First, adjust rates and bring operations into the black. Second, subsidize through the electrification enterprises, which is much easier, because there will be competition and many power distribution companies (we are not talking here of power generation). For example, there is an isolated system that is having terrible problems--the SETAR [Tarija Electric Service]--first because it does not collect past-due amounts owed to it and hence does not pay its debts, and second, it charges ridiculous rates because it is a very small system. A private corporation will certainly invest money and will interconnect with the rest of the system in order to lower its operating costs. I believe that is a viable approach to the solution. In the case of very small enterprises, capitalization is not applicable, because it is a very complex process. Therefore, they will be auctioned, sold, or transferred to the private or cooperatives sector. [PRESENCIA] Capitalization is a thesis. What is its antithesis? [Illanes] Continuing in our present situation, or worse. I see no other solution. The big problem is that the basic thesis is not ours alone; it is worldwide. We have given it a social, plural content. We believe that capitalization will produce a permanent and growing effect. And since this is the international turn of mind, the international institutions and all the countries that offer us aid, loans, or grants reflect that mentality. Today, the World Bank does not want to lend money to drill wells, or build hydroelectric plants or railroads, but rather for health, education, and basic welfare. If state-owned enterprises want to survive they must resort to banks for loans. And if they have been unable to survive to date with low- or no-cost loans, how can they do so on commercial loans, while remaining in the hands of the state, with its inefficiency, its political meddling? Not that the state is a poor manager. The problem is that the managers appointed by the state, good or bad though they be, have to cope with political meddling. Every four years, there are changes of personnel, including the managers. This produces total instability in the careers of the workers and professionals, and hinders the making of plans, the programming of investment, etc. What we are now trying to do is isolate the enterprises from political influence, by transferring them to private-sector management. If we do not capitalize, those enterprises will die, and that would be unquestionably a disaster for Bolivia, because the country would lose revenue and jobs. As things stand now, the state-owned enterprises cannot survive. [Box, p 2] Strategic Sectors?... Rubbish! After the explanation given by Minister of Economic Development Fernando Illanes on the necessity of attracting capital, we asked if the influx of that capital might not bring with it the danger of creating a state within a state. He emphatically rejected that possibility. "We are not going back to Patino's time. Let me give you an example. In 1952, when the mines were nationalized, Mr. Simon Patino personally was worth $4.2 billion (whose relative value today would be 10 times more than that). There is probably not a single enterprise in Bolivia that is worth even half that figure. In other words Simon Patino would be worth some $40 or $42 billion in current dollars. We are talking about a gentleman who was worth $4.2 billion in a country whose budget at the time, by all reckoning, was surely not even $1 billion, and whose GDP was not even $1 billion." Furthermore, he explained, there will be regulations. "Insofar as possible, the market will be wide open. The market for YPFB, which is the largest of the enterprises, will be the widest open, because in its case it is indeed possible. There are others that, as the economists are saying, are natural monopolies, and one of the few among them is ENFE [National Railways Enterprise]. "As for the rest, I believe it will certainly be possible to open them up to, if not total market transparency, then at least, in the worst of cases, to one or more oligopolies that will be strictly regulated and supervised by a regulatory body having oversight over the energy, hydrocarbons, rail, and airlines sectors, etc." The minister believes that, for these reasons, "no single enterprise will be able to wield economic power of such huge dimensions," and much less so if it is in the hands of not just a few people, but of "hundreds of thousands or millions of stockholders," so that decisions are arrived at through a meeting of the stockholders and boards of directors. He therefore asserts: "There will no longer be kings of tin. I cannot imagine that happening. The conditions no longer exist that might create such a distortion in our economy, which is now very much more diversified. Before, we produced tin, period." In another vein, we asked the minister whether it might be possible for strategic sectors to be manipulated by international capital. Illanes categorically rejected the idea. "That line of thought marks a generational abyss. I do not believe in the word `strategic.' I very much hope that a transnational will come forth, and not some small-time company, because our market is so insignificant that we are doing handsprings specifically to attract big-time transnational capital. It is our only hope of guaranteeing that these grounded enterprises will be refloated, because they require colossal investments and international markets. "To my mind, only the human being is strategic. The rest is rubbish. Pardon my frankness, but I do not believe in strategic sectors." [Box, p 2] Everyone Will End Up With Less There being no other way to broach the subject, Fernando Illanes was asked directly about his forthcoming negotiations with the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] and the universities, and the degrees of flexibility he can bring to bear. Without hesitation, he termed it "a question without a response, because if I had degrees of flexibility I could not reveal them since I would then be exposing my negotiating cards. And if I said none, I would be lying." He stated that the meetings held with the universities thus far had been productive and cordial, and that he had offered them, "within my concept that the human being is the country's most important asset, personally to make every possible effort to satisfy their needs. I know that I shall not be able to satisfy them to the extent of 100 percent, I told them, but I can at least improve the present situation of the universities." "But," he added, "everyone wants more, including myself for my ministry. And I have not succeeded in obtaining it, because I have a secretary for finance and an undersecretary for the budget who are more hard-nosed than I." He said there should be no distinction between the technical and the political as regards relationships with the different sectors. We need to do the right thing, he said, "and not resort to distortion or to causing unrest somewhere just to win votes. That sort of thing, it seems, is what is called politics," he stated with irony. Nevertheless, he asserted that the government will necessarily "cause unrest throughout the nation, as well as in all the ministries, because no one is receiving what it set out to receive. No one, absolutely no one." And, he said, this state of things will continue "until capital begins to flow into Bolivia. If that flow does not occur, our future will be one of very slow growth, which is not a solution for the people of Bolivia. And a solution that does not resolve the problem of the majority of the Bolivians is not a solution. Another one has to be found."
