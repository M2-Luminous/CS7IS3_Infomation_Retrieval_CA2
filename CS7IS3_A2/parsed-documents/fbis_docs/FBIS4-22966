I. Khurgin, Moscow; UDC 51.57.591] [Abstract] The inadequacy of the probabilistic-statistical approach to data processing is shown in a geophysical study of wells. The drawbacks of this approach are discussed in detail. The proposed alternative is the treatment of measured parameters as fuzzy numbers and the determination of the main parameters of oil- and gas-bearing strata (obtained by solving petrophysical equations) as solutions of fuzzy systems of algebraic equations. The appropriate mathematical vehicle is developed. The problem of solving a fuzzy linear system of algebraic equations is reduced to a nonlinear programming problem.
