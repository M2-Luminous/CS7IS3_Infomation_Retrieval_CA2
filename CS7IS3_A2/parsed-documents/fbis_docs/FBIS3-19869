What will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more modern? [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and maintenance of the Armed Forces. Over the past few years we have witnessed profound changes in the Armed Forces, ranging from the initiation of new laws governing the body to the new personnel recruitment and pay systems, with a view to the greater effectiveness of the Armed Forces. The changes in the EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes. [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that plan? [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low point.... [Saraiva] What do you mean by that? [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete. Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their aims. We are never satisfied. [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of motivation to serve the Armed Forces? [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the Portuguese people have always known how to defend the fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces depends to some extent on the perception of the threats surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation. Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating factor. Any Army professional likes to have his M-60's, any Air Force man eagerly awaits the F-16's; naturally, any sailor is pleased with the Vasco da Gama-class frigates. With respect to the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they will be reintegrated into civilian life. However, it is in education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the schools and at home. [Saraiva] With respect to the so-called performance of military duties, which system do you prefer -- compulsory military service or the volunteer and contract system? [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum. Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the volunteer system -- for instance, Britain -- and others that have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system is pure. All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still have to resort to general mobilization. [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other countries? [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European countries -- specifically, in France. [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose sole aim seems to be to attract less-qualified young people to join up. [Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years, compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the basic education that was not given in the schools. It is well known that many young people from the poorest families who came from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is exercised in a more sophisticated way. [Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed Forces who say that the fighting military component could be disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which the forces are not, at first sight, designed? [Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small, but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good training. So the vocational training process helps modernize the Armed Forces, and if that training can be projected outside, so as to benefit those whom have performed military service, I can see no harm in our civilianizing the training that we currently give young people. [Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the prevailing international situation? [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East-West conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility. Today, the scene is completely different. In the current multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts that require limited but well-trained and more flexible Armed Forces. In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's interest on the international scene. [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces should have taken part more actively in the conflict. [Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces. However, I will simply say that Portugal should act in the just defense of its interests. [passage omitted]
