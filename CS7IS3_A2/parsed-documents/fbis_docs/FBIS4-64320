Finance Minister Anne Wibble paints the picture of a black economic future for Sweden if we do not become members. Outside the EU we will be threatened by mass unemployment or low wages and low environmental standards. Wibble was speaking at the launch of a translation of an EU white book on the economy yesterday. "If we do not become members we will not attract any investment," Finance Minister Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) said. What arguments can Sweden use to attract investment if we are not members of the EU? "Why should companies invest in Sweden if Sweden is not part of the core market?" Wibble asked. If Sweden cannot offer a stable relationship with Europe investors will choose to invest in other countries. In such a situation Sweden would then have to try to compete using the tool of low wages and low taxes or perhaps lower environmental standards, the finance minister said. If we are outside we have a simple choice between lowering our standards or accepting mass unemployment. If things look black for Sweden outside the EU, the white book does not paint a bright picture of the situation inside the EU. Over the last 20 years unemployment has been rising the whole time, with a brief exception in the eighties. At the same time, in all important economic respects the EU's competitiveness has worsened in comparison with the United States and Japan. The reason why the EU has produced its white book on the economy is unemployment. Today 17 million are unemployed. This is 11 percent of the EU's active population. And before the end of the year unemployment could rise to 18 million, the EU's ambassador to Sweden, Jaime Cavanillas y Junquera, said at the launch of the Swedish translation of the white book. Anne Wibble said that in the past the EU has not made sufficient effort to combat unemployment. But now unemployment is top of the EU agenda -- and this is a good thing. The white book is a thorough review of various possible ways of strengthening the economy, growth, and employment. What is especially important is that it dismisses the notion that technological progress is a cause of unemployment, Wibble said. It also dismisses the notion that job-sharing is a way of resolving the crisis. Rationing jobs to make them go further among more people is no solution, the EU notes in its white book. In the United States there has been growth in employment. But many of the new jobs are so badly paid that people cannot live on them. In Europe growth has been less, but the jobs that have been created are better paid. We do not want to be forced to choose between the American and the continental European experiences, Wibble said.
