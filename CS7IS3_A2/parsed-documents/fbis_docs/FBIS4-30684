Why? [Kakizawa] I am not totally skeptical. We are in favor of the initiative. It is a constructive proposal. But I do not share the optimism of those who say that the issue has now been resolved. Further details are required concerning the agreement reached between the U.S. and North Korean leaders. There are still ambiguous or vague points which must be cleared up. For example, what exactly is meant by "freezing" the nuclear program? Similarly, with regard to the guarantees, do the promises made to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] also involve the reprocessing installations to which Pyongyang has so far denied access? These are fundamental questions. [LE MONDE] The Japanese press reports that Prime Minister Hata declared that "North Korea probably has no nuclear weapons" and that its refusal to grant inspections of its nuclear sites is due to "a desire not to succumb to external blackmail." Do you share this opinion? [Kakizawa] That is not the idea Mr. Hata was seeking to express. He simply pointed out that President Kim Il-song stated that he does not want nuclear weapons and that he lacks the economic capacity to conduct such a program. Mr. Hata was simply expressing his hope that these words were well-founded. In any event, we do not know if Pyongyang already has the bomb or if it wants to have one. [LE MONDE] How do you interpret the behavior of the North Korean leaders? Have they made mistakes or are they pursuing a subtle strategy? [Kakizawa] I believe they are playing a quite intelligent game. They probably already have reprocessing installations. Would they need such equipment if it was simply for a civil program? It is doubtful. I think they are playing for time. Is it not odd that Kim Il-song is thinking -- as he said to Mrs. Miki, the wife of the former Japanese premier -- of a meeting with the South Korean president on 15 August? I find this rather late for a meeting which it was said should take place "as soon as possible." [LE MONDE] North Korea is in the process of achieving one of its aims: With Mr. Carter's visit, it obtained direct dialogue with the United States. Is this not already a success? [Kakizawa] This is true. It is a diplomatic success. But North Korea's ultimate aim is to normalize relations with the United States and obtain an undertaking from Washington not to use force against Pyongyang. [LE MONDE] In your opinion, what sanctions should be imposed against North Korea? [Kakizawa] They must be progressive. They should not be seen as a punishment but as concerted pressure in order to induce Pyongyang to return to the Nonproliferation Treaty and to ensure that it respects the IAEA provisions. North Korea must not feel threatened by sanctions which are an expression of international solidarity. [LE MONDE] Is China's position of crucial importance in finding a solution to this crisis? [Kakizawa] Most certainly. China's support is essential if sanctions are to prove effective. If it refuses to apply its sanctions (that is, in its case, to suspend border trade with Pyongyang) the effect will be practically nil, even if Japan stops North Koreans living on the island from sending money home. [LE MONDE] This crisis once again shows the limits to Japan's ability to intervene on the international stage. Although this time the crisis is on its very doorstep, it could not have been a party to military measures. Yet one of Japan's aims is to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. What constitutional changes would allow Japan to assume the responsibilities that come with such a status? [Kakizawa] A revision of the Constitution is not a necessary condition for Japan's entry into the Security Council as a permanent member. The intervention of UN peacekeeping forces for which Japan may possibly supply troops must, we believe, remain quite limited. These forces must remain neutral and limit themselves to surveillance activities. Our Constitution does not provide an obstacle within such a framework. [LE MONDE] Bearing in mind its constraints, what could Japan's role be within the Security Council? [Kakizawa] It could make a positive contribution on several levels. First of all, financial. Who pays for the operations? First the United States and then Japan. We fully accept this funding responsibility. Yet the United States seems to want to reduce its contribution. Is that because France is willing to contribute more? That would surprise me. If it becomes a permanent member, Japan is prepared to assume a higher financial burden. Also, precisely because of the pacifist commitments in the Constitution, Japan may seek to influence the UN role more clearly toward preventive diplomacy. As was the case in Cambodia. Finally, Japan will be the only country in the Council not to have nuclear weapons. It will therefore be well placed to exercise its influence with a view to reducing nuclear weapons. As long as the Council continues to consist of countries with a nuclear capability that are logically seeking to maintain their military supremacy, no progress will be possible. [LE MONDE] When could Japan join the Council? [Kakizawa] In 1995, the United Nations will be celebrating its 50th anniversary and there is talk of changing the Charter. The United States and some 50 other countries are in favor of Japanese membership. We are aware of the positive stance taken by France on this question. But some of your leaders express doubts on our ability to assume the responsibilities of a permanent member. The statements by [French Foreign Minister] Juppe are encouraging, but President Mitterrand seems to have reservations. [LE MONDE] Some countries fear that the presence of Japan as a permanent member of the Security Council would produce, due to the links between Washington and Tokyo, a second U.S. voice? [Kakizawa] I do not believe so. I believe that we will demonstrate our independence. China is already a permanent member but does it represent Asia? It is a rather special case. On the other hand, Japan could no doubt better represent the region within the Council. [LE MONDE] That is the sensitive issue due to the scars of history. Do you think that these countries really want to be represented by Japan? [Kakizawa] I do not know if they want to be or not, but they must face reality. Interdependence between Japan and Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly close. Everybody believes that an increased role for Japan is essential. Following the statements by the former Japanese justice minister denying that the Nankin massacre in 1937 ever took place, China and Korea reacted, but they do so calmly. Japan must certainly not forget the past, but above all we must make more effort to build the future. [LE MONDE] What do you think of Mr. Clinton's policy in Asia? [Kakizawa] The new team did not have a great deal of diplomatic experience. Today, I believe that Washington has become aware of the Asian situation. With regard to China, he has realized that his own values cannot be too brutally imposed. Human rights must be respected by the Chinese Government, but progress must be gradual. On this point the Clinton administration has become more realistic. With regard to Japan, the United States first imposed its quantified targets for reducing its trade surplus. It then became more reasonable in order to avoid trade conflicts. If economic relations were to deteriorate, political links would also be affected. The direction taken by the United States is favorable to the renewal of mutual confidence.
