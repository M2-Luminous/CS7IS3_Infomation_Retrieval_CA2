However, he declined to give details of the meeting, saying that it was "secret." It was not ruled out that Simonenko's step was a result of a thoroughly planned policy of opposition to the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and was aimed at consolidating voters in favour of a leader of a Socialist Party, Aleksandr Morozov. The move was apparently made to take advantage of the obvious disappointment of the Ukrainian population in the present leadership and its failure to ensure normal life in the country. Apart from Leonid Kravchuk, taking part in the presidential race are Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch, Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, Vice-Premiers Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor Pinzenik, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk and one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs, Valeriy Babich. Ivan Plyushch is said to stand the best chance of being elected as a supporter of concentrating executive power in the hands of one person within a system of soviets as a form of state system. If Kravchuk fails to postpone elections, he will find it difficult to remain in his post.
