Last Sunday [27 March], the first prototype, DA-1, undertook a successful 70-minute maiden flight, starting from Dasa's own airfield. Dasa's chief test pilot, Peter Weger (51), gave an account of his flight in DA-1: "Extremely easy to fly, just as on the simulator, much more stable than the Tornado." During the first flight in what is currently the most modern combat aircraft in the world, Weger already felt secure enough to extend and bring back in the landing gear and to simulate a landing approach. It was only after the first flight of DA-1 that Weger realized he had made history: He is the first German to make a maiden flight in a multinational military aircraft destined for serial production after World War II. In the case of the "Tornado," more than 20 years ago, the pilot was British. At the "official" first flight of EF-2000 in Ingolstadt, State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm, in charge of armament in the Defense Ministry, will stand in for Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. Ruehe will not attend the official first flight of the four nations (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain) in Warton, England, on 4 May, either. When Ruehe became defense minister some two years ago, he initially held the view that a new combat aircraft was not necessary. Later, he changed his view, saying "a new aircraft for a new time." Yesterday [28 March], industry referred to this rather skeptical view held by the German defense minister and to the clear rejection of the Eurofighter by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] (defense expert Kolbow: An SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] government will not buy the aircraft), adding: "We Germans still have great problems being accepted as partners by the others." The current situation is such that the DA-1 prototype will only be tested in the air for 10 hours by Dasa in Ingolstadt; after that, it will be transferred to England. Great Britain has secured "the entire flight test program." This is a heavy setback for Germany as a business location, an industrial expert said. After the successful first flight, Dasa is "therefore, beginning to rethink." It insists on the number of test flights being increased.
