The commissioner of police, General P. Seleke, is also out of office. This follows an announcement by the South African Government that its ambassador, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt, has taken over as acting administrator of the homeland. Dr. van der Walt said at a news conference that Mr. Mangope had accepted that he was no longer in power. He had returned to his house at Matswedi and measures had been taken to ensure his safety. Dr. van der Walt said the joint South Africa and Bophuthatswana security forces had succeeded in stabilizing the situation in the homeland. Dr. van der Walt said there would now be free political activity in Bophuthatswana, South African constitutional regulations would apply, and South African officials could be seconded to assist with the administration of the homeland. Shops would be able to reopen from tomorrow, and glass companies had been approached to repair broken display windows to discourage further looting. It was hoped to have schools reopened as soon as possible, and steps would be taken to get the television services back on the air. Dr. van der Walt appealed to striking public servants to return to work, and said their salaries and pensions were secure.
