On the Hong Kong issue, however, Sino-British talks were terminated unilaterally by the British side, which deliberately raised obstacles, although both sides had carried out 17 rounds of talks for more than seven months. This is an unfavorable factor to Hong Kong's steady transition, but not a decisive factor. Hong Kong's economic situation is good. Some 12 percent of Hong Kong people who have settled down abroad over the past 10 years or so have returned. Many Hong Kong citizens say that they have full confidence in Hong Kong's future. The breakdown of talks is something we do not wish to see. This has been proved by the unremitting efforts the Chinese side has made from the beginning to the end of the talks. However, what has now happened is also not unexpected. As early as 1982 when meeting with former British Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave the following prediction: "What I am concerned about is how to ensure a smooth transition in the next 15 years. I am afraid that great disorders may appear during this period. But they will all be manmade disorders, disorders made not only by foreigners, but also Chinese, but mainly the British." The old-line British colonialists have occupied the territory of Hong Kong, their last colony, for more than 100 years. They will certainly be unhappy about quiting immediately, although they also often spout high-sounding words of democracy. The current problem is how we should look at the situation we are facing. Some Hong Kong citizens with foresight said: "We must rely on our own efforts to ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong." In the past, because of the weak and corrupted royal court of the Qing Dynasty and the force of the British imperialists, three unequal treaties were signed. As a result, Britain has occupied this Chinese territory for more than 100 years. On 19 December 1984, the heads of the Chinese and British Governments signed in Beijing a joint declaration on the Hong Kong issue after two years of talks. On 27 May 1985, the two governments put the Sino-British Joint Declaration into effect by exchanging instruments of ratification in Beijing. The long-cherished wishes of the Chinese people finally came true. This could never have been done either by the Qing Court or in old China. The dream of the Chinese people can be turned into reality only today, when China has become powerful. In his speech delivered at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central Advisory Commission, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Why could talks on the Hong Kong issue be held successfully? It was not because the participants on our side had special skills. The main reason was that our country had developed in the past few years and become a prosperous country, a powerful country, and a trustworthy country. We keep our word and mean what we say." Hong Kong's prosperity and return and Macao's return have all benefited from this, and so will the reunification of the motherland in the future. This is where our confidence lies. Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and with the intensification of reform and expansion of the opening up drive, our country will become more powerful. The party and state are fully confident on this point. By adhering to the policy of "one country, two systems," further intensifying reform, and opening wider to the outside world, the Basic Law will go deeper into the hearts of the people....Our future is certainly bright. The new year is approaching. Let us look at the brighter future with full confidence!
