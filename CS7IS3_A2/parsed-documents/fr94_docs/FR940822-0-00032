FR940822-0-00032 FR940822-0-00009 (1) Commercial aviation fuel is held exclusively for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft only if the person that holds the commercial aviation fuel at the first moment of October 1, 1995, actually uses the aviation fuel in that exempt use. (2) Commercial aviation fuel is not held exclusively for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft if, at the first moment of October 1, 1995, the commercial aviation fuel is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the aviation fuel as supplies for vessels or aircraft). Thus, for example, commercial aviation fuel held by a fixed base operator for sale to an airline for use in foreign trade is not exempt from the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427. (b) Exception for certain amounts of fuel _(1) In general. The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax does not apply to commercial aviation fuel that a person holds at the first moment of October 1, 1995, if the aggregate amount of commercial aviation fuel held by that person at that moment does not exceed 2,000 gallons. (2) Additional rules relating to the 2,000 gallon exception _(i) Coordination with other exemptions. In determining the aggregate amount of commercial aviation fuel held by a person at the first moment of October 1, 1995, there is to be excluded the amount of commercial aviation fuel exempt from the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) of this section (relating to fuel held for an exempt use). (ii) All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded. The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of commercial aviation fuel held by a person (and not exempt from tax under paragraph (a) of this section) if the aggregate amount of commercial aviation fuel held by the person at the first moment of October 1, 1995, exceeds 2,000 gallons. (iii) Controlled groups. A member of a controlled group (as defined in §47.3&hyph;2) holds more than 2,000 gallons of commercial aviation fuel if the aggregate amount of all commercial aviation fuel held by all members of the controlled group exceeds 2,000 gallons. (3) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (b): Example. D, E, and F are members of the same controlled group. On October 1, 1995, D holds 2,000 gallons of commercial aviation fuel. E holds 1,500 gallons of commercial aviation fuel, and F holds 500 gallons of commercial aviation fuel. None of the commercial aviation fuel is held for an exempt use. Because the aggregate amount held by all members of the group is 4,000 gallons, which exceeds 2,000 gallons, all commercial aviation fuel held by each member is subject to the floor stocks tax. Thus, D is liable for tax of $86.00 (2,000×$.043), E is liable for tax of $64.50 (1,500×$.043), and F is liable for tax of $21.50 (500×$.043). §47.3&hyph;11 Requirements with respect to payment and return for the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax. (a) Payment of tax. The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax is to be paid without assessment or notice on or before April 30, 1996. (b) Filing of returns_ (1) Form 720. Every person liable for the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax must make a return of the tax on Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. The return is to be prepared and filed in accordance with the instructions relating to the return. (2) Time for filing_ (i) In general. The Form 720 required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be filed on or before April 30, 1996, and is a return for the first calendar quarter of 1996. A first return reporting only October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final return'' must be marked. (ii) Return reporting other taxes. A person must file only one Form 720 for a quarter. If a person is required under part 40 of this chapter to file Form 720 for the first calendar quarter of 1996 for other excise taxes on or before May 31, 1996, that person files a single Form 720 for the quarter on or before May 31, 1996. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not extend the time for making deposits or paying any excise tax. PART 48_MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS EXCISE TAXES Par. 2.
