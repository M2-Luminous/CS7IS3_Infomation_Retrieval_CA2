Speaking at a press conference after a regular cabinet meeting, Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be concluded. "We have secured the amount needed for (domestic) supply. And we have no import plans for this year," Kato said. The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and distribution, was to import a total of some 2.66 million tons of rice to make up for the shortage caused by last year's poor harvest. As for rice imports contracted so far, China was the biggest exporter with 1.07 million tons, followed by Thailand with 753,000 tons, the United States with 537,000 tons and Australia with 183,000 tons. Of these, 2.21 million tons were for table use, while the remainder were for processed foods. In a related development, the food agency said Tuesday that short-and medium-grain rice mainly imported from the U.S. And China totaled 1.7 million tons of the 2.41 million tons of nonglutinous rice contracted for import. Of the 1.7 million tons, 700,000 tons had been sold to wholesalers by June 16, the agency said. Long-grain rice imported from Thailand, which turned out to be unpopular with Japanese people, who usually eat short- and medium- grain rice, totaled 710,000 tons, of which 420,000 tons have been sold. With the agency now providing mainly short-and medium-grain rice to wholesalers, agency officials said they expect a stockpile of some 100,000 to 200,000 tons of long-grain rice by the end of October.
