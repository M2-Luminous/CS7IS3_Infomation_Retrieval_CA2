The conferees agreed to: 1) Establish close ties with concerned nations and strive for stabilization of foreign exchange rates; 2) Work for early passage of the fiscal year 1994 budget; 3) Expedite completion of plans for deregulation; and 4) Strive for implementation of tax system reform within the current year. The conference was attended by the prime minister and four cabinet members, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai as substitute for Minister of Finance Fujii who was traveling overseas, Minister of International Trade and Industry Hata, Economic Planning Agency Director General Terasawa, and Management and Coordination Agency Director General Ishida. A briefing was given by the Ministry of Finance on the current foreign exchange rates and discussions were held on measures to be taken in response to the strong yen and its impact on the economy. As a result, the conference affirmed maintenance of sustained growth centered on domestic demand and implementation of reforms such as deregulation as basic policies for management of the future economy. Among the four items agreed upon, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, the conferees agreed that "Japan would maintain close liaison with concerned nations and take appropriate and timely actions," to cope with trends in the foreign currency markets. The conferees also confirmed plans to reinforce foreign exchange stabilization measures by taking actions such as cooperative intervention involving yen-selling and dollar-buying with Europe and the United States if the yen should rise further. The conference also agreed to expedite work on deregulation plans that will be a principal feature of international economic countermeasures to be compiled by June and that the plans will be "substantive in nature." They also affirmed that work on tax reform--consisting primarily of an income tax cut and consumption tax increase--will include thorough consideration of public opinion and the understanding and cooperation of the respective parties and factions, completion of a draft plan in June, and implementation during the current year.
