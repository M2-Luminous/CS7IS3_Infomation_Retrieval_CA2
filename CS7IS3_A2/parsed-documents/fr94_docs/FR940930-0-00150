FR940930-0-00150 FR940930-0-00028 Furthermore, a review of the 1993 HDE federal certification results clarifies the magnitude of the developmental task for manufacturers to achieve extremely low- emission levels, especially for diesels. The data, which represents engines tested on federal certification fuel, indicates that no current gasoline or diesel HDE family meets or is close to the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr standard on federal certification fuel (for diesel and gasoline engines NMHC and HC are roughly equivalent). Of the 9 gasoline HDE families certified in 1993, three are within one g/Bhp-hr of the standard (see Figure 1). Based on the aftertreatment control technology used by and available for gasoline engines, EPA believes that 3.15 g/Bhp-hr level would be within reach for a number of these families. For diesel engines, however, the 1993 heavy-duty engine federal certification results presented in Figure 1 indicate that achieving the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr standard on federal diesel fuel would be extremely problematic for the majority of engine families by 1998. However, five of the 37 diesel engine families certified in 1993 are within one g/Bhp-hr of the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO X level (equivalent to NO X -certification level of 3.0 g/Bhp-hr), indicating that a standard in this range would more likely be achieved by a variety of diesel engines on federal certification fuel than would the 3.15 level. Only one of 37 diesel engine families certified in 1993 is within one g/Bhp-hr of the 3.15 level; most have combined HC and NO X certification levels of 5.5 g/Bhp-hr or less. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER30SE94.000 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C There are two existing sets of regulations that will drive heavy-duty engine technology towards low NMHC+NO X levels: the federal 1998 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO X standard, and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty vehicles of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO X . EPA received many comments in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;28 stating that the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO X standard for all 1998 and later HDEs, which is one g/Bhp-hr lower than the existing standard, is feasible for diesel engines. Development of the technology necessary to comply with the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO X standard will make it more likely that a significant number of light and medium diesel HDE families will be able to reach emission levels slightly below 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO X on federal diesel fuel in the future, but it is unlikely that this federal standard will force the development of technologies needed to achieve a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO X standard on such fuel (i.e., NO X levels of 3.0 g/Bhp-hr or less) since there is no federal requirement to reach lower levels.
