In particular, the two countries forged special ties during and after World War II, thus making Britain an "exception" to its European partners, which simply called it the Atlantic faction (as opposed to the European faction). Since the end of the Cold War, Anglo-American relations have undergone profound changes along with the changes in the macroscopic climate. Some people hold that the special ties between Britain and the United States will "inevitably disappear," and others even say that the so-called special ties between the two countries do not exist any longer. Some Western media said: Ever since Clinton assumed power, the special ties between Britain and the United States have deteriorated to a "worrying extent." This is because the Conservatives did not support Clinton in the U.S. election. Therefore, how should the changes in Anglo-American relations in the post-Cold War period be assessed, and what are the reasons for these changes? State Interests At the Roots Generally speaking, personal friendships between leaders of different countries certainly have importance in relations between the countries concerned. People always equated the special ties between Britain and the United States with close wartime cooperation between Churchill and Roosevelt, the partnership between Macmillan and Eisenhower and Kennedy, and the close personal relationship between Mrs. Thatcher and Reagan. Hence, when Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher stepped down and a generation of people influenced by World War II left the political arena with Bush, people were very naturally inclined to think that the special ties between Britain and the United States "were scaling down." They also predicted that the special ties "would inevitably disappear." Some British newspapers played up the event in late 1992 when Major failed to meet Clinton, then president-elect, during his visit to Washington, saying that Clinton had deliberately given the cold shoulder to Major. Similarly, Downing Street officials wanted Major to receive an invitation to visit the White House on the eve of the NATO summit, which was held in Brussels earlier this year. During the Reagan and Bush presidencies, such a visit was merely routine for the leaders of the two countries to consult with each other before making decisions on major issues. However, the United States did not show due respect, and the White House did not send any invitation to Major. It was alleged that Major had professed that he could never build close ties with Clinton. However, state and national interests are, in the final analysis, the basis for deciding state relations. Personal relationships between leaders ultimately hinge on state and national interests. It is true that a series of conflicts and frictions have arisen between Britain and the United States since the advent of the Clinton presidency. In his election campaign, Clinton proposed dispatching a peace envoy to Northern Ireland and reconsidering the membership composition of the Security Council. Britain was very unhappy and doubtful about this, holding that the former amounted to interference in Britain's internal affairs and the latter was intended to expand the permanent membership of the Security Council (with the accession of Germany and Japan to the council), which would weaken and undermine its power status (permanent membership of the Security Council being one of the important symbols which props up the status of Great Britain). On intervening in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the two countries also disagreed and argued with each other. Britain was against a U.S. proposal for NATO's direct intervention in an ethnic conflict, worrying that this move would endanger the lives of British soldiers performing humanitarian duties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the United States did not possess such misgivings as there were no U.S. troops there. During the Cold War years, it was common for Britain and the United States to have conflicts and policy differences on some concrete issues. However, under the then prerequisite of jointly dealing with the Soviet "threat," the two countries usually consulted with each other and made appropriate concessions and compromises to settle conflicts. In general, Britain avoided openly criticizing U.S. policy, whereas the United States paid heed to Britain's views and took Britain's demands and interests into consideration. However, with the end of the Cold War, the two countries lost their common enemy and the historical conditions and foundation on which their special relationship relied. Hence, their conflicts have become outstanding and the system of consultation has weakened. The role of Anglo-American relations in the diplomacy of the two countries is faced with a problem of reorientation. The U.S. ambassador to Britain frankly admitted that "because of the changes in Europe and in the world, U.S.-British relations must obviously change," but the question lies in "whether or not the United States and Britain still have similar interests. In this regard, I am not sure." Have No Alternative But To Face Reality In recent years, Anglo-American relations have become cooler and cooler, which is inseparable from the fact that Britain's international status and influence has declined since the end of the Cold War. In a certain sense, Britain was a beneficiary of the Cold War. As one of the major victor countries in World War II and the second power of the capitalist world during the initial post-war stage, Britain played an important role, along with the United States, in the process of forming and developing the post-war political and economic order. Later, Britain gradually declined and became a second-class, moderately developed country. However, it enjoyed certain prerogatives and superiority in defense in the West and in high-level global diplomacy under the Cold War situation, particularly due to its long-standing status as the closest ally of the United States. Therefore, it could play a larger role and exert greater influence than its strength allowed and played a certain mediating role in U.S.-Soviet dialogue, in East-West relations, and in relations between Europe and the United States. With the end of the Cold War, Britain's position has been weakened. Today, a country's international status is directly affected by its economic strength, and thus, Britain is weak. At present, Britain's population accounts for 1 percent of the world population, its GDP accounts for 4 percent, and its volume of trade accounts for 5 percent. Britain's economic strength ranks fourth in Europe (after Germany, France, and Italy). In addition, as NATO becomes less important as a military organization, Britain's military strength and political superiority due to its contribution to NATO's defense is gradually becoming less valuable. In short, at present, the importance of Britain to U.S. diplomatic and global strategy is obviously weakening. A sharp contrast with Britain is Germany. After shaking off various restrictions and fetters imposed on it under the Cold War system, Germany has appeared in the international arena as a leading or dominant power and has superseded Britain as the United States' key partner for cooperation. In particular, the drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's disintegration have given Germany much room for maneuver. Now, the United States treats Britain coldly and sets the focus of its Europe policy in striving for Germany's support and cooperation, saying that its relations with Germany is a kind of leading partnership. The fact that Anglo-American relations have weakened is also closely related to the eastward shift of the U.S. diplomatic focus. As pointed out by certain western scholars, the United States, in a certain sense, was also a loser in the Cold War. The Cold War caused a heavy burden to the United States and led to a relative decline in its power. At present, the United States is perplexed by domestic economic problems, and it is gradually shifting its attention and international interests from Europe to America as well as to the East Asia and Pacific regions, where rapid economic development is in sight. The United States has drastically reduced and will continue to cut its forces stationed in Europe, and its influence in Europe has already shrunk and will continue to shrink. Meanwhile, the fact that Britain and the United States are becoming estranged from each other also reflects the Clinton administration's declining interest in and attention to Western Europe. Mutual Support Still Counts As a European country with a moderate level of strength, Britain is focussing its key national interests and policies on Europe. It is irreversibly involved in the process of European integration. However, the former Great Britain is not willing to confine its role and influence to Europe. The ruling clique in Britain will not easily give up its special relationship with the United States and still wants to rely on residual close ties with the latter to continue to "punch above its weight" in the world (a remark made by Douglas Hurd). In fact, special Anglo-American ties and British's membership of the EC may not necessarily be incompatible with each other. Close Anglo-American historical and cultural ties enable it to better understand the U.S. way of thinking and exert influence on the United States more easily. On the other hand, Britain is also a member of the EC and its pragmatic tradition, balanced thinking, and broad field of vision from a global viewpoint can contribute to the formation of a united and sound "European choice," thus playing a certain unique role in coordinating European-American relations. It seems that even after the Cold War, the United States still needs Britain, its faithful ally. Although the United States won the Cold War, its relative strength has been much weakened. In order to ensure its leading position in the new post-Cold War global order, Washington needs the support and help of its allies. With the disappearance of the Soviet threat, internal conflicts between Western countries are becoming outstanding. Some original U.S. allies have, to a different extent and in different respects, become open or potential enemies. Under these circumstances, Britain's support and help seems to be more valuable and important. In the post Cold War process of readjusting its European policy and its relations with Europe, the United States obviously needs Britain's support. Whether the question is about European-American economic and trade relations or about NATO's reorganization and restructuring, Britain's position and attitude is close to that of the United States. When the United States utilizes the United Nations and other multilateral organizations to forcibly implement its own concepts of human rights and values in the name of keeping international peace and maintaining the new world order, Britain often plays the role of the most faithful U.S. ally. However, this writer should point out that as far as the readjustment of British foreign policy is concerned, close Anglo- American ties do not only have positive significance and effects. If such ties are handled well, Britain can definitely have greater weight and influence in the international arena, but if they are not handled properly, other European countries may treat such ties as a "Trojan horse" of the United States, which will become a constraint on Britain's further integration into Europe.
