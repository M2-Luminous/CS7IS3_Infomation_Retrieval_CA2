The officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said it is necessary to retain some curbs on technology which can be used for military purposes after Cocom dissolves. They said the ministry will especially closely examine technology exports to countries which are likely to face future conflicts. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls will conclude its 45-year-old history Thursday midnight, having been made redundant by the ending of the Cold War. A more broadly-based, flexible organization will succeed the agency by October. In the meantime, each nation will voluntarily retain curbs similar to those that were previously in place. The MITI officials said technology exports to North Korea, Libya, Iraq and Iran will be strictly controled, while curbs on shipments to former communist nations will be relaxed. They also said Japan, the United States, and the European Union (EU) will resume discussions in late April on the details of the new system, for example studying which items are to be controlled.
