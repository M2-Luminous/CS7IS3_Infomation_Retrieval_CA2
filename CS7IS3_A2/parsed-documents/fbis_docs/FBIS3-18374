[passage omitted] Yesterday Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], warned against strikes. Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt (FDP) told BILD: "I warn against destroying the nascent upswing through strikes and against deliberately trampling on the sprouting plant of economic development. Strike means a stop to the economic upswing and many thousands of unemployed at short notice. I appeal to the partners to the wage negotiations: You must finally approach each other and agree on flexible contracts, tailor-made for the different branches, regions, and problems of the companies. Think about the fact that we are all sitting in the same boat. I tell the helmsmen of the employers and trade unions: Either we want to reach the shore together or we will all sink."
