In the daily newspaper under your able direction, of today's date [date of the letter], the columnist Mr. Javier Ponce, in an article titled "Not That Way, Don Marcelo," says the following: "No sir. These deaths (of the soldiers and policemen killed on the Putumayo River) cause us as much sorrow as they cause you. But what we do not accept is that prisoners were taken without cause, just to allow the minister of defense to have the audacity to say that these captures prove that our borders are well defended. And there is nothing else to say. Nothing to prove. Nothing more to lie about...because the remains of lies are the truths of power." Mr. Ponce's remarks are a gratuitous and unfair accusation against the honesty of the minister of defense and the acts of an institution that has earned the trust of the Ecuadoran people. What basis does Mr. Ponce have to accuse the minister of defense of lying and of behaving with audacity? We cannot believe that his conduct is due to an incredible ingenuousness, but rather to the sickness of the most benighted sectarianism. Of the 11 prisoners taken in the Putumayo River sector, six admitted that they were guerrillas and that they had taken part in the massacre of 13 members of the security forces, who were doing their duty, trying to protect their fellow men from the scourge of drugs, and five admitted that they were collaborators of the narco-guerrillas. These 11 persons were not arrested by chance or on a whim, but on the basis of evidence verified by experienced professionals--for example, a watch belonging to one of the victims was found on one of the prisoners, and also after questioning hundreds of persons. In order to prevent subsequent malevolent charges, the military forces filmed the interrogations in which the captured guerrillas admitted the details of their participation in the ambush, including the coldblooded murder of four members of the security forces at the order of a certain Commander "Pedro," who required them to commit this crime or pay for their disobedience with their lives. I invite Mr. Ponce and the human rights defense organizations to verify with their own eyes what the video clearly shows. Despite the fact that the Armed Forces, from generals to conscripts, feel sincere respect for individuals and are under strict orders to avoid committing any violations, the Armed Forces command from the very first moment of this action issued written and oral orders to avoid any brutality or cruelty. As soon as the investigation was completed, which necessarily had to be carried out at the scene of the crime, the prisoners were transferred to Quito to be turned over to the police authorities. Not because the "minister of defense was going to shine by showing off prisoners within 48 hours," as Mr. Ponce irresponsibly says, but so that they could be tried by competent judges and have the opportunity to defend themselves. The civilized and law-abiding manner in which the Armed Forces have behaved, and that deserves the recognition of the Ecuadoran people, is shamefully denigrated by Mr. Ponce. The unquestionable fact that the narco-guerrillas have not penetrated, and coca and marijuana cultivation has not proliferated in such a difficult geographic area, inhabited by many illegal immigrants and not a few drug traffickers and criminals, is the result of devoted and persevering military patrolling that honors the Armed Forces, although Mr. Ponce may say that the prisoners were taken so that the minister of defense could have the audacity to say that the borders are well defended. The ambush did not take place in the interior of Ecuador, but on the banks of a border river. Credit cannot be denied the Armed Forces so arbitrarily, as Mr. Ponce so impudently does, while conferring it, also arbitrarily, on confessed malefactors. What is the aim of this type of behavior? Is it to destroy the credibility of the forces responsible for maintaining the law and security so that the Ecuadoran people will remain defenseless before the aggression of the narco-guerrillas? This is why the words of Mr. Ponce who says, referring to the murdered policemen and soldiers: "those deaths cause us as much sorrow as they cause you," sound completely insincere and false. Anyone, not to mention someone who writes for an important newspaper, knows that a person accused of murder will resolutely deny committing a crime punishable by 16 years of imprisonment; and he also knows that the guerrillas, the bolder and more able they are, know how to conceal themselves among the people, in whose eyes they seem peaceful citizens. They dress in the clothing of simple peasants, they work just as other country people do, but one day they dig up their weapons and kill without pity. If the Armed Forces were so ingenuous and unprepared as to allow themselves to be fooled by these tricks, they would not deserve the trust of the people, but rather their repudiation and the most severe sanction. The prisoners are in the hands of justice, before whom they will have to prove their innocence. Justice is not being denied them. The Armed Forces are in no way interested in incriminating innocent people, but neither can they become accomplices to such a horrendous crime. I think it is necessary to emphasize that the prisoners were turned over by the Armed Forces to the appropriate authorities, in the presence of journalists, and with individual medical examinations. None of the prisoners was in poor health, so as to make one think that they had been subjected to brutal treatment. The impressions on their wrists are to be found on those who have been bound or handcuffed for long periods because they are dangerous; signs of chafing on their bodies are the effect of carrying heavy burdens or weapons for long periods, or they are caused by traveling through the forest. They are impressions found very often on the body of a soldier or a guerrilla, and they are indications of the activity that person has engaged in. Even before these accusations against military personnel were made, the minister of defense and the Armed Forces command ordered a complete and impartial investigation of those events. Our institution has the most interest in seeing that it not contain sadists or criminals, since we well know that these are the seeds of self-destruction. There is in the Armed Forces a sincere feeling of respect for the dignity of the Ecuadorans, and we feel that this dignity is the principal object of our efforts to protect security. For that reason, the agreement that the Armed Forces has with the Latin American Association for Human Rights, whose purpose is to encourage respect for those rights, and the agreement with the Ecuadoran Red Cross to foster international human rights, are evidence of the purest and most sincere desire to ensure that Ecuadorans live in complete dignity. I believe that this letter also allows me to direct myself to my comrades in the Armed Forces, to ask them never to allow themselves to be led into criminal or abusive behavior, however brutal the narco-guerrillas and other criminals may be, because military commanders will take the necessary measures to ensure that the Armed Forces always keep their honor and credibility clean. Mr. Editor, I believe that the minister of defense, chief of the military front, has every right to have this letter published on the same page on which the article by Mr. Javier Ponce appeared. Confident in your sense of justice, I am pleased to reiterate to you my sincere consideration and respect. Cordially, Jose Gallardo Roman General of the Army Minister of National Defense
