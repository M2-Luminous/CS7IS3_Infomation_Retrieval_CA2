Pure cocaine worth 300 billion lire was seized from several warehouses in the province of Turin in what was the largest anti-drug operation ever carried out in Italy against the South American drug-traffickers linked to the Mafia and the 'Ndrangheta [Calabrian mafia]. They had discovered a new way to transport vast quantities of cocaine to Italy by ship and long-haul vehicle. The mafia wanted to run its business from the old warehouses owned by small-time crooks at Borgaro in the province of Turin. Following 12 months of investigations, the anti-mafia investigative directorate under Siclari and Turin Chief Public Prosecutor Marcello Maddalena had the foot soldiers and heads of the organization arrested. The organization was to supply drugs to central Italy and eastern Europe. This is what Siclari said: [Begin Siclari recording] This finding means that there is a definite link between Colombians and organized crime in Italy, because it is unthinkable that this amount of drugs would be sent if very solid links did not already exist.
