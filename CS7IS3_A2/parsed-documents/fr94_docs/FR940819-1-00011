FR940819-1-00011 FR940819-1-00002 7 CFR Part 1942 RIN 0575&hyph;AB82 Community Facility Loans and Grants AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations that are utilized by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) in administering Community Facility Loans and Grants. This action is necessary to implement a provision of the Rural Electrification Administration Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, (REA Act) and change the security requirements for solid waste disposal loans. The REA Act prohibits that a condition for assistance under any RDA program be a requirement that the recipient of such assistance accept or receive electric service from any particular utility, supplier, or cooperative. Also, a change is proposed in the security requirements for loans secured primarily by revenue and the funds used to construct or improve solid waste facilities in rural communities. The intended effect of changing the security requirements for solid waste facilities is to provide better service to communities seeking to resolve solid waste disposal problems on a regional level. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before October 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments in duplicate to the Chief, Regulations Analysis and Control Branch, Farmers Home Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 6348, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence, SW., Washington, DC 20250. All written comments will be available for public inspection during regular work hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry W.
