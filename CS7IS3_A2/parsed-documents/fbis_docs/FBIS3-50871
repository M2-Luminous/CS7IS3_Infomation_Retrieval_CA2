A special Economic Cabinet meeting will be held at 1700 on 9 January. A special Economic Cabinet session to analyze possible measures to stop the wave of speculation unleashed by VAT implementation ended a few minutes ago. Rosana Ordonez, Central Information Office director, reported the details of the measures being analyzed: [Begin recording] [Ordonez] There was a meeting of the Economic Cabinet this afternoon, with the participation of Finance Ministry officials. Again, they stated that Venezuelans must accept VAT as a tax in order to cover the fiscal deficit. Unless additional revenues are collected, we will be unable to cover expenses at universities, the government payroll, and other public expenses. Economic experts were consulted on certain existing doubts regarding VAT implementation due to misinformation. They said that these doubts have existed in all countries where VAT has been implemented but that they gradually disappear through information campaigns through the media. At the same time, there has been speculation that is unrelated to VAT, because the products on which prices have been increased are precisely those exempted from VAT, such as milk, eggs, beef, and consumer products. Specific measures are being analyzed to control this wave of speculation and punish those who are abusing the people's economic possibilities. [Unidentified reporter] Will sanctions include closing businesses? [Ordonez] I cannot tell you what type of sanctions will be adopted, as they are being analyzed and will be announced tomorrow after a Council of Ministers meeting that will take place at 1700. What we want people to know is that the government is concerned about the situation, which is being analyzed. The situation is difficult and complex, and thus we are meeting every day, including Saturday and Sunday. We are studying options and possibilities within existing laws, so that within the state of law citizens can feel that the government is concerned about an unusual situation of speculation. The current government will tend to the problems affecting Venezuelan citizens until the next government assumes power. [end recording] The aim of the measures being analyzed is to inform the public that the government definitely wants to stop the wave of speculation for the benefit of consumers.
