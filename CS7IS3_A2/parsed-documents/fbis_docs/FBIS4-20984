Ramos] [Text] Following a number of inspections along the border with Colombia, agents from DEA and other international organizations have determined that 80 percent of the drug traffic that passes through Venezuela--some 100-150 tonnes a year--crosses the border between the states of Zulia and Tachira. MAS (Movement for Socialism) Deputy Julio Montoya has reported that the Perija Cartel [as published] has appeared along the Venezuelan border as a result of the displacement and reorganization of the Medellin Cartel's medium-level leaders. This comes after Colombian authorities dealt the drug traffickers smashing blows by killing or arresting their topmost leaders as part of the fight against drug trafficking in Colombia. Montoya said he has proof that the kidnapping of cattlemen along the border--which occurred last year at the alarming rate of three kidnappings per month along the country's western border, and, so far this year, has risen to four per month--is the result of a plot being carried out by the Colombian drug cartels. He said the drug traffickers' strategy is to force hacienda owners to leave the area to allow traffickers to buy the abandoned property with laundered money. According to Montoya, "Once this is done, the region will become an operations center with the installation of labs and other infrastructures to process drugs." According to the investigation conducted by Montoya, six of every 10 haciendas in the area have been put up for sale because of the hacienda owners' fear over the current situation. He said: "The effect on our agriculture and livestock industry is evident--lower production of beef, milk, and several agricultural products."
