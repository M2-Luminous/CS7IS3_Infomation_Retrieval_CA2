Gen. Abubakar made his feelings known yesterday in Owerri at the opening of the fourth national conference of retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers. Sola Kudaefe reports: [Begin Kudaefe recording] The chief of defense staff said that it was politically unprofessional for retired officers to attack military institutions and therefore carry away the spirit of esprit de corps they were taught while in service. Gen. Abubakar spoke of the need for them to be mindful of their public utterances as the general public will tend to believe whatever they said as truth. Another issue that is of concern to Gen. Abubakar is wearing of military ranks by retired officers involved in partisan politics. He contended that this was a source of embarrassment to the serving officers and therefore called on the conference of the retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers to offer recommendations on the possibility of disallowing those of them involved in partisan politics from wearing their military ranks. He gave the assurance that the government will always promote their welfare but quickly added that government alone could not do it and called on private sectors to help in this direction. In his address, the military administrator of Imo State, Navy Captain James Aniko, pledged that his administration will accord priority to the welfare of retired officers and men of the Armed Forces. Navy Capt. Aniko, however, called on the retired officers to offer useful advice and to assist him in his programs. Earlier, the general secretary of retired officers club, Retired Colonel (Yakubu Anikolasue), called for the harmonization of pensions and gratuities of retired members. [end recording]
