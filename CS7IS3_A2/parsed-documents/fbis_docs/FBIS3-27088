Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, made these remarks in response to reporters' questions about Patten's on-going Australia visit at a spring cocktail reception here this evening. "This is not the first time for Patten to play international cards. He did so as early as in 1992," Zhang said. He reiterated that the Hong Kong issue should be studied and discussed only between China and Britain and no third country has the right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs. "We maintain that China and Britain should cooperate in handling affairs such as elections during the transitional period, but the British side refused to cooperate and the Sino-British negotiations have subsequently broken down," Zhang said. Without agreements between China and Britain, the three-tier councils will all be terminated on June 30, 1997, and be reorganized, the deputy director added.
