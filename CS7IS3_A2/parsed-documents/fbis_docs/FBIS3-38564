"It's totally false, and even ridiculously implausible," commented Massimo D'Alema, a top official at the Democrat Party of the Left, the Communist Party's successor. A statement from the party also denied "in the most drastic terms" that any form of finance had ever reached the Communist or Left Democrat Party from the Ferruzzi group or late Ferruzzi-Montedison tycoon, Raul Gardini, who committed suicide on July 23 last year. Describing Sama's testimony as "false, denigratory and slanderous," the statement also charged that it was a "good addition" to various manoeuvres going on as the campaign for the March 27 general elections gets under way. Asked to confirm his earlier testimony at the hearings here against financial whiz-kid Sergio Cusani, a key figure in the acquisition of funding for the Ferruzzi-Montedison group's web of bribery, Sama said it was Cusani who told him about the payment, while Gardini confirmed the story. In December, Sama said that it was Gardini, his brother-in-law, who had disclosed the payment to him, telling him that the money had served to soften up the major left-wing opposition party in view of tax breaks for the merger between Montedison and ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] chemical interests to form Enimont. Today's Left Democrat statement pointed out that, as in his earlier testimony, Sama was unable to specify whether the "hypothetical billion" was handed over, nor who did the handing, nor to whom: "Once more, he calls as his witness someone who is no longer able to testify." D'Alema and Achille Occhetto, ex-Communist and now Left Democrat party secretary, admit to having dined with Gardini and Sama twice in 1989, but say their conversations concerned solely the state and future of the Italian chemical industry and made no mention of party funding. The tax break to sweeten the Enimont deal never got through parliament, in part thanks to Left Democrat opposition, removing one of the conditions under which the Ferruzzi family was prepared to pursue the venture and helping tip the family against Gardini, who eventually went his own way when his plans for the Ferruzzi group to dominate Italian chemicals fell apart. According to Sama's testimony, however, Cusani disclosed the payment when the two of them travelled by train to Switzerland for talks with financial consultant, Giuseppe `Pino' Berlini, who handled an important slice of the Ferruzzi family's under-the-counter operations outside Italy, including the channelling of funds to the parties and individuals receiving bribes. Sama claimed that Berlini told them the Ferruzzis had only 113 million dollars in their account with him, compared to 178 million the previous year. On the return journey, he said Cusani told him of the payment to the Communists. [passage omitted]
