At this meeting, Robaina explained to Vo Tran Chi that Cuba is immersed in a process of change in which the people's participation is essential. Robaina, who is on the last leg of an Asian tour that included eight Southeast Asian countries, pointed out that Cuba is making many changes and that there are many still to come. Robaina said that Cuba wants to learn first-hand from the experiences of a brother such as Vietnam, to which we are linked not only by economic ties but by auspicious and frank traditional ties. He added that Cuba is in a process of recovery that is dependent on the efforts and work of the Cuban people. Robaina stressed that what has most caught his attention in Vietnam is the way the party controls and directs the economic reforms. Vo Tran Chi said that there are many spheres in which the two countries can hold exchanges with a view to overcoming the current circumstances. The Cuban delegation will also meet with local officials and tour sites of economic interest. Ho Chi Minh City, which has a population of 5 million, is considered Vietnam's most important commercial hub.
