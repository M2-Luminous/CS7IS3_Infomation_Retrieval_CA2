David Collenette points to last December's election victory by extreme nationalists in Russia as a potential threat to peace in the future. Canada's Liberal government has promised deep cuts in military spending, but Mr. Collenette says those promises were based on the belief that the world had entered a more peaceful era and that belief may no longer be valid.
