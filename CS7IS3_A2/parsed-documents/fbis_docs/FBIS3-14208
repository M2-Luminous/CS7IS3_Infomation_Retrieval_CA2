Israel should also acknowledge the legitimate Palestinian rights and abide by the UN Security Council Resolution 242 based on the principles of land for peace and justice for peace, Musa added. Musa said the return of the Arab land, the solution of regional problems, and the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza would produce a new situation with Israel. In a statement delivered before the Consultative Council's session led by Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi today, Musa stressed the need to implement all the provisions of Resolution 242 for the sake of reaching a peaceful settlement based on the land-for-peace principle. This would also mean land and justice in return for peace, he added. Musa pointed out that when this happens, we will discuss the economic situation, such as the Middle East market or economic cooperation. He said that Israel's place in this market depends upon the return of the Arabs' legitimate rights. In his statement, the foreign minister said there can be no Arab solidarity without Egypt. He added: We always consult with the Arab brothers when we adopt any political stance. Musa noted: We always propose policies but we impose policies on no one. We must hold consultations before adopting any fateful decision, stressing that Egypt's role is known and valued. The foreign minister said he will raise the issue of pan-Arab security at the Arab League ministerial council meeting on Saturday. He said Arab positions still diverge and there are serious threats from inside and outside the Arab world. He pointed out that Egypt is trying to ensure comprehensive pan-Arab security. In his statement to the Consultative Council, the foreign minister said that the concept of pan-Arab security needs redrafting to be in line with the projected international changes. He said the concept of pan-Arab security must be broader than simply a bloc against any external aggression. He noted that the overall view of this issue must be wider and comprehensive. 'Amr Musa stressed that solidarity, cooperation, and accord represent the pillars of this security. It can never be established on enmity, Musa added. He highlighted President Mubarak's efforts to contain Libya's crisis with the West and end the events in Yemen and Somalia. Commenting on the obstacles facing the creation of pan-Arab security, Musa said the biggest obstacle lies within the Arab system. He noted that foreign forces are impeding the return of Arab solidarity. He said that only Arab strength can overcome such obstacles. Musa affirmed that Egypt does not accept the separation of north Sudan from the south. We can never accept that; this is a clear pan-Arab stance, he said. Touching on relations with Iraq, Musa said: We differed with Iraq because of its violation of international, regional, and Arab rules and its aggression against Kuwait. The situation can only be rectified by returning to basics. Iraq must accept Kuwait's independence and respect its sovereignty instead of viewing it as the 19th governorate. Musa pointed out that Iraq's conduct distorted the collective Arab system and created an Arab and international problem, from which we are still suffering. We must agree upon a cure on a clear-cut basis. The starting point should be Iraq's acceptance of Kuwait's independence and sovereignty and implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, he stressed. Proceeding to relations with Iran, Minister Musa affirmed that Iran is a fraternal non-Arab state the policy of which we disagree with on particular details. Iran is a Middle Eastern state that has borders with Arab countries. Discussing the regional situation requires talking to Iran as much as it requires talking with Egypt. But it is not part of Arab security or the Arab situation. Touching on the Turkish position, the foreign minister pointed out that Turkey's position is different from Iran's, because ties with Turkey are good. The Turkish policy and conduct are linked with its cooperation, friendship, and relations with the Arab world, he said, adding: We cannot place Turkey on the same footing with other states that have problems with the Arab world. The foreign minister reiterated that the Arab League's role can't be ignored or excluded, even if we find fault with its conduct. The Arab League is a mirror reflecting the Arab situation, he remarked, and its role is to discuss the actual situation. We officially asked the League to discuss the issue of pan-Arab security and an important study has been prepared in this connection, he said.
