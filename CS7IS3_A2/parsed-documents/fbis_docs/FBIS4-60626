[Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', when will the Palestinian National Authority meet? What is on the agenda? [Quray'] Meetings started yesterday. Meetings will discuss a big agenda to fill all vacancies in administrations and distribute missions and responsibilities to members of the Palestinian National Authority. Meetings will discuss the setting up of a bureau for auditing and financial and administrative supervision, to coincide with the start of the work of this authority, and to underline the principle of accountability and openness to the masses of our people. Also, the agenda includes the subject of following up the negotiations and setting up the committee charged with following up negotiations in the civil, security, and economic fields. All these issues have been addressed. Discussion will continue today. The meetings' agenda includes setting a date for the return of the Palestinian leadership and the members of the Palestinian National Authority to Gaza and Jericho. [Mu'addi] When will Yasir 'Arafat arrive in Gaza, or Jericho? [Quray'] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat will soon arrive at the head of the Palestinian National Authority. [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', have all members of the Palestinian National Authority been appointed? [Quray'] Almost. The number appointed is enough to assume all responsibilities and tasks. There will be consideration of some brothers. We think these names will be complete soon. [Mu'addi] How many members have been appointed thus far? [Quray'] Around 18 people have been appointed thus far. [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', many challenges are facing the new Palestinian Authority. What are the priorities? [Quray'] Two issues constitute the principal challenges to our people. A third issue constitutes the major challenge regarding Israel. With our people, we are required to achieve security in a democratic, healthy, and sound atmosphere in order to provide the stability needed for development. The second challenge is to create job opportunities, and the economic development projects that can provide job opportunities and achieve the prosperity our people seek. These are two issues we must tackle for the sake of our people. The third issue concerns completing the preparations for the negotiations for the next phases, since the agreement stipulates phases and gradual action, and so we can complete one phase and move to the next after we have established ourselves in a correct and sound way and created some confidence with the other party. [Mu'addi] Mr. Abu-al-'Ala', the Palestinian Authority will, as of next month, start dispensing the wages of the employees in Gaza and Jericho and the wages of the members of the Palestinian police. Do you have any money in the coffers? [Quray'] In fact, the coffers are still at the hands of the Civil Administration and the Israeli Government and the Israeli Finance Ministry. The money has not been received by the Palestinian National Authority. This is undoubtedly an Israeli responsibility, and also a responsibility of the world and the World Bank. This authority should not be dealt with in accordance with the old Arab proverb: He threw him in the water and then told him, careful, careful, do not get wet. This authority has major and difficult responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the world community to help it. It is Israel's responsibility to fulfill its commitments. The dues remaining from the taxes and tariffs, as well as other old dues, must be transferred immediately so that this authority can fulfill its tasks without trouble. The Authority cannot possibly stand by idly without being able to pay wages or pay for its own expenses. [Mu'addi] One last question, Mr. Abu-al-'Ala': It has been reported that Yasir 'Arafat recently fell ill and was admitted to the military hospital in Tunis. What is Mr. 'Arafat's health condition these days? [Quray'] I can confirm that these were very normal tests. He is in very, very good health. I can confirm this. [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Abu-al-'Ala', in Tunis, thank you very much. [Quray'] Thank you.
