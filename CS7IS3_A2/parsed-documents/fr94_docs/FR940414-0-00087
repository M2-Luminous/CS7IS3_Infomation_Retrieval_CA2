FR940414-0-00087 FR940414-0-00030 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 040894B] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of Pacific cod by vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). NMFS is requiring that catches of Pacific cod by these vessels in the Central Regulatory Area be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the allocation of Pacific cod specified for the inshore component in this area has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), April 9, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii), the allocation of Pacific cod Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 28,125 metric tons. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(3), that the allocation of Pacific cod TAC specified for the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, GOA, has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Pacific cod by operators of vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area in the GOA, be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง672.20(e), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., April 9, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.
