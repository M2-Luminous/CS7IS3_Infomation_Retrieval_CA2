Pakistan's position is that it would relent on the NPT only if India does and the Indian position is that it would relent only if the nuclear powers of the world, including China, do. Of the two, Pakistan's position would seem to be more amenable to a solution than India's but it is harder of the two in the sense that it being absolutely the basic minimum, leaves no room for any concession. Any government giving so much as even a hint of freezing the nuclear programme unilaterally, leaving the Indians free to carry on theirs, would immediately fall. The Indian position, on the surface, is far less amenable to any solution, because it seeks to impose the NPT not on one country but on all the major powers of the world, but is actually softer because its nonacceptance does not really hurt India's vital security interests. In that sense it is rather a phoney condition put up as a ploy to extract a quid pro quo or blackmail the U.S. In the case of Pakistan the quid pro quo is of F-16s. Pakistan having rejected that, has now its back against the wall. It can retreat no further. That is where the hardness of Pakistan's stance comes in. India is angling for more and more from the U.S. before it allows itself to capitulate on the NPT. It has already won from the U.S. the promise of nonintervention in Kashmir. Mr. Talbott's reference to the Simla Agreement and his silence on Indian atrocities in Kashmir, seems to be part of that India's other goal is to deprive Pakistan of conventional weapons. Hence its insistence on blocking the delivery of F-16s to Pakistan. The United States, on its part, has used the bait of sponsorship of India for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, in return for a deal on NPT. So India has kept to itself a number of options to play around. In this game of quiet diplomacy likely to be played in the days to come, Pakistan it seems would hardly hold any cards in its hand. A time may come when it may have to choose between its traditional friendship with the United States and its vital security concerns. In contrast, the pressure on India is minimal. India does not have to depend on the U.S. for anything, inlcuding friendship. It already has a traditional friend -- Russia -- in the Security Council. It has actually used the U.S. to block Pakistan on Kashmir. The U.S. seems willing enough to oblige India in some other areas also. India suffers from no qualms to milk the U.S. diplomatically, now under the cover of quiet diplomacy. The options for Pakistan, on the other hand, are limited. But while it does not have to let India take advantage of the U.S. obsession with the NPT, its own stance on the NPT as well as on Kashmir being a moral one, does snot have to be compromised for the sake of expediency. The world, it is hoped, will come to distinguish between a moral position and an immoral one. It did so, after all, in the case of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.
