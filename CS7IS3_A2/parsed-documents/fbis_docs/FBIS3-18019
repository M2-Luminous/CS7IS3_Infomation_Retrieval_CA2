It thus welcomed the decision of the Twelve to create a new criterion for obtaining Community regional aid that would directly benefit the three Scandinavian countries on the threshold of the EU (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). The Twelve are opposed to these three countries receiving regional aid as less-favored regions, insofar as the regions in question have a per capita income of around 80 percent of Community GDP, which is more than the 75 percent set as "objective 1." For this reason, the European proposal created an "objective 6" for eligibility to the structural funds concerning regions with a population density of less than eight people per square kilometer. Most of the Nordic regions of Sweden, Norway, and Finland meet this criterion, and could therefore benefit from this Community godsend, evaluated by Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos to be worth some ECU175 million per year. This proposal is a "great step forward and constitutes a very good base for the rest of the negotiations," stressed Swedish Foreign Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel during a news conference. "The fact that the specific situation of northern Sweden is recognized as such is very important," he added. In addition, Sweden asked the Twelve to grant it a transition period during which its contribution to the Community "kitty" would not be greater than the benefits it would reap from entering the Community "club." "From the start, we are ready to pay as much as we receive, but we would like a transition period up to 1999, after which we would contribute in full and would ensure the dynamic effects of our membership were felt," explained Mr. Dinkelspiel. The Twelve did not, however, hide their reluctance on this point. Mr. Dinkelspiel admitted: "I must say that our proposal was not greeted with waves of enthusiasm." Such a hypothesis would put a serious strain on the benefits expected from the membership of the four countries, currently members of EFTA (European Free Trade Area), estimated to be worth ECU1.6 billion. Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that Sweden would contribute almost half this sum (some ECU765 million), thus becoming the third largest contributor in the EU, and the largest contributor per inhabitant.
