Pawlak and Kwasniewski were driven to the URM through a side entrance; after the meeting, they drove off without talking with journalists waiting outside the building. The subject of the talk was the recall of Finance Deputy Minister Stefan Kawalec, as well as methods of governing and joint governing within the coalition. Kwasniewski held over three hours of talks with SLD ministers before the meeting. At that time, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski suggested that the powers of each of the three deputy prime ministers be clearly defined, so that each of them understood their responsibilities. On the same day, on the plane from Brussels to Warsaw, Waldemar Pawlak told journalists accompanying him that internal relations between the coalition parties are much more quiet than it might seem when one views them from the outside. The coalition agreement signed by the Polish Peasant Party and SLD does not regulate all relations between the governing parties, and even though there are no major frictions between them, their stands on many issues are different. This is why the situation requires patience and dialogue, which will make it possible to find good solutions. During the meeting of the prime minister and SLD leader in Brussels, Aleksander Kwasniewski is said to have expressed his dissatisfaction over the existing conflict. Journalists who witnessed this had the impression that Kwasniewski was voicing his opinions very firmly--but not so firmly as to let the crisis rock the government coalition. After the Thursday evening talks between both politicians, journalists came to the simple conclusion that their faces were rather glum. Both politicians are supposed to issue information on the results of their talks at a press conference on Friday.
