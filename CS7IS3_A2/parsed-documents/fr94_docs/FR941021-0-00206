FR941021-0-00206 FR941021-0-00024 ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Chemical Abuse Programs. A proposed rule on this subject was published in the Federal Register on January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1240 et seq .). This proposed rule renamed such programming as Drug Abuse Treatment Programs and distinguished between mandatory and voluntary requirements for inmate participation. The comment period closed on March 8, 1994. The Bureau received comment from only one respondent. A summary of comment and agency response follows. The commenter stated that the statutory provision mandating the Bureau of Prisons to provide substance abuse treatment programs is directly opposed to mandating participation in treatment programs when imposing the original sentence. The commenter cited 18 U.S.C. 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. 994(k) as being ``inappropriately immiscible'' to the provisions proposed in 28 CFR 550.52(a) (1) and (3). In response, the Bureau notes that there is no statutory conflict. The provisions in 18 U.S.C. 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. 994(k) relate to imposition of sentence by the court under the guidelines of the United States Sentencing Commission. These are intended to ensure that the various aspects relating to the offense are considered in determining the relevance of imprisonment, and if relevant, the length of such imprisonment. It is only after a term of imprisonment is imposed that 18 U.S.C. 3621 becomes applicable. The Bureau's authority under 18 U.S.C. 3621(b) to make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each inmate committed to its custody has been implemented separately through this very rulemaking. Use by the Bureau of the sentencing court's recommendation or of information in the Presentence Investigation has no direct impact on the prior decision taken by the sentencing court. The commenter also questioned the operation of the program at a specific Bureau institution, stating that the proposals were being implemented with severe sanctions for an inmate who does not participate voluntarily. The administrative remedy procedure is the appropriate means for inmates to voice their concerns on such aspects of their imprisonment. A review of inmate remedy requests for calendar year 1993 at the cited institution indicates only one request filed under the subject matter of substance abuse programs. The ``severe sanctions'' apparently refer to pay and community status restrictions (i.e., being held to the lowest pay grade and loss of eligibility for furlough consideration or community corrections center placement) imposed on an inmate who had declined to complete drug abuse education requirements. That complaint ultimately was mooted upon the inmate's completion of the forty hour course. In issuing the final rule, the Bureau has further reorganized the regulations for the sake of clarity. Additional provisions have been added which are either administrative in nature or are intended to allow for increased voluntary participation in drug abuse treatment programming. Specific provisions as to eligibility criteria codified in new §§550.55(a) and 550.57(a) are being adopted on an interim basis with the opportunity for further comment. A discussion of this further reorganization and additions follows. The statement of purpose and scope §550.50 is adopted as final without change. The provisions in proposed §550.51 have been reorganized and revised as new §§550.51 through 550.53. As revised, new §550.51 defines the role of the Drug Abuse Treatment Coordinator and the Drug Abuse Treatment Specialist. Provisions of proposed §550.51 which covered requirements on the Admission and Orientation program and screening and referral are now separately stated in new §§550.52 and 550.53. New §550.52 contains the provisions pertinent to the Admission and Orientation program. These provisions have been reworded, but there is no change in the intent. New §550.53 contains the provisions pertinent to screening and referral. As revised, this section now also provides for a record review by the case manager.
