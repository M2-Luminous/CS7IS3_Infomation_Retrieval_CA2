FR941027-1-00022 FR941027-1-00008 B. EIS Development Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq ., requires that federal agencies prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA is to build into the Agency decision making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of proposed actions. While NEPA does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed to prepare EISs in connection with ocean disposal site designations such as this (see 39 FR 16186 [May 7, 1974]). EPA, in cooperation with the Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), has prepared a Draft EIS (DEIS) entitled ``Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Designation of An Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site Located Offshore Miami, Florida.'' On September 7, 1990, the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the DEIS for public review and comment was published in the Federal Register (55 FR 36891 [September 7, 1990]). Anyone desiring a copy of the EIS may obtain one from the addresses given above. The public comment period on the draft EIS was to have closed on October 22, 1990. However, the closing date was changed to December 7, 1990 due to a request by the State of Florida. EPA received 12 comment letters on the Draft EIS. There were three main concerns expressed in those letters: (1) Placement of beach quality sand in the ODMDS; (2) potential for movement of silt and clay sized particles out of the disposal area and onto environmentally sensitive hardbottoms and coral reefs to the west during the occurrence of Gulf Stream frontal eddies; and (3) disposal of contaminated sediments from locations such as the Miami River. Concerns raised by the State of Florida, regarding use of suitable material for beach nourishment, will be addressed in the FEIS. EPA concurs with the State of Florida regarding the use of suitable material for beach nourishment, in circumstances where this use is practical. A real-time monitoring system will be instituted by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the occurrence of Gulf Stream frontal eddies. During the occurrence of such eddies, disposal at the ODMDS will discontinue. Details of the monitoring plan and protocol will be included in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the FEIS. Before any material can be placed within an ODMDS, it must be evaluated and shown to be acceptable for ocean disposal in accordance with ocean dumping regulations (40 CFR 227.13). Certain portions of the sediments proposed to be dredged from the Miami River have been found to be unacceptable for ocean disposal. The EIS will serve as a Biological Assessment for purposes of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act coordination. By itself, site designation of the Miami ODMDS will not adversely impact any threatened or endangered species under the purview of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Use of the ODMDS is not expected to adversely impact any threatened or endangered species. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has been asked by EPA to concur with EPA's conclusion that this site designation will not affect the endangered species under their jurisdictions. EPA has evaluated the proposed site designation for consistency with the State of Florida's (the State) approved coastal management program. EPA has determined that the designation of the proposed site is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the State coastal management program, and has submitted this determination to the State for review in accordance with EPA policy. In a letter dated September 13, 1990, the Florida Department of State agreed that the proposed designation will have no effect on any archaeological or historic sites or properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with the National Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89&hyph;6654), as amended. The proposed action discussed in the DEIS is the permanent designation for continuing use of the existing interim ocean disposal site near Miami, Florida. The purpose of the proposed action is to provide an environmentally acceptable option for the ocean disposal of dredged material. The need for the permanent designation of the Miami ODMDS is based on a demonstrated COE need for ocean disposal of maintenance dredged material from the Federal navigation projects in the greater Miami area. However, every disposal activity by the COE is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the need for ocean disposal for that particular case. The need for ocean disposal for other projects, and the suitability of the material for ocean disposal, will be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the COE's process of issuing permits for ocean disposal for private/federal actions and a public review process for their own actions. For the Miami ODMDS, the COE and EPA would evaluate all federal dredged material disposal projects pursuant to the EPA criteria given in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220&hyph;229) and the COE regulations (33 CFR 209.120 and Parts 335&hyph;338). The COE also issues Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) permits to private applicants for the transport of dredged material intended for disposal after compliance with regulations is determined. EPA has the right to disapprove any ocean disposal project if, in its judgment, all provisions of MPRSA and the associated implementing regulations have not been met. The DEIS discusses the need for this site designation and examines ocean disposal site alternatives to the proposed action. Non-ocean disposal options have been examined in the previously published Feasibility Report and EIS for the Miami Harbor Channel Project. Alternatives to ocean disposal may include upland disposal within the port area, disposal in Biscayne Bay, and beach disposal. Upland disposal in the intensively developed Port of Miami-Biscayne Bay area has not been found feasible. The Port of Miami itself is built partially on fill in Biscayne Bay. Undeveloped areas within cost-effective haul distances are environmentally valuable in their own right. Almost all inshore waters of the Biscayne Bay area are part of the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve. The waters of the southern portion of Biscayne Bay, now included in the Aquatic Preserve, are to be incorporated, along with some offshore waters, into the Biscayne National Park in the near future. The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) has afforded the waters of these areas special protection as Outstanding Florida Waters. This effectively removes virtually all of the Biscayne Bay area from consideration for disposal of dredged material. Dredged sand might be placed on beaches in the Miami Beach area. Suitable rock might be placed in nearshore waters. These options are feasible only where a substantial quantity of the desired type of material is separable from silt or other undesirable material. The COE has been authorized to deepen Miami Harbor. For that project, environmental and economic analyses were performed and an EIS was prepared. The COE examined and documented the feasibility of each of the above-described disposal options and found none to be feasible. The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in the Draft EIS:
