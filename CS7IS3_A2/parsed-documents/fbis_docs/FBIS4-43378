Information policy becomes all the more important if more flexibility is displayed in using money supply targets as an instrument. Lamfalussy applied the statement to countries that are in the envious position of being able to pursue a monetary policy based on rules, while also establishing a money supply target because of a stable relationship between money and prices. However, the same also applies to countries that cannot set any money supply targets. "For them, the obligation to achieve price stability is of even greater importance," said the EWI president at the sixth "International Frankfurt Banking Evening." Lamfalussy's impression is that things are developing in a positive direction with respect to the greater intelligibility of monetary policy decisionmaking, and he said the appropriate steps taken by the Bank of England were exemplary. Regarding the situation in Germany, he said: "As far as the Bundesbank is concerned, I have noticed a constant increase in the depth and breadth of the flow of information. The public is being informed about the interpretation of facts and numbers that affect decisionmaking as well as the reasons for the decisions that are made." There is no question of the premature abandonment of the strategy of announcing money supply targets, stressed Bundesbank President Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, speaking at the same event. As long as there are clear indications of marked distortions in relation to excessive monetary growth, the strong expansion of the M3 money supply should not prompt inflationary fears. [sentence as published] The development of the money supply is not an indicator of future price trends, but of the danger of inflation: "As long as all other sources allow us to be confident that prices are developing in the right direction, a certain degree of pragmatism is justified." A glance at the way in which the cost of living price index is evolving really does provide a basis for optimism. It is true that the latest figures do not correspond to the Bundesbank's ideas about price stability, but they show that things are developing in the right direction. Tietmeyer's actual words were: "According to all current forecasts, we will continue to make progress -- exchange rates, in particular, indicate that." Of course, one has not disregarded the fact that current problems with directing the money supply have made it more difficult for the markets to assess monetary policy. The current way in which the monetary supply is developing does indeed place the Bundesbank under a great obligation to provide explanations and justifications, said Tietmeyer, confirming Lamfalussy's statement on intelligibility. Ultimately, the difficulties that exist can only be resolved through a gradual "deceleration," even if that might have to occur over a longer period of time.
