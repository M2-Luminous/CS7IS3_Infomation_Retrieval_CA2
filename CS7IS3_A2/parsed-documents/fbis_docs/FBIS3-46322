After the devaluation, the official exchange rate would drop to the same level as the market rate used in commercial transactions. Thus, a single exchange rate would be established. This would also help promote Chinese participation in free trade, as well as considerably pave the way toward its membership in GATT next year. Currently, there are three different exchange rates being used in China. The first is the official exchange rate ($1 = about 5.8 yuan); the second is the exchange rate used in commercial transactions that is determined by the Foreign Currency Exchange Center ($1 = about 8.7 yuan); and the third is the exchange rate used in the black market ($1 = about 8.9 yuan). According to the same financial source, the Chinese Government predicts that the market rate would be about $1 = 8.8-8.9 yuan next year. By reducing the official exchange rate by about 3 yuan (51 percent), the government intends to establish a single exchange rate. Originally, the government had tentatively decided to put the plan into effect on 1 January 1994, but the plan was postponed since financial institutions would require more time for preparations. However, the government reportedly plans to put the plan into effect by late March. The yuan devaluation is expected to cause a rise in prices of imported and other items, with merchants taking advantage of the situation. However, the government plans to keep confusion in the market to a minimum by reinforcing price-monitoring operations. So far, the PRC has issued two types of currency: the foreign exchange certificate (FEC), which can be exchanged for foreign currency at the official exchange rate; and the renminbi (RMB), which cannot be exchanged for foreign currency. With the establishment of a single foreign exchange rate, however, it has become meaningless to issue FEC's. Thus, FEC's, which account for about 20 percent of the total currency in circulation, will eventually be abolished. On the other hand, it will become possible to exchange RMB's for foreign currency.
