China Warns Washington on Intellectual Property Rights Acknowledging problems in implementing the January 1992 Sino-U.S. memorandum of understanding (MOU) on protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) in China, Beijing has announced new steps to enhance its protection of IPR, while also warning Washington not to make the issue an obstacle to better trade relations. Reflecting this dual approach, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, in remarks to a press conference on 28 January, took Washington to task for its alleged criticism of China's IPR protection efforts. Complaining that the United States "does not understand" China's "positive measures" on IPR protection, she pointedly noted that the "level of IPR protection" in China has "surpassed the average world level" (Beijing TV, 28 January). Wu went on to warn Washington not to make compliance with the MOU the focus of a "trade dispute" with China, saying that would be "extremely unwise for the U.S. Government to apply pressure" on China. At the same time, Wu indicated that Beijing recognizes the need to continue to respond to the "demands" of foreign countries as well as to the growing internal pressures from its own market reforms for better IPR protection. Announcing new steps to enhance Chinese protection efforts, she said that Beijing will begin a "universal" education campaign to enable "people across the country at different levels" to understand the "importance" of IPR protection. In addition, Wu indicated that Beijing will "actively suggest" that IPR courts be established in "some key cities." A 31 January report on Wu's press conference in Beijing's English-language paper China Daily indicated that the drive to establish special IPR courts has already begun, noting that "last week" a "patent court" had been set up in Haikou in Haninan Province. Last August, Beijing's official press agency Xinhua had reported on initial efforts to set up a legal structure to handle IPR violations, announcing the establishment of a new court in Beijing to deal with IPR disputes.
