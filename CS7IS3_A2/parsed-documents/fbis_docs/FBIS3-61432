Buznikov, M.A. Kovalev, St. Petersburg State Electrical Engineering University imeni V.I. Lenin (Ulyanov); UDC 551.508.551.524] [Abstract] The suitability of atmospheric refraction measurements from satellites (ISZ) in order to obtain periodic data on the weather parameters of the atmosphere and plot their vertical profiles and the efficiency of remote refractometric probing as well as the expediency of developing an instrument for measuring atmospheric refraction prompted the development of an instrument which combines the functions of gas analyzer and refractometer whereby refraction is measured on the basis of the apparent vertical dimension of the sun disc. Block diagrams of two design versions and the optical train of the refractometer, a block diagram of the signal processing system, and a video signal diagram for one line are cited. Both designs are based on filming the sunset and sunrise from Salyut orbiters through the earth's atmosphere at a small angle between the direction toward the sun and the satellite orbit plane whereby the transmitted ray perigees dissect the atmosphere almost vertically with a small horizontal displacement on the scale of weather variations in the weather fields. A vidicon or a dissector can be used as the photodetector. Figures 3; references 6.
