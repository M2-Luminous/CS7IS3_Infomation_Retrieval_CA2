This portends the danger that the conflict will expand and deteriorate in that vital region. The conspiratorial role played by Saudi Arabia against fraternal Yemen is part of an orchestrated campaign led by the United States and carried out by its agents in the region. U.S. State Department reports had warned against the danger of Yemeni unity to the Gulf region in general and to Saudi Arabia in particular. The White House called for the need to accelerate a crisis in Yemen that could kill the unity. At the time, U.S. oil companies, especially Hunt, had discovered huge oil finds in the south of Yemen, most notably in Hadramaut. The company sent reports to U.S. officials affirming that the Saudi-Yemeni border area had great oil potential. The company expressed its concern over the difficulties it found in digging and prospecting for oil in the Saudi-Yemeni border area. The company frankly noted that oil exploration and prospecting in the border areas would lead to deep political problems between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Out of its commitment to the basic motives of the U.S. strategy in the Gulf region, the company asked U.S. officials for advice. It also asked that the necessary measures be taken in this connection. The report by Hunt clearly indicated that the process of the border demarcation between Saudi Arabia and Yemen does not include clear provisions on who controls the oilfields. At that time and in accordance with the NAFTA agreement between the United States and its Latin American neighbors, a report by the Canadian company Canoscy mentioned that this region contains--according to initial estimates--only 700 million barrels. Noting that several European companies had begun invading the region, Washington expressed its concern at the effect of this on U.S. interests. The Canoscy report mentioned that around 40 European companies secured privileges to explore and prospect for oil in the region. In view of this, U.S. officials intervened so that Hunt would get the lion's share of oil prospecting in south Yemen. For this purpose, butcher Schwarzkopf, who led the war to destroy Iraq, and Zionist Henry Kissinger (Both work as advisers to Hunt) paid a secret visit to Saudi Arabia in March. They met Saudi officials and discussed ways to secure full control of Yemeni oil. They claimed that north Yemen promised Iraqi President Saddam Husayn that it would provide him with oil royalties to enable him to rebuild Iraq's military power and regain Iraq's superiority. They also claimed that this deal was cut as part of a plan under which Iraq would modernize the Yemeni army, transfer military and technical expertise to Yemen, and enable Yemen to produce chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Schwarzkopf and Kissinger claimed that in view of this, Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states would fall between the jaws of an Iraqi-Yemeni pincer with the aim of controlling the Gulf oil. Former U.S. President George Bush--who was appointed by Hunt as a senior adviser, in addition to his posts in other oil companies such as Exxon--was holding covert meetings with the Saudi ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan, who was the real leader of the front coordinating with the Americans regarding Yemen. This was preceded by secret meetings between secessionist leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid--when he was Yemeni vice president--and U.S. Vice President Al Gore during al-Bid's visit to Washington for treatment last summer. Al-Bid asked for a meeting with the U.S. vice president away from the gaze of the Yemeni ambassador in Washington and embassy staff members. Al-Bid granted annual leave to Yemeni Ambassador Muhsin al-'Ayni, who received instructions from the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa to follow up al-Bid's meetings in Washington. The Yemeni ambassador did not realize the motives behind al-Bid's action. So the ambassador informed the Yemeni capital that al-Bid did not intend to hold meetings with U.S. officials. Information has it that al-Bid met Al Gore, who affirmed that Washington would support him whatever stance he adopted. Al Gore stressed that his country is governed by two basic options regarding Yemeni unity. The first option: If unity continued, Washington would prefer 'Ali Salim al-Bid to be president of the state of unity. Washington did not trust 'Ali Abdallah Salih's intentions, especially after he supported Iraq during the Gulf crisis. Regarding this option, al-Bid noted the difficulty in achieving it in the light of the tribal and party makeup inside Yemen, indicating that the congress party enjoyed wide bases of support. But Gore advised him not to pacify the northern leaders, emphasizing that the socialist party should abandon unity as long as it could not assume power. The second option: Maintaining the secessionist situation inside Yemen. In this regard, Gore said that Salih's aim behind unity was control of the oilfields in the south and control of strategic straits enjoyed by the south Yemen "state." The first step Salih would take would be to remove the socialist party from power. Although the U.S. vice president submitted these two options, 'Ali Salim al-Bid did not want unity to continue. He only wanted to explore the U.S. view in this regard. Gore claimed there was an expected alliance between Yemen and Iraq, which would lead to the loss of south Yemen's wealth. The U.S. vice president gave al-Bid information on Iraqi contacts with Yemen and Jordan to revive the idea of the Arab Cooperation Council. He submitted false documents on contacts held among the three states in this regard. According to the reports, al-Bid emerged from that meeting with one impression, namely, the need to abort the unity with north Yemen's leaders and to let south Yemen monopolize its oil resources. During al-Bid's stay in Washington, a U.S. official gave him an important report on huge oil discoveries in Ma'rib and four other southern areas. The report noted that south Yemen could become an economic giant if it could control its oil resources. After reading the report, al-Bid met Saudi Ambassador in Washington Bandar Bin-Sultan and asked him to tell the United States of his real desire to secede from north Yemen and of his fears of the consequences of secession if he were left alone in the battlefield to face the northern forces. Consequently, al-Bid obtained U.S. confirmation that the United States would support his military stance and would not allow the northern forces to get near Aden. Following al-Bid's return from Washington, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih asked for a report on his visit but al-Bid fabricated a political crisis so as to avoid presenting any reports on his Washington visit. During that time, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan arrived in Saudi Arabia on a mission to brief Saudi officials on the outcome of al- Bid's talks in Washington. When the crisis escalated, the northerners made many concessions for the sake of maintaining Yemeni unity while al-Bid engaged in strengthening his ties with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. His deputy, Salim Salih, played a direct role in obtaining financial support from Kuwait, which was later used to buy weapons for south Yemen. In light of the escalating developments that preceded the outbreak of war in Yemen, the United States decided to build the largest air base in the Jizan area near the Yemeni border and placed the job of preparing it under the supervision of Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Saudi minister of defense and civil aviation, who cut short a visit to Switzerland for treatment and returned home to supervise the building of the base. Information indicates that General Schwarzkopf's views were sought. He proposed that the base should target Yemen and Iraq so as to confront any expansion in the war. These factors were behind the enthusiasm shown by the southerners for the war against the legitimate forces. The promises they got had an effect on the statements that were made during the first days of the war, statements in which they threatened to inflict defeat on the northern forces. But the Yemeni people's rallying behind their national army thwarted the plot of the secessionists and their supporters. This plot is on the verge of final collapse under the blows inflicted on it by those who believe in the unity of the fraternal Yemeni people.
