Molusi] [Text] Johannesburg March 11 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has set a Friday [11 March] midnight deadline for political parties registered to participate in the elections to submit their candidates lists. "The name of any party which has applied for registration but has not lodged a candidates list by that time (midnight) will simply have to be deleted from the ballot paper," an IEC statement said. The IEC ultimatum will affect the Inkatha Freedom Party and Gen Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front which registered provisionally but have yet to submit candidates lists. The two parties said their participation in the elections depended on the outcome of proposed international mediation to resolve constitutional problems, as agreed by African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Gen Viljoen said on Thursday all negotiations should be terminated until the crisis in Bophuthatswana had been resolved.
