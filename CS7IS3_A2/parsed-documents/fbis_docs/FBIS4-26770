Party committees and governments at all levels in the disaster area should regard the work of fighting disaster and carrying out disaster relief their central task of paramount importance at the present stage and should meticulously organize the efforts, make overall consideration and all-round arrangement, and make an all-out effort to carry out flood prevention and disaster relief and to engage in production to provide for and help ourselves. From 21 to 23 June, Wen Jiabao led a work group of responsible comrades of central party, Army, and government departments concerned to the great dike along the Xiangshui and to several major disaster areas in Hunan's Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Hengyang, where they inspected the disaster situation. On behalf of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, they extended cordial regards to flood victims as well as to cadres, the masses, People's Liberation Army [PLA] commanders and fighters, armed police, and public security cadres and officers. Together with the local party and government leaders, they studied and arranged for flood prevention and disaster relief work. Heavy rainstorm hit areas along the Xiangshui from 12 to 18 June, creating great flood unseen in 100 years and causing heavy losses to industrial and agricultural production and to people's lives and property in urban and rural areas along the river. After the outbreak of the disaster, under the leadership of the Hunan provincial party committee and government and with the support of the PLA and armed police units in Hunan, the military and civilians in the province spared no efforts in fighting the disaster. Their efforts have ensured the safety of Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang Cities, as well as the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, State Highway 107, and other major transportation facilities; reduced losses caused by the disaster; and scored initial success in combating flood and carrying out disaster relief. At present, the masses in the disaster area are calm in their sentiments, society is stable, and life is normal. Wen Jiabao fully affirmed Hunan's fight against flood and its disaster relief work. He urged the military and civilians throughout the province to display the dauntless spirit of fighting successive battles to win all-around victories in fighting the disaster and carrying out relief. After hearing a report on the disaster and observing the disaster situation, Wen Jiabao also expressed his views on the work of fighting the disaster and carrying out relief. He said: The Xiangshui's water level is subsiding. However, its flood season has not arrived yet. We must not lower our guard and become careless; we must continue to do a good job of preparing against big flood and disaster. First, we must step up repairing various works damaged by water and reinforcing the dike. This is the key to preventing flood. Second, we must make adequate arrangement for the victims' daily life, properly resolve their food and clothing problems, and carry out public health and epidemic prevention work. Third, we must organize efforts to provide for and help ourselves and to rebuild our homes by engaging in production, and we must restore industrial and agricultural production. Fourth, we must strengthen ideological-political work to further mobilize the initiatives of the vast number of cadres and masses in fighting the disaster and carrying out disaster relief. Fifth, we must strengthen leadership. Party committees and governments in disaster areas must lead the broad masses to rely on themselves and rebuild their homeland through thrift and diligence. All departments should work closely and provide big support to overcome various difficulties. We must unite as one to fight the disaster and carry out disaster relief.
