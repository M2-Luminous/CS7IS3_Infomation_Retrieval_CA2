Cheaper products from the East Asia--and more and more frequently from Ukraine, Belarus, and the Balkan countries--are pushing our products out of the European Union (EU) markets," Waldemar Markuszewski, deputy director of the department of commodity sales and tariff policy regulation in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation, said to NOWA EUROPA. Some types of textile products are included in the so-called sensitive commodities group. The EC countries, as well as the United States, Canada, and Norway, limit their export by employing quotas. A large part of the quotas allocated to us in an interim agreement with EC remains unused. The ministry expects that this year will be better than last year. The annual reduction in duties on Polish textiles should help to make this possible. Furthermore, the size of the quota itself is being increased 2-3 percent. Our products are no longer as competitive as they were a year or two ago due to increased labor costs, although they are still lower than in the West. They lose out to the still-cheaper textiles from East Asia and the products from the Central and East European countries--e.g., Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia. Polish producers do not always know how to meet the requirements of the Western market, and they lack money for promotion. The old foreign trade organizations offices were either bankrupted or underwent transformation, and the companies were not always able to develop new connections with Western traders in time. The competition is great, and our firms find it difficult to meet it, especially because not every company can fill large orders. But there are Polish factories that have an established reputation on the foreign markets and steady customers in the EC countries and the United States. Textile quotas to the United States, Canada, and Norway are also being only partially used. Textiles are an important item in our trade and constitute almost 13.5 percent of total exports. Most of our exports are to Germany, indicating that our customers there know the Polish market well. This export makes up 18 percent of our export to the EU. We export the least to Spain and Portugal, whose markets are our competitors in deliveries to EC markets. Only 18 groups of texile commodities are subject to quotas. We sell the remainder, such as blankets, woolen fabrics, tents, ladies' blouses, and work clothes, without limitations.
