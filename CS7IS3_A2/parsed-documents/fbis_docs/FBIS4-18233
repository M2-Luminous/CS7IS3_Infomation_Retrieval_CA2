This does not just apply to Germany, but is a particularly valid point considering the stagnation in this sphere in Germany over the past few years. In the process of expanding EU institutions, the need to restrain the extent of public services in good time must also be given greater consideration in Brussels. Every EU country is currently holding a debate on the application of EU law on its terrirory, and on accelerating approval procedures. New concepts of efficiency in the state and in the administration are being developed. New trade forms are being worked out that conform to a more modern management of services, also taking into account the experiences of the private economy. But solutions for modernizing the state sector are not being introduced at the expense of this sector's efficiency. The state sector's efficiency must protect the common good from group interests. Therefore the question is not whether the state must act, but where and how it must act. Also, the objective is not the reduction of state sector activity to zero, but to adapt the state administration to modern requirements in good time. Modernization means setting clear goals, permitting efficient activity, making a more economical use of resources, reaching decisions faster, and concentrating state activity on important matters. This means "purifying" state and communal activity and giving it a more efficient shape. The public sector is reformable as long as everyone -- the citizens, working people, trade unions, and politicians -- wants it reformed. Public administration must continue to develop in accordance with changing requirements. This includes a reorganization of the administration to bring it closer to the people, so that the administration can become a public-oriented service. But it also includes accelerating and simplifying decisionmaking processes and administrative procedures. Genuine reform also includes a regular critical appraisal of tasks. The laender and communuity administrations must check whether a particular task really has to be performed by the public services. New "management" [preceding word in English] is required in the public sector, together with an elimination of the excessive hierarchical structures there, and a far-reaching decentralization involving the distribution of the decisionmaking process among smaller "autonomous" administrative units. I am not committed to the idea of the provision of services by private firms, but I wish to make it clear that no general decision can be made whether and to what extent public tasks and services will be performed by private structures and what form these private structures should take. That can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, careful consideration leads one to conclude that in the process of transferring from publicly to privately provided services, one must avoid at all costs the emergence of private monopolies in the provision of particular services. In addition, privatized services should be offered constant protection. One must also consider whether or not the quality of services should be retained as it is or improved, and whether working people should be protected against excessive costs thereof. Privatization also involves social security. Rhineland-Palatinate is also at the beginning of state and communal modernization. But its government, in office since 21 May 1991, has already gone from theory to practice on several points. We have embarked upon the path of greater state efficiency and are including private industry in state processes. Our new Investment and Structure Bank is aimed at implementing the government's industrial and structural-political objectives. An amalgamation of the instruments and companies that promote the economy is expected to produce a synergy effect. Government employees have already joined the Investment and Structure Bank, and personnel savings can be achieved in the district governments. Once the rules governing the administration of districts have been amended, most state tasks can be transferred to the districts. This involves turning state employees into district employees. Rhineland-Palatinate has accelerated this process with its "Tax Office 2000" project. Income tax declarations will no longer be processed in up to 15 separate stages by as many different employees, as is the case at present; instead, they will be handled by just one employee, who will at the same time have broader authority. A test conducted in February 1993 resulted in a shortening of the average length of time in processing a tax declaration from nine weeks to just three weeks. Eleven tax offices are now participating in this experiment. The public administration can be made even more efficient and economical when greater use is made of the experience and creativity of employees. For this purpose, a competition for the best ideas on simplifying administrative procedures is being prepared, and will be held throughout Rhineland-Palatinate. I expect it to provide results before the end of the year. The following is also established practice in Rhineland-Palatinate: A new tax office in Neuwied and police precinct in Alzey have been built with the use of private capital and the experiences of private industry in construction projects. Our ministry for the economy has developed a unique way of financing road construction programs out of private capital in view of the tight budget. In contrast to past methods of private financing, smaller enterprises will no longer be accorded second place before larger ones. Rhineland-Palatinate has scored a hit on a national level with the construction of the Langenlosheim Bridge (Bad Kreuznach region), which was only possible with private capital. The next project involves the building of a bypass in the Westerwald region. The decisive advantage of the "Mogendorf model" is that when tenders are awarded, enterprises with medium resources, facing high costs because of the need to obtain loans to finance a project, are no longer at a disadvantage compared to large enterprises with a lot of capital. In this way, the lending bank can offer the borrowing enterprise attractive interest rates by means of certain refinancing opportunities on the capital market. Thus, an enterprise can receive attractive interest rates, just like the state can. Rhineland-Partnership has also set an example of partnerlike cooperation between the state and private sectors in another sphere -- the elimination of problem waste. In the company that handles this waste, the state has 51 percent of the shares, and private waste removal organizations have 49 percent of the shares. For the processing of special waste in two additional furnaces, Rhineland-Palatinate was able to establish cooperation with the firm BASF within the framework of "public-private partnership" [preceding two words in English]. Steps have been taken to reorganize state construction in Rhineland-Palatinate. A personnel management concept has been drawn up to prevent an excessive expansion of posts and permit the reduction of present posts. The combination of state, communities, and industry will be intensified even further on the basis of experience. Since 1991, a permanent link between the state, industry and science has been guaranteed in the form of the "Rhineland-Palatinate Future Initiative" association. This association has involved itself mainly in practical dealings. Its chairman is the president of the largest enterprise, and his deputy is the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
