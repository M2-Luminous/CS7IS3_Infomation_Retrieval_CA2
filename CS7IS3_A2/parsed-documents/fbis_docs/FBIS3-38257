Fabbri said the latest charges, that Italian troops refused to act as escorts for aid workers and stood by as local gunmen raided a warehouse, were "absolutely unfounded." Speaking at the inauguration of a Carabinieri investigative science centre here, Fabbri explained that with the ongoing withdrawal of Italian troops from Somalia, those left at the town of Beledweyne were scarcely equipped to do more than defend themselves and to intervene if aid convoys were attacked. In any case, he revealed, most of the slim contingent was engaged in convoy escort duty when the request to provide protection for civilian personnel was received. As for their alleged inaction when the warehouse was raided, he said they had only been informed of the incident the day after it occurred. The situation at Beledweyne was "promptly" reported to the UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] command, which decided not to move in to protect the personnel but to evacuate all members of nongovernmental bodies from the town the following day, he pointed out. The protest from the Save the Children Fund was thus "without foundation" and "does not deserve the disproportionate amount of attention it has received," he said. As for the recent charges from the Fund (and from the Norwegian humanitarian organisation Redd Barna) that Italian troops of the Alpine regiment were using the services of child prostitutes in Mozambique, Fabbri said the Italian commander General Silvio Mazzaroli had been told by local police that "no complaints have been made against our men"; the minister also stressed that the alleged incidents that have prompted a probe took place in parts of the country where Italian forces are not operating. But he added that he had nonetheless requested the general to make a report on the matter. Fabbri said he could not find an explanation for "the unjustified animosity shown by Save the Children towards our soldiers and the insistence with which they are concentrating on our Alpine troops, without any solid evidence, a probe that if anything concerns all the contingents in Mozambique, and which stems from rumours circulating about episodes that are alleged to have taken place in the south of the country, where our units are not operating."
