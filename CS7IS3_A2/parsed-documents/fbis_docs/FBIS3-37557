Power plant managers are unable to settle accounts with suppliers due to a shortage of funds, high prices for coal, gas and mazout as well as neck-breaking tariffs for their transportation. Especially hard hit are power plants in the Russian Far East, Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka peninsula as well as in Karelia and the Arkhangelsk region where fuel supplies were drastically cut. Electric power plants in the Far East daily received 46,000 tons of coal this month, instead of planned 66,000 tons. As a result, fuel stocks at the plants dwindled down nearly by a third. A paradoxical situation has developed: While warehouses of siberian suppliers are overstocked with fuel, power stations experience shortages. But non-payment by electricity consumers prevent stations from paying for fuel. The Russian Joint Stock Society of Energy and Electification alone owes over 1,200 billion roubles. Incidentally, the figure is constantly growing. A chain reaction has emerged, as it were: tower plants owe money to coal miners and oilmen. In turn, they are in debt to railwaymen and machine-builders. Several railways sharply cut coal deliveries due to non-payments. Many specialists see the way out of the present situation in switching to payment of transport tariffs by power plants themselves through mutual settlements. If the situation with fuel supplies to power stations does not change in the near future, consumers, especially in the Far East and north-west, will inevitably experience further cuts in heat and electricity supplies. To avoid such a situation, it is necessary to boost coal and mazout supplies by the end of February and in March.
