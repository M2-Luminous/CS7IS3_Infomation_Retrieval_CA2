According to this law, the firms will pay their 60 million denars debt owed to the international bank to the state instead. They are to settle the debt in eight years, with a grace period of three years and an annual interest rate of six percent, paid in five equal rates, starting from 31 March 1997. The government also adopted the proposed law on changes in existing law on administrative taxes. This law balances administrative services taxes, including the state's diplomatic and consular representative offices abroad, with the predicted annual inflation of 70 percent. Government members postponed the discussion on the law on census as the Statistics Institute submitted an incomplete financial report. The institute only informs of approved finances for the census procedure, but no formal confirmation has been received by any international financial institution so far. The census is evaluated to cost about $2.2 million and if the financial side is not settled in due time, it is hard to expect it will take place in June as planned.
