FBIS4-368 "drafr069_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Sierra Leone German Ambassador Given 10 Days To Leave German Ambassador Given 10 Days To Leave NPFL Contacts Blamed AB0804200694 London BBC World Service in English 1830 GMT 8 Apr 94 AB0804200694 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The government of Captain Strasser in Sierra Leone has well and truly fallen out with the German ambassador, Karl Prinz, and wants him sent home. It all came to a head at Mr. Prinz' reported contacts with NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, in neighboring Liberia. Taylor is frequently accused of backing the rebels in southern and eastern Sierra Leone. From Freetown, Victor Silva telexed this report. At a press briefing this afternoon, the foreign secretary, Dr. Abass Bundu, revealed that the Sierra Leone Government had today sent a request to Germany to recall Ambassador Prinz. Dr. Abass Bundu said that Sierra Leone was forced to take this line of action because of what he called the unfriendly and undiplomatic behavior of the ambassador, adding that Karl Prinz' behavior was prejudicial to relations between Germany and Sierra Leone. Dr. Bundu was careful to point out that the move was not in any way meant to disrupt relations between the two countries nor their peoples, but was meant only to have Karl Prinz replaced as Germany's representative here. And he has been given a 10-day period during which he should leave. Today's announcement by the foreign secretary comes in the wake of press reports here culled from a German newspaper, DER SPIEGEL, which reported that the German ambassador had visited Charles Taylor in Gbarnga and had held private discussions with him. Dr. Abass Bundu revealed that Karl Prinz had never informed the Sierra Leone Government that he was leaving on this visit, but merely sent a note to the Foreign Office saying that he would be out of the country. The Strasser regime believes that Foday Sankoh's RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels have received arms from Charles Taylor's NPFL with their headquarters at Gbarnga and regarded the action of Karl Prinz as covert and not in the interest of Sierra Leone's security. Dr. Abass Bundu said that despite efforts to get an explanation from Mr. Prinz, he was treated with contempt by the German ambassador who, instead, informed his office that he would be going on annual leave on 15 April. We do not, said Dr. Bundu, discourage any attempts at bringing peace to Liberia and Sierra Leone, but we have the right to be informed of activities involving Charles Taylor, a man who has caused untold misery in our country, and Ambassador Prinz has not acted in an acceptable manner.
