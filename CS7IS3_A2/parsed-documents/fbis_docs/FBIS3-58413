The summit yielded four essential results: First, NATO emphasized the close ties between North America, in particular the United States, and Europe. Second, cooperation between the Atlantic alliance and European Union will be considerably intensified. Third, NATO is offering a Partnership for Peace to the countries of Central, East, and southeast Europe, as well as to the successor states to the Soviet Union. Fourth, the alliance has given a clear signal that NATO is open for new members. The alliance has thus proved the central importance of NATO as the cornerstone of security and stability, not only for the members of the alliance, but, beyond that, for all of Europe. [applause] We as Germans, in particular, have experienced that the strength and the solidarity of the alliance made a decisive contribution to the end of the Cold War and the division of Europe and Germany. This historic success of NATO is mainly based on the firm security alliance between North America and Europe. In his great speech in Brussels City Hall on 9 January, President Clinton affirmed that the partnership in the security alliance with Europe remains a priority for the United States. He also promised that some 100,000 U.S. troops would remain stationed in Europe. In addition, he expressly praised and recognized Germany's role for the establishment of a stable peace system in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, NATO unambiguously supports the Maastricht Treaty and, thus, the further political unification of Europe. This applies also to the efforts, which we all want, especially we Germans, to develop an independent European security policy and defense system with the help of the Western European Union as the security policy branch of the political union according to the Maastricht Treaty. Reservations in this connection, which have sometimes been voiced in the past by some representatives of the U.S. Administration, no longer exist. [applause] In the future, the Western European Union will be able to rely on NATO forces for its own missions, if necessary. The second significant result of our talks is NATO's invitation to the young democracies in Central, East, and southeast Europe and the successor states to the Soviet Union to cooperate even more closely with us -- politically and militarily -- within the framework of the Partnership for Peace. At the same time, the Brussels summit also sent out the signal that NATO is open to new members. We want to lead the former communist nations in Central and East Europe gradually closer to NATO, eventually even offering them membership, if these countries so wish, of course. [applause] This new approach is a historically unprecedented offer to create a military alliance for comprehensive cooperation and partnership with former opponents. All states accepting this partnership will have the opportunity to participate in joint military planning and exercises. This includes joint training and participation in international peacekeeping missions. With these measures, NATO wants to contribute to establishing armed forces that are committed to democracy and whose inner structures are comparable with those of our armed forces. Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, one of the central elements of this program is the offer to enter into consultations with partners if they fear a direct threat to their territorial integrity, political independence, or security. Our Partnership for Peace program is such that this process can take place in a flexible, individual way, taking into account other developments in Europe. Each country is invited to contribute its share to this partnership. Our future partners will be given the opportunity to codetermine the speed and extent of approaching NATO according to their own interests. [applause]. In view of the wishes of some of our East European partners to become members, NATO is faced with difficult questions. We understand the need for security and the fears of the people in these countries. These fears are based on tragic experiences in this century. In addition, the people in Central and East Europe were longing for freedom and democracy during the years of the Cold War. After the Iron Curtain came down, we encouraged these countries to introduce democracy and a market economy of the Western type. Therefore, their wish to join the great institutions of the West is very understandable. [applause]. At the same time, there are historically based fears, especially in Russia, of isolation. We, and especially we Germans, must take this concern seriously. [applause]. That is why NATO is looking for comprehensive cooperation with Russia and Ukraine in security policy and the military fields. Ladies and Gentlemen, if we want to achieve this goal of establishing a solid European security system, we all must take account of these psychological features and security interests. After our own experiences in this century, there must by no means be new divisions in Europe. Security and stability in Europe are indivisible. [applause]. That is why I think that disappointment or discouragement about the decisions made at the NATO summit are not at all appropriate. Our offer, which some countries have already accepted, is an important step that is intended seriously for the future NATO membership of the Central and East European states. Today Germany has good relations with all countries in Central and East Europe, including Russia. This gives us the special opportunity to work toward this process constructively on a bilateral basis. And our proximity to these countries, as well as our special historic experience and responsibility oblige us to do this. For me, an essential outcome of the negotiations in Brussels is that the Atlantic alliance and the European Union [EU] are working toward the same goal, namely to include the young democracies in Central and East Europe in existing Western communities. At the Conference of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, the EU offered concrete perspectives for membership to our neighbors in the east. We Germans especially want these countries to join. Yet, and this has to be made clear as well, they themselves have to create and meet the political and economic preconditions for membership. [applause]. We do not want to forget that these prospects for membership are of immediate significance in terms of security policy. After all, under the Maastricht Treaty one of the European Union's key objectives is to develop joint security and foreign policy. These countries will, thus, get the opportunity to participate in this development even before they become members. Ladies and Gentlemen; this policy primarily also corresponds to our own vital interests in Germany. It is absolutely inconceivable to me that the German-Polish border should remain the eastern border of European political union forever. [applause] In the other reform countries of East Europe, the European Union wants to develop relations in partnership on the basis of appropriate treaties. The Federal Government is pressing to conclude particularly the agreement with Russia as soon as possible. Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen; for many people the situation in the reform states, particularly in Russia itself, is characterized by enormous social problems, economic misery, and insecurity. The increasing crime and as yet insufficient structures of a rule-of-law state constitute a heavy burden on the people's day-to-day lives. They make economic reform difficult, which, understandably, leads to tension in domestic policy and even contributes to instability. The election in Russia and the big success of extremist forces are, therefore, a serious warning signal not only for the Russian leadership but for all of us. We in the West, too, must look even more closely than in the past at the immediate effects of the economic reform on the Russian population. At the Brussels summit we agreed that we must continue to support the policy of political reform in Russia, which has been personified by President Yeltsin since he took power. Despite all justified concerns about the Russian election result, we must not abandon our course. Progress must make itself clearly felt, especially for the people, whose standard of living has dramatically decreased in the recent past. [applause] We must not, however, ignore the shrill extremist sounds that we can now sometimes hear from Moscow. This is the one side. On the other hand, we should not contribute to dramatizing things. The extent of the social, political, and economic reorganization is absolutely unprecedented in history. A totalitarian communist dictatorship ruled in Russia after 1917, and, over the decades, generated a system that was hostile to the people and economically inefficient. Lifting the burden produced by such a regime takes time, courage, and incredible energy. Given the enormity of the challenge, the process can progress only slowly. The awareness of the people affected can adapt to the changes only gradually, and setbacks are inevitable in this process. Therefore, whenever we look at the developments in Moscow and Russia, we should not apply our traditional Western standards but show understanding for the special situation there. [applause] But we should not forget that, despite all the difficulties, the reform process in Russia has also brought about enormous progress. A majority of voters have given Russia a democratic constitution for the first time. The forming of democratic parties has begun; admittedly this has been quite difficult. In certain fields of economic reform, for instance with privatizations, we have seen the first successes. For me, this means that we must not let up in our efforts to support the reform process. What is of decisive importance is that we open our markets for goods from the reform countries. Economic aid, advice, and credits alone cannot bring about the desired results, however, if the countries are not enabled to earn their foreign currency themselves through exports. [applause] Of course, we will have to expect the Russian Government to continue conducting a policy of partnership, responsibility, and constructive participation in solving international problems. Hegemonic ambitions, of whatever kind, would be incompatible with these expectations. Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the alliance also agreed that Ukraine is an important partner for a future European security system. Nuclear disarmament in Ukraine, as laid down in the new agreement between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, will have to be effected as quickly as possible. Ukraine's security cannot be guaranteed by nuclear weapons, but only by close cooperation with its neighbors and NATO. [applause] I think we agree in expecting and desiring President Clinton's efforts in Kiev and Moscow to be successful. Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, to safeguard peace and stability in Europe, existing borders must remain untouched and minorities' rights be protected. The summit, therefore, welcomed the EU's initiative to establish a stability pact in Europe as an important contribution to peace and security. Over the past months and years we saw old centers of tension in Europe flare up and develop into bitter and bloody conflicts. At the Brussels summit we also discussed the situation in former Yugoslavia in detail. Safeguarding humanitarian supplies to the people there must remain our first priority. The alliance confirmed its readiness -- let me quote from the declaration -- under the authority of the UN Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina We will continue to try and achieve a political solution to the conflict and will thus support the efforts on part of the United Nations and the European Union. Unfortunately, the talks between Croats and Bosnians in Bonn last weekend did not lead to a breakthrough. Ladies and Gentlemen, people in many countries, including Germany, think that the efforts to end the conflict are insufficient. This is quite understandable. [applause] In view of the terrible images we get to see in the conflict area many people are asking themselves why the West and, particularly, why NATO is not doing more to end the conflict. I have great understanding for this question. Nevertheless, I would like to point out here that people often forget to what extent this war is dominated by hatred and irrational behavior -- developments that did not build up overnight but over decades or even centuries; and that all military experts concur that a comprehensive intervention to end the war with ground forces would require many hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Such an operation would cause many victims, even among the civilian population, and even then the question would remain whether lasting peace could thus be created. The truth is -- and one can say it with anger and bitterness, but it remains the truth -- that there is no magic formula for solving this conflict. We Germans, in particular, should be very cautious as far as giving good advice to others. We do not have the moral right to ask more from the responsible authorities in other countries -- and this is what I experience in my talks on a daily basis -- than what we do ourselves. [applause] When I look at my colleagues from France or Spain, who, as a result of their operational orders, have to bear the responsibility for the lives and the safety of young soldiers, I know what I am talking about, and I think we all see that similarly. Nevertheless, we want to take any opportunity, including today's, to thank these young soldiers from many nations and to express our sympathy to them and their families. After all, they are risking their lives in a difficult place for the cause of peace. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the former Yugoslavia is only one example, albeit the most terrifying one at the moment, that war has not been banned from Europe forever. Therefore, the development of a European peace system -- and let met put it in even more straightforward terms -- therefore, political unification is more important than ever. After all, the European Union, which we want, is more than a mere economic community, a community guided by the economic and financial interests of its members. The deepening and simultaneous extension of the European Union are decisive for the securing of peace and freedom. Ladies and Gentlemen, the fact that this year we can look back at 48 years of peace, the longest period of peace in modern history, also has something to do with the fact that people in Europe have come closer together. In this sense, and with a view to the next generation and what will come in the 21st century, the question of European unity will always also be a question of war and peace in Europe in this coming century. [applause] There is no alternative to such a policy or such a political vision in the foreseeable future. [applause] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the sober assessment of the situation in Europe at the NATO summit clearly shows that we will have to make our contribution to defending peace and freedom in the future, too. This means we need a Bundeswehr that is well-trained, well-equipped, and highly motivated. [applause]. It means that the capability to form alliances and be used in missions must be safeguarded. [applause] Peace and freedom do not come free. We all know that in view of the pressing problems the Bundeswehr cannot be exempted from cuts. But we cannot, and must not, let the operation of the armed forces be threatened by this. Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is in a time of transition today. This transition goes hand in hand with great challenges and insecurity. Especially in this difficult situation we have to see and make use of the great opportunities that have arisen for Europe after the end of the East-West conflict. It is, therefore, an outstanding result of the NATO summit in Brussels, that the Atlantic alliance and the Economic Union are now combining their forces in order to lead the reform states of East and Central Europe toward the existing community and integrate them into it. This has always been a goal of German foreign policy, and it will remain so. [applause] It is also true, and must be said when we are speaking of those days in Brussels, that the confidence of our friends and partners in both West and East has grown, that we are trusted. This international trust in the reliability and predictability of German foreign policy is one of our most important starting points for the future. It is an important asset. We have the compass to keep the right course -- together with our friends and partners -- in this transitional period that is so difficult for Europe. The transition is difficult, but it offers many more opportunities than the decades of the Cold War. Opportunities to secure peace and freedom for our country, for the people living here, and particularly for a free, open, and democratic Europe. [applause]
