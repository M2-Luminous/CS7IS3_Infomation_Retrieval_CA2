Majevica this morning. From the direction of Drijenca, Humci, Nahvioci, Brnik, Vrazici, and Teocak, Muslim forces launched an artillery attack on Serb positions and civilian targets in Priboj, Vukosavci, and Lopare. A tank attack was launched around 0900 and about 100 shells were fired on these targets. A school, a church, and a farm in Priboj were attacked by Muslim forces and two civilians were wounded. At around 1000, Muslim forces supported by heavy artillery launched an all-out infantry attack on Banj Brdo, Stolice, Piperi, and Spasojevici. The Serb defense forces energetically repelled the completely unprovoked attack and inflicted huge losses upon the enemy. Being unable to launch an infantry breakthrough, in the early afternoon the Muslim forces started shelling Banj Brdo, Stolice, and civilian targets around Lopare. The defense lines have not changed and there have been no casualties among the Serb fighters.
