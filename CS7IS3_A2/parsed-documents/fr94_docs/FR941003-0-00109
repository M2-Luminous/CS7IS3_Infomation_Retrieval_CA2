FR941003-0-00109 FR941003-0-00018 Section 267.8(c)(1) embodies the prohibitions of proposed §267.5(c), but has been simplified in one respect. Proposed §267.5(c)(1) addressed contracts between the mortgagee and the appraiser if the two were affiliated. While this relationship is still prohibited in multifamily cases, in single family programs, where DE mortgagees may employ staff appraisers, it is inconsistent with much of the lending industry's practice. The prohibition has therefore been dropped from §267.8(c). In §267.8(d)(1), the list of legal entities which, together with natural persons, comprise eligible types of appraisers has been expanded from the list in §267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule to include joint ventures, limited liability companies and other organizations. In addition, §267.8(d)(1) has been redrafted to explain the options available to a DE mortgagee in need of an appraiser, i.e., an independent contractor, a staff employee or a fee panelist. Section 267.5(d)(1) of the proposed rule did not cover these options; paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) focused instead on appraiser qualifications, which made them somewhat redundant since appraiser qualifications were also set forth in §267.5(d)(2), now §267.8(d)(2), describing the Roster. Proposed §267.5(d)(1)(iv) has been incorporated into §267.8 (d)(1) of this rule and revised to make it clear that the mortgagee and appraiser share not only concurrent but also equal responsibility for the accuracy and thoroughness of an appraisal. In §267.8(d)(2), the appraiser, rather than providing evidence of compliance with the items listed in proposed §267.5(d) (2)(i)&hyph;(vi), may now certify that he or she satisfies the requirements of that paragraph. Also, two of the proposed requirements have been dropped: there is no obligation to obtain errors and omissions insurance unless the mortgagee requires it and there is no fee for being listed on the Roster. Section 267.8(f)(1) [proposed §267.5(h)] no longer requires as a condition to transferring an appraisal that the accepting mortgagee have ``adopted appraisal review procedures in accordance with this part''. Inclusion of this condition in the proposed rule was an error. There is no appraisal review procedure contained in the rule. Section 267.5(f) of the proposed rule, regarding the extent to which others may assist the appraiser, has been deleted. As explained above, the thrust of many changes which distinguish this rule from the proposal is to place a greater reliance on USPAP and, wherever possible, to achieve compatibility with generally accepted practices of the appraisal industry. Consistent with this approach, the Department looks to USPAP to set criteria for the ``assistance of others''.
