Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 15 January reports that a research biochemist at the institute for citrus and other fruit crops recently won an award from the Ministry of Agriculture for obtaining a set of reagents and a blend for the development of a reaction, the purpose of which is to diagnose quickly and with 96-percent effectiveness the tree virus called "the virus of sadness" [el virus de la tristeza] which causes great damage to citrus crops worldwide. "The Cuban reagent is obtained from the blood plasma of previously immunized laboratory animals. The monoclonal antibody is capable of recognizing this tree virus before symptoms are present. This allows one to determine, after a sampling, the rate of incidence of the disease and fight it effectively and more cheaply. A reagent for the same purpose imported from Spain used to cost Cuba $2,000 per milligram. Our product has a production cost of $45. The market is being studied with a view to marketing the product for between $800 and $1,200 per milligram."
