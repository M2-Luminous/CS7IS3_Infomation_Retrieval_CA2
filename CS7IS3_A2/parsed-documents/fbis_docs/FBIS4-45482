FBIS4-45482 "jptdd027__l94060" JPRS-TDD-94-027L JPRS Narcotics 14 June 1994 WEST EUROPE UNITED KINGDOM National Criminal Intelligence Service Reshaped National Criminal Intelligence Service Reshaped BR1706130194 London Hermes Database in English 14 Jun 94 BR1706130194 London Hermes Database English BFN [Press release from the UK National Criminal Intelligence Service: "National Criminal Intelligence Service Reshapes Itself"] [Text] Albert Pacey, Director General of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), today outlined the way forward for the service in its fight against major criminal activity in the UK. `NCIS was formed two years ago out of disparate units drawn from various parts of the police service. Having established itself as an effective intelligence-gathering organisation, it is now appropriate to ensure that the structure of the organisation is capable of continuing to deliver high quality intelligence packages to our main customers: regionally based law enforcement agencies. `Following wide consultation and an internal review, a revised mission statement and strategic aims have been introduced. The new strategy is intended to position NCIS in the intelligence world and to give sharper focus to its work. `In order to deliver the new strategy the structure of NCIS has been revised and will comprise: -- UK Division encompassing all five regional offices and the current Scottish/Irish Liaison Unit; -- International Division which will integrate the intelligence product of Interpol more fully within NCIS. It will also contain the European Drugs Liaison Officer network and a newly created Europol section to act as the national focal point for intelligence to and from Europol HQ in the Hague; and -- HQ Division providing strategic intelligence by means of a revamped Strategic and Specialist Intelligence Branch. This will maintain an organised crime unit, football unit and specialist crimes unit. Additionally it will house a newly formed economic crimes unit and a new drugs unit. `This new structure will allow NCIS to provide leadership and excellence in criminal intelligence. We have moved away from a `commodity' based approach to crime to a `functional' one which will clarify our role. Underpinning this revised strategy will be our new integrated computer `brain': ALERT which is due to come on stream from 1 April 1995. It will be a flexible system allowing for the passing of intelligence and its analysis. `I believe that this new strategy and structure with its clearly defined areas of activity and clear lines of communication will prevent duplication of effort and ensure that intelligence is not lost. NCIS will continue to lead the way in providing high quality intelligence to law enforcement agencies and together combat major criminal activity.' Notes 1. Albert Pacey, CBE [Commander of the most noble order of the British Empire], QPM [Queen's Police Medal], has been the Director General of the National Criminal Intelligence Service since August 1993. He was speaking today at a press conference at NCIS HQ. 2. The following guiding principles have been established in the review of NCIS structure: - NCIS is a criminal focused organisation; - the business of NCIS should, where possible, be split on a functional rather than a commodity basis; - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals residing in the UK should be performed in the regional offices; - the development of strategic intelligence should be carried out at headquarters; - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals, or non-UK subjects of interest to NCIS, who live or are primarily based outside the UK should be performed at headquarters; - there must be clearly defined areas of activity with clear lines of communication to prevent duplication of effort and to ensure that intelligence is not lost; - NCIS should establish its own unique identity, with a structure which meets the needs of the organisation and its users. 3. The organisation's new mission statement, structure and strategic aims are attached. (Hard copy only.) PRESS ENQUIRIES: Susan Daniels: 071 238 8431
