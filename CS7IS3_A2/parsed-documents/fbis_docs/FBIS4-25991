As in other activities, he said, "strategically we should despise them, but tactically we should take them all seriously. "So we should not only have determination and confidence, but also the capabilities and methods in handling these things," he added. Li, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made these remarks at a meeting with a delegation from the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong led by its president Herbert Liang. He said the principle of "one country, two systems" has been created by Deng Xiaoping, which conforms to the interests of the Chinese people including the Hong Kong compatriots and is of important and far-reaching significance. "We will unswervingly implement this principle," he added. Li urged the Hong Kong compatriots to unite and make more contributions to the process of realizing that Hong Kong is governed by Hong Kong citizens themselves. During the meeting, Li congratulated the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on the 60th anniversary of its founding. He noted a great deal of work that the association has done in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development and supporting the mainland's reform and opening to the outside world and its modernizations. He expressed the hope that the association will continue its efforts to contribute to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
