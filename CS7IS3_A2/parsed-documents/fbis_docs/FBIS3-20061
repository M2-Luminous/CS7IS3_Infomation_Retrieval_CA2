He will not deviate "one centimeter" from this accusation, Schoenhuber said at a news conference at the Bavarian land congress of the right-wing extremist Republikaner in Erding near Munich on Saturday [26 March]. "The one who causes anti-Semitism in Germany is Mr. Bubis." The delegates' meeting, from which the press was excluded, was accompanied by protests. "Right-wing extremists are once again waging war against a hesitating democracy," said Fritz Schoesser, Bavarian land chairman of the German Trade Union Federation, with a view to the latest attacks. At a peaceful memorial rally he stated that the 70,000 registered right-wing extremists are a "warning signal for democracy in this country." According to the police, about 600 people participated in the demonstration against right-wing extremism.
