Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, told a regular press conference after the cabinet meeting that it will suffice if blueprints for the scale of the budget for the year starting April and the proposed tax reforms are decided before the Washington meeting. Kumagai said he hopes traditional bureaucratic procedures to decide the budget will be streamlined compared with how it was under the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party. With respect to the planned additional pump-priming package, he said the government will make a "political decision" on the scale of a potential tax cut and how to fund it as soon as the Diet closes its current session on Saturday.
