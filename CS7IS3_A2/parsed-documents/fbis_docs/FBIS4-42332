And in six months his ability to convince could determine the issue of Sweden's place in Europe. The Social Democratic Party [SDP] chairman occupies a strategic position. His May Day speech in Sundbyberg and Stockholm should say something about how he intends to play it. In contrast to LO [Federation of Trade Unions] chairman Bertil Jonsson, Ingvar Carlsson did not evade the European Union [EU] issue. Swedish Social Democracy cannot stay outside a European cooperation for peace, against unemployment, and for the environment, the party chairman explained. The day Ingvar Carlsson has the party executive committee and the party convention backing him as well, on that day he can appear with even greater authority in his argumentation for Swedish EU membership. The risk is that he nevertheless continues more or less like this up to the election, that is to say just mentions his EU position in passing at appearances whose temperament and overtones -- what the Social Democrats remember from the meetings -- are devoted to the fight against Bildt. After that, it could take a valuable month to form a government and get it under way. If so, there will not be much time for Ingvar Carlsson to speak earnestly with his people about what is at stake in the referendum. With the strong support the Social Democrats have now had for 20 months in the party strength polls, the party leadership should be able to take a few risks before the election so that it will increase its chances of winning in the referendum. Getting 43 or 45 percent in the parliamentary election cannot be totally decisive for the party, particularly since Ingvar Carlsson has said that he is looking for coalition partners rather than a single majority, but 48 or 50 percent yes in the EU referendum in November will make a crucial difference for Sweden. The nightmare for the Social Democratic party leadership is to get sole responsibility for leading Sweden and right afterward to see confidence in the country collapse. That is precisely what could happen if the national election is won largely by keeping quiet about the EU position, but the referendum is narrowly lost because there is not enough time to convince one's own ranks. A yes in the referendum does not solve Sweden's economic problems. What is self-inflicted must be self-cured. But a majority in favor of rejection could halt the recovery in a sensitive phase. Investors become more cautious. Buyers avoid Swedish Government obligations, with falling prices (equals higher interest rates) as a result. The concern that under all circumstances exists, that a Social Democratic government will result in resumed inflationary policies, will be reinforced in such a situation. And in the event a Carlsson government is forced, as a result of a no vote, to compensate for both inflationary concerns and this uncertainty, it will be faced with major demands for economies in the January 1995 budget -- without in addition being able to afford to alienate big capital by means of reintroduced double taxation and personal property tax. In his May Day speech Ingvar Carlsson did not make the smallest attempt at informing the audience about the complex international conditions that exist for the Swedish economy, the one economy in the world that is most dependent on a few big, global enterprises. "How could it go so wrong so quickly?" asked the former prime minister. His only reply seemed to be "Carl Bildt," possibly reinforced with "Anne Wibble." The course of events behind the crisis was forgotten. The prescription for the future was given as higher marginal taxes, no child-care subsidy, keeping every service in the public sector, and another 90,000 taxpayer-funded jobs. One should not simply accuse Ingvar Carlsson of playing with false cards regarding the economy. He actually seems to think that a return to Erlander is possible in the 1990's (although it is in curious contrast to his own observation in his European speech at the party convention in the fall of 1993: "If today we try to apply Keynes and Wigforss to a country, that country will ruin its economy directly"). The deregulations, the tax reform, the municipal tax freeze, the major decrease in housing subsidies, and other elements from the Carlsson administration's last years in power are completely gone, erased from the history of Social Democracy. It is like the other day when KOMMUNAL arranged a "tribunal against neoliberalism"; the accused were primarily Bengt K. A. Johansson's municipal law, Kjell-Olof Feldt's tax reform, and Allan Larsson's hard currency policy, all pursued under Ingvar Carlsson as prime minister. Someone has pushed the "erase everything" button to a sensitive part of the CD-ROM disk containing the history of Social Democracy in government. Perhaps this will bear fruit for the party in five months. But those who are knowledgeable should fear a backlash within a year.
