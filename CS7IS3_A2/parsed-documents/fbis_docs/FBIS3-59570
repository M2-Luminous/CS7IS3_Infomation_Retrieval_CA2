(Footnote 1) (The objective of the JESSI program is to make European semiconductor technology credible enough to win a respectable market share on the international scene, and above all to facilitate innovation in all electronics-based systems designed in Europe.) Practical applications are now possible. Users can start designing 0.5-micron IC's thanks to the libraries made available by a number of suppliers, with so-called "relaxed" rules, so that an IC designed by one of them can be easily distributed later by another one, possibly as a second source. It is worth reminding that until recently, in Europe, the most advanced custom-made IC's were based on 0.7-micron technology. Small production runs of 0.5-micron custom IC's will be possible from April 1994, with large ones becoming possible in April 1995. This "alliance at the top" is one of the consequences of the current good cooperation climate among the JESSI industrial partners, thanks to the action of JESSI President Heinz W. Hagmeister (the former president of Philips' IC division) and JESSI Vice President Guy Dumas (Matra MHS' former president). This alliance confirms that what "pays" in any government-initiated endeavor is a long-term policy with clearly identified objectives. Now that JESSI has reached its mature stage, results will soon follow, the most significant ones being expected in computer-assisted design and 0.35-micron technology: There is today a high likelihood that the goal of a transfer to industry of a 0.35- micron CMOS technology that is mostly free of non-European components will be achieved. The European semiconductor industry could thus be able to offer ASIC's [application-specific integrated circuits] based on a 0.35-micron technology before the end of 1996, that is, before the JESSI program terminates. IC's as of April 1994 The fact that there is design rule compatibility for 0.5-micron IC's among suppliers does not mean that the technologies of the participating companies are identical, apart from those of SGS-Thomson, Philips, and Mietec (Philips has been developing its technology at SGS-Thomson's Crolles [France] plant and Mietec is manufacturing IC's in Belgium under license from SGS-Thomson). For instance, SGS-Thomson's 0.5-micron, 3.3-volt technology is characterized by double-gate transistors which make it as fast as the 0.7-micron, 5-volt technology. And the company's stacked via technology with tungsten-filled holes makes for increasing integration density. Starting dates for the distribution of the IC's will be slightly different depending on the company: The 0.5-micron technology is being tested by SGS-Thomson-Philips, Siemens, and Matra MHS, while qualification -- and therefore the release of the final version of the 0.5-micron library cells -- is scheduled for early 1994. As for ES2, GEC Plessey, and Mietec, they will be ready a few months later. ES2, for example, will finalize its compatible design rules during the first quarter of 1994, and will market its 0.5-micron library in time for customers to start designing in the second quarter of 1994. At the same time, ES2 will conduct the qualification phase of its 0.5-micron technology -- directly derived from the JESSI program -- until late 1994 or early 1995, when the first operational 0.5-micron IC's will start coming out of the Rousset plant.
