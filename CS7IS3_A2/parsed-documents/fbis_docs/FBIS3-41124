Being there at the invitation of China's public security minister [Tao Siju], Magureanu held a series of talks with representatives of the Chinese intelligence service, intended to share information gathered by the two intelligence services in an effort to combat drug trafficking. Another goal of the visit is related to the fact that since 1989 Romania, like other Eastern European countries, has been facing a crime wave in which Asians are also involved and some of these violations could also threaten Romania's national security. The SRI director, carrying a (black) Romanian diplomatic passport, left for Beijing on a TAROM [Romanian national airline] charter flight.
