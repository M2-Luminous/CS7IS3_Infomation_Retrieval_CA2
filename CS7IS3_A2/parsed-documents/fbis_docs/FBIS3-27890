He added the government would start negotiations with the U.S. Government on the matter during next week, if things go smoothly. The Board of Audit and Inspection noted last July that the U.S. Government had not paid rents for its embassy buildings for the past 13 years without any legal basis. The government has concluded that it is reasonable to collect retroactive rents for the past five years and continue to collect new rents in the future, the official said. The government will also request that the U.S. Government move the embassy to the old site of Kyonggi Girls High School as soon as possible, he added. The rents are estimated at about 500 million won a year. The U.S. Government is expected to claim the right to use the buildings free of rents.
