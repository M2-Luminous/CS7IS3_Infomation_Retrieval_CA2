These two events will take place before and after 100 million Brazilians are to elect, in October, their new president, the entire Chamber of Deputies, and two-thirds of the Senate. The Workers Party [PT], of which I was president until a few days ago and which is the party that is supporting my presidential bid, considers these two forums to be very important, especially at a time when the world is experiencing important transformations and needs to redefine the economic and political order that emerged at the end of World War II. This is why we value the Cartagenas meeting, if only it can help implement concrete measures to face the serious social problems that Latin America is experiencing, especially the high degree of poverty. The summit must also contribute toward the democratization of Haiti, which presupposes an end to the military dictatorship and the return of Jean Bertrand Aristide to the presidency. Regarding the Miami meeting, we are concerned about Cuba's absence due to the veto of the U.S. Government, which is hosting the meeting. Such a decision is not compatible with the efforts of rapprochement that are being made in many parts of the world, and it maintains an atmosphere on our continent that is completely out of time and place with the Cold War that has now been overcome. In any case, this is an excellent occasion for Brazil's main opposition force, the PT -- which has a real possibility of gaining control of government on 1 January 1995 -- to explain how it views our position in the world. The main problem that is being experienced today in Brazilian foreign policy is the absence -- for more than 15 years -- of a national development project. In addition to the fact that profound internal changes have occurred in that period of time, we have also had transformations in the international situation. The end of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Socialist countries, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, have altered, with the end of the Cold War, the relations between international forces. But the world economy has also suffered very important transformations with the emergence of three [as published] great focal points: megamarkets and very large productive systems, and this has accelerated what many have called the "globalization" of the economy. The social and economic problems that these blocs are facing within themselves (unemployment, racism, and the advance of the extreme right); the economic situation in many areas of the "southern" part of the world; and the serious crises that the former Socialist countries and many areas of Africa are experiencing, permit us to talk about a new international (dis)order that is under way. The world is experiencing a period of transition and it is not known how it will end. It will be very important to take this into account when a new foreign policy is formulated for Brazil. Our country must seek the implementation of a new economic order that will eliminate the trade and financial blackmail that the developed countries impose on a large part of the world, and this must be done directly or through international organizations. We need to democratize international relations by reforming the United Nations, especially its Security Council, which was created 50 years ago when the world's problems were of another type and quite different from the current ones. Brazil's opening up to the world does not mean that we do not have priorities for the next few years. Latin America, especially South America, is the top priority. To strengthen, correct, and expand Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is an important goal that can accelerate an integration process that will include all of South America through the creation of a free trade zone in the subcontinent. This process is of fundamental importance in achieving more balanced relations with the United States and the EU. Brazil must seek to establish more open-minded relations with such countries as China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and especially with the latter country, which is now entering a new era. They are countries that cannot be absorbed, as is the case with Brazil, by the current blocs; and they also have economic potential and an international dimension and bearing that are sufficiently important for the implementation of common actions in the economic sphere, in specific or more extensive political interventions, and in scientific-technical cooperation, etc. Within the next 10 years, Brazil will finally have to participate in international initiatives or take them itself, in the fields of human rights, preservation of the environment, and in the achievement of a more just economic order, especially in the case of a new confrontation pertaining to social and labor matters at the international level. Strengthening national sovereignty and the implementation of national development projects in our continent are not incompatible with a policy of continental integration. On the contrary, the national projects can and must be made possible through a courageous and decided integration policy that will make the never-forgotten dream of Simon Bolivar come true on the eve of the 21st century.
