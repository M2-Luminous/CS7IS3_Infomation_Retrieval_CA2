Aware that the Iraqi press is state-controlled, foreign observers are speculating that BABIL's admonitions may signal an imminent shakeup in the Iraqi diplomatic community that may see the country's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf lose their jobs. BABIL's views and commentaries are not necessarily those of the decisionmakers in Iraq. It must be pointed out, however, that Iraq's foreign policy, and that of all nations, for that matter, is a reflection of its internal politics, all the more so in the absence of a pluralistic political system of government or a state within a state. Out of our concern for Iraq, we will venture to say that BABIL's criticisms are not well founded. It does not make sense to single out one party for criticism and lay the blame for the failure to get the sanctions lifted at the doorstep of Iraq's foreign policy makers. It is not so much the preformance of this or that Iraqi diplomat that will get the job done. It has more to do with Iraq's overall policies, administered by a well-known leader. To be fair, there is much to be said for the way the diplomatic team led by Tariq 'Aziz conducted itself at the height of the Kuwait crisis. Even hostile Western circles will go along with that evaluation. At the United Nations, 'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari did a wonderful job that few, in his place, could match. The same could be said for 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, who steered a successful media effort from Paris under unfavorable circumstances and an unequal balance of forces. Even Henry Kissinger, renowned for his feats on the diplomatic battlefront, could not have outperformed Tariq 'Aziz, Nizar Hamdun, or al-Sahhaf. The diplomatic team of any nation with circumstances similar to those of Iraq would probably do no better. In the kind of circumstances -- a bottleneck -- Iraq is going through, such brilliant diplomats should be retained, not fired. Iraq has had more than its share of exhaustion and bloodletting over the last three decades. It is more than likely that BABIL's admonitions to the directors of Iraq's foreign policy are not inspired by the country's top leadership, but are the opinion of their authors. If, indeed, they are inspired from above, then Iraq is in for a big loss that it can ill afford in these particularly hard and critical times.
