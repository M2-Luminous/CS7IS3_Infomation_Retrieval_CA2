At a news conference after a meeting with his Czech counterpart, Jozef Zieleniec, Claes added that the Czech Republic will, however, have to accept the Community standards if it wants to join the EU, since there is no question of again playing the "British game of opt outs." Asked by Czech journalists if the Czech Republic could join the EU before the end of the century, Claes reiterated the need to first strengthen the EU. He predicted, however, that the situation developing in Russia could accelerate European integration. In this respect, the Belgian foreign minister urged the Greek presidency to ensure that the association treaty signed between the EU and the Czech Republic last November is ratified as soon as possible. Claes also insisted that the EU would not treat the enlargement negotiations as one package and that one country of the Visegrad group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary) could well gain EU membership before the others. He added: "I am convinced that the Czech Republic will soon meet the economic conditions for membership." Claes had previously met with the president of the Czech parliament and members of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees. Czech deputies had reminded him of their "slight disappointment" at not being able to join NATO immediately. The Foreign Affairs Committee chairman said, regrettably: "We want to base our action on a policy of alliance. We do not want to be neutral. The Partnership for Peace (a type of strengthened cooperation between NATO and the countries of Eastern Europe) is a simple form of cooperation." Speaking to the journalists about the Czech "disappointment," Claes stressed that, even if Russia belonged to the Partnership for Peace, that would not give it the right to have any say in the enlargement of NATO. This is the first visit by a Belgian foreign minister to the Czech Republic, and Foreign Ministry sources say that the two countries are envisaging adapting and renewing bilateral agreements. New agreements in the areas of air transport, road transport, investment, and taxation are expected to be concluded. [passage omitted]
