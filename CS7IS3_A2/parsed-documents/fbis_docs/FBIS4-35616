In a statement he made to KUNA on his arrival in Kuwait today from Manama, in the framework of his tour in the region, he further said: We are not of the view that the declaration of independence by South Yemen will gain recognition. He also said: Clearly, Yemenis agree on the need to change the constitutional situation in Yemen to bring about a completely different situation, but at this moment we recognize one Yemeni state. After a meeting with the Kuwaiti Defense Minister Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah, the British minister further said: We do not believe that time has come to alleviate sanctions against Iraq, and this requires Iraq to meet two conditions at least. He said that these two conditions were Iraq's recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the state of Kuwait, and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders as demarcated by the UN. He also said that amongst the necessary and important conditions to alleviate the sanctions is Iraq's heeding of the UN Security Council resolutions concerning its arms of mass destruction, and its commitment to the measures concerning this. Hogg said he believed these requirements would not be met this year. Hogg also said that his talks with the Kuwaiti defense minister confirmed the British-Kuwaiti common defense and strategic interests, noting that Britain was very interested in Kuwait's independence and security. He said that the purpose of his visit to Kuwait was to discuss numerous issues of common interest with Kuwaiti officials. He described British-Kuwaiti relations as being excellent. Hogg is expected to hold a meeting tomorrow with Prime Minister Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdullah Al-Salim, the deputy speaker of the National Assembly and a number of local and foreign businessmen. The British minister will tomorrow afternoon visit Khawr Abdullah base where UNIKOM [United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission] forces are stationed, and will also inspect the border demarcation line approved by the UN Security Council's resolution 833. The British minister will hold a news conference tomorrow afternoon. The Kuwaiti defense minister said that the meeting he held with Mr. Hogg dealt with a number of issues, both bilateral and regional. Shaykh al-Hamud added that his meeting with the British official was the fourth of its kind in three years and hailed Britain's support for the Kuwaiti rights through the UN Security Council.
