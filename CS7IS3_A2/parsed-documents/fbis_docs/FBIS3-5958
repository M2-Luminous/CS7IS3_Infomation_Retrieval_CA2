Chairman Jesus Montane Oropesa in his speech said that last year the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries viciously schemed to stifle Korea and Cuba which are defending socialism, but the two parties, governments and peoples achieved great victories by firmly uniting to smash the enemy's moves at every step. The great leader comrade President Kim Il-song received the outgoing Cuban Ambassador to the DPRK Juan Jose Leon Vega, and gave him precious teachings and showed deep solicitude, he said, and pointed out: This is an expression of deep trust and love for the party, the government and the people of Cuba.
