This puts into practice the 21 April 1991 decision to reduce by 50 percent the $33 billion debts. [passage omitted] Speaking before representatives of industry at the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], Poland's Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak acknowledged the role that German banks have played in speeding up this agreement. Pawlak is convinced that the agreement could considerably reduce the financial risk involved in trading with Poland and allow an opening of normal credit lines for financing trade and investment projects. The Polish head of government was, however, less pleased with bilateral conditions for investment and market access. Pawlak said that there is not enough willingness in Germany to invest in Poland. The situation is especially serious in the construction industry. Poland's supplies in this field have declined from 2.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM500 million. Pawlak said he hopes that Polish companies will be given free access to German markets in the future. Although Poland had a DM1.5 billion deficit in trade with Germany last year, Pawlak is optimistic about the future, because the volume of trade has tripled to DM18 billion over the past four years. This has made Poland Germany's number one trading partner in Central and East Europe. As Poland's most important trading partner, Germany provides one-third of Poland's entire foreign trade volume. One of the reasons for Pawlak's optimistic view is the realization of new forms of institutional cooperation of entire border regions that "contribute to a deepening of cooperation in almost all fields." The newly established society for industrial promotion intends to support this development. It will be the task of this society to help establish contacts between partners in the fields of trade and investment, establish contacts with national and international banks, and provide advice. Business will also be promoted by the Warsaw-based Polish-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry that has now been "put into practice." Poland, which is associated with the European Union [EU], has formally applied for full EU membership. Pawlak was pleased with the political support that Bonn has promised to give Poland on its way into the European Union, and he pointed out that all the legal and structural reform measures that are currently being enforced are market-oriented. Parallel to the changes in the system, the Polish economy shows clear signs of recovery, with an inflation rate that is decreasing comparatively quickly. Thus, industrial production in the first quarter of 1994 increased by 10 percent over December 1993, while prices only went up by 5 percent.
