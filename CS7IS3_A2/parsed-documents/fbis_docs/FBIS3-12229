Shahin] [Text] Amman--Gloom, shock and anger hung over Amman Saturday as flags flew at half mast, many schoolchidren staged sporadic protest marches and a two-hour closure to mourn the victims of Friday's Hebron massacre. Jordanians of all backgrounds showed their outrage by taking to the streets in one of the most spontaneous public outbursts of anger since the Gulf war. In Irbid, al-Salt, al-Baq'ah and all over Amman, men, women and children took to the streets waving black and green as well as Palestinian flags, shouting Islamic slogans and calling for an end to "negotiations with the enemy." "No need to speak with those who murder us. Speak their language, the language of jihad," said a speaker at the al-Husayn Mosque during noon prayers Saturday. Speaking to a crowd of some 2,500 people gathered in the downtown square in front of the mosque after marching from different districts of Amman, the speakers urged Muslims to "return to your faith and become defenders of the faith in Palestine as in Bosnia." "The trio that betrayed you," (Israel Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin, (U.S. President Bill) Clinton and (Palestine leader Yasir) 'Arafat must not be allowed to pave the way of our future," said one speaker from inside the mosque whose address was broadcast through loudspeakers. Police sealed off much of downtown and traffic came to a halt while the speakers addressed the crowd. A heavy police presence was visible all over the city. Embassies, foreign banks and many other international organisations, fearing emotional reprisal owing to their foreign affiliations, reported a security alert. The day passed without incident, however. Numerous Amman groceries, many of them owned by natives of Hebron, closed for the entire day to mark the first day after the killings. All shops downtown were closed and black flags flew from the shutters of many. The crowd at the al-Hashimiyah Square in downtown continued their march and converged at the Roman amphitheatre at around 1:30 p.m. and dispersed soon afterwards. The demonstrations were organised by the Islamic Action Front and a group of pan-Arab leftist parties. Schoolchidren who were let out of school at 12:00 p.m. began demonstrations in their local neighbourhoods. Students at the University of Jordan also staged a protest. Groups of 40 to 60 schoolchildren could be seen Saturday in various parts of al=Shumaysani, downtown, Jabal al-Taj and al-Jawfah, Garden Street and Bayadir Wadi al-Sir as well as the al-Baq'ah and al-Wahdat camps raising the Palestinian flag and shouting slogans to protest Friday's killings. A group of some 60 students with green arm bands shouting "there is no god but God," converged on the closed American embassy in 'Abdun ini the morning hours but were turned back by American embassy guards and police. It was the first reported group of protestors to converge on the embassy, built two years ago. The group left no statement and did not identify themselves, according to embassy staff. Jordanian papers ran eight column headlines of Friday's killing with explicit pictures of the victims. Akhir Khabar, a liberal Jordanian daily, ran one of the most stunning headlines --"shalom"-- acroos its frontpage along with a blown-up picture of a dead man with his mouth open and blood running out. The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Saturday vowed to step up the armed struggle against Israel and carry out revenge attacks for Friday's killings. "Yes to the revolution of the knives," Hamas spokesman Muhammad Nazzal told a press conference. The movement called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation to immediately withdraw from the negotiations with Israel. "We call on 'Arafat to withdraw and for the negotiators to withdraw immediately," said one head of Hamas in Jordan, Ibrahim Ghawshah. "The Palestinian people know who they are and where they are," he said of negotiators living in the West Bank and Amman. It is clear that the negotiation option is not the option of the Palestinian people but a people-less leadership in Tunis. "It is a shame that 'Arafat is planning to go to Washington with 30 people before the blood of the martyrs has even had the chance to dry. It shows his disrepect for the suffering of his people," Mr. Ghawshah added. "Rabin is responsible for security and occupation. So this is his domain," concluded Mr. Ghawshah. "But the blood of the Palestinian people will be avenged."
