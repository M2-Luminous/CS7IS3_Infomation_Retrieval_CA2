[Angioni] The comparison is not entirely unfounded. There are similarities and differences. The real difference is that Lebanon had become ungovernable owing to the large number of external "sponsors" that made negotiations impossible. So far, strife in the former Yugoslavia has been restricted to the communities present in the territory concerned; it is important that mediation should continue and that it should remain a matter for the parties directly involved. Sponsoring by third-party nations must be avoided, because if they were to become involved the war would spread and make the pursuit of a solution even more complicated. [Fontana] NATO orders the Serbs to stop, and they react with threats against Italy. [Angioni] Every war takes place at various levels: There is psychological warfare, determent, and political, economic, and then military pressure. No threat should be underestimated. That would be presumptuous. Attacks can be made with artillery, missiles, and aircraft. As far as we know, there are no artillery weapons with sufficient range to reach Italy, no missiles or rockets, as far as NATO is aware, and the Serbs have not been given missiles with a range exceeding the 200 kilometers that separate the Italian coast from Serb territory. [Fontana] What would be the risk to the population in the event of a NATO strike on the Serb positions? [Angioni] NATO has already cleared the potential forms of intervention with the United Nations. Two forms of action are technically possible: One is to provide direct air support for the UN troops if they come under heavy fire. The procedure would be for the commander of the UN troops in Bosnia to apply to the permanent representative of the UN Secretary General, who would then ask the commander of the allied forces for southern Europe, who is empowered to order strikes on identified targets making direct offensives against the blue helmets, to intervene. The second form of intervention would consist of destroying weapon systems attacking the civilian population or the blue helmets. This scenario also contemplates strikes against the artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and this could happen when the ultimatum expires. [Fontana] And will the population be exposed to risk? [Angioni] NATO has taken account of the real aspects and those that serve as propaganda; it is aware that artillery is unlikely to be found in completely unpopulated areas. NATO has the "physical representation" of the lie of the land at its disposal, and there are photographs, etc. It must be borne in mind that these are mobile targets, and that our information must be updated constantly. The artillery posts can be moved in less than 24 hours. Our updates must be increasingly accurate as the ultimatum approaches zero hour. NATO will not strike if the risk is too great, but the possibility that the artillery may be positioned in or near residential areas gives rise to great concern. The pilot's orders and skill must reduce the risk to the absolute minimum. [Fontana] The raid could trigger the entry of other powers into the war, Russia in particular. [Angioni] Scenarios change rapidly. The UN resolution was passed by the Security Council, on which Russia has a seat as well, but Russia is against the eventuality of more substantial strikes. Moreover, it is impossible to ignore the reaction of public opinion, and the "automatic" involvement of certain nations must not be forgotten. [Fontana] Do you believe in the theory of "surgical bombing"? [Angioni] Those who believe in it on the basis of the Gulf war make two mistakes. Firstly, it is misleading to think that the same situation is repeating itself, and secondly, it is wrong to think that air strikes alone can put the situation right. [Fontana] There is talk of 500 guns surrounding Sarajevo. [Angioni] Some information is secret, but 500 guns may seem a lot. What matters is the "quality" of these guns. This category is often taken to include weapons that are not guns but mortars or howitzers. The most dangerous guns in the Serbs' possession are Russian-made, the "130's," which have a range of about 30 kilometers. All the others have a shorter range, and cannot strike from a distance greater than 10 kilometers. [Fontana] Second scenario: massive intervention by a peacekeeping force. How many troops would be needed? [Angioni] A peacekeeping army can only act in a context of support for peacekeeping operations, and if a settlement has already been reached, otherwise it becomes a euphemism for making war. In this case, too, the precedent provided by the Gulf war is misleading, because the distribution of three armies across the whole of Bosnia means that we cannot advance like a steamroller. The parties at war must reach a settlement whereby they can be separated and some form of justice can be restored. We must not allow emotion to interfere with a political and military solution, which must be approached with detachment and clear-sightedness. Unless the parties at war reach a settlement, the UN and NATO operation could well achieve nothing. Indeed, we must stand up and say that if blame is to be apportioned in Yugoslavia, it should not be laid at the door of those who will not or cannot intervene, but primarily of those who refuse to reach a settlement. [Fontana] So you regard intervention by ground troops to impose peace as unlikely? [Angioni] Highly unlikely, practically out of the question if you consider the numbers involved: 100,000 Serbs in Bosnia, 50,000 Croatians, all armed and determined to pursue their goals, 50,000 Muslims. Confronting and overcoming such massive forces would require a military organization large enough not to risk defeat or, what would be worse, prolonging the war. The numerical ratio in the field must be one to three, or probably five or more. If the forces to be confronted number 200,000, how many armies would it take? [Fontana] There would be a large number of casualties. What if the factions reach agreement? [Angioni] The issue is a political one. What would be the purpose of intervening? To establish the cantons contemplated in the latest peace plan? And for how long? These are questions requiring answers in political terms. Once it has these answers, the military organization can intervene to "keep down" the violence. But if this process does not begin, asking for a military presence, as an end in itself, in the hope of reducing the risk to human lives is completely unrealistic. The risks would increase, we would be providing more "hostages." [Fontana] So you place greater faith in the arms of diplomacy than in the arms of warfare? [Angioni] Yes, definitely. My experience has led me to believe that peace cannot be imposed at gunpoint. It would be a peace imposed with proclamations and notices posted on walls. Peace is a conquest made day after day, and it belongs to those who will benefit from it, the "consumers." Armies are not in a position to impose peace; they are there to help implement political decisions, and they need technical objectives to achieve in a strictly defined timeframe pursuant to political objectives. If the expiry of the ultimatum is followed by intervention, it will merely be the consequence of that political decision. If they do not withdraw the artillery, there must be intervention. Nothing is happening for the time being because the ultimatum, too, is a deterrent, and this is where the political decision is so finely balanced: Should we lose political face and credit by not intervening if the ultimatum is not complied with, or intervene on a limited, selective scale to show that we mean what we say? It is a psychological balancing act.
