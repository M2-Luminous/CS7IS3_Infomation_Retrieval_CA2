In an interview with AL-AHRAM's Saturday edition, he said an invitation will also be sent to the National Dialogue Committee to meet in Aden after the 'Id al-Fitr holiday to continue the dialogue, which stopped after a number of its participants withdrew because of escalating squabbles, the mass media's stand, and military clashes between the armed forces of the General People's Congress in Sanaa and the Socialist Party's forces in the border governorates in Abyan, Abb, (Ta'izz), and Lahij. He expressed hopes that the crisis will be resolved and noted the need for all the parties to cooperate to achieve this end. Al-'Attas emphasized that terrorism has serious effects on Yemen and on the Arab countries to which this terrorism is exported. He said he does not approve of any terrorist act directed from his country at fraternal Egypt or other Arab countries.
