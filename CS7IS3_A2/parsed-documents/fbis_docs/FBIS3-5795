Indonesia agreed to take measures to release Timorese political prisoners soon and to allow special rapporteurs access to East Timor. We have Ramos Horta [resistance representative abroad] live from Geneva. [Unidentified correspondent] Are you satisfied with the agreed declaration? [Horta] I am very pleased, obviously, although, as in all situations, an agreed declaration means concessions from both sides. The declaration does not condemn Indonesia for human rights violations in East Timor, but on the other hand, at the moment, it forces it to invite a special rapporteur -- responsible for investigating summary executions -- to visit Timor in June. It is also hoped that the rapporteur investigating torture and the working group for disappearances will visit before the end of the year. [Correspondent] Does this declaration open the door for the release of political prisoners, as Indonesia has signed? [Horta] I think so, I think so. [Correspondent] Including Xanana [jailed Timorese resistance leader]? [Horta] Yes, I believe so. It includes Xanana and other prisoners. I think that Indonesia will have to bring to the Geneva negotiations in May some concrete confidence-building measures. Indonesia will not be able to turn up empty-handed again, as it did in New York and Rome. Yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the UN secretary general's representative, who is mentioned in the resolution, and I said that now the secretary general also has the moral obligation of pressuring Indonesia into coming to the May negotiations with some concrete steps. [Correspondent] Can I assume that you are optimistic that Xanana Gusmao will be released soon? [Horta] Well, I am not optimistic or pessimistic. I hope that Xanana Gusmao and others will be released, because it is also in Indonesia's interest. There is a lot of pressure in Indonesia on Suharto not to give in regarding Xanana Gusmao's release, but Indonesia's international interests, its image abroad would improve a great deal if President Suharto were to make such a gesture.
