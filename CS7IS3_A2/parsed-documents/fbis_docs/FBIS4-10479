The meeting raised expectations due to the recent crisis between the government and the Carabineros forces, but the purpose of the visit was for Pinochet to thank the chief of state for his concern for his wife [Lucia Iriarte de Pinochet], who underwent surgery last week, according to an official communique. The communique states that on the occasion they "also raised institutional Army subjects." Pinochet apparently arrived at La Moneda through underground entrances to avoid meeting with the media. Last week Frei faced his first government crisis when Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange ignored Frei's request for him to resign, after a court ruling charged him with not fulfilling his duties and with having obstructed the court's actions in the case of the murder of three communist leaders in 1985. [passage omitted] Some analysts considered Pinochet's position of not intervening in the conflict and his statement that the possible resignation of Gen. Stange "was a problem that concerned him alone," were decisive in convincing Stange to accept leaving the post.
