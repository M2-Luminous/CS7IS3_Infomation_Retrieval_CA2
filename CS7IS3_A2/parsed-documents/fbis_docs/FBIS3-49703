The natural gas supply from the Russian Federation to the Balkan countries, i.e. Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey runs through separate pipelines. The pipelines for Turkey and Bulgaria are connected to the pumping station at Orlovska, on Ukraine's territory. There is no outlet or other possibility to draw gas from these pipelines all along their length that traverses Romania. "The pipeline that supplies Romania has the junction in Ukraine, upstream the Orlovska compressing station, i.e. on that station's intake. "Besides, a representative of Gazprom -- the Russian natural gas exporter -- is permanently monitoring the gas amounts supplied to the three countries at the Isaccea station where the pipelines enter Romania's territory."
