RKW (Board for the Economy's Rationalization), headquartered in Frankfurt, has opened an office in Hungary. Its purpose will be to subsidize consulting for businesses that are about to be formed, are in the process of being formed, or have been newly formed. In Bavaria, the purpose of RKW is to assist new, medium-sized businesses. There this activity is based on traditions of 40 years standing. As the managing director of RKW said at his news conference yesterday, 90 percent of the businessmen in Bavaria are satisfied with this service. However, German assistance can be effective only if it is based on local experience. Therefore RKW has concluded a cooperation agreement with IPOSZ (National Federation of Trade Associations), an umbrella organization whose associations have a combined total of 709,000 businessmen members. When signing the agreement for the Hungarian side, IPOSZ Chairman Gyorgy Szucs noted that the agreement was another successful step toward the realization of the four-year-old program that had set as its objective the development of a system of consultancy services to ease the first steps of small businesses, thereby making the about-to-be-formed or newly formed businesses competitive and thus contributing to their long-term survival. German financing for the program will be arranged through the Ausgleichsbank. RKW is maintaining its Hungarian office in the IPOSZ building on Imre Kalman Street. We learned from office manager Andrea Glodi that a staff of 40 to 80 consultants will be in place by the end of May or early June. The consultants are being selected on the basis of personal interviews conducted by RKW experts. RKW will provide further training for the successful candidates. The first businesspeople will be able to call at the office foreseeably by the middle of June. The subsidies will be administered directly through the banks participating in the Start loan program. Persons considering a business career may seek consulting before the final decision to start a business; persons establishing a business, before and during its establishment; and the owners of start-up businesses, during the first three years of operation. They may seek advice about their business plans, their foreseeable market and competitive situation; about the availability of financing and the selection of location; as well as about questions arising in conjunction with the elaboration of their business strategy, operational plans, or marketing plans. A business may avail itself of at most six subsidized personnel-days of consulting time, with RKW footing half the consulting fee. RKW will maintain its office in Hungary foreseeably for 18 months. The signatories of the cooperation agreement are confident that the consulting system will be able to stand on its own feet by that time, and to function without foreign subsidies. This hope is being nourished also by the agreement that IPOSZ signed today with Ernst & Young. The gist of the agreement is that henceforth this well-established accounting and consulting firm will accept also small businesses as its clients. As Arpad Tertak, the firm's general manager, put it, the firm will place at the disposal of business representatives and members of the trade associations belonging to IPOSZ the business experience and knowledge it has accumulated over several decades. Through IPOSZ, the firm will assist clients with consultancy services, including the preparation of loan applications. It will also undertake to find foreign sources of financing and professional and institutional investors as potential partners.
