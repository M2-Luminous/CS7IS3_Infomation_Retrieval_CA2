The Church also warned that the current presidential system "sometimes leads" to an uncontrollable growth of the powers of the head of state in a nine-page document issued by the Synod of Bishops on the government's plan to reform the nation's Constitution. The religious leaders said that "other branches of government should be strengthened to obtain a balance and a real division of powers in the state." "It is not our intention to propose a reform draft; our objective was to point out issues that cannot be absent in the new Constitution," they explained. The Church confirmed that it had doubts about the way in which President Carlos Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul Alfonsin had agreed on a reform plan through the Olivos Pact. The bishops group also accepted the dropping of the Constitution's current requirement that the president be a Roman Catholic. However, it underlined that "the cultural identity of the Argentine nation has unquestionable Roman Catholic roots." The document specifies that the definition of God included in the Constitution as the "source of all reason and justice" should be maintained in the new charter. In addition, the Church said that the new law of the land should include an article similar to the one included in the Cordoba Constitution stating that "the dignity and moral and physical integrity of human life from its conception cannot be violated."
