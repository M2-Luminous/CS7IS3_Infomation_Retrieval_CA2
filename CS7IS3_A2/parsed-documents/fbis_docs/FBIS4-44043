Russia has been buying Turkmenistan's natural gas at a very low price and selling it to Turkey and Europe for three times as much as it pays for it. Obviously, it neither wants to lose that resource nor to allow Turkmenistan to become wealthy and rid itself from Moscow's influence. It is reported that allowing Russia to become a member of the pipeline consortium--which has been established by Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey--was powerless to obstruct Moscow's influence. Although Turkey is a member of that consortium, BOTAS [Pipelines and Petroleum Transportation Corporation] does not have any say in it. Meanwhile, planning work cannot be carried out because of Russia's bureaucratic obstructions. No concrete project has been drawn up yet. Consequently, the funds that are required for the laying of the pipeline have not been acquired. Some $5 billion are required for the project. President Suleyman Demirel held talks with President Saparmurad Niyazov in Ankara yesterday. He informed him that it is of vital importance to supply Turkemenistan's natural gas to Turkey within two years at the latest. Demirel also asked Niyazov to use his influence to overcome Russia's obstructions.
