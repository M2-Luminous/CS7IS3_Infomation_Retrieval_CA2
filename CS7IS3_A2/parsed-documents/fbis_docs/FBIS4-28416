The article says: Strange, indeed, are the reports of mass media about the "nuclear suspicion" against North Korea. It is clear that they are intentionally fabricating information and misleading public opinion for a dramatic switchover in the military policy of Japan. They are spreading the rumor of "threat from North Korea" not only to promote the new U.S. strategy but to bring a turnabout in Japan' military policy and make people understand it. While hastening military collusion with the United States, Japan seeks to establish a political and military system facilitating the use of armed force overseas. This is why Japan is getting overheated in crying over "threat from North Korea" as she cried for "international contribution" at the time of the Gulf war.
