During the symposium, more than 200 Vietnamese and foreign participants discussed problems such as dioxin in human organism, soil composition, vegetal organism and its long-term effects on the environment. It was reported that US defoliants known as Agent Orange had caused long term, dangerous effects on the environment and millions of people in Vietnam. Over the past years, the country has done much to solve problems caused by the US toxic chemicals, providing initial medical care to the victims. Reforestation has been promoted nationwide particularly in areas destroyed by the US defoliants to restore the environment to normal conditions.
