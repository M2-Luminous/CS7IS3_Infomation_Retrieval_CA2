Comrade Li Changchun and Comrade Ma Zhongchen also discussed with them specific ways and means of deepening reform and fulfilling this year's economic tasks. The forum was presided over by provincial vice Governor Fan Qinchen and attended by Song Zhaosu, Zhang Honghua, Zhang Shiying, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, and some other provincial leaders. At the forum, city mayors and prefectural commissioners from Nanyang Prefecture, Zhumadian Prefecture, Xinyang Prefecture, Zhengzhou City, Luoyang City, Kaifeng City, and some other cities and prefectures spoke one after another and reported their work. They said that they were greatly encouraged by those new reform measures promulgated by the state in 1994 but felt greater pressure on their work at the same time. They pledged to turn such pressure into a motivating force and make a success of their work in 1994. At the forum, provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun emphatically called for clearly viewing the situation, bracing up, and developing the province's current good situation. He said: The year 1994 will be an extraordinary year in which we will be confronted with opportunities, challenges, hopes, and difficulties. Successfully carrying out work in 1994 will lay a solid foundation for us to attain the strategic goal of raising Henan's gross national product to a level higher than the country's average and lowering Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the country's average by the end of the 1990's as well as achieve a comparatively well-off standard of living at an earlier date. This year, we should unswervingly adhere to the guiding ideology of continually putting forth new ideas, grasping each and every excellent opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating development. We should also properly handle relations between reform, development, and stability, should regard development as the central task, reform as the motive force, and stability as the basis, and should firmly concentrate on these three aspects of work. Speaking of development, Li Changchun noted: At present, we are being confronted with the major contradiction of slow-paced development, this being incompatible with the country's overall development. In view of this situation, we should try to acquire a thorough understanding of a series of propositions made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, such as "development is the last word" [fazhan cai shi ying daoli 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810], among others. We should firmly aim at the above-mentioned strategic goal and strive to raise Henan's gross national product to a level higher than the country's average and lower Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the country's average on the basis of an optimized economic structure and increased economic efficiency. Li Changchun also called for implementing this strategic goal to the letter throughout the province by developing famous-brand products, focusing on key economic areas, making energetic efforts to obtain more state investment, overseas investment, and domestic investment, and accelerating Henan's overall development. Speaking of reform, Li Changchun pointed out: We should consider reform a powerful motive force behind economic growth. Henan's practice over the past few years has fully proven that, as long as local leaders follow a clear-cut train of thought in the course of reform, economic development is bound to accelerate in local areas. Reform is a shortcut which will enable us to narrow the economic gap between Henan and the rest of the country. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels in Henan should concentrate sufficient efforts on studying reform, should promote development by virtue of reform, should promote opening up by dint of development, and should blaze a new trail in the course of development. Speaking of stability, Li Changchun maintained: On one hand, we should not simply try to maintain stability for the sake of stability and should not refrain from speeding up reform; while, on the other, we should understand that, along with the gradual deepening of reform, we will surely come across new situations and new problems. Thus, we should first try to perfect a social security system by focusing on developing insurance businesses tailored to the needs of elderly and unemployed people at present, should provide proper assistance to staff and workers of closed or partially closed enterprises, should provide proper assistance to retired enterprise personnel, should tackle the problem of the payment of teachers' wages, and should enable the broad masses of the people to spend a happy Lunar New Year Festival.
