The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his position. Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the following: "As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction" in recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say, however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under. She pointed out that the "Belize Council," a new council comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose appointment will be announced next week, will make recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch "in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them." The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.
