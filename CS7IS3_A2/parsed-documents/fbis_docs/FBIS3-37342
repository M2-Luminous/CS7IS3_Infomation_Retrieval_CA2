In his words, Belarus' Council of Ministers has no grounds to think that the delay in the trip is connected with Chernomyrdin's unwillingness to sign documents on creation of a monetary union between two countries. "Russian and Belarusian premiers have firmly agreed to unite monetary systems," noted Dragovets. Referring to the opinion of the chairman of the Belarusian Council of Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Dragovets said that the final date of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Minsk would be coordinated after conclusion of the British Prime Minister John Major's visit to Moscow.
