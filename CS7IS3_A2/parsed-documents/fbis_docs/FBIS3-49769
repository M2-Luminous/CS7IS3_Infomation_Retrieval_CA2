They believe that the projected price increases will result in higher inflation and higher maintenance costs, as well as lower real incomes of employees. On 9 February, they will stage an all-national demonstration in Warsaw. According to the National Committee [KK], the increases in the prices of energy and other goods of the so-called basic consumer basket scheduled for this year will bring about an increase in maintenance costs and a drop in employees' real incomes. Another factor that will limit these incomes will be higher tax rates. "S" fears that the policy of the present government will make it impossible to carry out the fundamental provision of the "Pact on Enterprise," which pertains to an increase in real wages in the production sphere in a situation of a projected increase in the GDP. "I always knew that the present governing group does not meet our political expectations; the budget bill proved that it does not meet our social expectations, either," stated "S" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski. Most of the KK members support the idea of organizing protests. The differences were only over the timing and the form of the protests. The proposal to stage an all-national demonstration in Warsaw was backed, as one KK member put it, on such a scale as to "make all of the windowpanes in the Office of the Council of Ministers fall out." More than a dozen persons wanted to organize strikes; a few discussed the possibility of a general strike. According to observers, the union is not prepared for a major strike action. The appeals for strikes should be looked upon as a kind of stick. "S" authorities hope that the major price increases projected in the budget law will cause an increase in social impatience and spontaneous protests. Then the union will be able to try to organize a more serious strike action. The unionists were very surprised that the government would like to obtain credit from the World Bank for the Mass Privatization Program and for the National Investment Funds. "The bill on the privatization of state-run enterprises no longer has the provisions in line with which all citizens are able to purchase the shares of privatized companies, in a situation of the insufficiency of domestic capital and savings. Thus, finally, there will be no chance of including the citizens in the processes of privatization," stated KK Presidium member Jerzy Ostrouch. "S" has invited experts of the extraparliamentary center-right groupings to take part in the work of the team that is supposed to draft a constitution bill. The invitations will be extended by Chairman Krzaklewski. The team for the new constitution will set up a Senate Club of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "S." According to the KK, the refusal to admit the states to NATO affronts the aspirations of societies that for half a year strove to regain their identity.
