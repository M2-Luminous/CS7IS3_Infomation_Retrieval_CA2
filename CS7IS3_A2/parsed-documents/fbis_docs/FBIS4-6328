Eight North Koreans have asked to be brought here through the South Korean Embassy in Kazakhstan and five more at the Embassy in Uzbekistan, the officials said. "The government will seek cooperation with these countries as well as with Russia to resettle them here," said one official. "Negotiations are under way and we have asked for support from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees." Seoul announced last week that it would accept all camp escapees as long as they are not serious criminal offenders. The number of those in flight is estimated to be as high as 500.
