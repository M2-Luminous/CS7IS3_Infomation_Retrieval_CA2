FR940202-1-00013 FR940202-1-00005 Discussion The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that an operator of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes reported the failure of a main landing gear (MLG) wheel axle during push back of an in-service airplane from the terminal. Subsequent non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection of the operator's fleet of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes revealed that corrosion was present on most MLG wheel axles examined. Although no cracks were found during this inspection, preliminary findings indicate that the crack which led to the failed axle had initiated from a corrosion pit located on the radius of the brake abutment flange on the axle. Corrosion and cracking in a MLG wheel axle, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in failure of the MLG wheel axle. Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;079, Revision 1, dated October 4, 1993, that describes procedures for removal of the MLG wheels and brakes, inspections of the wheel axles, and reinstallation of MLG wheels and brakes. The Fokker service bulletin references Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin F100&hyph;32&hyph;63, Revision 2, dated September 23, 1993, as the appropriate source of service information for the wheel axle inspection. The Dowty Aerospace service bulletin describes procedures for a visual inspection to detect corrosion in the wheel axles of the MLG sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an NDT inspection to detect cracks in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;080, dated October 4, 1993, and Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin F100&hyph;32&hyph;64, dated September 23, 1993, describe procedures for accomplishing the corresponding repetitive actions described in the service bulletins discussed previously. The RLD classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive BLA 93&hyph;108/2 (A), dated November 1, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive visual inspections to detect corrosion in the wheel axles of the MLG sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an NDT inspection to detect cracks in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 100 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the recurring cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators (for four inspections per year) is estimated to be $308,000 per year, or $3,080 per airplane per year. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:
