We have now completed the review and determine the net subsidy to be zero for the 65 companies listed in the Appendix and 13.35 percent ad valorem for all other companies for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Dana Mermelstein, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 17, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 25612) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Mexico (46 FR 21357; April 10, 1981). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. The review involves 65 companies and eight programs. Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican leather wearing apparel. These products include leather coats and jackets for men, boys, women, girls, and infants, and other leather apparel products including leather vests, pants, and shorts. Also included are outer leather shells and parts and pieces of leather wearing apparel. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 4203.10.4030, 4203.10.4060, 4203.10.4085 and 4203.10.4095. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. Analysis of Comment Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), whose members produce leather wearing apparel. The ACTWU's comment supported the preliminary results of this review. Final Results of Review Since the comment received did not oppose any aspect of the preliminary results, we determine the net subsidy for these final results to be the same as in the preliminary results: zero for the 65 companies listed in the Appendix and 13.35 percent ad valorem for all other companies for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties as follows for subject merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1992, and on or before December 31, 1992: zero on shipments from any of the 65 companies listed in the Appendix; and 13.35 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all other companies. Further, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. As provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Customs Service will collect cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties on such shipments as follows: zero on shipments of this merchandise from the companies listed in the Appendix, and 13.35 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all other companies. These instructions shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22. Dated: August 13, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
