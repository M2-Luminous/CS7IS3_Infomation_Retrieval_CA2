FR940804-2-00139 FR940804-2-00079 [Release No. 34&hyph;34463; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Restrictions on Orders in Multiply Traded Options Entered by Specialists and Registered Options Traders for Execution on Other Exchanges July 29, 1994. On December 14, 1992, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act;''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change relating to restrictions on entering orders in multiply traded options. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on March 12, 1993. 3 One comment letter was received opposing the proposed rule change, 4 to which the Phlx responded. 5 This order approves the Exchange's proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31961 (March 8, 1993), 58 FR 13662 (March 12, 1993). 4 See Letter from Alger Chapman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, CBOE, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated April 13, 1993 (``CBOE Comment Letter''). 5 See Letter from Gerald O'Connell, Vice President, Market Regulation, Phlx, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated June 25, 1993 (``Phlx Response Letter''). Description of Proposal The Phlx proposes to adopt Advice B&hyph;12, which would extend the prohibitions contained in Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx Advice B&hyph;4, regarding off-floor opening orders for options traded on multiple exchanges. Currently, Commentary .14 to Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx Advice B&hyph;4 prohibit a Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') from placing an opening order for their market functions account from off-floor. The Phlx now seeks to restrict Phlx ROTs and specialists from sending orders which would establish or increase a position in registered options to other exchanges from off of the Phlx options trading floor. Before an opening order initiated from the Phlx equity options floor may be sent to another market for execution, it must first clear the crowd at the Phlx when the bid or offer of the order is on or between the Phlx disseminated market. 6 Pursuant to the proposal, ROTs and specialists would be required to place their off-floor opening positions in their customer accounts, regardless of whether the execution of such orders occurs on the Phlx or on another exchange. 7 The fine schedule for proposed Advice B&hyph;12 would run on a three year cycle, such that repeat violations within a three-year period would result in escalating fines. 8 6 Clearing the crowd on the Phlx would require that the order be loudly and audibly voiced in the crowd and, if not then executed, the order may be sent away. 7 Proposed Advice B&hyph;12 would only be applicable to transactions in equity option. 8 The fine schedule for Advice B&hyph;12 provides that a fine of $500 will be imposed for the first violation and a fine of $1,000 will be imposed for the second violation. The sanction for the third violation is discretionary with the Phlx Business Conduct Committee. In addition, under a rolling three-year cycle, if three years elapse between the first and second violation, the second violation would be treated as a first violation. If there is a violation within the three years after the most recent violation, the next highest fine will be issued. Thus, a third violation less than three years after a fine was issued for a second violation would be treated as a ``third violation,'' even though more than three years may have elapsed after the first violation.
