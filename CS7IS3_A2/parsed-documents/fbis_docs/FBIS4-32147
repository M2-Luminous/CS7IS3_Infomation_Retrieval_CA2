The communique issued after the conclusion of their meeting points out that considering that until now no direct answer has been received from Romania's president in connection with the request to present his stance in Parliament, the gathering of signatures of CDR parliamentary representatives is progressing to begin the procedure of suspending President Iliescu from his office. The communique also says that depending on the way debates on the education draft bill and the draft bill on the restitution of nationalized dwellings continue in Parliament, the CDR will decide whether it is opportune to commence a parliamentary strike. According to our correspondent Ioana Perdichi, during today's meeting they also agreed that a censure motion against the government should be introduced during the current parliament. They also sanctioned the draft of the censure motion text, which is to be submitted for discussion during the bilateral talks to be held with the Democratic Party [PD]. The parliamentary groups of the CDR and the PD held a met this afternoon and elaborated the joint action strategy of the opposition. They decided to continue to gather signatures for the procedure to suspend President Ion Iliescu from his office and agreed -- in case the president explicitly rejects the idea of giving explanations in Parliament -- to actually begin the aforementioned procedure. Regarding the censure motion, the leaders of the opposition parliamentary factions agreed that a censure motion should be introduced against the activity of the government, worked out the text of the motion, and agreed that the document is to be forwarded to the competent parliament bodies after the necessary number of signatures is gathered.
