The statement starts with the Koranic verse: "And they ill-treated them for no other reason than that they believed in God, exalted in power, worthy of all praise." SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes the text of the statement: O brave men of Hebron. O the lions of Gaza. O the heroes of Nabulus. O the guardians of al-Aqsa Mosque. O the knights of Ramallah and Bethlehem. O the enduring masses in all our towns, villages and camps. O the men, women, youth, and children. Declare it a fresh revolution against the occupation. Cry out Allah Akbar [God is great] and let these cries tear out the hearts of the criminal Zionist occupiers. Let the hearts of the malicious settlers tremble. Pursue the occupation soldiers and attack the gangs of settlers and slay them wherever you catch them for things have come to a head and all the deception has been uncovered. [passage omitted condemning Hebron massacre] Let the veil drop from the eyes of those who have illusions about peace with the enemy. Let the symbols of capitulation -- those of Madrid, Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, who are crouching in Tunis watching the wounds of our people and nation -- fall. [passage omitted] Be united and do not allow any traitor or people with weak spirits to join your ranks. Censure the capitulationists and defeatists, force them to abide by your hopes and aspirations, and block the road between them and the enemy. Let the demonstrations and mass rallies take to the streets. Engage with the soldiers and the herds of settlers. Let the heroes pursue the settlers and turn their settlements into jails and let them shed the blood of the rancorous Zionists in the streets of the settlements. We in Hamas call for the following: [passage omitted] On 11 March, the last Friday in Ramadan, we urge all our people to travel to holy Jerusalem to perform the Friday prayer at the al-Aqsa Mosque. We urge them to defy the occupation authorities and the siege and curfew, and to perform the prayer, even on the walls of the al-Aqsa Mosque if necessary. On 'Id al-Fitr day, we urge the people to perform the 'Id prayer outside mosques in open yards, in accordance with the Prophet's teachings. We also urge them to visit the families of the martyrs, wounded, and detainees and the patients, and to help the poor and the needy. On 14 March, we call for staging mass rallies, to be attended in particular by the families of the martyrs, wounded, and detainees. We also urge the demonstrations to proceed to the homes of the members of the negotiating team to urge them to withdraw completely from the negotiations and to join the resistance against occupation. Allahu Akbar. Victory to our mujahid people.
