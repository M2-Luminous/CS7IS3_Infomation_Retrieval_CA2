Lopez Moreno said conditions have forced authorities to reschedule Chiapas gubernatorial elections two months after the previously scheduled date. He warned, however, that there will not be another acting governor in the state because the people are against it. Juan Carlos Antollo was in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas this morning. He is now back in San Cristobal de las Casas, one hour from the Chiapas capital, and filed this report on what is happening in Chiapas. Good evening, Juan Carlos, how are you? [Antollo] Good evening. After traveling a road with 326 curves and three straight segments, we made it to San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. As you pointed out, it was said today that there will be no more acting governments in this state. It was decided that the gubernatorial elections, which some proposed be postponed until 1995, will be held this year in October. This will guarantee that the transition of state executives is made within the timeframes established by the Chiapas Constitution. Chiapas Government Secretary Pablo Salazar Mendicoechea made the aforementioned statements while disclosing a report that Governor Javier Lopez Moreno will send to the Chiapas Congress. Salazar Mendicoechea said the governor held a series of meetings throughout the state during which it was decided that this year's gubernatorial elections would be held in October instead of 1995. The document added: This decision was made because right now the state is facing difficult situations. If these situations are indeed taking place, however, the electoral process should go on as mandated by law. [Begin Moreno recording] For this particular occasion, we propose that the gubernatorial elections be held on Sunday, 16 October. The local deputy and mayoral elections will be held as scheduled in August 1995. No more acting governors will be appointed because most Chiapas residents are against that. There will be new electoral legislation that will allow equality in political campaigns, new prerogatives for parties, reliability in electoral organizations, and credibility in the results.
