It issued a circular to keep a tight rein on the country's fixed asset investments in 1994. While affirming the achievements made in economic construction last year, the circular warns against the tendency in investment over-expansion caused by extended building scales and sluggish restructuring. It points out that construction should focus on top-priority projects, while approval of new projects should be brought under strict control. In principle, no new projects will be approved this year, it adds. The People's Bank of China should keep a close watch on the overall loans for fixed asset investment and where they go, while no banks are allowed to offer loans for any new project that is not approved by the State Council and the State Planning Commission, it says. It also bans any extending of issues of bonds and securities and expansion of experimental scope of stock companies without authorization. While focusing on badly needed housing, a tight rein must also be kept on development of real estate and building of development zones, it says. It says that close attention should be paid to strengthen the guidance and standardized management of direct foreign-funded projects in order to encourage foreign investment in the domestic infrastructure facilities and basic industry. The circular concludes that the leadership of the macro-control over fixed asset investment should also be enhanced to ensure a sustained, fast and healthy economic development in 1994.
