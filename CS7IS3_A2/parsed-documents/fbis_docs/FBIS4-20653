This expert system serves as a support tool for use in dealing with these issues, and can quickly and easily prepare basic manufacturing data for work management, such as assembly work sheets and standard-time tables, in the production preparation stage before the start of manufacture. 1. Introduction Fujitsu is a data-processing and communications equipment manufacturer with a wide range of products--from integrated circuits and semi-conductor products to large computers and communications equipment. Over the last few years, Fujitsu's product line-up has been expanded to include items such as personal computers and workstations. This expansion reflects the trend toward downsizing in computers, and, as a result, has greatly changed the production environment. In addition, product life cycles are becoming shorter and design changes are occurring more frequently. This is because, until recently, the main users of computers have been companies, but the market is now shifting toward individuals, whose tastes are more likely to change. These factors are making demand forecasting more and more difficult. Furthermore, conventional methods are insufficient for managing factories successfully. 2. Issues of Assembly Factories Given the above situation, the most important issues facing assembly factories are the design and construction of the most suitable manufacturing line, total work management, and production stability from the start of mass production. Figure 1 shows the relationship between product life cycle and production. The dotted lines indicate the relationship curves of conventional products, and the solid lines indicate those of new personal products. For conventional products, the flow of the manufacturing line is checked for any problems after production has started and the standard time is estimated using industrial engineering (IE) techniques, such as the stopwatch method, after production stabilizes. A work is managed and upgraded based on the standard time to facilitate cost reduction. This procedure is inappropriate for new products, however, because even if the standard time is estimated the production model may change before proper management can be applied. In this state, the management accuracy gradually deteriorates, and, if no measures are taken, a work may eventually be left to operators at the factory and carried out without management. Fig. 1. Changes in production environment. To cope with the above problems, manufacturing standards for work management must be established in the production preparation stage before the start of manufacture. As shown in Fig. 2, the basic data consists of design criteria such as work and the standard time, and is used widely in product design, planning and estimation. Fig. 2. Uses of basic data. However, estimating the standard time brings about the problems shown in Fig. 3. Fujitsu has therefore developed a new expert tool for IE that tackles these problems. The new tool uses both conventional IE techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) so that work can be managed at the same level as for conventional products even in a complicated production environment. Fig. 3. Current problems in estimating the standard time This paper presents the new system in detail. 3. Aims in Development During our study of system implementation we set the following development goals to solve the above-mentioned problems: 1) Time The system enables production preparations to be made before the start of production. 2) Speed The system can quickly process data on new products and products whose design has changed. 3) Consistency The system enables any supervisor, manufacturing engineer, or designer to estimate and use standard time consistently. 4) Generality and adaptability The system can be used by divisions dealing with different products, and is adaptable to changing conditions. Details of the system are presented below. 4. System Outline 4.1 System Features As shown in the system outline in Fig. 4, the new system uses a Fujitsu FM-R personal computer, and automatically creates product assembly flowcharts and estimates the standard time based on the component data input from the engineering database. This system is called the standard-time estimating expert system, or STEIN. STEIN has the following features: 1) Can be linked with CAD 2) Adaptable, and allows manufacturing expertise to be stored in databases 3) Enables creation of the basic data 4) Has a wide range of applications and is easy to use. With the first feature, data entry by the operator is minimized through the use of component data created by CAD, such as part names and drawing numbers included in design information, and the equipment assembly sequence produced by the designer. In addition, parts data can be processed in the trial-manufacture stage, where the parts data is made complete, and design changes reflected quickly. Fig. 4. System outline. The second feature means that the expertise on manufacture possessed by manufacturing engineers and technicians is stored in the knowledge database in the form of rules and tables, so expertise can be added or updated easily and the system can be reorganized to meet user specifications. The third feature is a database containing data in a standardized format called "basic data," which has been established for use in a wide range of applications. The fourth feature comes from the system's modular structure, which minimizes the modification required for manipulating parts data and specifications peculiar to the user. Moreover, the system uses a mouse as an input device to prevent operation errors and to improve operability in processing jobs. 4.3 System Module Configuration Figure 5 shows the system module configuration. STEIN consists of the main module, which performs work analysis and standard-time estimation and six other modules. Fig. 5. System module configuration. Among the six modules, data conversion (STEIN _P_), data editing (STEIN _P_ and STEIN _g_), manufacturing base data conversion (STEIN _t_), and matching (STEIN _ch_) are the preprocessing modules of the system. If the format of the parts data prepared by the user differs from the basic data format when the system is installed, the format conversion section in STEIN _P_ can be modified so that the data can be input easily into the system. CAD might not be used by all the design departments of each user. For a department not using CAD, the system can be operated by creating an input file using a data-editing module (STEIN _P_ or STEIN _g_). If design changes are made frequently, using STEIN _ch_ enables a previous version of data for which conditions have already been established to be used in a new data which doesn't estimate standard times and work conditions, thus allowing the design changes to be reflected quickly. Figure 6 shows the system operating environment. Fig. 6. System operating environment. In addition to the FM-R mentioned earlier, at least 8 Mbytes of RAM, a hard drive with a minimum storage capacity of 40 Mbytes, a mouse, and a printer are required. The required software includes the MS-DOS[.sup]TM[/] operating system, the GCLISP language, and the expert system construction support tool ESHEEL/FM. If data is exchanged with a higher-level system, an emulator board and emulation software are also required. 4.3 Work Analysis and Standard-Time Estimation (STEIN _a_) Figure 7 shows the processing steps for routing and standard-time estimation. The knowledge databases required for routing and standard-time estimation are the database for work analysis (knowledge 1) and that for standard-time estimation (knowledge 2). Knowledge is discussed in detail in section 4.4. Fig. 7. Processing steps. First, component data is read. Then, the hierarchical structure of the equipment configuration is structured without alteration, and the results are converted into data grouped into frames. Figure 8 shows the data grouped into frames. Grouping data into frames enables the data to be connected by a semantic network, which facilitates the retrieval of necessary information and structure-related changes. Fig. 8. Data grouped into frames. For each component, knowledge 1 prepares information such as the component classification shown in Fig. 9 based on the component name and drawing number. Classifying components entails grouping them into aggregates for the determination of their characteristics and attributes. Components are put into groups, such as a group of components for fastening a certain component or a group of components to be mounted in the first or last work, so that the work to be done can be easily determined. Fig. 9. Component classifications. Consider the classification shown in Fig. 9 as an example. If the names of components contain the word "screw," all those components are classified as being screw components and fastening components. Then, routing is done according to the rules about the component-mounting order included in knowledge 1. As shown in Fig. 10, if the rules specify that the screw is the component to fasten the immediately preceding component, namely the metal fitting, and that a stick-on component called a label must be used in the last work, the mounting order is determined and work is done for each component. Once routing is completed, each work step is assigned a work item name based on the work item names defined in knowledge 2 and the rules provided in knowledge 1. <graphic> Fig. 10. Process determination and work item name In the example shown in Fig. 10, the work step that involves the component classified as being a metal-fitting component and the component classified as being a screw component is automatically assigned the work item name, metal-fitting mounting. Lastly, the standard time is estimated for each work item. In this step, the working conditions for estimating the standard time, such as the distance the components are moved, the weight of the components, and the tool used, are determined based on knowledge 1, and the time values are calculated from expressions defined in knowledge 2. If working conditions have not been determined according to the rules provided in knowledge 1, manual alteration is required. STEIN _a_ has an alteration function that enables error-free alterations to be made easily. Figure 11 shows the screen for editing the work, and Fig. 12 shows the screen for editing the working conditions. Most editing operations can be performed using the mouse. In the editing of work, work item names can be changed and added, and the order of work steps can be changed. The operator selects the appropriate function key command menu, then specifies the work item to be changed with the mouse. All operations are performed interactively as instructed by messages. In the editing of working conditions, the working conditions and set values registered in the time estimation table provided in the knowledge for standard-time calculation are displayed. If a set value differs from the corresponding actual value, the operator corrects the set value. Selection is performed by selecting choices at the bottom of the screen with the mouse. Operations are very simple, and can be mastered quickly. The assembly flowchart, shown in Fig. 13, is explained below. Fig. 11. Screen for editing work. Fig. 12. Screen for editing working conditions. Fig. 13. Printed output. Print processing outputs component assembly flowcharts showing component names, drawing numbers, quantities, work items, and the standard time. If notes or memorandums on a component or work step are entered on the screen shown in Fig. 11, the entered information is also printed in the flowchart. A version management list showing the version numbers of data and knowledge databases in the system is also printed out. This list enables engineers to manage processing results version by version. 4.4 Knowledge Editing (STEIN _O_) Knowledge maintenance is important for the operation of expert systems. It is inadvisable to edit knowledge frequently after system operation has started. Therefore, knowledge must be fully extracted and incorporated into the system before system operation is started. Even if sufficient knowledge is extracted and incorporated in advance, however, the system cannot remain complete forever. Changes in knowledge often occur in the early stages of system operation, and still occur after operation has stabilized. For this reason, it is more efficient to improve the quality of knowledge while the system is being used. In this case, knowledge is changed after the user starts operation, so the user must be able to edit knowledge without modifying the system during operation. The STEIN _O_ module is provided so that knowledge can be edited easily through an improved human-machine interface (HMI). This module has the following features: 1) Experts can edit their expertise into easily understandable information because all knowledge is expressed in Japanese sentences, and no expertise on artificial intelligence is required for editing. 2) Changes in knowledge are reflected in the system immediately. 3) The module has a print function that can print knowledge in a form that enables the printed output to be filed immediately and a function that automatically checks knowledge. These functions facilitate the checking of knowledge and ensure correct editing of rules. Details of knowledge editing are explained below. 4.4.1 Knowledge for Work Analysis Knowledge is organized in the hierarchical structure shown in Fig. 14, and classified and arranged in four categories: knowledge for component information specification, knowledge for process information specification, knowledge for work item specification and knowledge for working condition specification. Each type of knowledge is defined in the IF ... THEN[.sup]1)[/] format in Japanese. 1) Knowledge for component information specification. This type of knowledge is used to classify components, change component names, or specify information about components such as component size. Examples of this type of knowledge are "if the name of a component contains the word connector, then the classification of that component is connector," and "if the component classification is screw, then read the screw length from the drawing and set the read data." 2) Knowledge for process information specification If a screw is tightened on a unit during assembly work, that unit and screw are used in a single work step. Knowledge for assembly sequence editing is used to identify work steps and group components for each step. An example of this kind of knowledge is "if the classification of the component is screw and the classification of the preceding component is unit, then these components are used in the same work step." 3) Knowledge for work item specification This type of knowledge is used to specify necessary work items based on the information about components grouped on a step basis. An example of this type of knowledge is "the work item of a work step involving a connector and screws is connector mounting, and a connector connection work is added." With this type of knowledge, as many work items as required can be specified for each work step. Notes on work can also be specified; for instance, "The work item of a work step involving only connectors is connector connection. The memorandum on the work is `connect the connector in correct direction'." 4) Knowledge for working condition specification When the standard time is estimated using a time estimation table, working conditions are defined as work state variables. This type of knowledge is used to adjust working conditions to reflect the actual state. Examples of this type of knowledge are "the working condition `number of screws' is the value of the `quantity' of a component of which component classification is screw" and "if the component classification is power unit, the working condition `component weight' is `considerably heavy'." Basic information required for specifying working conditions can be copied automatically from any place in the work information area. 4.4.2 Knowledge for Standard-Time Calculation To calculate the standard time for each activity shown in an assembly flowchart, the time estimation table is required. Work is defined as a combination of several work elements. Work elements[.sup]2)[/] are the basic unit of work; they cannot be further subdivided. Defining work as a combination of work elements simplifies and ensures the maintenance and management of work items. Because work elements are used commonly in various types of work, working conditions are defined so that a certain degree of generality is kept, and work elements are defined by expressions having the defined working conditions as variables. A working condition is defined as a pair: a choice and its corresponding time value. Fig. 15. Organization of standard-time calculation As shown in Fig. 15, knowledge for standard-time calculation is organized in a three-level structure: work item, work element, and working condition. For example, the work called mounting consists of three work elements: component pickup, component setting, and screw tightening. Each work element is further defined using working conditions such as component pickup area and component weight. In the example of mounting work shown in Fig. 16, the standard time is calculated as described below. Fig. 16. Example of mounting. First, working conditions are specified for each work element. Examples are shown below. Component pickup area = component shelf (1), Component weight = less than 1 kg (0), Unpacking = none (0), Number of insertions = 1 (1), Concurrent work = none (0), The number in parentheses is the value corresponding to the choice selected as the working condition. The time value for each work element is as follows: Component pickup = 0.004 X component pickup area X component pickup area + 0.004 X component weight + 0.0555 X unpacking + 0.016 = 0.02. Component setting = 0.01 X number of insertions + 0.01 X concurrent work + ... = 0.08, Screw tightening = ... = 0.344. The standard time value for the mounting work is then calculated from the following expression: (Component pickup + component setting + screw tightening) X number of components = 0.888 (minute) This hierarchical structure simplifies work specification and enables the time estimation table to be edited easily. 4.4.3 Operating Procedure This subsection describes how to edit knowledge. Figure 17 shows the screen for editing work item information. Every operation can be performed using the mouse. If the user specifies the data to be changed with the mouse, the necessary choices are displayed in the selection field at the bottom of the screen. The user then selects a choice with the mouse. If input from the keyboard is required, this request is displayed in the selection area at the bottom of the screen. Fig. 17. Screen for editing work item Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time Figure 18 shows the screen for editing knowledge for standard-time calculation. The system always grasps the linkage relationship between work items, work elements, and working conditions. Therefore, the user does not have to remember that relationship and merely needs to make required changes. The system has a function for printing knowledge for work analysis and standard-time calculation in an easily readable layout on A4-size paper. These functions ensure correct editing. Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time The program for editing the time estimation table can be activated as a separate system. If the editing program is installed in a laptop computer, the user can edit the time estimation table while measuring work at the factory and can input editing results immediately to STEIN _a_ for execution. Thus, people who know nothing about programs can edit knowledge. 5. Improved Efficiency Using STEIN[.sup]3)[/] greatly improves the efficiency of process design and standard-time estimation. Figure 19 shows a comparison of the processing time required when a manufacturing engineer did routing and estimated the standard time in the conventional way (that is, based on actual measurements and drawings), and when he used STEIN. A total processing time of one year has been estimated for both cases based on the time required for routing, the standard-time estimation for a new model and the time required because of design changes, and the estimated total processing time for both cases has been compared. If the time required for processing in the conventional way is expressed as 100 percent, the time required to perform processing with STEIN is 20 percent, or only one-fifth. The new system can not only improve the working efficiency, but can also immediately update already estimated standard times whenever necessary and improve the accuracy of time values. Fig. 19. Improvement in working efficiency. 6. Conclusion With the new system, STEIN, we were able to quickly prepare basic data necessary for managing an equipment assembly factory, and achieved our original goals. We have also developed another application based on STEIN, which is capable of determining the most suitable work sequence for a factory line. This application is now ready for use. Future work includes the development of a system that uses the technology applied to distributed processing performed in a network, uses shared basic information more effectively, and is linked with a planning system such as a scheduling system or a component delivery planning system. In the manufacturing sector, the use of computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) is becoming increasingly widespread. Some of the problems inherent in this technology have been solved, but many problems including unsuccessful transfer of expertise on manufacturing, still remain. Even when a factory is built with CIM, the factory cannot be expected to expand production without further human effort. The goal is to create a production system that can be supported and operated by experts posted at important points. We firmly believe that STEIN can support CIM and further develop into a vital tool for assisting these experts.
