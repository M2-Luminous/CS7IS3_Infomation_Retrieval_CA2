FR940523-2-00017 FR940523-2-00007 Comment 5 Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) state that because they were cooperative respondents in this review, they should not be ``assigned'' the high best information available (BIA) margin from the 1989 review. DOC Position: These resellers have not ``been assigned'' a margin as individual firms. Resellers have no inherent right to a separately calculated rate, regardless of how cooperative they may be. For the reasons stated above, the circumstances in which the transactions occurred during this period do not allow the Department to calculate separate rates for these sales. Thus, we have not assigned individual rates to the resellers, and all sales for this review period will be assessed a duty based on the margin of the procedures. Comment 6 Alternatively, Yue-Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) argue that the methodology used to determine the dumping margin in the 1989 review was flawed, and that therefore the margin determined in that review should not be applied as BIA for the PRC manufacturers in this review. They also claim that in selecting a BIA margin, the Department must consider the most recent information available, and that any data on which BIA is based is rebuttable. In contesting the use of the 1989 figure, these resellers claim that the use of Thailand as a surrogate and the use of petitioner's own cost data were inappropriate in the 1989 review, and that costs were improperly calculated in that review. DOC Position: In selecting a BIA margin for the PRC potassium permanganate industry, we followed our usual practice of assigning an uncooperative respondent the higher of the highest margin determined for any firm in any previous review, or the original investigation, or the highest rate for a responding company in the current review. See 56 FR 393. The Department's two-tier BIA methodology was upheld by the Court of Appeals in Allied Signal Aerospace Co., et al. v. United States , 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In this case, we used the highest margin from the immediately preceding review, the 1989 review. The CIT has specifically affirmed, in Novachem, Inc. v. United States, Slip Op. 92&hyph;149 (CIT, August 28, 1992), that the Department acted reasonably in utilizing Thai factor data and petitioner's data in determining that rate. Even if the use of Thailand as a surrogate had not already been upheld by the CIT, however, the use of a margin from an earlier review does not permit a rearguing of the merits of a rate in a previous review for which the Department has issued final results of review. The appropriate time for challenging the merits of the 1989 review has passed. Thus, criticism of our use of the 1989 BIA margin is unfounded. Comment 7 Zunyi and the importer Novachem state that Zunyi was responsive in this review, and that the Department should therefore not apply to it the same BIA rate that it applied to non-responsive PRC firms. The petitioner states that the Department properly applied the highest rate from the 1989 review as BIA for the PRC firms, noting that this determination was proper due to the presumption of state control in a non-market economy and the fact that there was no clear showing in this review that any of the PRC manufacturers of subject merchandise are independent from the state legally, financially, or economically. DOC Response: We agree with the petitioner. For the reasons discussed in response to Comment 2, Zunyi failed to show that it was sufficiently independent to merit a separate rate for this review. Indeed, the record contains sufficient information to determine that separate status would be inappropriate. Thus, Zunyi must be considered part of the country-wide potassium permanganate industry for the purposes of this review. Since the government of the PRC and the industry as a whole did not adequately respond to our questionnaires (most firms did not respond at all), we have followed our usual practice in assigning, as BIA for uncooperative respondents, a country-wide margin (see our response to Comment 6). When a country-wide margin is assigned, the degree of cooperativeness assessed must be that of the industry as a whole. To assign a country-wide margin based on the response of a single firm could mask dumping by other non-responsive firms within the industry. Therefore, it is not appropriate to evaluate the extent of Zunyi's cooperation. Final Results of Review Upon review of comments submitted, the Department has determined that the margin for all PRC manufacturers/producers/exporters of potassium permanganate for the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990, is 128.94 percent. The margin for all third country exporters of potassium permanganate from the PRC for the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990 shall also be 128.94 percent, the rate of their suppliers. The Customs Service shall assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning all respondents directly to the U.S. Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the PRC country-wide firms will be 128.94 percent, and (2) because no non-PRC exporter has established on the record, for this administrative review, that it qualifies as an intermediate country reseller under the terms of the statute, the cash deposit rate for all non-PRC exporters will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise. Specifically, that rate will be the PRC country-wide rate of 128.94 percent we have established in this administrative review.
