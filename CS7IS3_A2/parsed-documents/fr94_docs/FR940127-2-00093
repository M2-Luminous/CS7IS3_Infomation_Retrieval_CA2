Relating to Stock Upside Note Securities (``SUNS'') January 19, 1994. I. Introduction On November 18, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and trade Stock Upside Note Securities (``SUNS''), 3 the return on which is based on the Lehman Brothers Global Emerging Telecommunications Basket (``Telecommunications Basket''). 4 Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on December 6, 1993. 5 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On January 6, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 6 This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 ``SUNS,'' ``Stock Upside Note Securities,'' and ``Global Emerging Telecommunications Basket'' are registered service marks of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (``Lehman Brothers''). 4 The Telecommunications Basket is a static portfolio consisting of 24 equity securities listed as: (1) Common shares outside of the United States in the countries having the greatest exchange trading volume for the shares; (2) common shares in the United States; or (3) as American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') in the United States. An ADR is a negotiable receipt which is issued by a depositary, generally a bank, representing shares of a foreign issuer that have been deposited and are held, on behalf of holders of the ADRs, at a custodian bank in the foreign issuer's home country. The securities which comprise the Telecommunications Basket are securities issued by corporations formed under Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33255 (November 18, 1993), 58 FR 64347 (December 6, 1993). 6 Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change states that: (i) if the entity that is used to calculate the value of the Telecommunications Basket is required to use the bid and offer price for a portfolio security to determine the market price of such portfolio security, then that entity shall not use any bid or offer price announced by Lehman Brothers or any affiliate of Lehman Brothers; and (ii) Lehman Brothers will monitor the volatility of the Telecommunications Basket securities and will discuss with the Commission the need to increase the frequency of portfolio value dissemination if the volatility of the Telecommunications Basket increases materially. See Letter from John Riley, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 6, 1994 (``January 6 Letter''). II.
