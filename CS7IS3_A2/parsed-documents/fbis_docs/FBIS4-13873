FBIS4-13873 "drnes079cc_94004" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Islamic Affairs Writers Claim Al-Azhar Statement Supports Terrorism Writers Claim Al-Azhar Statement Supports Terrorism NC2304161994 NC2304161994 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 18 April publishes on pages 18-20 a 3,000-word article by columnist 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah responding to the statement issued by the Islamic Research Council, headed by al-Azhar's grand imam, which denounces secularist writers for casting doubts on al-Azhar's authority regarding Islamic affairs. Al-Tawilah, who says he learned of the statement with "both astonishment and shock," argues that it "explicitly announces support for extremism and the extremists." He says al-Azhar, by this statement, "has changed its negative stance to one positively favoring the enemies of the nation." Explaining this, the writer notes that the al-Azhar statement, in its attack against secular intellectuals, says that they fight extremism with even more misleading and harmful extremism. This, he says, gives the terrorists an excuse to fight this more misleading and harmful extremism. Elaborating on this, al-Tawilah states: "All supporters of extremism and terrorism justify terrorist criminal acts by saying that this or that writer said something against religion, hurting the sensitive feelings of those extremist boys and angering those who harbor them in the dark. So they decided to demolish banks, kill scores of men, women, and children, and harm thousands of families." He adds: "The al-Azhar council is using the same justification, giving the terrorists the green light for further terrorism." Al-Tawilah maintains that Egyptian intellectuals from both the left and right have always respected al-Azhar and highlighted its role in defending Islam and preserving the Islamic heritage. He gives examples of many Egyptian leftist writers and thinkers who highlighted the good image of Islam and served religion in their literature. The problem, he says, is that the intellectuals reject the right of religious authorities to decide what can be published and what cannot. "The difference lies in the fact that we do not want al-Azhar or other religious institutions to impose an executive control over our intellectual activity and mental interpretations," he says. He adds: "That is, we object to al-Azhar making decisions, but accept its making recommendations, giving opinions, and writing reports." Concluding, al-Tawilah says: "The attempt to provoke a battle between al-Azhar and the Egyptian intellectuals serves only the enemies of Islam, foremost of whom are the extremist terrorists." In an 1,800-word article on pages 20-21 of the 18 April issue of Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF, writer Ibrahim 'Isa also accuses al-Azhar of supporting terrorism with its statement. The writer begins: "What did al-Azhar leave to the extremists? Once you differ with the extremists and oppose them you immediately, in a blink of an eye, become hostile to Islam, an apostate, an atheist, an infidel, or a rebel against religion; and this is true if you are against anything that leads, for example, to the shedding of your blood, and to them killing you physically and morally!" The writer wonders: "If al-Azhar's 11 April statement was not terrorism, what then is terrorism?" The writer says that it was the people, not God, that established al-Azhar and legislated the laws that gave it its important role. Al-Azhar, therefore, is not above criticism. "There are no religious institutions in Islam and there is nothing like a `grand imam.' We, the people, invented the title and put it in our civil law. And we can remove it whenever we want; it is not inspired or imposed by God." 'Isa then challenges al-Azhar to issue a statement explaining what it has done to fight extremism, which has continued to grow over the past 25 years. He notes that al-Azhar has never mentioned extremist material such as 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's books or the audio cassettes containing destructive religious ideas and preaching. Insinuating that al-Azhar has suspicious links with Saudi Arabia and its religious establishment, the writer also wants al-Azhar to issue a statement "explaining in detail its position on the Wahhabi thought" [a fundamentalist sect dominant in Saudi Arabia] and another "on the Arab oil projects that have been established in al- Azhar over the past few years, though I hope sincerely that such projects do not exist."
