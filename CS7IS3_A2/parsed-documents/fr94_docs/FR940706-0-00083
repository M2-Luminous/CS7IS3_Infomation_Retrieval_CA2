(4) The need for additional Federal funding. (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Secretary. (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Secretary, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21_Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education, OMB Circular A&hyph;122_Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations, or 45 CFR Part 74 Appendix E_Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals, or 48 CFR Part 31_Contract Cost Principles and Procedures, as applicable. (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense. (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, the Secretary may waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. These waivers may authorize recipients to do any one or more of the following: (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Secretary. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Secretary is under no obligation to reimburse these costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover these costs).
