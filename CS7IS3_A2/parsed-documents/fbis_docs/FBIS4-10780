The Guantanamo Naval Base would, of course, be no exception, because in the region surrounding it, we have everything necessary to neutralize that U.S. enclave. Raul added that in that case, and as long as the aggression does not originate from that base and the lapsed time is not used to reinforce the base, Cuba is willing to allow the time necessary to evacuate civilians from the base, primarily the spouses and children of the personnel of the U.S. naval base. In the ceremony held in Guantanamo to observe Militiamen's Day and the 33d anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist nature of the Revolution, Raul stressed that our historic legacy is to fight fiercely for the independence of the fatherland, under highly disadvantageous conditions, against the enemy; to take their weapons; respect prisoners of war; and help injured prisoners. After stressing that our people feel admiration and gratitude toward their brave sons, the members of the border guard troops unit, Raul pointed out that the Revolutionary Armed Forces are proud of the courage, dedication, and discipline of this unit deployed on the front line.
