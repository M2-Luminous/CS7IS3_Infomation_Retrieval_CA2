New sections 314.107 and 314.108 are added to subpart D to read as follows: §314.107 Effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the act. (a) General. A drug product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce when approval of the application or abbreviated application for the drug product becomes effective. Except as provided in this section, approval of an application or abbreviated application for a drug product becomes effective on the date FDA issues an approval letter under §314.105 for the application or abbreviated application. (b) Effect of patent on the listed drug. If approval of an abbreviated new drug application submitted under section 505(j) of the act or of a 505(b)(2) application is granted, that approval will become effective in accordance with the following: (1) Date of approval letter. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) of this section, approval will become effective on the date FDA issues an approval letter under §314.105 if the applicant certifies under §314.50(i) or §314.94(a)(12) that: (i) There are no relevant patents; or (ii) The applicant is aware of a relevant patent but the patent information required under section 505 (b) or (c) of the act has not been submitted to FDA; or (iii) The relevant patent has expired; or (iv) The relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed. (2) Patent expiration. If the applicant certifies under §314.50(i) or §314.94(a)(12) that the relevant patent will expire on a specified date, approval will become effective on the specified date. (3) Disposition of patent litigation. (i)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (b)(3)(iii), and (b)(3)(iv) of this section, if the applicant certifies under §314.50(i) or §314.94(a)(12) that the relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, and the patent owner or its representative or the exclusive patent licensee brings suit for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt by the patent owner of the notice of certification from the applicant under §314.52 or §314.95, approval may be made effective 30 months after the date of the receipt of the notice of certification by the patent owner or by the exclusive licensee (or their representatives) unless the court has extended or reduced the period because of a failure of either the plaintiff or defendant to cooperate reasonably in expediting the action; or (B) If the patented drug product qualifies for 5 years of exclusive marketing under §314.108(b)(2) and the patent owner or its representative or the exclusive patent licensee brings suit for patent infringement during the 1-year period beginning 4 years after the date the patented drug was approved and within 45 days of receipt by the patent owner of the notice of certification, the approval may be made effective at the expiration of the 71/2 years from the date of approval of the application for the patented drug product. (ii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters judgment; (iii) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court issues a final order or judgment that the patent has been infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court determines that the patent will expire or otherwise orders; or (iv) If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the court grants a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug product until the court decides the issues of patent validity and infringement, and if the court later decides that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, approval may be made effective on the date the court enters a final order or judgment that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. (v) In order for an approval to be made effective under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the applicant must receive an approval letter from the agency indicating that the application has received final approval. Tentative approval of an application does not constitute ``approval'' of an application and cannot, absent a final approval letter from the agency, result in an effective approval under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (4) Multiple certifications. If the applicant has submitted certifications under §314.50(i) or §314.94(a)(12) for more than one patent, the date of approval will be calculated for each certification, and the approval will become effective on the last applicable date. (c) Subsequent abbreviated new drug application submission. (1) If an abbreviated new drug application contains a certification that a relevant patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed and the application is for a generic copy of the same listed drug for which one or more substantially complete abbreviated new drug applications were previously submitted containing a certification that the same patent was invalid, unenforceable, or would not be infringed and the applicant submitting the first application has successfully defended against a suit for patent infringement brought within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt of notice submitted under §314.95, approval of the subsequent abbreviated new drug application will be made effective no sooner than 180 days from whichever of the following dates is earlier: (i) The date the applicant submitting the first application first commences commercial marketing of its drug product; or (ii) The date of a decision of the court holding the relevant patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.
