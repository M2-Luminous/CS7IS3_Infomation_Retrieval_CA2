At a meeting with Board of Foreign Trade officials and private sector representatives Monday, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, gave his backing to the proposed company, and suggested that the government finance the company's research and development projects after its establishment. A follow-up meeting scheduled for June 9 by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is set to make further plans regarding the company's proposed opening date and what products it will make in trying to replace Japanese imports, the board said. The board said the holding company would first begin producing key parts and components that are imported from Japan to the tune of US$50 million each on a yearly basis. Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$4.96 billion in the first four months of the year, up 4.5 percent from the same period last year. But its deficit with Japan was US$14.22 billion last year, and the figure is expected to hit US$15.5 billion this year.
