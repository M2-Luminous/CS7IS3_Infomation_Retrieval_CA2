FR940912-2-00053 FR940912-2-00042 3. Does the applicant or any person or entity listed in response to Question 1 or 2 have any ownership interest in or connection with any other IVDS applicant or licensee? If so, disclose fully the nature and extent of such interest or connection, the file number (or other identifier) of such application, and the location of such IVDS system or proposed system. 4. Are any of the individuals listed in response to Questions 1 and 2 related (as husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, or daughter) to each other? Does any member of the immediate family ( i.e. , husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, or daughter) of any individual listed in response to Questions 1 and 2 have any interest in or connection with any other IVDS applicant or licensee? If the answer to either or both of these questions is yes, disclose fully, concerning the persons involved, their relationship, the nature and extent of such interest or connection, the file number (or other identifier) of such application, and the location of such IVDS system or proposed system. 5. If the applicant certified on the application that it is a small business, submit the following supporting documents (a small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates, has no more than $6 million net worth and, after federal income taxes, excluding any carry over losses, has no more than $2 million in annual profits each year for the previous two years): a. a statement disclosing the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates at the time the application was filed and the applicant's (including affiliates) current net worth. b. the most recent balance sheet(s) for the applicant and its affiliates (submit an audited balance sheet, if available). c. a complete copy of the Federal income tax return(s) for the applicant and its affiliates for the past two years (calendar or fiscal). d. a complete copy of the State income tax return(s) for the applicant and its affiliates for the past two years (calendar or fiscal). 6. If the applicant claims a preference as a business owned by members of a minority group(s) and/or women, indicate the gender of the individuals listed in response to Questions 1 and 2, and indicate the minority group(s) of which the individuals listed in response to Questions 1 and 2 are members. The applicant must also describe how women and/or minorities exercise de jure and de facto control of the applicant. A business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and 50.1 percent controlling interest in the applicant. For applicants that are limited partnerships, the general partner either must be a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who is a U.S. citizen and owns at least 50.1 percent of the partnership equity, or an equity that is 100 percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. 7. If the applicant was a high bidder for one or more IVDS licenses ( i.e. , signed a high bid acknowledgment form) and did not submit the required down payment by August 8, 1994, the deadline for payment specified by the Commission, explain the reason(s) for the applicant's failure to tender its down payment. Unless otherwise specified above, the information submitted must be current as of the filing date of the applicant's Form 175 application. Any changes since that date shall also be disclosed. False statements in response to this letter would be in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, and could result in criminal penalties.
