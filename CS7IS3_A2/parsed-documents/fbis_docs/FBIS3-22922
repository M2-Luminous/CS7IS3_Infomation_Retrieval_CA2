This general, nicknamed "Mali [Little]" by his friends, caught our attention when (in the first half of February) he started negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [Passage omitted] [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize, what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army? [Milovanovic] [passage omitted] We are making it plain to everybody that if air strikes do take place all foreigners on the territory of the Serbian Republic will become hostages. This also includes the representatives of the International Red Cross, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and, unfortunately, even journalists. Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead and attack! This is one of our defense mechanisms. Furthermore, as of 1 March, they have been flying in our sky and recorded everything. They have probably also placed numerous radio tracers [radio lokator] on the ground, along the separating lines. However, their problem is that they know all our capabilities [sentence as published]. Earlier they did not know, for example, that we can follow them all over Europe, and especially in Italy where they are concentrating. In one combat raid, as we soldiers call it, we can decimate their first shock group, which would consist of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a single chief of state whose air force is taking part in the attack would be able to justify this at home. To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe, however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway, but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates, destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This, however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of international representatives would take place. We have no other choice, we must defend ourselves.
