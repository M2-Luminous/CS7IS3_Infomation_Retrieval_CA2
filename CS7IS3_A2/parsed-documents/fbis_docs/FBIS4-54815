Therefore, he should have advisers--people who, for free or for a fee, share their knowledge with the head of state. The president may, but he does not have to, accept their suggestions. As it turns out, in practice, he most often "does not have to." The president has almost 700 advisers, not counting his closest aides in the Office. These are members of the presidential councils, of which there are 12. another one is being established--the council for veteran affairs. This costs the President's Office approximately 700 million zlotys per year--the return of the costs, hotels, and mineral water. There have already been cases of returning money for air tickets on international routes (a member of the council for sport issues) and for a journey in a state car with a driver (a member of the scientific council). Added to this are printing costs--whatever is invented by the councils is printed--sometimes in the form of thick books. The councils also receive meals, even though their members complain about the quality. Among the president's advisers are over 150 professors and more than 200 scientists with lesser titles. There are 10 priests and one bishop. Only five persons are called "lawyers." Moreover, the councils include journalists, peasants, sportsmen, scouts, writers, artists, businessmen, architects, and politicians. As a matter of fact, there are not many well-known and active politicians, apart from Bronislaw Geremek and Aleksander Malachowski. Incidentally, their roles are apolitical there. The councils convene every second month, on average. The teams into which they are usually divided may meet more frequently. The president tries to attend every third meeting of each council, but he does not always make it. In practice, he attends the session of each council once a year. He has not yet met with the council for youth affairs. How, then, does he find out about the councils' advice? "In various ways--for example, from the press. It is always known when a meeting of one of the councils has been held. Apart from that, there are reports. It is not true that the president does not read anything. He likes theoretical political works, for instance, or reminiscences of politicians very much. Moreover, sessions are attended by his civil servants," says Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski, head of the Bureau of Political Servicing of the Office (he coordinates the activities of eight councils). The councils are supposed to act entirely independently. If the president wants to ask them about something, he will do so. It is worth adding that he does this rarely. Moreover, the councils were established as a result of initiatives of the people themselves: They came and said that they wanted to establish a council with the president. This gives importance. Therefore, their expectations cannot be too great. Recently, the president stated that he does not want any more councils, but the veterans still managed to ask for their own council. The employees of education may not have such a chance. "If we had accepted all of the motions, there would already be 50 councils," claims Andrzej Kojder, the main expert in the Political Servicing Bureau. Thus, all along, the councils have been in the wrong place--they were left far from the decisionmaking processes. They turned into discussion clubs that at some higher level are taken care of by Lech Walesa. Therefore, the thesis submitted by the Belweder's opponents that the councils would be the basis of a presidential government is not very realistic. The councils are not satisfied with the president: He attends their sessions only rarely. It is not known to what extent he takes advantage of the experts' efforts. He does not give any feedback. Nor is the president satisfied with the councils: He says that they have become another forum at which the complaints and frustrations of various milieus are discussed, that their members simply want to get something done via the Belweder, that they do not submit any legislative drafts, even though the president has the right to launch a legislative initiative. He presents his complaints right at those meetings. A. Zakrzewski: "The president at one point interrupts a speaker and says: I am not satisfied with you all. Tell me what I should do, give me addresses, telephone numbers; work on a joint stand." Lech Falandysz, deputy of the head of the Office (he coordinates the work of two councils; one council is taken care of by Andrzej Kozakiewicz, and the council for media affairs by the President's Press Office) adds: "In general, Lech Walesa is not keen on lawyers. The same goes for Mieczyslaw Wachowski, who is very businesslike with me. Walesa probably no longer considers me a lawyer, and this is why he tolerates me. He is a practical man, and he often emphasizes it. His presidency is of an amateurish-sentimental, not professional, nature, and that is all right with me. I could not work with another president." There are better councils and there are worse councils; much depends on the chairman. Andrzej Kajetan Wroblewski, who steers the scientific council with an iron hand, is listed as a model to follow. Also, the councils for agriculture and social policy work quite well. The former established contacts with Minister Smietanko. It is believed in the Office that the other councils should also meet with appropriate ministers; rhaps then they will become more specific and useful. However, not all of the ministers want that because, in fact, the councils are presidential not governmental. The creative work that has been accomplished by the councils is various. Apart from issues that are really serious and strategic, in the list of achievements one finds such items as: "obtaining additional money for publishing a book by U.S. Vice President Al Gore," "declaration for Polish public opinion, expressing concern about the political climate in Poland," or "the resolution of a conflict related to the Frederic Chopin Society." Just as the president does not have a concept for the councils, the councils do not have a concept for themselves. The plenary sessions of the councils are more like a stereotype; their structure is more that of a seminar than of an advisory body: attendance list, opening address, discussion, conclusions, setting the date and the subject of the next session. Attendance is not very good. And all of this is happening in a vacuum. The councils' members are rather unanimous in saying that they do not really know whether the council is simply the prolongation of their scientific work and they are supposed to behave as they do at their universities, or it requires effort and a different attitude from them. However, there is no feedback for that. Andrzej Kojder believes that there are too many well-known people in the councils who also have a hundred other tasks, who are members of various bodies, and for whom membership in the presidential council is a matter of prestige. They would very gladly meet with the president in the salons of the Belweder and drink coffee with him there. However, the president does not have time for that. Indeed, the councils swarm with prominent names. One cannot say no to the president. There was only one such case: A representative of the Independent Association of University Students [NZS], who was invited to become a member of the council for youth affairs, rejected the offer because the NZS had not liked the president for some time then. Still, members of the councils are such people as Jerzy Turowicz, Piotr Buchner, Gustaw Holoubek, Adam Michnik, Leszek Balcerowicz, Wieslaw Ochman, Marcin Krol, Sobieslaw Zasada, Bronislaw Geremek, Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Father Wieslaw Nieweglowski, Aleksander Gieysztor, Lena Kolarska- Bobinska, Henryk Samsonowicz, Marek Rostworowski, and many others. These are all first-league people. There arises the question, then, why contact with the president is so poor and why the advisory usefulness of the councils is so small. Only twice did the president quote the opinions of the councils when he made a decision: when he agreed to the candidacy of Zbigniew Klajnert for culture minister in the Suchocka government and, for the second time and not so directly, in the case of the self-governmental election law, which he finally vetoed. Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Giving advice to Lech Walesa is difficult, extremely difficult. It must be done very skillfully, and much patience is required. At the start, the president most often does not want to listen to anything. Later on, when he thinks about it quietly, reads something, he sometimes changes his mind." Lech Falandysz: "Telling the president that he is to do this or that, or at least that he should do this or that, is out of the question. The entire issue can be forgotten. The style favored in the Belweder is that of the military: If something is pulled off, no one will commend you; if not, you will be reprimanded. People must often work and say things they think they should. Lech Walesa wants to have not advisers but generals, who would present him with several options; he would then choose one or think about his own option. This is why the professorial style of giving advice, full of reservations and doubts, does not satisfy him." Another Office civil servant, who wanted to remain anonymous, claims that the concept of advice-giving bodies is not very good now. The Research and Analysis Office does not really fulfill its function. The 20-person legal office, which, among other things, reviews all of the laws before they are signed by the president, must often give up its suggestions when it hears political arguments. There are no good relations between the law and politics. There is no advisory body that would have powers in both these areas, which would include outstanding specialists capable of convincing Lech Walesa of their political abilities, which is not easy because the president believes that he is the greatest political talent in the country--the greatest and the only talent. Besides, the president would have to trust such people, and this may be the most difficult matter. Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Lech Walesa had bad experiences with political advisers at the time they were led by Zdzislaw Najder. After the Belweder was conquered by the Center Accord, the entire milieu linked to the Democratic Union moved away from him. The situation has not changed up to now. The president lacks this potential. It will not be replaced by existing councils, even if they are twice as numerous." It looks like the president receives various, poorly coordinated signals, both important and not very important, on the basis of which he makes his decisions. Therefore, the decisions often mirror the nature and the level of the advice the head of state receives. Perhaps the situation looks like this: He does not trust those people who might give him sound advice, and those he trusts give such advice as they can give. Three years ago, my colleagues in POLITYKA wrote about the "loneliness of Mr. President." Since that time, many people have come and gone from the Belweder; however, the president still seems to be alone, even though he has a few hundred advisers. It is not known for sure whether this is a choice or a necessity.
