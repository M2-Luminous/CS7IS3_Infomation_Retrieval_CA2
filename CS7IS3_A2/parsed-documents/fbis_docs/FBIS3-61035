But what about its problems? In the view of the Zemessargi, they are virtually nonexistent. Just 30 weapons were lost this year. If you add the 20 in 1992, the result is insignificant--only one weapon has been lost for every 340 volunteers. The problems lie elsewhere. For example, the personnel of the 18th Zemessargi Battalion were upset that there is just one grenade for every three volunteers and that they are forced to buy bullets at their own expense. In order to avoid weapons losses, it was proposed to improve the way they are kept: According to one volunteer, Modris Zermanis, a medical academy student, students should be allowed to keep weapons in their dormitories. A member of the 23rd Battalion took an even simpler approach to this question. He proposed that volunteers be authorized to carry weapons not only when in uniform and on duty, but also when off duty. The danger of this proposal is obvious: Fifty people have died at the hands of these valorous "guardians of order" in the republic in 1993. But this clearly doesn't bother the Zemessargi.
