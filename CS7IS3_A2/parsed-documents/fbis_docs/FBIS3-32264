Income tax revenues totaled 786 million lempiras; the property tax accounted for 26 million lempiras; 1.002 billion lempiras was collected for the tax on production, consumption, and sales; import duties amounted to 877 million lempiras; and service fees accounted for 109 million lempiras. The official stated that although the figures are not comparable to those of the previous year because the entire general budget would have to be analyzed for that, they do amount to 333.2 million lempiras more as of the end of October. Chong Wong noted that "we are meeting the collection targets" set for this fiscal year, even though the share revaluation tax has not yet been paid; it is expected to yield another 100 million lempiras. He complained that Hondurans are paying scant attention to this new tax, leaving everything to the last minute. The deadline for submitting applications is 30 November, and payments are due no later than 15 December, with no extensions. So far, however, only 25 million lempiras has been collected on this tax.
