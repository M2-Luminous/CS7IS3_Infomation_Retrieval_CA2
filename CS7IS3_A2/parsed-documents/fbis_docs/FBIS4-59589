Undoubtedly, Secretary Christopher will find in Damascus what he found in previous tours, that is, a frank Syrian position on the peace process, a definite commitment to UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, a comprehensive view of the just peace, and a sincere will to establish peace in a region that has seen all kinds of aggression and expansionist policies. He will sense an infinite seriousness in dealing with the ideas and proposals aiming to implement the UN resolutions and to implement, seriously and practically, the bases of the Madrid peace conference. It is also expected that when he moves to Israel, Secretary Christopher will find there the same position he found in previous tours, that is, an ambiguous Israeli concept of the peace process; an evasion of, or even contempt for, UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; negligence of the spirit of the U.S. initiative; an incomplete view of peace; and a sincere will to squander available opportunities, waste time and drain the Madrid conference of its content and the peace process of its objectives in order to impose the peace Israel wants, tailored according to the expansionist schemes and aggressive intentions known throughout the entire world. The question that comes to mind in the light of this fact is: How can the U.S. position, in other words the position of the U.S. sponsor, be reconciled with the policy of procrastination and obstruction Israel is pursuing? How can this dilemma be escaped; a dilemma Israel wants to be a dilemma for the U.S. Administration itself? If Israel succeeds in making this a dilemma for the United States, it will be able to subdue the U.S. initiative and the mediator's role. This would serve its own interests in the peace deal it wants, without taking into account the credibility of the U.S. position or U.S. interests in a region, which is required to enjoy peace. As it receives Secretary Christopher today, Syria is stressing that its position supports the just and comprehensive peace which can achieve complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, on top of which is the occupied Golan Heights; which can return rights to their rightful owners; and which can establish objective conditions for a genuine stability that would be accepted and even defended by the people, and for a peace based on international legitimacy and its resolutions as the terms of reference. These must be adopted in order to fortify the awaited peace and entrench the desired justice. Syria believes any distortion of this concept or twisting of these facts, which are known to the entire world, means a departure from the right course and the start of a journey down intricate roads that will lead the region to anywhere but peace.
