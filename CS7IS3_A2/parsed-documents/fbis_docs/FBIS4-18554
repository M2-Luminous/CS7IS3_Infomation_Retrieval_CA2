Amid efforts by republicans for direct dialogue, the IRA's 72-hour ceasefire was still holding tonight. Sinn Fein chairman Tom Hartley delivered a letter to Downing Street urging Mr Major to authorise talks in the wake of the Downing Street declaration. The leader of the political wing of the IRA said of the ceasefire: "This initiative should be built upon. It is a step forward in the development of a real peace process and deserves an imaginative response from the British Government." Mr Hartley said there had to be a desire to break new ground on all sides of the political divide. There had to be no preconditions in the arena of openness and imagination. He added: "The IRA initiative and Sinn Fein's peace strategy is evidence that this type of thinking exists in Republican ranks. It would be a mistake to believe that it is only the grand gesture which unlocks conflict. On the contrary, it is the small moves which are the motor for change." Although the letter will be studied at Downing Street, the Government repeated its earlier insistence that direct dialogue could not take place until there was a permanent end to violence. A spokesman said: "The Government position is clear. We are not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the joint declaration. They know what needs to be done, a renunciation of violence." Unionist MPs rejected the so-called truce as a cynical ploy by the terrorists to put pressure on London. And the east Belfast Democratic Unionist MP Mr Peter Robinson claimed Sinn Fein and the Government were in secret contact again, and said London would eventually cave in to the Sinn Fein demands for clarification. Ulster Unionist leder Mr James Molyneaux said the ceasefire was "utterly contemptible" and accused the SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] leader John Hume of being "the actor's voice" of Gerry Adams. [passage omitted] Although the level of security on the streets of Belfast today appeared to drop, police and troops remained vigilant. One soldier on duty in the city centre said: "The situation hasn't changed. I don't feel any more relaxed. I just don't trust them (the IRA)." Republicans staged a series of protest pickets outside RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] stations tonight and one was also held at the gates of the British Embassy in Dublin, which Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring dismissed as a "cheap and odious."
