The current policy calls for "positive but cautious development of futures trading," said Gao Shangquan, head of a governmental research institution on economic reform. To achieve the purpose, he said, the State Council will launch a number of pilot projects on futures trading while striving to improve the relevant legislation and supervision mechanisms. "The approach is to dig a `canal' first and then divert water into it, instead of letting it overflow," added Gao, who was formerly a vice-minister of the State Commission on Economic Restructuring. State-imposed prices are being canceled as part of China's market-oriented economic reform, "prompting enterprises to safeguard the value of their products by engaging in futures trading," Gao said. Profit returns from futures trading, usually high, may also help increase its business volume, he added. However, he said, futures trading involves high risk and is still in the initial stage of development in China. "Neither the country's conditions nor the actual demand allow an immediate boom of the business. "Laws and government decrees on futures trading will be published only after repeated experiments under the State Council," said Gao, now a senior researcher with the commission. "Even in the future, futures trading should be handled with care," he said. Gao said that government officials and experts are drafting a set of provisional regulations concerning futures trading and planning the establishment of official bodies to administer the futures markets. Meanwhile, China's first futures law is being formulated, he said. Gao said that "tight control" is being imposed over entry of funds from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and foreign countries into futures markets on the Chinese mainland. And the government also advises Chinese citizens to be "cautious" in international futures trading. But Gao said that participation in the world futures market is the ultimate goal of China. "The problem is that China has yet to meet some of the basic requirements for taking part in international futures trading," he said. In 1990, Zhengzhou in central China established the country's first grain and edible oil trading market. The country now has 38 commodity exchanges and wholesale markets, dealing with petroleum, iron, steel and chemicals as well as food. There are also some 200 registered futures trading companies. "The progress has been rapid, but problems are many," Gao said, noting that the government has had to close down what he called "underground companies" -- "companies" unlicensed and failing to qualify for futures trading. In a nationwide futures craze in 1993, some got quick money but many went bankrupt overnight, Gao said. Some profiteering merchants from outside the Chinese mainland also took advantage of the confusion to drain off China's revenue, Gao said.
