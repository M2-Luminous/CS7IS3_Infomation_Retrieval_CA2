Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Peres was responding to queries by several Knesset members claiming that the arrangements on the border crossings would allow the Palestinians to carry out the right of return. Peres said that if the Palestinian leadership violates the agreements Israel will implement sanctions, including summarily preventing Palestinian entrance by resorting to the right of veto Israel was given in the agreement. The foreign minister said that last year approximately 300,000 Palestinians entered the territories for summer visits. He admitted that supervision of their exit at the end of their visits is not perfect.
