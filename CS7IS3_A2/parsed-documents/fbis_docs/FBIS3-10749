Senators, Deputies, Ministers, and representatives of public power; and civilian society: I will just say a few words to state that we have decided to promulgate without delay the emergency law that Congress has issued so that the special measures contained in the law can be adopted immediately and the situation of Banco Latino and the financial system in general can be addressed. I think that in this case, we have had the first experience of what we call the commitment to solidarity. All the public power institutions have contributed to the effort to face this delicate, difficult, and complex situation. The private sector has also expressed, in different ways, its willingness to cooperate so that solutions can be undertaken to the satisfaction of a large number of Venezuelans and foreign residents in the country who have seen their economic situation gravely jeopardized by the events that have taken place. After promulgating the emergency law, the national government plans to immediately present to the legislative chambers a bill with a brief partial reform of the published document because it considers that some of the approved provisions, due to the justified brevity of time because of the praiseworthy urgency with which Congress worked on the law...[pauses] perhaps there was not sufficient thought about the consequences that some of the norms might have and which, far from helping, might hinder the objective of achieving the reorganization of the Venezuelan financial system, which is an objective that concerns all of us. The law that I just signed has this double objective: on the one hand to address the emergency situation, the special situation created by the Banco Latino crisis, and on the other to give the branches of government the definite possibility of favorably resolving the aspects that might create fear among the Venezuelan community and the difficulties for the operation of the financial system. I am sure that the same climate of dialogue and cooperation among the branches of government, which has prevailed in the passage of this law, will also be present when the government proposals regarding this are received. I think today's action brings hope to those who have watched their personal situation with anguish due to the Banco Latino crisis, which I have not hesitated to describe as a real disaster and whose dimension has exceeded everything that was initially thought when the government of President Ramon Velasquez decreed the intervention of that bank. I thank those present here, especially the members of the legislative chambers and the members of the committees that have been involved in this issue. I thank them on behalf of Venezuelans because they have maintained an open-minded, understanding, and constructive position that undoubtedly leads us to have strong hope about the future of the country and which views with undeniable and appropriate concern the situation of the economy and the National Treasury. Again, thank you, and I hope the Venezuelan people, who have been shaken by the recent events of Banco Latino will feel more secure and have more hope about the efforts that the public and private sectors are making to guarantee everyone their legitimate rights and to share the necessary sacrifice to resolve the situation. [applause]
