It has come to light from sources close to presidential quarters that work on a regulatory document for the Russian special service has been completed. It was signed by Boris Yeltsin yesterday. In accordance with it, the FCS comprises the very same structure of the former Security Ministry minus the Investigation Directorate and the so-called 15th Directorate (in charge of underground towns). Stripping the FCS of investigative functions makes it look more like a civilized country's special service. Earlier, a separate presidential edict made border troops an independent organization. In all likelihood, the 15th Directorate will be handed over to the Main Security Directorate -- Mikhail Barsukov's agency. This, however, will only legally formalize what is already solid reality. The fate of the Investigation Directorate is still unclear. There is a possibility of some reorganization of the former Security Ministry's inner structure, but it will not be of a fundamental nature. Former Security Ministry personnel are awaiting a repeat efficiency rating procedure which, however, no one fears. To date there are only two men on the payroll of the new organization -- its director Nikolay Golushko and his first deputy Sergey Stepashin.
