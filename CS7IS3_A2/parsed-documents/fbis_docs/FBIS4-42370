During their discussions in Mulhouse on Tuesday [31 May] the two defense ministers, Volker Ruehe and Francois Leotard, came out in favor of building a new military cargo plane. The experience of the civilian aircraft producer Airbus Industries are to be used in this venture. There is "a strategic demand" for the new cargo plane, which is to have a greater range than the current planes with a view to international missions, German delegation circles said. A study on the plans will be drawn up in the Western European Union by next year.
