FR940428-2-00067 FR940428-2-00040 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3757; FR&hyph;3673&hyph;N&hyph;01] Revision to Chapter 2 of HUD Handbook on Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD; and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to advise the public, particularly housing managers, owners and residents of certain HUD-assisted housing, that the Department has revised Chapter 2 of its Handbook entitled ``Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs'' (Handbook 4350.3, Chg&hyph;24) to address concerns raised by members of the public about certain provisions of the Handbook relating to occupancy policies in housing for elderly (age 62 and over) persons. The supplementary information section of this notice provides additional information on the changes made to Chapter 2 of the Handbook. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Margaret Milner, Acting Director of the Office of Elderly and Assisted Housing, Office of Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6130, or Albert Sullivan, Director of the Office of Multifamily Management, Room 6160, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone number (202) 708&hyph;4542 (voice) for Ms. Milner: (202) 708&hyph;3730 for Mr. Sullivan; or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD). (These telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department's Handbook 4350.3 on Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs (the ``Handbook'') provides guidance on the occupancy policies and procedures governing multifamily housing subsidized under the following programs: the Section 221(d)(3) (Below Market Interest Rate) Program; the Rent Supplement Program; the Section 236 Interest Reduction Program; the Rental Assistance Program; the Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside Program; the Section 8 Property Disposition Set-Aside Program; the Section 515/8 Farmers Home Administration Program; and the Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation Program. Chapter 2 of the Handbook entitled ``Eligibility for Assistance; Eligibility for Admission, Marketing and Tenant Selection'' addresses, among other things, the eligibility of elderly persons and persons with disabilities for multifamily housing subsidized under the covered programs. Members of the public, including groups representing persons with disabilities, have raised certain ``nondiscrimination'' issues with respect to those portions of Sections 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;19 of Chapter 2 of the Handbook which relate to the identification of projects or portions of projects that are for the exclusive use of elderly persons under the following programs: Sections 221(d) (3) and (4), Section 231, and Section 236. To clarify the Department's position on these issues, the Department has revised Sections 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;19 of the Handbook. The Department believes that the revisions made to these sections provide clear and consistent direction to housing providers and to the HUD Field Offices on the nondiscrimination issues raised by members of the public. Because of the broad interest among housing managers, owners, residents, and other members of the public in the subject matter addressed by Chapter 2, and to ensure wide dissemination of the Department's position on these issues, the Department is taking the unusual step of publishing in the Federal Register its notice to the Field Offices on the revisions made to Chapter 2. The notice is attached as Appendix A to this document. In publishing this notice, the Department also clarifies that Chapter 2 of the Handbook, and the revisions made to Chapter 2, do not implement Subtitle D of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D addresses the subject of ``Authority to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents and Units for Disabled Residents in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing.'' The Department will be issuing an interim rule on Subtitle D of Title VI. Chapter 2 will remain in effect, as revised by the accompanying notice, pending the effective date of interim regulations for Subtitle D. When interim regulations for Subtitle D have been issued, the Department intends to review Chapter 2 and to make any further revisions as may be appropriate. Dated: April 21, 1994. Roberta Achtenberg, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner.
