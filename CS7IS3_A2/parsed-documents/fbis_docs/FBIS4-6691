A report from the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) recommended construction of a nationwide optical fiber communication network as a core project in Japan's future infrastructure in advanced telecommunications. It should be built through free-market competition and private-sector participation, utilizing financial support from the public sector, it says. The report also calls for simplification of procedures in the radio frequency licensing system to encourage new entries into mobile phones. The recommendations will be submitted to ministries and agencies for inclusion in a government deregulation program scheduled for release this year.
