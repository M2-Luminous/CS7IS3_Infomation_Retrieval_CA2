These were joined, the press assessed, by some 12,000 employees, many of whom travelled to Bucharest from the province. The executive was represented at the talks by Labor and Social Protection Minister Dan Mircea Popescu, Finance Minister Florin Georgescu, Government's Secretary General Viorel Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie, the government's liaison officer with the employers' and trade unions' associations. The trade union delegation consisted of 15 persons, with the Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan Hossu, and his CNSLR-Fratia [National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions] counterpart, Victor Ciorbea, at its head. According to a government release, lying at the core of the talks was a government ordinance regulating the maximum wage fund exempted from supplementary taxation, which the unions consider as restricting wage rises. Also of prime importance was the subject of the degradation of the purchasing power of the common citizens, and wages in the educational system. At 0120 the talks were interrupted and scheduled for resumption Thursday, 16 May. After this first round of talks Octavian Partenie said that the government made its point of view known, to the effect that supplements to the budget allocation for education would be approved as soon as the economy provided the necessary funds. He also said the government consented to resume the talks provided the unions called off their rallies. Bogdan Hossu was quoted as saying that there was hope that on Thursday positive solutions would be found for all the claims. The unions' actions started Tuesday [14 June] morning with a rally in Aviatorilor Square and continued with marches along the main avenues of Bucharest until the afternoon, when the demonstrators returned to Victoriei Square, in front of the government's building, where they demanded that a trade union delegation be received by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. The first round of negotiations started after long bargaining between the sides related to the size of the unions' delegation to the talks.
