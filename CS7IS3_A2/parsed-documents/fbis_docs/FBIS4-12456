The Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine said in a joint statement that they fired on a patrol of Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the west of Israel's self-declared security zone. The statement said the factions blew up an armored vehicle, killing or wounding its crew. Voice of the South radio said a civilian vehicle had been attacked close to Shqif al-Naml without causing any victims. Security services confirmed an SLA patrol had come under fire but could not give details of any casualties. The two factions are opposed to the Middle East peace process and the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation autonomy accord signed in Washington in September.
