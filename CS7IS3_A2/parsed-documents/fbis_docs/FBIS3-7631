"Although the government has lifted the visitation ban on me, I am still not allowed to be met by people outside my family. Many of my friends actually want to come and give support to me," Xanana said in broken Indonesian language at Cipinang Prison when being visited by members of the two organizations. The former Fretilin leader is now serving 20 years of imprisonment. He told members of the commission Marzuki Darusman, Bambang Suharto, Charles Himawan, and Clementino Dos Reis Amaral and lawyers of YLBHI Luhut Pangaribuan, Haryono Citrosubono, and Frans Hendra Winarta about his activities in prison. Xanana said his activities were restricted and he was not allowed to read Indonesian magazines or newspapers. Earlier, he said that he did not even know whether the visitation ban on him has been lifted. However, Marzuki Darusman said that it has and in principle he has been allowed to be visited. Darusman explained that the ban was imposed following his letter to the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists in which he claimed his trial had been unfair. However, Xanana responded that in fact he is still not allowed to be visited by people outside his family. Responding to his complaint, Jakarta's head of Justice Office Alamsyah Bur, while there is no restriction to visit Xanana or any other political prisoners certain procedures have to be followed to ensure security of all prisoners. [sentence as published] "Every visitor will be questioned aboout his or her reason to see the prisoners. We can't allow people visiting the prisoners if he or her has no certain reasons," Bur added. Xanana also denied that he had appealed for clemency to Indonesia's president, Suharto, since he never admitted his Indonesian nationality. He then wanted lawyers from YLBHI to represent him. Xanana was captured in November 1992 and jailed for life which was later reduced to 20 years following his appeal for clemency. He was sentenced on charges of heading an armed rebellion, plotting against the state, and illegal possession of firearms. Luhut Pangaribuan, a lawyer from YLBHI who received Xanana's authorization to represent him, said that he would try to defend him as far as it was made possible by the country's legal system. Marzuki Darusman stated the legal process on Xanana has come to the final stage and the punishment has been meted out. "The commission will only observe whether his rights are respected. We will not interfere with the legal process," he added. He also said that after seeing Xanana's prison facilities, the commission felt satisfied because everything was in accordance with minimum applicable standards.
