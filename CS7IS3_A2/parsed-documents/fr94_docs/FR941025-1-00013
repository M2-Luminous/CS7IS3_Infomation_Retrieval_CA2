FR941025-1-00013 FR941025-1-00002 When animal tests involve challenge with infectious microorganisms in order to establish that the biological product can elicit protection against disease, the challenge with infectious microorganisms may produce an illness which is characteristic of a natural infection. Therefore, we are also proposing to amend ยง117.4 by adding new paragraphs (d) and (e), to allow for the treatment or humane destruction of test animals which show clinical signs of illness attributable to the challenge microorganism, which are likely to result in death. The proposed amendment would have the objective of eliminating unnecessary discomfort resulting from injury, unfavorable reactions, or illness when conducting tests in animals. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The effect of the rule would be to provide that animals used in testing biological product which become ill, accidentally injured, or exhibit unfavorable reactions could be removed from the test and be treated or humanely destroyed. The objective of the rule would be to eliminate any unnecessary discomfort to animals. The rule would require no additional testing of animals. It would simply provide an option which was not previously available. Therefore, the rule is not anticipated to increase costs to producers of veterinary biological products. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 117 Animal biologics, Animals. Accordingly, 9 CFR part 117 would be amended as follows: PART 117_ANIMALS AT LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS 1. The authority citation for 9 CFR part 117 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 151&hyph;159; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d). 2. In ยง117.4, new paragraphs (d) and (e) would be added to read as follows: ยง117.4 Test animals. * * * * * (d) During the course of a test, animals that are injured or show clinical signs of illness or unfavorable reactions that are not due to the test may be removed from the test and treated or humanely destroyed. If sufficient animals do not remain for the test to be evaluated, the test shall be declared inconclusive and may be repeated. (e) Test animals that show clinical signs of illness that are due to the test may be treated or humanely destroyed if the illness has progressed to a point (defined in the filed Outline of Production) when death is certain to occur without therapeutic intervention. When interpreting the results of the test, the animals that were treated or humanely destroyed because of illness due to the test and the animals that have died from illness due to the test prior to being humanely destroyed shall be combined into a common statistic of mortality due to the test. Done in Washington, DC, this 19th day of October 1994. Terry L. Medley, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
