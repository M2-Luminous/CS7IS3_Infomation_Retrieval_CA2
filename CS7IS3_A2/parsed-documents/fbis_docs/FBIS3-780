Bitter accusations were flung at AVF leader General Constand Viljoen for his role in the AWB's disastrous retreat from Mmabatho yesterday. AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said he would be most unhappy to remain in alliance with Viljoen. "We don't trust him," he said. "We are very disillusioned and disappointed with the role General Viljoen played in Bophuthatswana. He has no credibility left with our people," an angry Rundle said from the AWB's Ventersdorp office yesterday. About 4,000 AWB members pulled out of Mmabatho yesterday after being requested by Viljoen to leave the territory. During the retreat three AWB members were shot dead, apparently in cold blood, by members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. A further five AWB members were wounded in skirmishes. But Rundle denied that AWB members had been involved in clashes with members of the Bophuthatswana security forces and said the organisation had not been chased out of Mmabatho. "Our people left because we were asked to leave." He said Mangope had personally asked AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche for assistance to stabilise the situation in Mmabatho. "President Mangope personally had discussions with our leader, and asked for his help." The Bophuthatswana government has denied this, saying it had asked Viljoen for assistance on condition the AWB would not be involved. Asked whether the AWB would remain a member of the AVF, Rundle said: "We will settle that at our next meeting. I am a member of the AVF's executive council and I, for one, would be most unhappy to remain a member if General Viljoen is there. Viljoen was not available for comment late yesterday.
