Prior Amendments and Proposed Changes The following is a discussion of proposed changes made as a result of public comments on the July 19, 1985, proposed regulation, which was never finalized; changes made to the OAA by the 1987 amendments (Pub. L. 199&hyph;175); and other editorial, clarification and technical purposes. 1. Section 641.101 is revised to read: ``Part 641 contains the regulations of the Department of Labor for the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) under title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, which maintains a dual objective of providing community service assignments while promoting transition to unsubsidized employment. This part, and other pertinent regulations expressly incorporated by reference, set forth all regulations applicable to the SCSEP.'' 2. Section 641.102 removes or amends a number of definitions of terms to reflect DOL's uniform administrative requirements for grants in 29 CFR part 97, which apply to activities under this part. Among the terms omitted are ``local government'', ``State'', and ``grant agreement.'' 3. Section 641.102 is amended to expand its coverage consistent with the 1987 amendments (Pub. L. 100&hyph;175), to include ``literacy tutoring'' among the examples of community services. 4. Section 641.302(a) conforms to the revision of OAA section 502(b)(1)(M), made by section 162(a) of Pub. L. 100&hyph;175. The program assurance in that section now must take into account the rates of poverty and unemployment of the eligible individual groups. 5. Section 641.303 is amended by removing the words ``Objective of'' from the beginning of paragraph (b) and adding in lieu thereof the word ``The''. 6. Section 641.305(b)(3) is amended by removing ``place of'' from the phrase ``place of residence'' in the heading and substituting the word ``reside'' for the phrase ``have a place of residence''. 7. Section 641.309 is amended to add the word ``interest'' after the word ``skills'' in paragraph (b). 8. Section 641.312 is amended to add a new paragraph (b)(4). The former paragraph (b)(4) is redesignated as paragraph (b)(5) and a new sentence is added to newly designated paragraph (b)(5), immediately preceding the final sentence, to read: ``When authorized in the grant agreement, transportation may be provided for enrollees from home to work, to training or to supportive services.'' 9. Section 641.315 is revised to read: ``A maximum duration of enrollment may be established by the recipient in the grant agreement when authorized by the Department.'' 10. Section 641.324 is amended by revising the heading of the section to read: ``Enrollee and applicant complaint resolution.'' In paragraph (b), the word ``federal'' is added before the word ``law'' in the first sentence. Paragraph (c) is revised to read: ``Recipients that do not receive any funds under the JTPA shall process complaints of discrimination in accordance with Title 29 CFR parts 31 and 32. Recipients that receive any funds under JTPA shall process complaints of discrimination in accordance with Title 29 CFR part 34.'' 11. Section 641.402(b)(2) is redesignated as ยง641.405(b)(2) and is revised to read: ``The amount of Federal funds budgeted for enrollee wages and fringe benefits shall be no less than 75 percent of the grant.'' The remainder of that sentence is removed. 12. Section 641.405(b)(1) is revised to conform to the revisions of section 502(c)(3) of the OAA, made by section 161 of Pub. L. 100&hyph;175. The maximum percentage of federal funds which may be used for administrative costs is now limited to 13.5 percent, unless the Department increases the amount available to not more than 15 percent of the grant's federal cost. The Department shall administer such required increases in accordance with section 502(c)(3) of the OAA. 13. Section 641.406 is expanded to include administrative cost waiver criteria.
