"I am in no way ruling out the possibility of calling upon Van Thijn," said PvdA [Labor Party] Leader Kok. On Friday, both Van Thijn (PvdA) and Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin, his CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] colleague, announced their resignation from the government. The vacant posts will be filled by Kosto, secretary of state for Justice, and by De Graaf-Nauta, secretary of state for Interior. On Thursday, the Second Chamber forbade the so-called police ministers Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn from dealing with the Inter-Regional Investigative Teams (IRT's) aimed at combating organized crime. Immediately after the second debate in the Chamber on the sudden decomposition of the Utrecht/North Holland IRT, Hirsch Ballin -- who is a rising political star within the CDA -- came to the conclusion that the Chamber was excessively restricting him from performing his duties. Hirsch Ballin announced his resignation at the cabinet meeting on Friday morning. In the afternoon, after the cabinet meeting, Van Thijn followed with his decision to resign. Van Thijn maintains that he was not forced to resign by the cabinet. After the political commotion concerning his position, "to be quite honest it would be hard to justify my staying on," said Van Thijn at a press conference in The Hague. According to Prime Minister Lubbers, the departure of both members of his government is "tragic, both for them and for their cabinet colleagues." The departure of the two ministers from the Lubbers-Kok government responsible for "police affairs" brings the total of resignations from this government to five. Lubbers denied that his political reputation, and hence his chance of securing the presidency of the European Commission, has suffered from this. The departure of Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn "is not an affair, but an example of a specific manner of behavior between Parliament and the government. This is the way things should always be," said the prime minister. PvdA leader Kok underlined that he had "strongly" advised both Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn against resigning. The motion adopted by the Second Chamber "did not force them," he said. For that reason, Kok has no objection to a comeback by Van Thijn, who took office in January of this year. "The events of the past few days were not necessary as such," he said. Van Thijn described his brief period in office at the Ministry of the Interior as "bizarre." Approximately two months after he took office, he was confronted by an extremely critical Second Chamber following the sudden decision made at the Amsterdam police and justice forum to cancel the IRT for Utrecht and North Holland. Only in a second debate last week did the Chamber accept a motion in which the two ministers were blamed for the failure of the IRT experiment. Van Thijn has not yet made any statement regarding his political future. He said: "I have really not thought about it at all. First I must recover from the confusion and emotion of recent days." Unlike Hirsch Ballin, Van Thijn is not a member of the newly formed Second Chamber. [passage omitted]
