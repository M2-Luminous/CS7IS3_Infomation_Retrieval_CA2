His morning's agenda included meetings with Northern League representatives Umberto Bossi and Roberto Maroni, with life Senator Paolo Emilio Taviani, and with Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli. Asked about the controversy over the sensitive post of the Interior Ministry, the Forza Italia leader said that "We still have to go into all that but I don't see any insurmountable problems." His Northern League allies have pressed to obtain that post, but other political forces have vetoed that, saying the League could open up a Pandora's box if they got their hands on sensitive police and security roles and files. The list of potential ministers was "still up in the air," he said. Formal consultations on the cabinet are slated to begin Monday [2 May].
