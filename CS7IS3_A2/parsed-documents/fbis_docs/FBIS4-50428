[Tong] "The State Council's decision to set up the China Export and Import Bank is geared to the demands of our country's current implementation of a socialist market economy. For many years, our country has achieved tremendous results in exports but our main exports have been agricultural, sideline, indigenous, and specialty products. We now face the task of upgrading and renewing our export products by exporting more technology-intensive products. A review of the status of our country's industries shows that our machinery and electronics products and turnkey equipment are highly competitive in this respect. The bank's establishment will create excellent conditions for the export of such products. The bank will extend credit on the export of such goods, so as to create a strong banking support system for upgrading and improving their quality." Chairman Tong Zhiguang told the reporter: The Import and Export Bank of China's capital funds are allocated from the state coffers. The bank is managed on the basis of self-sufficiency and break-even concepts, and along the lines of enterprise administration; however, it is not an institution that provides free allocations. Operationally, it is directed and supervised by the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the People's Bank of China.
