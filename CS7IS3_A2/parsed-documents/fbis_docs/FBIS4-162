FBIS4-162 "drafr064_c_94014" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KZP Commissioner Comments KZP Commissioner Comments MB0204131194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1237 GMT 2 Apr 94 MB0204131194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Greg Arda] [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] there was nothing "clandestine" or "sinister" about his force's attempt to buy guns from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission]. He described the deal as an "ordinary, above-board business transaction" and rejected any insinuation it was clandestine. In a statement, Gen During accused Eskom of backing out of the deal because it was afraid of dealing with "political adversaries of the African National Congress". "We find it ludicrous that any publicity should be given to this matter, and particular, that any sinister connotations should be ascribed to, what is considered by us, as an ordinary above-board business transaction." Gen During said at no stage did the KZP conceal its identity as the buyer. The KZP and the "negotiators for both parties were at all times fully aware of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction". Eskom on Friday said it had suspended two employees pending a Goldstone Commission investigation into the deal which could have seen 1,000 weapons sold to the KZP before the transaction was cancelled by the company. Gen During said Eskom should have been fully aware that the arms were destined for the KZP because a signed letter from himself accompanied a required export permit for the weapons to a self-governing territory. The deal was done through an "authorised weapons dealer", he said. Eskom had been paid for the arms, and although the KZP considered the company's cancellation of the deal as a contractual breach, the force had accepted this, Gen During said. "Representations made by senior Eskom officials to the effect that they regarded the matter as a politically sensitive one," Gen During said, had led the KZP agreeing to calling off the deal. "I'm compelled to conclude that Eskom management fear some form of reprisal arising from these events and in a pathetic attempt at exonerating themselves from any blame daring to deal with the political adversaries of the ANC, they have now requested the Goldstone Commission to investigate the matter. "I believe that the Goldstone Commission has far more important issues at hand with which they should be presently occupied, other than to sensationalise a matter like this," Gen During said.
