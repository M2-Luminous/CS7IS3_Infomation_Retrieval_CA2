FBIS4-4675 "dreas065__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. F-15 Fighter Crashes in Okinawa U.S. F-15 Fighter Crashes in Okinawa City Assembly To Protest OW0504021894 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 5 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0504021894 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] The Okinawa Municipal Assembly (with Heiwa Yaga as speaker) called an extraordinary session at 1800 [0900 GMT] on the afternoon of 4 April at which members unanimously adopted a resolution and a statement of opinions strongly protesting to U.S. military authorities about the U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter crash in the morning. An assembly delegation is scheduled to present these documents to the U.S. Forces Okinawa Area Coordinator, the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau, the prefectural governor, and the prefectural assembly speaker on the morning of 5 April. The resolution and statement of opinions point out: "The Kadena ammunition dump is located near the accident site, and in neighboring areas there are also stock farms, recreation centers, and villages. As a single mistake could have resulted in a disaster involving citizens, it was a serious shock to our people and they are now uneasy." As well as criticizing the U.S. military for its deficient maintenance and management of military aircraft, the documents reiterate the people's great anger. "Okinawa city residents have been compelled to coexist with the largest U.S. military base in the Far East. And as far as they are concerned, they feel this accident vividly demonstrates their fears that inevitably result from the existence of military bases." Touching on previous accidents, as well as the fact that military aircraft regularly fly over residential areas, the documents state "our people are continually exposed to the danger of being deprived of their lives and property." Therefore, while strongly demanding that measures be taken to prevent any further accidents, the assembly wants the cause of the accident be publicized for prefectural residents as soon as possible, maintenance work on all aircraft strengthened, and a ban on aircraft flying until proper maintenance work is ensured.
