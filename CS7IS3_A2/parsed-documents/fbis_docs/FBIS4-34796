The document was signed during a special ceremony attended by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Argentine President Carlos Menem, who is paying a three-day visit to Canada. According to the agreement, Canada may provide special technology and cooperation in the nuclear field to Argentina. The agreement will allow Argentina to make better use of its nuclear resources for strictly peaceful purposes, especially in the energy field, according to official Canadian sources. Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet said during the ceremony that the agreement "marks the beginning of a new phase of the relationship between the two countries." The minister announced Canada will sell Argentine technology and equipment for the installation of a second nuclear plant in addition to granting aid for the research being carried out by Argentine experts. The agreement was signed after Argentina this week signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in which the signatory countries agree to use nuclear power strictly for peaceful purposes.
