In a unanimous resolution, the council limited UNOSOM's mandate to assisting the Somalia parties in achieving national reconciliation, providing humanitarian relief and protecting major ports and airport, etc. A direct outcome was that the council also authorized a gradual reduction of the UN Somalia peacekeeping forces to 22,000. The UN Operation had over 30,000 soldiers at its peak and currently there are about 25,700 troops. The resolution follows the UN's failure to forcibly disarm Somalia factions. U.S. troops last summer masterminded operations in Mogadishu in a search for faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid, whose supporters were accused of killing 25 Pakistani peacekeepers in June. When 18 U.S. soldiers were killed on October 3, the United States, facing strong domestic opposition to military involvement in Somalia, announced it would complete its withdrawal by the end of March. Since then the UN policy towards Somalia has been under scrutiny. The Chinese ambassador to the UN, Li Zhaoxing, noted the importance of a political settlement on the issue. "The international community had become increasingly aware that the final solution to the Somali question lies within the Somali people themselves and the key to it is the realization of broadly- based national reconciliation," he said. "UNOSOM's experience and lessons have shown that the fundamental and effective way for a settlement is by peaceful means. Resorting to military action will only serve to complicate the matter," he added.
