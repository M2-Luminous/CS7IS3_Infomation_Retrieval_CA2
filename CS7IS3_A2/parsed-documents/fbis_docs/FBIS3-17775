This was disclosed to Interfax on Monday by a member of the drafting team. The source said that the document suggests renouncing early elections, potentially destabilizing constitutional amendments and the politically charged comments on the events of October 1993. The draft reportedly includes the formation of a public body to ensure all sides observe the agreement. It should be signed by federal government bodies, federation members, parliamentary groups, political movements, public organizations and trade unions. If the terms are violated by any party, they will be asked to leave the political arena. At the initiative of the president the document was drafted by five working groups on the following spheres: politics, economy, regional and ethnic matters, culture, security. Earlier on Monday a well-informed source close to the president told Interfax that the final text of the draft agreement will be handed to Yeltsin within the next few hours.
