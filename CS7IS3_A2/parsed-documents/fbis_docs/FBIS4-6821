Speaking to the BANGKOK POST through an interpreter in his hometown Abdul Garim bin Hassan concluded that the situation in the South, manifested by torching of rural schools and bomb attacks, was manipulated with political intent. A respectable religious instructor, he urged the Chuan government not to be misled by the situation or to put the blame on separatist movements. Abdul Garim said he recently met Dr Arong Mureng, leader of a new and aggressive faction of the Pattani United Liberation Organisation, another separatist organisation which has waged a battle for the creation of an autonomous Pattani state in southernmost Thailand. Dr Arong was suspected by the Fourth Army Region of playing a role in the torching of 34 schools in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat provinces last August. The BRN founder said he and Dr Arong shared the view that most of the untoward incidents in the past eight months in the South were perpetrated by some politicians to cause trouble for the Government. He insisted that his BRN organisation and Dr Arong's PULO faction were not involved in any of those incidents. "I know him (Dr Arong) personally and this helps convince me that the allegations against Arong for causing turmoil are totally ridiculous. "First, he is a staunchly religious man and anyone who has strong faith in religion will not dare do anything which will harm the lives of innocent people. "Secondly, it would take a large number of people to cause trouble in different places simultaneously. And Arong does not have that capability," said Abdul Garim referring to the torching of 34 schools. He said when he first heard about the incidents he knew at once that they were not perpetrated by separatist movements. Abdul Garim is considered by the Fourth Army as a highly respectable member of the BRN. Negotiations are under way to persuade him to return to Pattani to pursue a normal life. The BRN founder charged that some separatists "who do not have any ideology" were hired by some politicians to create turmoil in the South 'to create a pretext for the overthrow of the Government. He said Arong suspects that some of his men may have become tools of the politicians but without his consent. Arong, he added, was infuriated. Abdul Garim claimed separatist organisations were created for political objectives. He explained that southern provinces were a perfect target for trouble-making because the public could be easily misled to believe that the separatists have a hand in them. He said he felt sorry for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai whose administration has become a target. "He is a man of good heart and who has always fought for justice in society. I personally admire him," said Abdul Garim. About his 30-year struggle for an autonomous state in southern Thailand, he said he now realises that violence and armed struggle are not a solution to problems in the South. He said he was considering the peace overture from the Fourth Army. If he is assured religious freedom, he said he may return. "What I really want to do when I return home is teach Islam to young Muslims and tell them to have faith in our religion," he said. He said he has heard of the progress in the Muslim-dominated provinces and was impressed by the effort of the Government which has gone to great lengths to redress the plight of Muslim people. Abdul Garim, who led an armed struggle during the early 1960s because he felt at the time that the government was repressing Muslims, now views the situation more favourably. He said he was confident that the situation in the South will improve now that the Government recognises and respects the religious' rights and freedom of Muslim people.
