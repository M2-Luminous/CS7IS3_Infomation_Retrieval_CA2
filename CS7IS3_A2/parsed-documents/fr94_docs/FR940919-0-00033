ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is approving the 1990 base year carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventory submitted by the State of Minnesota as meeting the Clean Air Act requirements for emission inventories for CO. The inventory was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas in Minnesota. USEPA's action is based upon a base year emission inventory which was submitted by the State of Minnesota to satisfy the requirements of section 187(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rulemaking becomes effective on October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the base year emission inventory and other materials relating to this rulemaking are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Maggie J. Greene before visiting the Region 5 Office.) United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard (AE&hyph;17J), Chicago, Illinois 60604.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On November 9, 1992 and November 10, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted to USEPA 1990 base year CO emission inventories for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas in Minnesota. The inventories were were submitted to USEPA as a revision to the State of Minnesota SIP. The State held public hearings on October 26, 1992, and November 6, 1992, to entertain public comments on the 1990 base year emission inventory for Duluth. The public hearing for the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was held on June 22, 1994. The USEPA issued a completeness letter to the State on March 8, 1993. The notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9155) Federal Register . II. Public Comment/USEPA Response A thirty-day public comment period was provided to allow interested parties the opportunity to comment on USEPA's proposed action. There were no public comments received on this action by the Agency. Additionally, USEPA redesignated the Duluth area to attainment on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17706) in a separate rulemaking action. III. Rulemaking Action USEPA is approving the base year emission inventory that was submitted by the State of Minnesota. The State submitted a complete inventory containing point, area, and mobile off-road and on-road source data, and documentation. The inventory is complete and approvable for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas according to all criteria set out in the June 24, 1993, memorandum from John S. Seitz, Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to the Regional Air Directors. Although Minnesota had not provided opportunity for public comment on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area inventory at the time of USEPA's proposed rulemaking, Minnesota provided such public comment period for 30 days ending June 17, 1994, and held a public hearing on June 22, 1994. With this action, the Minneapolis-St. Paul area inventory is now also complete and approvable. As a result, USEPA is approving the SIP carbon monoxide emission inventory submitted by the State of Minnesota. The emissions inventories of carbon monoxide emissions for a typical winter day in Duluth and in the Minneapolis-St. Paul areas are indicated in tables 1 and 2 below. Table 1._ Carbon Monoxide Emissions for the Duluth Area 1Emissions source 11990 emissions rate (lbs/winter day) On-road Mobile 114,718 Off-road Mobile 13,624 Point Source 4,270 Area Source 85,614 n,s Total Emissions 218,226 Table 2._ Carbon Monoxide Emissions for the Minneapolis-St. Paul Area 1Emissions source 11990 emissions rate (lbs/winter day) On-road Mobile 2,790,595 Off-road Mobile 345,702 Point Source 559,898 Area Source 566,285 n,s Total Emissions 4,262,480 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP.
