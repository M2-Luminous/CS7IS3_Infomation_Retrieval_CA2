Thomson] [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Nineteen parties contesting next week's elections on Tuesday [19 April] handed a memorandum to the European Community's election unit in Johannesburg, requesting election campaign funds allocated by the EEC be provided directly to them and not through the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. The request was made after a proposal tabled by the Federal Party at a meeting of the IEC's party liaison committee on Tuesday morning was carried by 14 votes to five. The proposal was that the EEC be approached to distribute the funds among the parties "in an equal manner". A joint statement by the 19 parties said: "Due to the time constraints between now and the elections we feel an urgent decision on this matter is needed to ensure free and fair elections and a multiparty democracy." The parties are the South African Women's Party, Green Party, Western Cape Federalist Party, Islamic Party, Africa Muslim Party, African Democratic Movement, Workers International, African Moderates Congress Party, Federal Party, Merit Party, Workers List Party, Right Party, Ximoko Progressive Party, Soccer Party, Luso-South African Party, Minority Front, United People's Front, Dikwankwetla Party and Women's Rights Peace Party. South African Women's Party leader Sue Millard told SAPA: "The way in which the state electoral fund is administered completely sidelines the smaller parties and is not in the interests of the public. "The required signatures and opinion polls (required to qualify for funds) are not ideal ways of determining support. For example, a lot of people have to deal with intimidation." Ms Millard said most of the parties opposing the proposal were those with ample funds, and it was clear who they were.
