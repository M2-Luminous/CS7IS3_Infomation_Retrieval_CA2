It says this fragility has clearly manifested itself soon after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. Commenting on this subject today, the paper says the desired peace is never an Israeli peace that comes at the expense of Arab rights and Arab existence. Peace does not mean the continuation of occupation and the existence of military and security positions and settlements. Peace is not partial agreements or separate deals. TISHRIN says that peace is that which puts a final and total end to occupation and provides real circumstances and appropriate climates to regain the Palestinian people's political and national rights, including their right to self-determination. The paper adds that since the Oslo and Cairo agreements have not guaranteed these rights as much as they guaranteed the continuation of Israeli occupation and control of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and since they have given the occupation forces and settlers the green light to commit savage crimes and fascist massacres, it is only natural to clearly state that the partial agreements concluded between Israel and a Palestinian party have collapsed because the massacre was a natural outcome of these capitulatory agreements. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israeli terrorism is always ready to commit more crimes and massacres unless the international community, represented by the UN Security Council, shoulders its responsibilities and rescues our people from the Israeli killing. Within the same context, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: What makes the tragedy of the Hebron massacre more bitter is the farce currently taking place at the UN Security Council. The Council has for over five days after the massacre and despite vehement global condemnation of it, failed to issue a resolution condemning Israel and its ugly crimes on the one hand, and providing protection and security to the Palestinian people on the other. AL-BA'TH adds: This proves not only the different standards employed by the big powers in dealing with the world issues, problems, and crises, but emphasizes that the protection these states are providing for the Zionist entity and its terrorism in the occupied territories, southern Lebanon, or in what is related to the peace process, is keeping the region under the yoke of Israel's aggression. It is Israel's crimes which threaten regional and world peace and security.
