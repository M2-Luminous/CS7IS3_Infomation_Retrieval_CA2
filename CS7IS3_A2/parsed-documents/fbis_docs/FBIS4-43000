An increasing number of Third World countries are trying to acquire such weapons, a report of the Federal Intelligence Office says, which was presented by State Minister in the Chancellor's Office Bernd Schmidbauer to the Cabinet on Wednesday [8 June]. According to Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, it is pointed out that North Korea is willing to sell its carrier systems to anyone who pays the necessary sum of money. It is to be assumed that more and more "threshold countries" are offering such systems and that missiles with a range of 1,000 km will already be available by the beginning of the next decade. The report comes to the conclusion that only a strict export regime and close international cooperation can prevent further proliferation.
