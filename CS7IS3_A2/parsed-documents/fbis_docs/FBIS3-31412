The large privatization amendment which is to be dealt with by the parliament on Wednesday is neither the governmental nor opposition draft, he said. The two parties are in accord on everything except the personal union of a government member with the FNM. We are willing to make concessions, such as the finance minister not needing to be director of the FNM Board of Supervisors, he added. If the government is to implement an economic policy, it must have money, and this is in the Fund, Meciar stated. The government provides companies with guarantees, and as more than half of the budget is based on these guarantees, the personal union between the government and the FNM is indispensable, he said. The companies managed by the FNM owe some 2 billion Slovak crowns ($60.6 million) for taxes, Meciar said. The struggle for personal union is no power struggle, it is a struggle for the efficient linkage and workability of the system, he added. Wednesday's voting on the large privatization amendment will not be connected with a no confidence vote in the government, Meciar said. If the parliament passes a law which does not suit the government, the latter will return it in accordance with the Constitution through President Michal Kovac to the parliament, he concluded.
