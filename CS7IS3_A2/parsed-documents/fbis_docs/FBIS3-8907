The initiative is aimed at having an agreement reached between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) on the cessation of hostilities and the restoring of peace. Churkin and RSK President Milan Martic agreed in Belgrade on Wednesday that Krajina-Croatia talks be held at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 22. The conflict between Krajina and Croatia broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb people to a national minority. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 on ethnically and historically Serb territories within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N. protected area (UNPA) in March 1992. After meeting with Martic, Churkin conferred separately with Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and left for Zagreb in the afternoon. Churkin is due to leave from Zagreb for Washington on Thursday to meet with U.S. President's special envoy Charles Redman. The new Russian initiative is in a way complementary with the U.S. initiative for the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its subsequent confederation with Croatia. The new Russian peace initiative indicates that Moscow has arrived at the conclusion that no overall political settlement is possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina without a solution for the krajina-Croatia issue. On the other hand, the United States considers the agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be of the utmost importance at this point. However, the agreement has completed only the first stage of the U.S. peace initiative. The second stage, that is, the reaching of an overall settlement for Bosnia- Herzegovina, will not be possible without the Bosnian Serbs and Russia. It remains to be seen how Washington intends to clear the way for the second stage of the peace initiative. It is aware that the initiative cannot be successful without the Bosnian Serbs and it is no doubt seriously counting on Russia to lend a helping hand. The announced Churkin-Redman talks should most likely be viewed in that light, and it would be no surprise if the special U.S. envoy was soon to visit Belgrade again.
