Chen Xitong said: Beijing's enterprise signed a cooperation contract with the Matsushita Company eight or nine years ago. Now the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company Limited has built three production lines and put its new product "Huawang" on the market. This shows that our cooperation has blossomed and has borne fruit. He said: Mr. Matsushita Konosuke died several months before the inauguration of the Beijing-Matsushita Company, which was very regrettable. However, he had great foresight to select such a man as Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi to carry on his unfulfilled wish. Chinese people have a good tradition of remembering all the friends who have helped us. When China is conducting reform and opening up today, we particularly need the cooperation of the friends in the world and are also very grateful to them. Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi expressed thanks for his appraisal. He said: This project in Beijing is merely the first step of the ideals of Mr. Matsushita Konosuke and it must succeed. Therefore, I have exerted my utmost efforts during my six-year stay in Beijing. The success should be attributed to the comprehensive support of Beijing Municipality and the selfless workers of the entire company. After the meeting, Chen Xitong gave a wall carpet bearing the drawing of the Great Wall and an album to Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi and his wife. Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, also met with Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi and his wife recently. Li Qiyan said: Today's development of the Beijing-Matsushita Color Kinescope Company Limited is the result of the concerted efforts of both sides. You are a very competent entrepreneur and we thank you for your contributions. After returning to your country, it is hoped that you will continue to publicize the friendly causes developed by China and Japan and draw more Japanese friends to Beijing to make investments and build plants. You and your wife are also welcome to visit Beijing anytime. Li Qiyan also presented a certificate of honor to Mr. Ninagawa Chikayoshi. Municipal leaders Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, Li Runwu, and Zhang Peng were present at the meetings.
