I came to express my respect for those who risk their lives in the defense of their ideals. I have said it: I agree with broad sectors of Chiapas society which believe the social demands that have been made are just. I also believe, however, just as broad sectors believe, that the path chosen has resulted in grief, pain, and sacrifice. I understand that the people of Chiapas must do something soon. We must do it right to work for reconciliation. We must make an effort to have peace with justice and to have the dignity that all people of Chiapas want. I am convinced that electoral campaigns -- I am not referring to mine, but to those of all parties -- must effectively aid the reconciliation. I believe this, and I have made my campaign a parallel path for reconciliation. Society must know that. Therefore, I urge all parties to put differences aside and make this campaign a crusade for peace. Let us make it an offensive for peace, like commissioner Manuel Camacho said. I think everyone, especially the parties, should do his share and do it well. We must work from the bottom up, adding not subtracting. I think that is the way to move closer to peace. The state's political conditions, which stem from ancestral, economic, and social problems, call for new rules. In Chiapas, we must turn our backs on the past, but not on all of the past. We must remember the best of it. We must be conservative. We must preserve our culture and old traditions. In Chiapas, especially in this region, where children do not attend school and where they die of hunger, where hundreds, perhaps thousands do not know how to read or write, we must think of realistic ways to build them a new future, a future that will guarantee them the right to be born and to live with dignity. We must build a future that guarantees health, development, education, housing, employment, and land, especially land, for them. In other words, we need to guarantee that everyone will have food tomorrow. How should we treat this land issue? How should we reconcile historical reason with the law? Chiapas has been a different Chiapas since 1 January. Many of us knew it, but many more just discovered this pluralistic society: We are several races; we are from several regions; we speak different languages; we have different climates; we have different temperaments; we have different religious beliefs. I believe the secret lies in how to direct this social energy toward building a common future; how to make all this strength, all this energy, a great social victory for the Chiapas people. I agree with those who say that Chiapas is a heck of a town to defeat. I think this new pact can be considered a proposal. It is like a method of discussion for finding agreements that will allow us to build our future. This is why I insist that we should make this political campaign a permanent debate. It should be a basis for finding that which unites us and rejecting that which separates us. This social pact must be implemented by society. To do this, I propose forming a pluralistic government. When I say pluralistic government, I am not just referring to a government with many parties in it. I am referring to a government that will unite its different religious, environmental, regional, political, economic, and social aspects. To do that, we need: - just laws, an autonomous judicial branch, an honest police force, and fair economic laws; - sustainable economic development. We must guarantee an economic system that will promote the welfare of the population without jeopardizing opportunities for future generations; - thorough social reform based on education to supply the necessary tools for finding jobs; - democracy based on legality and legitimacy. I offer a pluralistic government that will use Chiapas' best men, regardless of their party affiliation. I will not rule with my friends. All I need to form a new government is men who are honest, conscientious, and competent. Transition is a process. To implement it without problems, we must have a strong government, a government that cannot be short-termed. I propose a strong government, very strong; a government whose strength is based on the law, on what is right, on consensus, on legitimacy; a government based on the people's support and on pluralism.
