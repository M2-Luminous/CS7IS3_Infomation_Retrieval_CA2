FBIS4-41057 "drsov120_c_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Officials Address Duma Before 2d Vote Officials Address Duma Before 2d Vote LD2206141094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1315 GMT 22 Jun 94 LD2206141094 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The draft of the federal budget for 1994 failed to collect the necessary number of votes (225) for its confirmation during a repeated voting in the RF [Russian Federation] State Duma Wednesday. As many as 220 deputies voted for it, 46 - against, and 33 abstained from voting. A total of 299 deputies participated in the voting. A new voting on the draft has been scheduled for 16:00 [1200 GMT], until that time all factions of the lower chamber will discuss this issue. Addressing the deputies before the voting, chairman of the chamber's budget committee Mikhail Zadornov warned them that in the case that the budget is not adopted the government will be forced to present a draft decree on financing for the third and fourth quarters, as a result, the State Duma would be left without any opportunity to monitor the spending of state funds. The arguments of Fist Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Petrov, who declared that the government cannot receive a credit from the Central Bank of Russia without the adopted budget, apparently seemed unpersuasive to the members of the chamber. Without the loan the state will not be able to finance Russian regions this July or pay wages to state employees. Due to the delay in the adoption of the budget, he said, the government will have no opportunity to carry out the decree on increasing of the minimum wage which the State Duma is to consider this Wednesday. As many as 194 people voted for the adoption of the budget during the first voting, 57 - against, and 44 abstained from voting.
