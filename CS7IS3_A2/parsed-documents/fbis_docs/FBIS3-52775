The committee in its report has called for allowing the private sector and foreign companies in the insurance sector. But it has suggested certain controls for its efficient working in the new economic conditions. The 33-point recommendation submitted by the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Mr. R.N. Malhotra, has suggested that the private sector companies must have a minimum pay-back capital of 100 crore rupees and the promoter stage should not exceed 40 percent of the capital. The report said that if the foreign insurance companies were allowed, they should float Indian companies. The committee has recommended that LIC [Life Insurance Corporation] should be converted into a company registered under the Companies Act. The report says Postal Life Insurance should be permitted to transact life insurance business in the rural areas among the general public. The committee has recommended that the ownership pattern of the LIC, GIC [General Insurance Corporation] and its four subsidiary companies should be changed by reducing government share holding to 50 percent. It has also suggested that all insurance companies should be equally governed by the provisions of the Insurance Act. The committee was set up in April last year to examine the existing structure of the insurance industry and to suggest changes in light of the new economic policy.
