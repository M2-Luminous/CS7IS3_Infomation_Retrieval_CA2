He held a news conference in Vladivostok, at which he said that troops of the Pacific Border District were in a state of good combatreadiness. The inspectors had the opportunity to witness with their own eyes that the eastern border protected by the Pacific troops was still strong and secure -- the district's border guards detained 35 transgressors, uncovered and prevented 63 attempts to use counterfeit passports at border crossings, and seized a large contraband shipment of choice seafood delicacies, which domestic businessmen attempted to export to Japan illegally. The chairman of the inspection commission said: "We evaluated the situation in the border district strictly and impartially. Practically every aspect of the condition of the troops was examined, and in spite of the numerous problems, all troops and units of the district cope well with the goal of protecting the border, and the state of morale of the officers and personnel is praiseworthy."
