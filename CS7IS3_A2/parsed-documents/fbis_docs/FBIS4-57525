FBIS4-57525 "drlat098_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 17 May 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Cristiani on Onusal, Kidnappings, International Aid Cristiani on Onusal, Kidnappings, International Aid PA1905144994 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 17 May 94 PA1905144994 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU Spanish BFN [News conference by President Alfredo Cristiani with unidentified reporters on 17 May; place not given; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast -- recorded] [Text] [Cristiani] As long as compliance with parts of the peace agreements is pending, and because Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] is in charge of verifying compliance; it is only logical that it continue its work until the process is over, gradually reducing its activities in the final phase, as the UN secretary general has said. We believe the extension is normal in view of pending matters such as public security, the PNC [National Civilian Police], and the land transfer process, which will continue after 31 May. I believe the extension is necessary. [Reporter] We understand that the Onusal head will hold a high-level meeting on public security this week with the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] and the government. What specific public security issues will be discussed? Has that meeting taken place? [Cristiani] No, no, there has been no meeting. A preparatory process in under way to discuss preliminary issues. The most difficult points are discussed at the highest level. We are trying to redesign the PNC deployment --at least that is the government's position -- to avoid the vacuum of authority that could result from expediting one aspect of a joint process; that is, the deployment of one force and the demobilization of another. This was originally planned one way, so we must try to modify the plan so the next government [words indistinct] the deployment would take place differently. The objective is to provide security for citizens. [Reporter] How are the kidnapping investigations going, particularly in the western region? [Cristiani] The kidnappings have not been just in the western region. Recently three [words indistinct] have been involved in this type of activity in the eastern region, and there have also been cases in other parts of the country. The western region has been the most affected recently. We hope to continue [words indistinct]. [Reporter] Yesterday [word indistinct] said this could affect the financial [words indistinct]. Our country is reportedly among those which represent the highest risk for investors. [Cristiani] We are not among the countries with the highest investment risks. We are no longer in that category. We are now among countries where investment is not so risky. This is a problem of common crime that is not unique to El Salvador. Crime is a problem everywhere. We could say it is worse in Guatemala, and even Costa Rica is facing serious crime problems. The modus operandi of these extortions and kidnappings indicate that it is not a band of criminals specializing in such crimes but common criminals who think it is easy to blackmail a family by asking for large sums of money in exchange for the release of one of its members. I believe that as we increase the number of PNC agents, we will be able to fight crime more efficiently. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] involved in kidnappings? [Cristiani] There have been two cases. [Reporter] The UN secretary general said international aid is vital to the consolidation of the peace process. Do you agree that international aid is fundamental to the process in respect to public security and land transfers? [Cristiani] It is fundamental in the sense that the country lacks funds. Those programs can be implemented more quickly and without problems when the international community supports them. As for the land transfers, we think we have the necessary funds to complete that program. The PNC is responsible for public security, therefore the state is willing to continue providing the necessary funds for a public security body that meets our needs. [Reporter] Would you say that those who gave financial support to El Salvador [word indistinct] have abandoned the country in peacetime ? [Cristiani] I would not say that. Each country has its own problems. New needs are arising in the world so resources must be shared. East Europe, which has given up communism and is trying promote development, has received a great deal of support from industrialized nations.
