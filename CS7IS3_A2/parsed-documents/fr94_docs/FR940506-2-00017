FR940506-2-00017 FR940506-2-00007 [A&hyph;588&hyph;807] Industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From Japan; Termination of Circumvention Inquiry of Antidumping Duty Order AGENCY: International Trade Administration, Import Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of termination of circumvention inquiry of antidumping duty order. SUMMARY: On June 9, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Brecoflex Corporation (Brecoflex) for a circumvention inquiry of the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan with respect to imports by Mectrol Corporation (Mectrol). Pursuant to that request, the Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53706). The circumvention inquiry covers the period January 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. Based on a review of Brecoflex's submissions in conjunction with the International Trade Commission's (ITC) analysis of the manufacturing process for production of industrial power belts, the Department determines that Brecoflex does not have standing as a domestic producer of a like product to file the request in the instant inquiry. Therefore, we are terminating the circumvention inquiry. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Kimberley Huffman at (202) 482&hyph;0780 or Wendy Frankel at (202) 482&hyph;5253, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 14, 1989, the Department published the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan (54 FR 25314). On August 4, 1989, we published an amended order (54 FR 32104). On June 9, 1992, Brecoflex, who identified itself as a producer of a like product in the United States, alleged that the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan was being circumvented and requested that the Department investigate the matter. The Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993. In several submissions, Mectrol alleged that Brecoflex did not have standing to file a request for a circumvention inquiry. Therefore, on February 1, 1994, and February 28, 1994, the Department issued a standing questionnaire and supplemental standing questionnaire, respectively, to Brecoflex. Brecoflex responded to the standing questionnaires on February 17, 1994, and March 4, 1994. Analysis Standing To File a Request for a Circumvention Inquiry Section 353.29 of the Department's regulations states that ``[a]ny interested party, as defined in ยง353.2(k), may file'' a request for a circumvention inquiry (19 CFR 353.29). In its June 9, 1993, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a domestic producer of industrial power belts. The provision in the Department's regulations for standing as a producer is ยง353.2(k)(3) which includes in the definition of interested party ``[a] producer in the United States of the like product'' (19 CFR 353.2(k)(3)). Brecoflex's U.S. Operations In its June 9, 1992, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a producer in the United States of a like product as covered by the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan. Pursuant to questions raised by Mectrol concerning Brecoflex's standing to bring this request for a circumvention inquiry, the Department issued a standing questionnaire to Brecoflex. In its standing questionnaire response, Brecoflex explained its U.S. operations as follows. Brecoflex states that it imports from Germany polyurethane timing belts and performs secondary operations on these belts in its only United States facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. The secondary operations consist of the following: (1) Slitting of roll stock and truly endless belts to narrower belt widths; (2) Cutting roll stock to specific lengths; (3) Splicing and welding of open-ended roll stock to finished belts; (4) Attaching injection molded profiles to belt backs; and (5) Machining of finished belts such as edge grinding, removing sections of teeth, providing holes for joining belts in linear drives, and grinding of belt back. Brecoflex states that it fabricates, markets and sells three basic types of synchronous polyurethane timing belts that it considers to be subject merchandise. These belts include the Breco M, the Breco V, and the Brecoflex. Brecoflex performs the operations listed above on these three belts.
