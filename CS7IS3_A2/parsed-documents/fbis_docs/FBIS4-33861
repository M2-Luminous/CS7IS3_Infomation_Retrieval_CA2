Upon arriving at the medical center, a commando group intercepted the policemen escorting the inmates in an attempt to free them. A shootout ensued and, unfortunately, a student was shot and killed. Masin Chirino Serrano, 23, was a student at the Biology School of the University of Zulia. She died immediately. As a result of this death, university and secondary school students began demonstrations that turned into angry riots in the school of engineering, medicine, and sociology and on Cecilio Acosta and Delicias Avenues. The riots so far have resulted in eight private sector trucks being burned. The disturbances continued until this Friday afternoon when Zulia State Governor Lolita Anillar de Castro ordered the militarization of the unversity area. Fortunately, there is no report of any other student casualties. At this moment, however, students are still shouting slogans. [Begin recording of unidentified person] We have noticed that since this government took power, insecurity has increased in our region. How can it be that the police, instead of being in the neighborhoods fighting criminals, are here killing students who have something to offer the country? [end recording]
