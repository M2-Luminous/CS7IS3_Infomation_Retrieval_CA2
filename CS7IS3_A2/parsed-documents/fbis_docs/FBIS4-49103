However, the sluggish agriculture sector is faced with challenges in the course of rapid national economic development, according to economists. Last year saw the national economy develop at a speed of 13.4 percent compared to the previous year and the gross output value of agriculture grew by only four percent. Although the total grain output reached a record of 450 billion kg last year, most provinces in southern China, known as a "land of plenty", reported reductions in the output of grain, cotton and cash crops. "Agriculture is the source of the basic necessities of life, and the supply of farm products directly affects people's living standards and the stability of prices," said an economist here. "Once it fluctuates, people will face food problems and it will be difficult to construct a market economy," he added. Analysing the reasons why agriculture is developing too slowly, Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, acknowledged the government's inefficient input into agriculture, the price scissors between industrial and farm products, and poor education and imperfect basic management in rural areas. China has a total population of 1.2 billion, of whom 900 million live in the rural areas. Chinese leaders have time and again stressed the necessity for the consolidation of the foundation of agriculture, and called for ensuring the annual grain output to remain at or above 450 billion kg and cotton, 4.85 billion kg. Farmers incomes should increase at a rate of 5.8 percent annually, they say. To guarantee farm production, governments at different levels have adopted a package of policies. The government of Fujian Province, in southeast China, has encouraged industrial enterprises to support agriculture. Tong Wanheng, deputy governor, said, "The wider we open to the outside world, the more attention we should pay to grain production." To encourage farmers to grow more grain, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has made it known to increase grain purchase prices this year. Central China's Henan Province plans to invest 1.28 billion yuan in transforming low-yield farmland and building key irrigation projects this year, an increase of 11 percent over the previous year. Southwest China's Sichuan Province has sent some 10,000 agro-technicians to 30 grain production bases to offer technical consulting services and guide local farmers in scientific farming. "It is hard to image Sichuan, China's most populous province, lacking grain," Zhang Zhongwei, deputy governor of Sichuan in charge of agriculture, said. A survey shows that Chinese farmers so far have grown grain in 109.3 million ha [hectares], basically fulfilling the annual farming program. The rise of state cotton purchase prices has stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for cotton growing. In addition, the 500 state-designated marketable grain counties, 150 cotton-producing counties and a number of areas piloting in quality and efficient agriculture already have taken steps to promote scientific farming.
