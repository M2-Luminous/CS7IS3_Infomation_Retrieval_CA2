"To make our lives richer, we have to directly address the issue of rectifying the gap between domestic and overseas prices," he told a private advisory panel, urging it to come up with specific recommendations for that purpose. It is the 13th meeting for the panel, an advisory body on prices to the prime minister. The panel has 44 members, including economic experts and people in the industrial, labor, and consumer fields chosen to give their opinions on bringing down Japan's prices to international levels. Sources close to the panel say it remains to be seen what specific measures it will be able to recommend, since policies so far have been unable to tug domestic prices lower despite the appreciation of the yen. The panel is likely to base its discussions on a report compiled by a research committee that was set up last fall. Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa and other cabinet members also attended the meeting.
