Yet, in the first four months of 1994 we heard other "terrorist" explosions since 17 November, the "Revolutionary Peoples Struggle" [ELA] and their other kinsmen moved several times through the dark streets of Athens leaving their explosive identification mark. Since the beginning of the year, 17 November made its appearance three times, according to the evidence, and ELA five times. It may be noted that the organizations have not assumed responsibility for those attacks by issuing proclamations, but the ELA made telephone calls. This was a usual terrorist activity, not a drastic increase as originally thought, since during the same four-month period in 1993, 17 November struck seven times and ELA struck four. Almost the same applies in the case of ELA for the same four-month period in 1992--ELA acted five times while 17 November remained completely inactive. 17 November apparently suspended its activities in the first months of 1992 following the encounter with the police on Louizis Rankour Street. But by the end of 1992 it had acted four times, starting with the murder of Thanos Axarlian during the rocket attack against Yiannis Palaeokrassas. Was It a Failure? The officers of the antiterrorist units, assessing the "quality and quantity" of the various "strikes," observe that although the number of actions is approximately the same as those during the previous two years, there is indeed an increase after many months of "quietness." The bloody game of Greek terrorism does not stop. Let us not forget that 17 November started its season this year with the cold-blooded murder of Mikh. Vranopouloas. Later, it attacked two insurance companies, the American "Alico" which has been in the Greek marketplace and the Dutch "Nationale Nederlande" for 30 years. It was at that time that the failed rocket attack on the British carrier "Ark Royal" became known. It was noted that if the two rockets were launched from the Piraeus small lot and had hit the ship, the diplomatic and political consequences for our country would be hard to foretell. It would have been the organization's most spectacular strike. The policemen, however, have certain reservations and wonder whether the action did indeed fail. The two rockets were placed some 200 meters from the target, a distance which is an impediment to effectiveness, as shown by other strikes. Some imply that after the "easy and secure" strikes against the insurance companies, the organization sought to impress not only the Greek public opinion. The Targets Are "European" With the exception of "Alico," all the targets of 17 November and ELA had a purely European character. This is certainly related to the UN activities in the Balkans and the troubled area of Bosnia. If one should accept the theories which hold that the terrorist actions affect or are related to certain governmental actions at the diplomatic, political, social, and business level here and abroad, he will see the summit conference of the EU leaders, which will take place in approximately two months in Corfu. He will see the effort to attract foreign investors to Greece; the opening of the tourist period; the prime minister's visit to the United States; the treatment of Kurds in European countries such as Germany. It is assumed that the bomb attacks on the German [Company] "Miele" (by 17 November) in the building also housing the UN High Commissioner and on the Greek office on refugees which works with the UN (by ELA) are directly related to the Kurdish issue and its repercussions in Europe. These assessments come mostly from the political leadership of the Ministry of Public Order, not the "operational" echelons of the Greek police. As for the selection of the targets, the Attiki Security antiterrorist unit admitted indirectly that "it was almost taken by surprise." During the period with the largest number of terrorist actions, the major political issue was the reaction of the "productive classes" to the government-sponsored tax bill. Naturally, the police had taken extraordinary measures to guard the tax collection offices and state financial agencies, having in mind last year's avalanche of bombs and rockets against tax collection offices, as well as against tax collection officials' cars, especially directors. The discovery of the two rockets aimed at the British carrier gave an opportunity to assess 17 November's armory. Police officials believe that this organization has used up almost half of its rockets during 17 attacks with 2.36-inch and 3.5-inch antitank missiles stolen in December 1992 from the storage area of the Sykourio military camp in Larisa. The National Defense Ministry had reported at that time that the terrorists had stolen 60 to 65 rockets. They have now "used up" more than 30. The Others In a recent TV interview, Public Order Minister St. Papathemelis said that ELA is simply the tail of 17 November. This is nothing new since, for years now, the prevailing theory in the headquarters of the antiterrorist service is that of "communicating vessels" regarding the two major organizations. However, after a given action by ELA, we see other anarchist groups attacking party offices, state-owned cars, police officers, banks, and security services. These groups, known also as the stooges of the terrorists, apply the tactic of assuming responsibility for a given action by telephone. During recent years, 16 such groups have been active mainly in Athens but also in Salonica. Among those groups, we have the "Anarchist Group 15 May," "Rabid Anarchists," "Anarchists Beyond Detection," and others that gain their "revolutionary mantle" after a specific terrorist attack. Be that as it may, their bombs are not Easter firecrackers either.
