The firing by the terrorists on the home minister's caravan in Doda proves that the roots of terrorism are very deep in Jammu-Kashmir. Chavan, who visited Jammu and Doda, said that he felt the people there wanted to join the national mainstream, but are afraid to speak because of their fear of rifles. The central leaders have been making such statements continuously for the last three years. After their trips to Jammu-Kashmir, the central leaders always conclude that the people there do not support the terrorists, but are afraid of revenge and lack the courage to speak up. The question arises: Whose job is it to take away the guns that are aimed at these people's heads? Who is responsible for arresting the terrorists? If it is the government, then what is the use of making such statements? Do not government officials understand that they are sending the wrong message to the Kashmiri people by telling them we are helpless, and that we do want to help them, but are not strong enough to deal with the terrorists? The image that is presented to the world is that India has no influence here, and the people here want to get out of India. This is the image that Pakistan presents to Western and Muslim nations. The home minister said that the government is willing to talk with the Huriat Conference and other separatist groups on the condition that they give up violence and be prepared to talk according to the Indian Constitution. We do not know who the home minister is trying to fool. The groups that thrive on the belief of separatism and who believe in violence and military methods will not accept the home minister's condition and be prepared to commit suicide. Chavan said that the attractiveness of terrorism was increased because these youths were unemployed. Therefore, the government would increase opportunities for employment. This is also looking away from reality. Even if we grant that unemployment is a cause for increasing violence, how can we provide opportunities for employment in this atmosphere of violence and anarchy? In Jammu-Kashmir, especially in the Kashmir Valley, administration is in name only. All business is idle, and industrial production has stopped fully. Government and non-government offices do nominal work, and two years of education in schools and colleges is not completed even in five years. No industrialist is willing to invest money in the state. Even the home minister himself has admitted that foreign contractors responsible for building the hydroelectric project in Dulhasti have given up the project out of their fear of violence. In this atmosphere, what kind of miracle will Chavan, Rajesh Pilot, or Farooq Abdullah pull to create new jobs? The only miracle they can pull is to silence the guns of the terrorists. But the preliminary preparations the government should have made have never been done. The local and central police are in a precarious condition, while the terrorists have spread their communication network all over the state. In this situation, the security forces' efforts to rout the terrorists are like chasing their own shadows. Usually, innocent citizens suffer in these efforts. Until the central government gives up its much-abused cliches and forms an effective strategy to end the anarchy in Kashmir, it will not be able to get out of this mess, nor will it be able to show a path to the people. *
