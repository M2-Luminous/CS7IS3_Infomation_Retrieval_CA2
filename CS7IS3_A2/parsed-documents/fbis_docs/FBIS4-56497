In a statement over Signal FM, the two organizations denounce the latest measures being considered by the U.S. Government, involving the reinforcement of sanctions and possible armed intervention in Haiti. MOFFRAPH and AJEPOPOA ask the Haitian people to rise up against such decisions. [Begin unidentified MOFFRAPH spokeswoman recording, in Creole] MOFFRAPH is seeking independence and freedom. We prefer to stand up and die rather than kneel down and die. We are surprised to hear Americans will land on Haitian soil. So, we in MOFFRAPH urgently call on the parliamentarians to fill the presidential vacuum before they go on vacation. Courageous women, courageous men, it is time. MOFFRAPH says: Grenadiers, to the attack! [end recording]
