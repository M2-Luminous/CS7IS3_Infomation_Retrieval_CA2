Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane were interrogated in Dakar yesterday in connection with the 16 February riots that led to the death of eight persons including six policemen. Nothing filtered out of the hearing conducted by three examining magistrates as lawyers took refuge behind the confidentiality of judicial inquiry. Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS] and Landing Savane, secretary general of the African Party for Democracy and Socialism were marched back to their prison cells after the hearing. They were charged with breach of internal state security. Four other accused persons, Boka Kane, PDS deputy and Pap Malik Sy, second in command of the banned Dayira Moustarchidine Wal Moustarchidate Muslim youth organization were also heard and kept in detention. The Senegalese Government believes Wade and Landing Savane's responsibility is clearly established. This was stated by Abdoulaye Elimane Kane, Senegal's communication minister and government spokesman, who is currently visiting Paris where our Paris correspondent, Mohamed Issoufou Saliou, met him. [Begin Kane recording] Since the docket is already before court, the public prosecutor will have the task of proving their responsibility and the defense counselors will have to prove the contrary if they can. However, the Senegalese Government is convinced today that the incidents occurred during a protest march that was indeed unauthorized and that they resulted in frightful killings, material damage, and demonstrated a clear intention to endanger the Republican institutions. There is no doubt about this viewpoint because one can verify from all newspapers published after the incidents, including private independent newspapers, that it was the organizers who gave the order for the protest march to begin, and it is quite clear that they did not take any measures to forestall the consequences of the protest march. The rest is purely technical. I tell you that the state attorney general upholds the view that they were effectively caught in the act. [end recording]
