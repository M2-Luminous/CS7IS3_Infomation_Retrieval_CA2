"Up until yesterday, all we learned was that there was unusual movement of Cameroonian troops toward the Nigerian border," General Fred Chijuka, spokesman of the Defense Headquarters, told AFP. Gen. Chijuka, however, remarked that the movement of the Cameroonian troops does not necessarily mean that they have come "into contact" with Nigerian troops. "They are probably moving their troops closer to the border just in case hostilities break out," he said. Nigeria and Cameroon, which are claiming ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, a 1,000-square-km zone rich in fish and oil, have stationed their troops at their borders.
