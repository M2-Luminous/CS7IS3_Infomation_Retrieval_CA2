FR940706-2-00130 FR940706-2-00077 [Docket No. 72&hyph;2] Virginia Electric and Power Co. Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM&hyph;2501 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501 held by Virginia Electric and Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Surry ISFSI, located in Surry County, Virginia. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance. The amendment revises the Technical Specifications making procedural changes to spent fuel characteristics for the CASTOR V/21 cask and allows use of the CASTOR X/33 cask at the site. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling, and storage safety. They are procedural in nature and result in a change in process operations and equipment that does not alter the scope and type of operations presently authorized. The safety evaluation for this amendment demonstrates that the accident consequences for the analyzed design basis accidents remain negligible. There is reasonable assurance that the public health and safety will remain protected by activities authorized under this amendment and that the environmental impact will remain insignificant. The applications for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance of the amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applications for amendment dated December 23, 1988, May 3, 1991, and November 19, 1993, and (2) Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501, and (3) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated June 29, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC., and at the Local Public Document Room at the Swem Library, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, 23185. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 29th day of June, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Charles J. Haughney, Chief, Storage and Transport Systems Branch Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NMSS.
