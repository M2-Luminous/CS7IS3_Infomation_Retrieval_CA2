In some villages near the center of the oblast, outbreaks of an especially dangerous and infectious disease -- swine plague [chuma sviney] -- have been recorded. This is an unusual incident, because the disease wipes out pigs of any breed and any age. The (?greatest) danger is posed by the meat of the infected pigs, which are being slaughtered. Their meat may only be safely used after thermal processing and even then, only for preparing stewed sausages and canned meat. The Brest Rayon Executive Committee has imposed a quarantine in all infected regions. During this quarantine, all exports and imports of pigs, as well as the grazing of cattle at collective farms, are forbidden; transportation movement is also limited. Other regions of the oblast are also alarmed; free, large-scale swine vaccination campaigns are already being implement in those areas.
