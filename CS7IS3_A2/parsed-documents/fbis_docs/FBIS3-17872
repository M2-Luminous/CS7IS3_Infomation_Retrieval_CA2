In response to an ITAR-TASS question about his meeting with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, Shumeyko remarked that such meetings are held periodically when the president needs to discuss some matters with law-makers. The Federation Council speaker is confident that the houses of parliament "should not be used as an instrument of the struggle for power." There is no sense in parliament's decision-making "for decision's sake". Decisions made at the state level should be complied with, Shumeyko stressed, adding that it is easier to coordinate matters at the very first level of the decision making process. "Boris Yeltsin did not make any recommendations to the Federation Council," Shumeyko specified. Touching upon the notorious coup scenarios, Shumeyko described them as an "attempt to undermine the situation in the country in order to catch fish in troubled waters." He believes that the situation in Russia is now stable enough, and that attempts to upset it by such methods look ridiculous and won't pan out.
