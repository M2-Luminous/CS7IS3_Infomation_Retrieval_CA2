Canal from the "NTC News" newscast] [Text] Among the gringo workers who arrived at Juanchaco, there are professors whose speciality is not included in the education program of the small school they are building. The U.S. troops did not come to Colombia only to build civilian facilities; they have also gone into areas of conflict to conduct military training. [Begin General Octavio Gnecco, Naval Infantry commander, recording] They have sent several U.S. Marines as temporary instructors, especially in river combat techniques. [end recording] Several training exercises have already been held at a base called Barranco, located in Guaviare. The foreign military personnel, together with several engineers, have arrived with their weapons in the area. Just as in the Malaga Bay and Puerto Lopez areas, the military have been sent by the United States to help the Colombian Navy build several facilities. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Have those instructors also given antiguerrilla courses in Colombia? [Gnecco] Yes, on several occasions. Based on a U.S. Army offer, we held a one-month training course for our troops in San Jose del Guaviare. [end recording] This type of military training has also been given in Puerto Legizamo and, according to the Colombian Navy, is also part of the cooperation agreement with the United States. What we do not know is, as is happening in other parts of Colombia, military advisers are also arriving, and not as professors of the school they are going to build in the Malaga Bay area.
