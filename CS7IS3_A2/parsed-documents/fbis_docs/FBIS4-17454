The movement toward a market economy is to be speeded up by privatizing trade, opening up joint-stock companies to outsiders, and granting hard currency loans to private importers, Uzbekistan's Deputy Prime Minister Utkur T. Sultanov said at the Hanover trade fair today. At the first German-Uzbek economic convention he explained further aspects of his government's reform package. Trading and service companies will in the future be sold at a new stock exchange which is to be established. Foreigners who acquire more than 50 percent of a company and manufacture consumer goods will be exempt from taxes for five years. The planned Uzbekinvest insurance company is to insure foreign investment in the future. There are also plans to abolish import duties from July 1995. The economic convention was organized by the German Business East-West Trade Committee together with German industry's cooperation office. The convention's central topic was barter trade.
