The Renamo leader said he is ready to take over power, but he will accept remaining in opposition. Our correspondent in Maputo, Fernando Magalhaes, met Renamo's shadow cabinet: [Magalhaes] This is Renamo's first shadow cabinet and Afonso Dhlakama introduced it to us: [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] This is Minister for Internal Administration Albino Faife. This is Agostinho Murrial, information minister. This is Minister of Agriculture Paris [Raul] Baza. [end recording] [Magalhaes] He also introduced us to the recently appointed aides of provincial governors. This will be a way of sharing regional government that many Frelimo people fear will paralyze its government. [Begin recording] [Magalhaes] Will this shadow government dynamize or paralyze the country's activities? [Dhlakama] It will dynamize them. It will help the reintegration and reunification of the country. [Magalhaes] The appointment of the aides was decided at the first Dhlakama-Chissano summit, which took place in Maputo on 3 September 1993. Maybe this is the beginning of a government of reconciliation which the international community wants to see still before the elections. Do you hope to win the elections? [Dhlakama] Well. [Magalhaes] Or do you hope to win the next? [Dhlakama] Well, I want to make it clear that I did not fight for power but rather, I fought for democracy and freedom and I have already won. We will have to see whether I will win the elections or not. We will have to see. I have hope that the results will be good. [end recording]
