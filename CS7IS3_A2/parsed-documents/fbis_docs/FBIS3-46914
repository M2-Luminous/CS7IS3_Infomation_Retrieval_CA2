Discussing the issue of further revising political reform bills in the House of Councillors, Murayama showed a positive stance on a recent proposal, saying: "The proposal that proportional representation seats should be decided on a prefectural basis is worth studying." However, he took an uncompromising attitude on ways to reallocate seats for single-seat constituencies and proportional representation and to handle political donations by companies and other organizations. He stressed: "If we adopt loose rules on them, it will decrease the significance of efforts to prevent political corruption and to achieve political reform. We should leave these key points untouched." He added: "If there is a portion on which political parties cannot reach an agreement, a vote should be taken. That is the only alternative." Concerning the possibility of the dissolution of the House of Representatives for the general election following a failure to enact the political reform bills in the extended Diet session, Hata said: "It may be good for political parties to contend in the election for their policies." But he was negative about dissolving the house, saying: "It is not time to dissolve the lower house since there are many issues to be tackled." As for the issue concerning whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should take political responsibility if he fails to have the political reform bills adopted, Hata said: "The prime minister is making sincere efforts for the reform. And yet, can you hold him responsible for failing to achieve reform? The public will ask each Diet member to take responsibility." Meanwhile, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the cabinet will be held responsible for it. We should make as much effort as possible to avoid the dissolution of the House. But if the bills should be scrapped, it is possible the government will ask people's judgment on the bills." While stressing that the SDPJ would work for the passage of all four political reform bills, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the Diet itself will be held responsible for the failure of political reform. It may as well try to at least pass the bill on the prevention of political corruption to live up to the people's expectations. This is one option." In this way, Murayama indicated that if it were impossible to enact all four bills, it might be necessary to separate the bill on the prevention of corruption from the others to have it enacted.
