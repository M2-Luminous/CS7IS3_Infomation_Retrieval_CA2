These are the results of a survey conducted by CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] for the weekly PANORAMA. A sample of 2,400 voters was tested in the four constituencies cited on 21 and 22 February, with results allowing for a margin of error of more or less 4 percent. More specifically, progressive candidate Luigi Spaventa won 23 percent of the vote in Rome, followed closely by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi with 22 percent of the vote. Center candidate Alberto Michelini got 11 percent. In Milan, the survey predicts that Bossi can muster 32 percent of the vote, well ahead of the progressive Bassani, whose share of the vote was 17 percent. Center candidate Gianni Rivera got 11 percent, and MSI [Italian Social movement] member La Russa 8 percent. In Naples, support for Alessandra Mussolini was at 30 percent, whereas her direct progressive rival, Maria Fortuna, won 19 percent of the vote. Finally, in Bologna the winner was Achille Occhetto (27 percent), well ahead of right-wing coalition candidate Pierferdinando Casini (15 percent). The third place was taken by [Radical] Pannella-list candidate Olivero Toscani, with 8 percent of the vote. The CIRM survey confirmed the national percentage of the "undecided," estimated at 28 percent. This percentage, however, was much higher in the four constituencies in question: In Naples, 45 percent of the voters had not yet made up their minds, in Rome 43 percent, and in Bologna 37 percent. Only in Milan was the percentage of the undecided equal to the national average, namely, 28 percent.
