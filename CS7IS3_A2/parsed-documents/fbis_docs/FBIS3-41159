The proposed hard-hitting anti-drug legislation, which is designed to give "teeth" to the existing Dangerous Drugs Act 1991 will give powers to Police, Customs and Coast Guard officers to seize cash being imported or exported; to stop, board, search, detain, or divert ships; to arrest without warrant; and to appoint civilians to assist with drug busts at sea. The Bill was laid quietly in the Senate on Monday while the Upper House was engaged in debate on the Petrotrin merger and in the Lower House on Friday during the Budget Debate. A limited number of copies was distributed only to members of both Houses. The Bill is closely patterned after the British Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which was specially drafted to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the 1988 United Nations (Vienna) Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Even so, a few sections which are important for the investigation of money laundering activities in the UK have been omitted from the local Bill. The proposed amendments would improve on existing legislation by expressly making money laundering an offence--laundering one's own drug money is still legal in this country according to the 1991 Act. The Government hopes that new laws would remove existing impediments to the prosecution of drug offenders, and cure deficiencies related to the confiscation and forfeiture (by local and foreign courts) of the proceeds of drug trafficking. If accepted and passed by the required special majority of three-fifths of the members of each House, the Bill could prove to be a major tool in the war against financiers and beneficiaries of the drug trade. It makes extensive provisions for the execution of confiscation orders, whether made by local or foreign courts. This is hoped to reap heavy financial benefits from nationals convicted of drug trafficking in foreign countries. It provides for onward extradition, in which a person's return to a foreign territory shall not be debarred only because the person will be sent from that territory to another, to stand trial for an offence. This clause attempts to rectify a deficiency in existing law which led to the freeing of three Trinidadians in 1986, after attempts to have them extradited to England failed because they were really wanted in connection with a heroin-trafficking operation in the Golden Triangle. An offence of conspiracy to commit drug-related offences has been created under the proposed legislation. Any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any offence under the Act would also be guilty of an offence and is to be liable on conviction to the same penalty as the principal offender. The proposed Bill targets those who work for drug barons by laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking, with intent to help the trafficker to elude prosecution for a drug trafficking offence, or avoid the enforcement of a confiscation order in respect of his illegally acquired proceeds. It provides for the prosecution of those who conceal or disguise property derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking. Anyone who converts, transfers or disposes of that property, or removes it from the jurisdiction to assist the trafficker, is also guilty of an offence and can be fined between $50,000 and $100,000 and imprisoned for five to 10 years. Unlike the British Act, however, the local Bill does not make the concealing of information (or providing false information) about money laundering an offence. Under the British Act, references to concealing or disguising property include references to concealing or disguising the nature, source, location, disposition, movement or ownership or any rights with respect to the "laundered" property. The local Bill provides a kind of amnesty for professionals (bankers and attorneys, for example) involved in laundering money for traffickers if they voluntarily disclose information about the illegal activity. This is subject to conditions that the disclosure is made before the act is done and the act is done with the consent of a police officer, or the disclosure is made after he does the act, but on his initiative and as soon as it is reasonable for him to make it. The local Bill also makes it an offence for a person to receive, possess or convert money or property, knowing that such money or property was derived from drug trafficking activities. This clause targets those who provide services or goods which are of assistance to the trafficker in his illegal activities; or those who knowingly purchase property for "next to nothing" or accept gifts from drug barons. It is a defence under the Bill to prove that the property was acquired for adequate consideration (equal to the market value of the property). One of the more far-reaching clauses gives a Customs or Police officer the authority to seize and detain any cash being imported or exported, if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of, or is intended to be used in any drug transaction. This clause seeks to trap hundreds of people who pass through the airports and other ports each year, carrying large sums of local and foreign currency. In previous years, anyone found carrying cash exceeding limits stipulated by Central Bank's foreign exchange policy, could have been arrested and charged under the Customs Act. But since the dollar was floated in April this year, law enforcement officers have had no jurisdiction to even question the origin of huge sums of currency. Under the proposed laws, seized cash can be held for an initial 48-hour period, but its continued detention can be authorised by a magistrate. The detention order can only last for three months at a time, but can be renewed and have effect for up to two years once the magistrate is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion that the money is drug-related and that the detention is justified while the origin or derivation of the cash is further investigated.
