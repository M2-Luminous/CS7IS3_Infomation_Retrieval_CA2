The government delegation left Luanda this afternoon. Our correspondent was at the airport and spoke to Faustino Muteka, head of the government delegation. He did not disclose anything new. [Begin recording] [Muteka] We are negotiating. It has been agreed that there should be discretion. So, I would not like to hinder the talks in any way. [Reporter] If it depended on the government delegation, how long it would take to find a settlement? [Muteka] If the other side adopts an unwavering attitude, we will need more time to study ways of reaching consensus and signing an accord. [Reporter] Does the government delegation has enough powers so that it will not need to return to Luanda to receive new instructions? [Muteka] It is not like that. The government team has full powers. It is the government delegation... [Reporter, interrupting] Is there any consensus? [Muteka] We must discuss any new developments with the government.
