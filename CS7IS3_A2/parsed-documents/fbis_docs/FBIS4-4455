Meanwhile, Cambodia does not have any law to protect bank credits. Therefore, operations in that country are rather risky. Banthun noted that current measures applied by the government to control the amount of loans are incompatible with the free trade market system. In other words, the measures are impractical because the demand for bank loans in Thailand is still high. Banthun said: "In implementing the state bank's policy of increasing the baht's role in this region, the open market mechanism -- that is, interest rates -- must be allowed to control the demand for bank loans completely." He indicated that the amount of trade among countries in the region will determine the expansion of the baht's role. The baht is, however, widely used as a medium of exchange in Laos. The Thai Farmers Bank will continue to make loans in neighboring countries provided it does not have to assume too much risk. The managing director of the Thai Farmers Bank said the countries in which the baht is well recognized are Laos, Burma, and southern China, because they are engaging in the quadrangle economic development scheme. But the baht's access to Cambodia is hindered by the lack of legal support in that country. Banthun said: "The baht has bright prospects in the quadrangle economic zone. It will be used as a common medium of trade by all parties participating in the development scheme.
