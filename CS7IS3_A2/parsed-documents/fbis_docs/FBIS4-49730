Twenty six XUARCPCDIC members attended the meeting. [passage omitted] The XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee presided over the meeting. The plenary session approved the report [entitled] "More Effectively Launch the Anticorruption Drive in Depth and Over a Protracted Period of Time to Serve the Needs of Xinjiang's Reform, Development, and Stability" delivered by Comrade Zhou Shengtao, secretary of the XUARCPCDIC, on behalf of the XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee. Comrade Abulaiti Abudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional government, delivered an important speech at the plenary session. Principal leaders of all major leading bodies attended the meeting. Comrade Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, attended the meeting and delivered a concluding speech. The plenary session conscientiously studied and discussed Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and the guidelines adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. Those who attended the plenary session unanimously believed that Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech was very profound, that it was very apparent it was directed against those who are corrupt and has a strong significance of serving as our guideline, that the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was a very important meeting which mobilized all concerned to more effectively launch the anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of time and drew up a plan for launching the drive. The plenary session reviewed and summed up the implementation of the central authorities' decision on the anticorruption drive by the party committees and governments at all levels since the Fifth Plenary Session of the XUARCPCDIC. It pointed out: The party committees and governments at all levels have adopted a resolute attitude, taken prompt actions, and have done a large amount of work in implementing the party Central Committee's and the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Tackling a Few Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future" since August 1993. The vast numbers of cadres and the masses have wholeheartedly supported and taken active part in the work. Cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels have scrupulously done their duties and worked hard. After more than half a year's efforts, we have achieved preliminary successes in the anticorruption drive and scored achievements, to various extents, in fulfilling the three tasks proposed by the central authorities. Some other negative phenomena and corruption have been somewhat curbed. Generally speaking, the momentum of the anticorruption drive is good; its progress is healthy; it has basically met the requirements desired by the central authorities and the autonomous regional party committee and it has played a better role in maintaining Xinjiang's political stability, promoting its reform and opening up, and protecting its economic development. The plenary session maintained that the progress of the anticorruption work is still unbalanced, that some successes have not been consolidated, that we must be aware that negative phenomena and corruption are still serious while realistically affirming the successes achieved by the anticorruption drive in the earlier phase, that it is necessary for us to continue to work hard, and that by no means can we afford to slacken our efforts in the slightest degree. The plenary session maintained that the anticorruption drive is a test for leading cadres of the party and government organs at all levels and a tempering process for the vast numbers of cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory organs. In the course of practice, they will deepen their understanding of the party Central Committee's important decision on the anticorruption drive and explore and amplify some effective measures for launching the anticorruption drive, such as focusing attention on conducting ideological education to seek unity of thinking and to enhance consciousness of and strengthen resolve in the anticorruption drive; strengthening leadership and practically seeing to the implementation of the three tasks; strictly having a good grasp of policies, and subordinating oneself to and serving the needs of economic construction; insisting on proceeding from facts and solving whatever problems that exist to let the masses of the people really benefit from the success achieved in the anticorruption drive; and dealing with corruption by looking into both its root cause and symptoms, establishing and perfecting rules, regulations, and a restrictive mechanism through supervision, and consolidating the successes achieved in the anticorruption drive. We must continue to persist in these effective measures and gradually amplify them. The plenary session pointed out that 1994 is a crucial year for us to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to realize the shift of our economic structure to a new orbit. It is also a crucial year in which we face heavy tasks and a rigorous test in our anticorruption drive. We must keep in mind the overall situation of the whole party's work when launching the anticorruption drive; continue to conscientiously implement the decisions and opinions of the central authorities and the autonomous regional party committee on the anticorruption drive; consolidate and amplify our successes in the anticorruption drive achieved in the earlier phase; and more effectively carry on the anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of time. [passage omitted] The plenary session called on discipline inspection and supervisory organs to step up supervision over law enforcement to guarantee the smooth transmission of government decrees by revolving their attention around the implementation of the important policies and measures adopted by the party Central Committee, the State Council, the autonomous regional party committee, and the autonomous regional people's government on deepening reform, developing the economy, and maintaining stability. [passage omitted] The plenary session emphatically pointed out that the key to more effectively launch the anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of time lies in improving the understanding of leading cadres at all levels to seek unity of thinking. Leaders at all levels must take the lead to practice honesty and exercise self-discipline in compliance with the demand set by the central authorities on further consolidating an developing the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses of the people. The party committees and governments at all levels must adhere to the strategic principle of "grasping two links at the same time and taking a tough stand on both," place the anticorruption work top on their agenda, and practically strengthen leadership. Principal leading comrades of the party and government must personally handle the work and take steps to solve major problems. [passage omitted] Discipline inspection and supervisory organs are required to further adhere to the party's basic line; to closely revolve their efforts around the central task of economic construction; to subordinate themselves to and serve the guidelines on the overall situation of the whole party's work; to conduct discipline inspection and supervision amid the efforts to promote reform, development, and stability; and to create a favorable environment for Xinjiang to deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability through the fulfillment of all their discipline inspection and supervision duties so as to expedite the autonomous region's rapid and highly efficient economic development. [passage omitted] It is necessary to have discipline inspection and supervisory organs further strengthen the building of the rank and file of their own cadres. Cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory organs are required to conduct intensive study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," to arm their minds with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to use them as a guidance for their work. They must go deep into the realities of life to conduct survey, study the knowledge about a socialist market economy, enhance their political integrity, and improve their professional competence. It is necessary to strengthen the building of the leading groups of discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels and to bring into play the functions of discipline inspection and supervision in a better way so as to promote the work to a new level. The plenary session firmly believed the party committees and governments at levels will surely be able to achieve new phased successes in carrying out this year's anticorruption work so long as they resolutely implement the central authorities' decision on anticorruption, reach a common understanding, practically strengthen leadership, fully rely on the masses, and pay close attention to the implementation of various tasks. The plenary session called on the vast numbers of party members and cadres in the whole region to conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, to surmount all difficulties and obstacles and steadfastly launch the anticorruption drive in accordance with the plan and requirements of the autonomous regional party committee and in the spirit of doing concrete work with perseverance, and to make new contributions to maintaining political stability, guaranteeing [the progress] of reform and opening up, and promoting economic development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line.
