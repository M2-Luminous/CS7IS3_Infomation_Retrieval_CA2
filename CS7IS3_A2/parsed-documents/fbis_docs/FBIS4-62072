This is very important for the Cabinet of Ministers," Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said during the opening of today's meeting of the Russian Government's Presidium, assessing the Duma's approval of the 1944 federal budget in first reading. "We met with the Duma's understanding and I believe this was due to our common realisation that the fate of the country was being decided," Chernomyrdin stressed. "We shall base the joint budgetary work of ministers and lawmakers on methods of conviction," he added. According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma's preliminary approval of the budget laid the beginning for "concrete, painstaking work, in which the government will persistently uphold its viewpoint after taking into account everything that it had missed or overlooked". The head of the Russian Government said that the budget financing of the defence complex was a most important problem. "Be what it may, we shall back the military-industrial complex and this refers to all its ministries and departments, including the Russian military science. As to the defence order, it is necessary to balance it out, after seeing what we have on hand this year and without exaggerating or hushing up problems," Chernomyrdin noted.
