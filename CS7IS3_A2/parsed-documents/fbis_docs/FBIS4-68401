Trade between Finland and Russia last year again rose above its 1991 level, and Finnish exports to the East consisted mainly of machinery, equipment, and means of transportation. Those exports exceeded 6 billion markkas in value and accounted for a total of 4.5 percent of our foreign trade. For its part, the value of Finnish imports from Russia was close to 8 billion markkas. Exports of machinery and equipment to Russia were twice what they were the year before, accounting in total for nearly half of Finnish exports. The most important single export items were telephone and radio sets. Food exports to Russia tripled last year, and one-fourth of all Finnish food exports go to Russia. Beverage and food exports exceeded 1 billion markkas last year, and nearly one-fifth of those exports consisted of fruit and vegetables. The slowest growth last year was recorded by the textile and garment industry. Clothing purchases for Russia totaled just over 120 million markkas, while shoes accounted for nearly 110 million markkas. Energy continues to dominate Finnish imports from Russia, although petroleum quantities are below the levels achieved during the peak years in the late 1980's. Petroleum imports last year were at the same level as in 1992: approximately 3 billion metric tons, or about one-third of total imports. Imports of natural gas have increased and account for one-fifth of total imports, while coal stands just under 5 percent and direct electric current accounts for nearly 10 percent of imports. Timber accounts for over 10 percent of total imports. Timber imports, mostly in the form of logs, are rising steadily.
