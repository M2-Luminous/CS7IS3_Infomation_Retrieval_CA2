In his New Year address the great leader President Kim Il-song set forth a task to decisively increase production by making effective use of the existing production foundation and creating production capacity still more in the coal industrial sector which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy. In several days of the New Year alone coal miners in different parts increased results of capital tunnelling 1.2 times, preparatory tunnelling 1.3 times, test drilling 1.4 times and coal production 1.2 times, compared with the corresponding time of the previous month. The Anju District coal mining complex is overfulfilling its daily plan by more than 7 percent these days by operating mining equipment at full capacity. The Sunchon District coal mining complex which last year tunnelled over 7,000 metres more than the previous year has given definite precedence to tunnelling from the beginning of the year. The Sinchang coal mine of the complex has carried out its daily tunnelling plan at 130 percent in the New Year up until now. The Tokchon and Pukchang District coal mining complexes have secured new reserve cutting faces and augmented the utility rate of mining equipment to boost coal production to a high level. Especially, the Chenam coal mine of the Pukchang District coal mining complex this year set itself a goal of increasing coal production 50 percent up on last year and is conducting a vigorous high-speed tunnelling drive. The coal miners there last year produced 120,000 more tons of coal than the previous year through the introduction of a belt conveyer line in transport and modernization of mining equipment. The South Hamgyong Provincial, Saeppyol, Onsong, Myongchon and Kangwon Provincial district coal mining complexes are fulfilling their daily plans at 120 to 130 percent by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. New coal mines and pits are under construction vigorously in Anju, Sunchon and Pukchang areas and North Hamgyong Province which have rich deposits and good mining conditions.
