FR940816-1-00053 FR940816-1-00009 10. Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Indian Reservation, Fort Thompson, South Dakota The Crow Creek Indian Reservation has a checkerboard pattern of land ownership, with much of the land owned by non-Indians. Up until the 1993&hyph;94 season, the tribe observed the waterfowl hunting regulations established by the State of South Dakota. However, the tribe is continuing to develop a wildlife management program, and in a proposal dated June 13, 1994, requested that it set its own 1994&hyph;95 special waterfowl hunting regulations as it did for the 1993&hyph;94 hunting season. These regulations would be in accordance with Federal guidelines and independent of the State of South Dakota seasons. The tribe would have a later, continuous duck season, beginning on October 29 and ending on December 11, 1994, and the same daily bag and possession limits permitted by final Federal frameworks, to be announced. The requested hunting season dates would probably not be within Federal frameworks. The season and bag limits would be essentially the same as last year, and harvest is again expected to be low because of the small number of hunters. Estimated harvest, based on hunter reports, for ducks last season was about 67, including 59 mallards. The tribe states there may be an increase in the success of duck hunters in the 1994&hyph;95 season due to the shift in season dates. The tribe requested that the goose hunting season begin on October 9, 1994, and extend through January 1, 1995. The daily bag and possession limits would be those permitted by final Federal frameworks, to be announced. Harvest for last season has been estimated at about 203, of which 191 were Canada geese. This harvest level is less than half of the estimated harvest for the previous hunting season. Harvest for this coming seasoning should be approximately the same as last season. The Service proposes to approve the tribal requests for duck and goose hunting regulations. In the past, the duck regulations have been continued on an experimental basis; the Service now considers these regulations to be operational. However, as with all other groups, the Service asks that the tribe continue to survey and report the harvest. 11. Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Reservation, Lower Brule, South Dakota For the first time, in the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird seasons, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Service are cooperating to establish regulations for the Lower Brule Reservation. The Lower Brule Reservation is about 214,000 acres in size and is located on and adjacent to the Missouri River, south of Pierre. Land ownership on the reservation is mixed, however, the Lower Brule Tribe currently has full management authority. On-reservation management authority over fish and wildlife was established for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe via a MOA with the State of South Dakota, dated October 24, 1986. This MOA will continue until settled by the court. The MOA provides the tribe jurisdiction over fish and wildlife on reservation lands, including deeded and Corps of Engineers taken lands. Recent meetings between the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks and the Service have yielded consensus on the implementation of this Agreement for the 1994&hyph;95 season. This will allow the public a clear understanding of the Lower Brule Sioux Wildlife Department license requirements and regulations. The Lower Brule Reservation waterfowl season is open to tribal and non-tribal hunters alike. For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is proposing a duck season length of 51 days, which would run from October 14 through December 3. The daily bag limit would be 4 ducks, which could include 4 mallards but no more than 1 hen mallard. The goose season would run from October 14 through December 31, with daily bag limits of 2 Canadas or 2 white-fronted geese, or 2 in the aggregate. The daily bag limit for snow geese would be 10. Possession limits for the above would be twice the daily bag limits. For the 1993&hyph;94 season, calculations set the duck harvest at 136, primarily mallards, and the goose harvest at 3,654, virtually all Canada geese. With these proposed regulations, the duck harvest is anticipated to increase by 90 and the goose harvest by 500. Estimates of increase are based on conditions in 1994&hyph;95 being the same or similar to the flight conditions in 1993&hyph;94. All basic Federal regulations contained in 50 CFR Part 20, including the use of steel shot, Migratory Waterfowl Hunting and Conservation Stamp, etc., would be observed. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe has an official Conservation Code that was established by Tribal Council Resolution on June 1982. The Service proposes to approve the regulations set out here for the Lower Brule Reservation, provided the Service and the tribe can come to agreement on restrictions relative to species of concern, e.g., wood ducks, redheads, canvasbacks, hooded mergansers and pintails. 12. Yankton Sioux Tribe, Marty, South Dakota On May 31, 1994, the Yankton Sioux Tribe submitted a waterfowl hunting proposal for the 1994&hyph;95 season. The Yankton Sioux tribal waterfowl hunting season would be open to both tribal members and nonmembers. The waterfowl hunting regulations to be established by this proposal would apply to tribal and trust lands within the external boundaries of the reservation. The duck (including mergansers) and coot hunting regulations proposed by the Yankton Sioux Tribe, including seasons and bag limits, are as follows: Season limits would be October 29 to December 6, 1994. The possession limits for ducks and coots would be twice the daily bag limits, with only double the species restrictions. Daily bag limits would be 4 for ducks and 15 for coots. For ducks, the daily bag limit would include only 3 mallards (of which only 1 may be a hen), 1 redhead, 1 pintail, 2 wood ducks, 1 canvasback and 1 hooded merganser. Swan season and bag limits would follow those set by the State of South Dakota, for both tribal and nontribal hunters.
