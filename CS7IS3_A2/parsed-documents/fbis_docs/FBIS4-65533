With all the criticism of the Community's pragmatic step-by-step course, one tends to forget the economic and political success of integration. A military confrontation in Western Europe is unthinkable today. "The tragedy in ex-Yugoslavia is dramatic evidence of this," the chancellor emphasized. Vranitzky said that Austria's specific contributions after joining the EU will be its commitment for Central and Eastern Europe, as well as some impulses in environmental policy. The transit agreement is a milestone on the way toward an ecological transport policy. Austria will also show a strong commitment in social affairs. The deepening of integration and enlargement do not contradict each other; these are just two sides of the same coin. "The challenges of the next few decades -- preserving European competitiveness, protecting jobs, preventing environmental disasters, stabilizing Eastern Europe, and reacting jointly to the pressures of migration -- could hardly have been tackled by the original six European Community members alone." The fear that in coping with these tasks, Austria is part of a "North European bloc," is unfounded. "We have applied for membership in a Union that represents all of Europe." Austria's traditional role of mediator and its ability to reach a consensus are helpful in this.
