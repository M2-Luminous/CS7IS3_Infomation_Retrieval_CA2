Mentese stated that nobody should give the impression that winning certain mayoral posts in the local elections will bring a new order; that a new order is in office; or that the applications, institutions, or regulations of democracy will change. Mentese's statement to the Turkish Radio and Television regarding the issue is as follows: [Begin Mentese recording] Local administration elections were held under the supervision and inspection of legislative bodies according to Article 79 of the Constitution. The elections were held in peace and security. Participation was high. The elections were observed by the foreign and local press, the media, and the world. Our judges and prosecutors are assessing the allegations of fraud. Those who won the elections should not overreact and those that lost the elections should respect the results. Nobody should give the impression that by winning certain mayoral posts in the local elections they will bring a new order, a new order will come to office, or that democracy's applications, institutions, or regulations will change. Those who won the mayoral posts in certain areas have only the right to serve and take care of regional and local needs as stipulated by law. The winning of the mayoral elections in certain areas does not give them the right to have their say, to rule, or to govern provinces, districts, or for that reason the country. In order to govern the country it is necessary to gain control of the legislative authority, the right to make laws, and also to capture the power named the executive power. In order to govern the country, it is necessary to be a government. It is out of the question that this power and authority can be acquired by winning certain mayoral posts and local council memberships. Furthermore, according to the Constitution, local administrations are under the jurisdiction and control of the general administration. They are obliged to operate according to the existing laws and cannot overstep their authorities, transgress the laws, or conduct arbitrary procedures. All of us in this country will live according to the principles of Ataturk, the Constitution, and democracy with its institutions and regulations. Our citizens should respect each other whatever their way of life or views and should approach each other with love. Nobody should think that he can impose his political tendencies, believes, or ways of life upon others and nobody should behave in that direction. Anybody who opposes the laws, trespasses his authority in the line of duty, or deviates from great Ataturk's path by dissociating from his principles and innovations, will be sent to the concerned independent judicial authorities for the implementation of necessary legal procedures and punishment.
