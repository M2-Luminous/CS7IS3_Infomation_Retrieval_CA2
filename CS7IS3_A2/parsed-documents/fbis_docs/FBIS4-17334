He wished that Boris Yeltsin would not only carry on as president until 1996 but would nominate himself to next presidential elections and be elected for yet another five-year term. Talking to the editors-in-chief of Russia's leading media, Shumeyko said that Boris Yeltsin is the only appropriate candidate to the presidency in the country. "A change of Russian president now would be tantamount to a catastrophe, he believes. A new head of state would start changing the entire team in the center and province. His people would start settling scores with previous teammates." In such an event, Shumeyko feels, Russia would plunge into such a political and economic crisis that would blast any hope for further reform.
