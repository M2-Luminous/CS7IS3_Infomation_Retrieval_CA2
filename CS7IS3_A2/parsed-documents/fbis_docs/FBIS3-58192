The strategy for the Folketing election should be in place. Local elections are not a Folketing election. Still, so many tendencies countrywide can be inferred from how the voters expressed themselves on Tuesday [18 November] that these have immediately been included in the party leaders' strategic considerations preceding the Folketing election. Aside from the two EC referenda, this is the first time in almost three years that voters have had the possibility of telling politicians what they think. Therefore, the local elections can be described as a kind of midway election, not least because a change of government, over which the voters had no influence, has taken place since the last Folketing election in December 1990. The local elections became a remarkable battle between the two great blocs, the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, between Uffe and Nyrup. The small parties were trampled, the somewhat larger ones squeezed. The Liberal Party and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were the great victors in the local elections, having never before achieved such success in the urban areas, where the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist People's Party previously were the dominant parties. The Social Democrats lost more this time in comparison to the local and the county council elections of 1989, but the prime minister's party still did better than expected, and relief over the result has made Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen behave like a winner almost on a par with Ellemann-Jensen. The Radical Liberal Party was the only one of the small coalition parties that received a reward from the voters. On the other hand, the election was a catastrophe for the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party. The Conservatives lost, but not by as much as most people had expected. The extremist parties, i.e., the Socialist People's Party and the Progress Party, also took a hit from the voters. Election Results One has to be cautious in trying to read the nationwide result of the county council election--the election that best can be compared with a Folketing election--directly as a Folketing election. However, the Social Democratic Party received 34.3 percent of the votes compared to 35.4 percent in the last county council election, while the Social Democratic Party won 37.4 percent of the votes in the landslide at the Folketing election in December 1990. The Radicals won 3.9 percent of the votes at the county council election on Tuesday, an increase of 0.5 percent compared to the last county council election. The Radicals won 3.5 percent in the Folketing election. The Democratic Center fell from 2.5 to 1 percent in the county council election; the Christian People's Party from 1.9 to 1.6 percent. In the Folketing election the two parties won 5.1 and 2.3 percent respectively. The Liberal Party has thundered forth from 17.8 to 27.1 percent in the last county council election, while it won 15.8 percent in the Folketing election in 1990. The Conservative Party won 12.8 percent compared to 14.5 percent in the last county council election and 16 percent in the Folketing election. The Progress Party now has 5.1 percent compared to 7 percent in the last county council election, but the party won 6.4 percent in the Folketing election. The Socialist People's Party has fallen from 10.7 percent to 9.1 percent; the party won 8.3 percent in the Folketing election. The Uffe Effect If these numbers are extrapolated to a Folketing election, the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party will have dropped out of the Folketing. Occasionally they do so also in the opinion polls, but even though they might be able to pass the threshold in the upcoming Folketing election, the government majority has been lost. The question, however, is whether the Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen after the Folketing election can muster a majority of the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and the Progress Party. The outcome of the next Folketing election therefore might well be that Prime Minister Rasmussen will continue as prime minister for a social democratic-radical minority government. The Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen might do well in the election, but might not be able to benefit from it anyway. Most voters will be siphoned off from the other nonsocialist parties, and there might not be a majority that can designate Ellemann-Jensen as prime minister in 1994. It is only fair to say that Ellemann-Jensen is well satisfied after Tuesday's election. The Liberal Party has now become an urban party especially attractive to young voters. However, his problem in next year's election campaign will be to maintain the Liberal Party's progress when the Social Democratic Party and Rasmussen get the Social Democratic Party's election machine started up. Even though the Liberal Party might win the Folketing election in a landslide, the Folketing election will be make-or-break for Ellemann-Jensen. If he does not manage to effect a change of government, it will be quite uncertain whether or not the Uffe effect can hold on to the Liberal Party's new voters if the Liberal Party continues to drag on for a few more years in opposition. The Conservatives The Conservative Party is in a different position than the Liberal Party. The Conservatives, of course, also have their eyes on the Folketing election. But the most important thing for the party is to recover and gain some new voters. If there is no change of government in 1994, this will be no catastrophe for the new party leadership headed by Hans Engell. The party leadership will be able to display the result, but it can easily manage several years in opposition without it causing internal problems. It will be most important for the Conservatives to maintain their close alliance with the Liberal Party. The two parties must not let themselves be played against each other; the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party must always appear as a credible alternative to the existing government. That is why the Liberal Party's popularity with the voters might cause anxiety for the Conservatives among whom some fear that the Liberal Party might be tempted to go it alone when settling with the Social Democratic Party. Government Problems Prime Minister Nyrup Rasmussen apparently also sees himself as a winner in the local elections. Of the four governing parties, however, it is really only the Radical Left Party that is a winner. Among the Radicals, the mood is very high, and group leader Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen was almost euphoric as he congratulated the radical members of the local administration and of the county council: "The gain in the number of seats won is nothing but formidable." The radical politicians are clearly in tune with their voters. That is why the radical Folketing groups view the local election result as a confirmation that the Radicals made the right decision when they joined the Nyrup government in January. For the Democratic Center, Tuesday's election was nothing less than a catastrophe. The party lost its four county council members and almost all its local administration members. In the party's traditional stronghold, Gladsaxe, the party lost all of its seats in the local administration. The Democratic Center has been doing some serious soul-searching since the party joined in the government, but now the party has almost gone into a coma. Party leader Mimi Jakobsen was on an official visit to the Middle East when she received the depressing news. She states that she alone is responsible for the party's poor election results, but that the Democratic Center will remain in the government and that there is no intention to change the party's direction. The Democratic Center's obvious problems can also become the prime minister's. Prior to the coming Folketing election, the Democratic Center will be even more anxious to define their position than they have been so far, so that the image of the government will sputter more and more. This will delight Ellemann-Jensen and increasingly irritate the many Social Democratic Folketing members, who would like to see the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party kept out of the government. The Democratic Center's group leader Bente Juncker, who is at odds with Jakobsen, has announced a more aggressive approach. The Christian People's Party also received a jolt from the voters, but not as strong as that of the Democratic Center. The Christian People's Party is more used to hovering near the threshold in the polls. But this will not keep Merethe Due Jensen and Inger Stilling Pedersen quiet. Soul-searching is also on the agenda for the Socialist People's Party and the Progress Party. The Progress Party members have to decide whether or not to draw a more aggressive front with the Social Democratic Party in the coming election campaign. The Progress Party must take into account that the party's policy concerning immigration did not win them any votes in the local elections.
