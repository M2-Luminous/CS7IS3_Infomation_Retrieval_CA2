FBIS4-65294 "drweu094_n_94008" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Sweden North Disappointed Over Regional Aid North Disappointed Over Regional Aid 94P20753A 94P20753A CSO [Editorial Report] Local politicians in northern Sweden are concerned that they will receive less regional aid than they had thought under the European Union [EU] accession agreement. According to a report by Lena Hemmel in the 22 April Swedish SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 18, Sweden is earmarked to receive 2.4 billion kronor in regional aid -- 360 million under the Objective 6 program, and the northern provinces thought that they were also entitled to seek aid from the other 2 billion. In what they regard as at best a misunderstanding and at worst a betrayal, they have now discovered that they are not. A local politician in the town of Vilhelmina called the accession agreement "worse than the worst imaginable." He expressed concern that "there can be other hidden problems that they [government negotiators] wanted to cover up and that will come up once the referendum is over and we are already in the system." Georg Andersson, the former Social Democratic communication minister and now a member of parliament from the northern town of Lycksele, said: "This is negative, very negative...it does not improve the climate of opinion on EU accession. Many people have placed great weight on regional policy."
