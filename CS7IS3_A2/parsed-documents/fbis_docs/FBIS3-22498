[passage omitted] The Minister of Health also acknowledged that some medical personnel are still unwilling to treat AIDS patients for fear of being infected. [passage omitted] Sujudi said that there are now 13 million AIDS patients in the world. The number of patients continues to rise as time goes on. There are now 177 AIDS patients in Indonesia. "To keep down the number of AIDS patients, husbands shouldn't play around; they should think of their wives at home and the teachings of their religion," he added. In the meantime, it was reported from Mataram that starting the end of this year the Department of Health will begin the official use of a reagent produced by Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram, Lombok, which can detect the HIV virus, the cause of AIDS, for surveillance purposes. Dr. D. Soemarsidi, director of Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram, told KOMPAS last Wednesday (1 December) that 60,000 units of this HIV test reagent had been shipped by his distributor in Jakarta. In addition, 15,000 units of this test were sent to the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region Provincial Government for the same purpose. The Department of Health's order for this means of surveillance proves that this AIDS reagent, which uses the trademark Entebe dipstick HIV and is produced domestically, can be used to detect AIDS in our country. The World Health Organization has acknowledged the ability of this reagent to detect AIDS. This year the Department of Health has put in an order for 170,000 tests, which will be filled in the near future. Soemarsidi said that the first acknowledgment came from the Department of Microbiology of the WHO Collaborating Center on AIDS in Antwerp, Belgium, at the end of last year. Studies show that the sensitivity of the reagent to AIDS has reached as high as 97 percent, with a specificity of 99.1 percent after it was compared with the Western Blot test. A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of Sirirat Hospital, Mahidon University, Bangkok (Thailand) shows even better results. Reports on the results of the study at the end of last year show that the sensitivity level reached 100 percent, with a specificity of 99.52 percent. The Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram has been trying to produce this AIDS reagent for commercial purposes since the beginning of this year. Although the WHO evaluation has been very convincing, marketing the reagent is not as simple as one might imagine. In fact, since they were convinced that the market would absorb their product immediately Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram produced it in large quantities. But in the middle of 1993 about 60,000 HIV dipstick tests had to be destroyed because their expiration dates had passed. Because of the orders from the Department of Health and from the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region Provincial Government, Dr. Soemarsidi is optimistic that the product will be absorbed by the domestic market. In fact, Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram is prepared to produce up to 50,000 tests per month. Nevertheless, Soemarsidi explained that this AIDS reagent should be produced for human needs, like the production of a Hepatitis B reagent in the past. That is why he thinks that the reagent should be used for surveillance purposes, even though it will be marketed and distributed through distributors appointed for that purpose. The selling price of the reagent was not mentioned, but KOMPAS noted that the price was fixed last year at 1,500 rupiahs per test, much lower than the cost of other detection substances which had the same or even lower sensitivity levels.
