It involves 10 guns that were purchased in 1993. Two of these guns will be installed in each of the three frigates of the Sea Force and the rest will be installed in the four Navy minesweepers, one gun in each boat. The frigates were manufactured in France, as were three other light patrol crafts manufactured in 1981 at Uruguay's request. These patrol crafts have design problems and suffer constant cracks in the rudder. A decision has thus been made to sell them and the proceeds would be used to improve Navy salaries. The Navy has four minesweepers from the former German Democratic Republic's disbanded Navy, four minesweepers based in the Uruguay River, two support ships that usually run to Antarctica, the training ship Capitan Miranda -- which is currently under repair in Spain, a buoy tender, a tugboat, and three amphibious craft. The Navy is also studying the possibility of adding a new helicopter to the Naval Aviation fleet of three helicopters, various maritime patrol planes, and training planes. The weekly "BUSQUEDA" yesterday published a report stating that between 24 December and 2 January the Navy released personnel "to generate savings that (...) will alleviate a difficult economic situation." Naval sources said that between 24 December and 2 January "there were no meals for personnel" in an "unprecedented lack of foresight" in the Navy. The sources explained that guard services like those at weekends were posted, but the situation returned to normal early this week when the 1994 budget funds became available. Defense Minister Daniel Hugo Martins subsequently confirmed this report to Radio Carve.
