In an article today, the paper says that the overwhelming majority of the world has come to realize that the United States and Britain are involved in a dirty (?political) game that has nothing to do with UN resolutions or law. Rather, they have come to realize that this game is part of selfish interests and calculations aimed at harming Iraq and other world peoples. AL-THAWRAH indicates that the (?Iraqi letter) to the UN Security Council clearly supported the Iraqi rights that Washington, London, and world Zionism want to deny and to [words indistinct] as a result of the imperialist aggression and the unjust blockade that has been imposed on it. The paper says: The free will of Iraq and the international community has successfully exposed attempts to falsify facts and the meaningless [word indistinct] that the representatives of imperialism have shown at the UN Security Council. AL-THAWRAH adds that, for the first time in three years, the UN Security Council finds itself besieged by unequivocal Iraqi facts. Therefore, Washington and London went crazy, and ordered their representatives to oppose the issuance of any resolution in the interest of Iraq. However, they failed to convince the representatives of France, China, and Russia of the tendentious U.S. and British argument for extending the blockade against Iraq. The paper stresses that Iraq has a fair case and is an influential player in the Arab region and the world. Therefore, it is not easy to blackout the evident Iraq role [words indistinct] that want to see the truth. The paper says that the U.S. and British administrations should consider well the changes that are taking place inside the United States and Britain, changes which indicate that many U.S. and British parties are demanding that Washington and London adopt a different policy on Iraq. Concluding its article, the paper says that those who have legitimate rights and adhere to their rights and independent national decisionmaking, just like Iraq, must achieve a comprehensive victory over the powers of evil and exploitation.
