In statements published today in the daily "LA JORNADA," the Zapatist leader indicated that the EZLN hoped that "war would be staved off by the pressures exerted by the civil society and the whole nation for the agreements to be kept." The government "will only comply if it is forced to do so, and this will be by the force of the rifle or by society's pressure," insisted the leader of the Chiapas rebels. For Marcos, "the sole possibility of peace is for other forces to make a commitment to oblige the government to keep the agreements." One day after his return to the Lacandona Jungle in Chiapas where the Zapatists took shelter to ask the Indian communities' opinion on the agreements made with the government, Marcos declared that the problem is no longer the rebels', but the nation's as a whole. "The government will have to fight against its past to convince the communities that it will now meet its commitments," the Zapatist "subcommander" stressed. Marco made a brief analysis of the 63-day armed rebellion in which he accepted military defeat in the taking over of Rancho Nuevo where an Army garrison is located. He also admitted that "the swift manner in which we passed from the armed situation to the San Cristobal table took us by surprise." He stressed that during the rebellion the EZLN "General Command received numerous letters of support from Indian from other parts of the nation in which they also stated their desire to join up in arms, among them the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahumaras, and Maya tribes. The 19 representatives of the EZLN directorate returned on Thursday to the Lacandona Jungle after an 11-day dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis, government delegate for peace and reconciliation, with whom several agreements were reached. These include the government's response to the Zapatists' main demands.
