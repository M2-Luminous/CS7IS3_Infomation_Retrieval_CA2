Dr. Buthelezi, what exactly are your sentiments at the moment about this election? [Buthelezi] Well, at the moment my spirits are down because of the problems that we have encountered, and particularly the issue of the shortage of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers, because the agreement, after all, that was made on the 19th -- when the president and Mr. Mandela and myself had that discussion in Pretoria, where we made the agreement that we all signed -- actually was based on the fact that there would be only stickers with the IFP space at the bottom of the ballot paper, and that any ballot paper that didn't have a sticker of the IFP at the bottom would not be considered to be a valid paper, and would be regarded as spoilt. So now I have heard rumors that these ballot papers are getting short. But I am even more alarmed by the suggestion that is being made that people could scribble IFP at the bottom, because that is just not acceptable to us, and we reject that totally, because even on the 19th that was suggested and it was rejected by us completely. [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, is this a warning that you might not view the election as a free and fair one at the end of the day, and that you would have to reconsider all the options you signed earlier this month in Pretoria? [Buthelezi] Well, actually, it is not us who broke them, because the chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] was actually present when we made those agreements, and therefore it is not the IFP breaking these, but otherwise it's the IEC that is now deviating. I am not trying to apportion blame on them, I know that they are doing a very difficult job, but the point is that there is no way in which we can agree to what is being suggested now that our people should just scribble IFP at the bottom of the paper without the IFP sticker, because this has been a complaint of people everywhere, even in Cape Town. There are people who wanted to vote me in Cape Town. This morning I received some faxes from overseas, from Portugal and from America and from someone who has just been to London, who wanted to vote for me, but they were told that they should scribble my name, and these were white people who are even literate and educated, but they refused to do that because they say that infringes also the secrecy of the ballot. [Alfonso] So what will it take for you to be happy with these elections? [Buthelezi] Well, if we have enough stickers, and if the dates for the elections are extended. I have heard that, you know, tomorrow may be declared a holiday again, but I think that is not enough if you take into account that our old folk were here yesterday. Before old people were here, indigent people, pensioners and sick people were here and they stayed here for hours on end, and this is not only here, but everywhere. It has happened everywhere that these elderly people, sick people, have come and gone home without voting. Just now I have received a fax from Vryheid stating the same thing, from Mr. Mentz, you know, that in Vryheid they have hundreds and hundreds of these old people who didn't vote yesterday, but even today who find the situation unsatisfactory. That is why they have sent the fax to me. [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, what people throughout the country want to know, are you seriously considering pulling out of the election if that doesn't happen? [Buthelezi] Well, that is a function of the Central Committee, but I think I will have no option myself. If in fact they are trying to foist this decision that people should scribble the name instead of a sticker, then I will have to call a special meeting of the Central Committee because the Central Committee has the final word on this. But I think I would be duty bound to call that meeting because, quite clearly there is no way in which we can accept that. [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much, and we cross back to the studio in Johannesburg.
