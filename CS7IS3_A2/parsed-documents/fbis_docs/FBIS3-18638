Shovelfulls of money. Nonpolitical agreements. The trio Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi is not competing with its adversaries on equal terms. And if the latter do not react, the campaign could become a walkover. You are a party of the center or of the left. Do you want to use television advertising? You have to go to Fininvest. And there you have two choices. You can pay full price for the ads, and you are ruined. Or, you can accept Fininvest's super discount, which is even worse: in effect, you accept financing from the Milanese tycoon, and you even have to declare it in accordance with the law. Do you see the absurdity? Those who want to combat the politician Berlusconi on television must accept money from the businessman Berlusconi. And probably have to tell him: thank you, and what a pluralist you are. It is just an example, not even the most important, of the distortions introduced into the political contest by the entry of the owner of Fininvest. These distortions are making a fixed match out of this electoral campaign because of the enormous disproportion between the political forces in the contest. They further give an artificial and vaguely repugnant appearance to the rise of the Right, an outcome which the polls predict. The Right was strong to begin with, very strong. Never in power, the Lega and the MSI [Italian Social Movement] had stolen much less than the others: while the winds of Clean Hands were blowing, they could demonstrate a kind of virginity. In addition, they had two first rate leaders. Bossi is coarse and Fini pedantic, but both are capable of appealing to many sectors in Italy. But neither of the two would have created a triumphant Right without Silvio Berlusconi, the man who was described on the cover of L'ESPRESSO last November as "the vote gatherer" while many were still pondering the misleading question of whether or not he would run.? Berlusconi has made headway with a deployment of forces never before seen, beyond the reach of any other rival. By now, everything is known about the limitless television and newspaper empire that the state and the banks have allowed him to own. But little attention is paid to how that empire is used, in which moments of impartiality are rare. The chief's adversaries are attacked mercilessly; on the other hand, television coverage of him abounds and favorable interviews appear even in nonpolitical newspapers. Television stations beat the drum for Forza Italia, mobilizing stars and starlets; the magazines even distribute postcards to register. But above all, Berlusconi's mass media are used to condition the mass media that he does not own. The uproar against RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] is an extreme case, with grotesque results, such as the gag imposed on the satire "Tunnel," but it is not the only one. Every day Fininvest's powerful resources warn the state-owned television news programs and independent daily newspapers against rubbing Berlusconi the wrong way; or else the rumor will be spread that the other news media owners have taken sides with the left. It is impressive firepower. Umberto Bossi himself recognized it when he admitted that without an agreement with Berlusconi, his League party would have risked being "literally cancelled." But this is only the best known aspect of Berlusconi's power. There are others. For starters, money: Berlusconi has incomparably more of it than his adversaries. His companies (Standa [department store chain]) do not pay their suppliers, they delay paying eminent collaborators like Maurizio Costanzo (Channel 5) for months, they even leave the winners of television quiz shows ("Yes or No") high and dry; but the money reaches Forza Italia through a hundred mechanisms already described by CORRIERE DELLA SERA. This behavior may well be described as immoral, but it has the advantage of nourishing the network of clubs without risking criminal penalties. This is because, according to the law of 1974, a private company can subsidize a party without limits, on the one condition that the contributions be approved by the board of directors and described in the balance sheet. Well, Fininvest is not at all embarrassed to openly finance the Forza Italia clubs since they both have the same owner. For the PDS [Democratic Party of the left] and the PPI [Italian Popular Party], however, it would be impossible to find a financier who would agree to appear as such. That is not all. Only Berlusconi can count on thousands of yes-men trained for years to the cult of the chief. This is why his party, created from above by managerial decision and entrusted to masses of paid employees, can establish in two months the 9,000 offices that would cost other groups the work of generations; and it is the only party that does not have and structurally cannot have internal conflicts. Forza Italia is also the only organization that gathers support effortlessly for non-political reasons: from the major bankers who risk seeing their credits go up in smoke to the small suppliers left waiting for payment, the country is full of people who have a material interest that Berlusconi's political adventure not end in a catastrophe. This does not account for the fact that Berlusconi the businessman, moving between commercial television, supermarkets and soccer teams, also has non-political know-how in manipulating the emotions of the crowd. It is the sum of these elements of strength that confers on Berlusconi's campaign the unpleasant appearance of a walkover, and leads one to blame the right for conducting an unfair contest. It is not competing with the Center and the Left on equal terms. And the evidence is to be found not only in the rapidity with which the Right seems to grow, but especially in the speed with which Berlusconi has become the undisputed head of the entire alliance, supplanting within a few weeks Bossi and Fini, who are superior to him in charisma and in real political following. It is obvious that Berlusconi, besides being powerful, is able. He knows well how to use the immense arsenal he possesses. He has represented his entrance into the contest as a long-awaited and long-feared event, by means of a show of pretended hesitations and reconsiderations which few recognized from the beginning as designed to mislead. Moreover,the great event has been transformed quickly into many minor events: the cassette with the recorded appeal on television news, the convention in Rome transmitted in its entirety on Channel 4, the refusal to take part in direct debate, the call-ins on RAI talk shows. By contrast, the Left has created a campaign totally devoid of events, except for such negative ones as agreements with Communist Renewal, tiresome negotiations over candidacies conducted by small, petulant groups, and now involvement in judicial investigations. Even the name chosen, "progressives," is abstruse, it is a word no one ever uses; and the symbol is ugly. In 1978, Enrico Berlinguer, who did not have television, knew how to create one grand event. It was enough for him to say, in an interview with Giampaolo Pansa, that he accepted NATO's protective umbrella. There is a need for equally striking and serious gestures today. Otherwise, only a miracle will be able to stop the Right. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Are you in favor of the electoral agreement between the League and Forza Ita-| |lia for the northern voting districts?
