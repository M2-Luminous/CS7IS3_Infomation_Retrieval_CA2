FR940721-0-00017 FR940721-0-00007 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 22 [PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253; FCC 94&hyph;123] Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act_Competitive Bidding AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This Memorandum Opinion and Order states the Commission's intention to use lotteries to award licenses for all cellular unserved areas in which applications were filed prior to July 26, 1993. This action is taken because the Commission indicated in a prior order in this proceeding that it would address in a separate action the applicability of competitive bidding or lottery procedures to certain radio applications filed before July 26, 1993. The Commission concludes that this action to use random selection instead of competitive bidding to award licenses among these competing applications will serve the public interest. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Markendorff (202) 418&hyph;1320 or Geraldine Matise (202) 418&hyph;1300 in the Common Carrier Bureau.

Synopsis of Order In this Order, the Commission states its intention to use existing random selection procedures to choose from among mutually exclusive applications filed prior to July 26, 1993, for authorization to provide cellular service to unserved areas. This action is consistent with the Special Rule adopted in Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act. In the near future, the Commission's staff will issue a Public Notice rescheduling the two previously scheduled lotteries. Finally, the Commission stated that it will consider requests for approval of full market settlements and proceed with licensing where such approval is granted. Ordering Clauses Accordingly, it is ordered that selection from among mutually exclusive applications filed prior to July 26, 1993, to provide cellular service to unserved areas shall be by random selection, in accordance with existing Commission rules.
