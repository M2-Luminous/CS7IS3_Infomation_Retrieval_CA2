He said the Danish Government considered it important that the EU remain an open organization and that was why it intensively tried to arrive at an agreement between the EU and Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria. Petersen said he hoped that these countries would become EU members as of January 1, 1995, thus opening up a new EU chapter of extending eastwards. The Danish Government is determined to seek the EU's extension to Central and East European states, including the Czech Republic, and considers it very significant, Petersen said. The government welcomes the Czechs' effort at joining this organization, he added. Zieleniec said he and Petersen devoted much time to an analysis of the situation in Europe, to security issues and prospects of the United States-proposed Partnership for Peace program for European security. The Czech side is prepared to make use of the project for cooperation between the two countries' Armies and Defense Ministries. He said it was also important that small states mutually cooperate in the security sphere. Petersen labelled the two countries' relations as excellent. Both ministers also pointed to increasing mutual trade and Denmark's active role in bilateral trade and economic relations. Also discussed was a potential visit to the Czech Republic by the Queen of Denmark. Tomorrow, Petersen will leave for Slovakia.
