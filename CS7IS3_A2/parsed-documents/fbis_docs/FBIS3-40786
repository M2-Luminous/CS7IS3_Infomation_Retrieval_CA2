Venkitaramanan, considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee [JPC] on the securities scam, included "reactivation," in April 1992, of the current account of Harshad Mehta in the State Bank of India (Main Branch) in Bombay. This allegation, according to the deposition of Mr. Venkitaramanan and his clarifications to the committee, was misconceived because there was in the first instance no freezing or deactivation of the account by the RBI but only an order to monitor the flow of funds. (The RBI has no power to freeze a current account except under legal procedures like implementation of a "garnishee order" from a court or on issuing a show-cause notice to the account holder.) What had happened in the case of the Harshad Mehta account, according to the defence put up by the former RBI Governor, was that on March 16, 1992, extracts from the current account of Harshad Mehta with the SBI were brought to the attention of Ms. Viswanathan, Executive Director of the RBI, by Mr. M.N.Goiporia, Chairman of the SBI. This itself was the result of a query made by the RBI Governor at a meeting held in the RBI on March 10, 1992, as to the source of funds of Harshad Mehta. The information from the SBI Chairman on the Mehta account was shown by Ms. Viswanathan to Mr. Venkitaramanan on the same day (March 16, 1992), whereupon the latter reiterated over the telephone his instructions to Mr. Goiporia to monitor the account. Ms. Viswanathan, on her part, instructed RBI officials to scrutinise voucher entries on the Mehta account on a top priority basis. Harshad Mehta did not operate the account between March 16 and April 1, 1992, but again operated it from April 2 to 8, 1992. Whatever the reasons which impelled Harshad Mehta to operate or not operate his current account, the fact was that there were no orders from the RBI to the SBI for freezing or defreezing the account or to withdraw the monitoring of the same, Mr. Venkitaramanan is understood to have told the JPC. Foreign banks: Another issue that has exercised members of the JPC is the alleged instruction, given by Mr. Venkitaramanan in his note of March 20, 1991, to the Deputy Governor, Mr. Amitabh Ghosh, for "different treatment" for foreign banks suspected to be involved in irregular transactions in PSU [oublic sector undertakings] bonds and Government securities. Mr. Venkitaramanan clarified to the JPC that all that his role of March 20, 1991 (which, incidentally, was issued within three months of taking over his job) said in respect of foreign banks was that "while foreign banks are involved, we have to take care." The note had also mentioned that several banks who were suspected to be carrying on "fictitious" transactions in violation of norms and instructed the Deputy Governor to ensure that such transactions did not take place. (The full magnitude and modus operandi of the transactions came to light only in subsequent investigations, especially by the Janakiraman committee.) Mr. Venkitaramanan told the JPC that orders to "take care" (while dealing with foreign banks) did not mean either closing one's eyes to the wrongdoings of foreign banks or going soft on them. The instruction, calling essentially for proper alertness and caution in dealing with them, was issued in the context of the massive foreign exchange crisis that had overtaken the country at that time and the frantic efforts then being made by the Government and the RBI to shore up the reserves. The situation was such that the RBI, while following up the securities issue, would at the same time be soliciting foreign currency deposits from foreign banks under a scheme launched under instructions from the Government in 1990. Subsequent investigations conducted by the RBI on securities trading in fact, covered foreign banks and revealed several irregular practices on their part. A third issue on which the then RBI Governor was questioned by the JPC was his role in the appointment of Mr. M.J. Pherwani as Chairman of the National Housing Bank (which, as revealed later, was a leading player in the scam) and of Mr. K. Margabandhu as Chairman and Managing Director [MD] of the UCO [Unitrd Commercial] Bank. Mr. Venkitaramanan pointed out to the committee that the Appointments Board, headed by him and including representatives of the Finance Ministry, at its meeting on February 9, 1991, recommended the name of Mr. Margabandhu in view of his record of handling industrial relations problems successfully in the State Bank of Saurashtra as its then MD. The RBI Governor told the Board that mainly because of the better selection and training procedures at the SBI compared to other banks, the quality and standard of its officers was of a high order. Considering the weak financial position and working environment at UCO Bank and the fact that no other officer of the rank of Deputy MD of the SBI was then willing to assume responsibility of chairmanship of the UCO Bank, the Board finally recommended his name. Mr. Margabandhu, it noted, had also worked in Calcutta in the SBI. As for Mr. Pherwani, the RBI had recommended his name for the [National Housing Bank] NHB chairmanship in view of his experience, expertise and innovative approach (Mr. Pherwani, who was earlier Chairman of the Unit Trust of India, was at that time heading the infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd. besides being a Director of the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation). The Appointments Board, while considering the RBI recommendation, decided to leave the matter to the Government to finalise but expressed the view that if Mr. Pherwani was selected, he could be allowed to continue as IFL Chairman. Mr. Venkitaramanan sought to impress on the JPC that the RBI could only recommend names based on facts available to it and if there was anything that went against the individuals concerned, it was to be taken care of by vigilance inquiries before issuing orders. In respect of charges of delay or laxity in following up his initial note and in issue of circulars to all banks (which was done by the RBI in July, 1991), the JPC is understood to have been told by Mr. Venkitaramanan that the intervening period was taken up by investigations by the bank. What was more, he said, it was he (Mr. Venkitaramanan), who insisted on issuing the circular in July 1991, ruling out suggestions from the Deputy Governor concerned for appointing an auditing firm to examine the issue further. The Governor had taken the view that since evidence of irregularities in securities trading had existed within the RBI as early as 1986-87 following a report submitted at that time by an official, the matter brooked no further delay.
