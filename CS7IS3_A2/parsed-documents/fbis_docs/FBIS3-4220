The PWC has begun reviewing Hong Kong's laws to identify any possible conflict with the Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 mini-constitution. But the move has raised concerns that the PWC is duplicating some of the tasks being carried out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) set up by an internationally binding treaty. Shao Tianren, the coconvenor of the PWC's legal group which began a three-day meeting in Beijing yesterday, ruled out the possibility of inviting legal experts from Hong Kong to attend the discussions to avoid any duplication. "We can't invite Hong Kong officials for they are under the British administration, and that would involve discussions at a foreign affairs level," he said. Mr Shao's statement contradicted moves by the PWC several months ago to invite Hong Kong officials to address its groups, sparking a row with the British administration. The PWC's economic group had invited Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu to explain Britain's fourth proposed airport funding strategy. The invitation was declined. Speaking after the first day of the legal group's discussions, Mr Shao said 12 ordinances relating to land and real estate had been reviewed. "The group has decided not to recommend changes to the units of weights and measures under the British system such as inches, feet or pounds," he said. "All these are historical habits. Let the Hong Kong people decide whether to change them or not after 1997." However, Mr Shao said the 12 ordinances were in need of technical amendments to remove references to British sovereignty, such as "Royal" and "British government". He denied any duplication of the work already being undertaken by JLG experts. "Our group will only give principal advice and we will not amend the ordinances and regulations one by one" he said. "It's not the assigned work of the PWC. If both sides (the Chinese and British) can co-operate the (legal) work actually can be discussed in the Joint Liaison Group."
