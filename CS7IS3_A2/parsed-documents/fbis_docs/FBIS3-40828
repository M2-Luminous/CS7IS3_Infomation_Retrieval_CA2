The committees studied the general budget and the sectors' budgets throughout last week. The Chamber's public meetings are to be held in order to hear the views and stands of the parties and labor unions on the bill. The citizens who have been suffering because of soaring prices and unemployment expect this bill to address some of their problems and to open, at least, a breach in the wall of the crisis that is growing worse from one government to the next. The most important clause to those waiting for relief is the one dealing with the social sectors. People expect measures to be taken to improve those sectors, to boost purchasing power, to provide suitable housing, and to create jobs. When the finance minister read the bill, he placed the social sectors seventh in order of priority and focused on two points: First, the number of jobs, which he said increased from 15,000 to 25,510 jobs. Second, the establishment of a fund for the employment of youth, to which one billion dirhams have been allocated. The jobs, according to the bill, are distributed as follows: Education and Health, 8,100 jobs. Ministries of Justice, Finance, and others, about 2,500 jobs. Security jobs such as gendarmes and national security, about 15,000 jobs. Therefore, less than 35 percent of the jobs are allocated to the ministries of social affairs. With regard to "Youth Employment Development Fund," it is not definite yet whether its funds will finance the new jobs. But it appears that the Fund is the subject of a dispute between the prime minister and the minister of finance over its "ownership." The presentation memo of the finance bill says that "particular attention has been devoted to the finance bill, which is evident in the allocation of one billion dirhams in the prime minister's investment budget to a special treasury account that has been established for this purpose." As for section two (article 42) of the finance bill, its first clause provides that "out of the desire to control the accounts of operations relating to developing the employment of youth, an account shall be established to be called `Youth Employment Development Fund.'" The minister of finance will be responsible for receiving its revenues and spending its expenses. The ministers present at the committee's budget discussions appeared to treat the social aspect somewhat indifferently. The attitudes of the government (and its parliamentary majority) will be clarified following the changes the nationalist and democratic parties have proposed. The status of the social situation in the official policy and those who applaud it will be defined. The committee meetings have also enabled the representatives to get acquainted with several areas of interest to the "technocrat government." The rule provides that the qualifications of the minister should be compatible with the task assigned to him. Unfortunately, some ministers' knowledge of the Arabic language as a constitutional language is poor. Some of them have shown that they are not familiar with the specifics of the Moroccan citizen's living conditions and his basic needs.
