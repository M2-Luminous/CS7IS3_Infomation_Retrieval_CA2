FBIS3-46819 "dreas004_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 North Korea South Berated for `Dependence on Outside Forces' SK0601021194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 5 Jan 94 SK0601021194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 5 Jan 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] Wearing the horsehair cap of a civilian-led government, the present regime in South Korea runs counter to the unanimous desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen by advancing on the road of dependence on outside forces and North-South confrontation, thereby further revealing treacherous colors with each passing day. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is further clinging to outside forces while looking for a way to perpetuate the present national division. This is exemplified by traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise to provide $3 billion every year for the upkeep of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces occupying South Korea in the two rounds of summit talks with the United States and the annual South Korean-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting held in July and November last year in which he begged for the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' permanent occupation of South Korea. In a bid to nail the U.S. imperialist aggression forces down in South Korea at all costs, the Kim Yong-sam clique not only allowed the United States in last April and May to utilize ports in South Korea freely in an emergency according to the aggressive and treacherous Wartime Host Nations Support Agreement, but also took the treacherous step of allowing the U.S. 7th Air Force continuous use of the U.S. Air Force's installations and facilities which had been returned to South Korea. Particularly, we cannot overlook the fact that the Kim Yong-sam clique has given the South Korean rice market to its U.S. masters in order to seek an international cooperative system to crush [apsal] their own fellow countrymen despite the South Korean people's unanimous objection. This is a treacherous act that can be committed only by traitors who have inherited the dirty blood of the five enemies of the Ulsa Treaty. Caught up in its maneuvers to perpetuate division, the puppet clique is clinging to the forces of Japanese military aggressors without hesitation in order to find a way to survive. During secret talks with the Japanese prime minister who visited South Korea in early November last year, the Kim Yong-sam clique promised that he would forget past nefarious atrocities committed by Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in return for Japan's cooperation in the settlement of the nuclear issue. The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is much more vicious than previous puppet governments in aggravating North-South confrontation. The warmaniacs of civilian government incite the spirit of war and northward invasion by making indiscriminate and violent war remarks like the so-called military countermeasure or full readiness, under the pretext of non-existent nuclear development in the North. The Kim Yong-sam group have appropriated a great amount of money from the budget, over ten trillions, for military expenditures this year, as never before attempted by any previous dictators, thus revealing their true nature as warmaniacs.
