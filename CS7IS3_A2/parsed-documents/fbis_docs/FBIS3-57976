Hardly anywhere else has a society fared better. Developed in the Nordic countries, the people's home, modeled after the Swedish system, has guaranteed a low unemployment rate combined with an at least reasonably equitable distribution of income; the society has taken care of its underprivileged and those who have been passed over to the extent national and local governments feel they can afford it. Steady economic growth has also allowed for and even made acceptable a high tax rate once it could be shown that the social security network would last. The society has taken care of people from the cradle to the grave and provided them with the opportunity for an education along the way. There is no need to more especially exaggerate the security afforded by a Nordic welfare society. It is not the best system in Europe in every respect, but, measured by nearly any yardstick whatsoever, one of the quartet composed of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland is found in the front rank. The typical Nordic society model has come to the end of the road along with--sorry to say--economic growth coming to a sudden stop, high taxes, and indebtedness, although in Finnish or Swedish discussion of the matter they are unwilling--at least as yet--to admit to this side of the situation. It seems to be impossible for politicians to, if not understand, at least recognize the effect of the growth of the debt, which is comparable to a cancer. As such, the numbers speak a harsh language. Finland's national debt has grown by over 90 billion markkas this year, which is about half of its expenditures, according to the national budget: When the state spends 2 markkas, one of them is to pay off the debt. Everyone realizes that we cannot go on like this endlessly. The whole dismal nature of the matter is revealed when we look at the future: The increase in the national debt is accelerating so rapidly that the present debt will double in three years and reach the gross national product level by 1996 at the latest. The welfare state is being swamped like a small boat caught in a breaker under the constantly expanding burden of debt. In the face of this storm, the government's commitment to a 70-percent debt level is not worth much. The automatic process of the increase in the debt is leading to a situation in which the public sector may drift into a catastrophic cash crisis. Tax revenue can no longer be increased as much as it could before by raising taxes. Because the road of taxes and borrowing is beginning to be blocked, we are left with reorganization. During the recession, the private sector has reorganized its activities with a strong hand. A total of nearly 300,000 jobs, or 17 percent of all jobs, has been lost in just under three years. During the same period, the public sector has lost a little over 60,000 jobs, which is just under 9 percent of all jobs. Increasing unemployment was not an end in itself, but the private sector has been forced to reorganize its activities since cash receipts have dried up. "Unowned money," on the other hand, has allowed the public sector to go on with a different kind of life. The increase in unemployment to 20 percent is something that neither can nor should in any form be accepted, much less submitted to. However, the other side of the coin is the cost of labor. The forces of any system whatsoever run dry if labor is priced at an unreasonably high level. When the wage-earner's take-home pay is about 7,000 markkas a month, including employee taxes and social contributions, the employer's burden is as much as almost three times that figure. Under the circumstances and in a competitive world, one has to be especially resourceful to get by and survive. It is a tough job to prevent the growth of mass unemployment and, at the same time, respond to the cheap labor of East Europe and Asia with high technology and production based on it. There are too many good qualities in the Nordic society model for its decay to be accepted. The best and only way to save the sound core of the world of the past is for the political parties to extensively commit themselves to giving up their benefits and improve their organizational structures so that public indebtedness can be gotten under control and the whole society does not need to change into a relief state. This kind of courage will yet be rewarded, although the reward is not yet in sight. If our society does not take care of its public-sector problem, our creditors will. This is why it would be better for us to stare a bit less at the brilliant export figures and the stock market as it whistles its way upward and spend a bit more time looking at the debt curves on the charts. Under the conditions of the recession, we can and must live with a budget deficit, and the deficit may even grow, but there must be a clear and credible limit to the rate at which we contract debts. So that in the future we do not have to, to copy the comparison with the Bosnian situation offered by Olli Kivinen on Thursday, answer the question: Where were you when the foundations of Finland's welfare state were destroyed?
