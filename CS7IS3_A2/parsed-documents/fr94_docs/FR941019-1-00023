FR941019-1-00023 FR941019-1-00002 2. Risk Weights and Avoidance of Double Counting. Once the credit equivalent amount for a derivative contract, or a group of derivative contracts, has been determined, that amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. However, the maximum weight that will be applied to the credit equivalent amount of such contracts is 50 percent. In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the derivative contracts covered by these guidelines may already be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy and, perhaps, assigning inappropriate risk weights, counterparty credit exposures arising from the types of instruments covered by these guidelines may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in calculating banks' risk-based capital ratios. The FDIC notes that the conversion factors set forth in section II.E.1. of appendix A, which are based on observed volatilities of the particular types of instruments, are subject to review and modification in light of changing volatilities or market conditions. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these types of contracts are contained in table IV of this appendix A. 5. In Appendix A to part 325, section II.E.3, as that section was proposed to be added at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994, is revised to read as follows: II. *␣*␣* E. *␣*␣* 3. Netting. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of derivative contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that: * * * * * (d) The bank maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of derivative contracts, including a copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions. A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount. 42 42 For purposes of this section, a walkaway clause means a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payments at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter, even if a defaulter or the estate of a defaulter is a net creditor under the contract. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available for inspection by the FDIC. Upon determination by the FDIC that a bank's files are inadequate or that a netting contract may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs (b) (i) through (iii) of this section, underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract. The credit equivalent amount of derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated by adding (i) the net current exposure of the netting contract and (ii) the sum of the estimates of potential future exposure for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, adjusted to take into account the effects of the netting contract. The net current exposure is the sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts subject to the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive, then the net current exposure is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the net current exposure is zero.
