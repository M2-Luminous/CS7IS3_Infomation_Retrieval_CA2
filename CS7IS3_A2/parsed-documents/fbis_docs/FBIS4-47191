There are still a few documents pending. But what will be the effect of the already signed edicts? There have been quite a few skeptical and even deprecatory comments among opinions about the already promulgated edicts. But here is the opinion of the director of the Institute for Economic Problems of the Transition Period, Yegor Gaydar. On the whole, they can only be welcomed. The decisions contained in them were discussed for a long time within the government and were the subject of fierce debate and opposition. Among the most serious decisions involving direct action, for which there are no legal obstacles in the way of their implementation, is the document on the liberalization of foreign economic activities and the abolition of quota-setting and licensing. This is a quite revolutionary decision. In my opinion, it had already become immanent at the end of 1993 and could have been implemented as of the beginning of this year. Last fall, with enormous difficulty, we implemented the decision to reduce substantially the volumes of quota-restricted and licensed commodities. To be honest, I will not believe in this decision until I see it implemented in practice: I know only too well what serious groups of interests the abolition of quota-setting and licensing touches and what substantial opportunities for the mobilization of illegal revenues are associated in our country, just as in any country carrying out such a large-scale program, with these changed standard acts. A substantial factor which prompted at this time the adoption of so radical a decision is the extreme impudence of many exporting sectors in the use of the breaks and privileges on export tariffs, which was displayed at the beginning of 1994. This matter has traditionally been the subject of haggling--export tariffs or centralized deliveries of fuel and energy resources? Over the course of all of 1993 there was constant discussion about what portion of the exportable gas or oil should go for the federal budget's needs. The general plan was something like this: Around half of the exportable resources would be used for the budget's needs and then the other half would be exempt from the export tariffs. In 1994 a paradoxical situation arose when the producers were exempted from the export tariffs and they considered it absolutely unnecessary to deliver products for budget requirements. As a result, the budget's revenues from foreign economic activities, toward an increase in which, to a large extent, the draft of the 1994 budget had been oriented, decreased sharply in the first half of the year. Then the urgent need arose to simplify all foreign economic activities and to abolish not only quotas and licenses, but also the export tariff breaks. If the decision is actually carried out, this will lead to an increase in export receipts. The main obstacle in the way of the abolition of the quotas, let us say in the area of oil marketing, has traditionally been associated with actual transportation limitations on the volume of our exporting--the capacities of the pipelines and the major exporting ports. Actually, we are currently exporting approximately as much oil as our transportation can carry out of the country. I am convinced that this situation will continue in the near future--it is not a matter of quotas, rather of transportation. Although, of course, the abolition of the quotas and licenses, in principle, expands the opportunities for transportation enterprises to make the most of their own monopoly position. But, all the same, there are advantages to having this kind of economic regulation in comparison with the administrative type. If, over the course of a certain amount of time, you have transportation capacities which act as actual limitations, sooner or later you will build a new oil-tanker seaport. But if you have administrative quotas and licenses, then the result will exclusively be an additional number of Mercedes. From this point of view, I think that this kind of decision will be beneficial to the long-term dynamics of Russia's foreign trade and the development of its fuel sector. If, of course, we actually manage to put it into practice. There are also other decisions which are correct and long immanent, for example, consolidation of the highway fund into the budget. I would call the sharp tightening up of tax control one of the other especially significant ones. It is a very useful and outstanding decision! But it has one shortcoming: Unfortunately, it does not have any legal force. Until the appropriate law is adopted by the Duma and then by the Federal Assembly, not a single court will implement it. Unfortunately, I know this quite well from experience. The same thing may be said about the decision to grant large breaks to joint production ventures, which contribute more than $10 million. This decision is contradictory and ambiguous in its consequences. But it cannot be implemented on the basis of presidential edicts within the framework of the existing constitution. This is more a declaration of intentions, which may have practical consequences in the event that it is backed up by appropriate legislation. Otherwise, this decision contradicts a whole set of laws. As for the changes in the tax legislation, these are sensible proposals for reducing somewhat the rates for the profits tax, the value-added tax, and the deductions for social insurance while increasing the property taxes. But, the personal income taxes as a second source, it seems to me, have been selected unsuccessfully. I absolutely do not believe in the feasibility and advisability of the upper rate for the income tax. I am convinced that, under the conditions of our lack of tradition of tax discipline, this decision will more likely lead to a decrease, rather than an increase, in actual tax receipts. I would more likely name as an obvious target an increase in the rates of the land tax as a perfectly natural direction for making up "falling" revenues. The document on reforming state enterprises has been in preparation for a long time. It makes it possible to take one more step to eliminate the completely irregular situation when the directors of the state enterprises, within the framework of the concept introduced by us back at the end of the eighties of full economic management, received rights I usually compare with the rights of regimental commanders--to declare war, to conclude peace, and to sell off their regimental property with such obvious serious consequences for the national economy. Now it is possible to strengthen control over the state enterprises' work and to create incentives for their more or less normal behavior.
