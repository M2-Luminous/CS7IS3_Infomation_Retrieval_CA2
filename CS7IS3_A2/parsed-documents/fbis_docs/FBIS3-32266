After a tour through Granada, which included visits and meetings at private enterprises and the inauguration of a municipal office of the Social Action Ministry, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the government will not allow small groups to turn the country into a state of outrageous chaos. "Civil disobedience means chaos, and in chaos very few people win anything. I do not believe we can solve Nicaragua's problems that way," the high-ranking official stated. "I hope that is nothing more than a pressure tactic from them (Sandinist Labor Union) to make the negotiations advance," he said, adding the government "has been negotiating since last week." Five transportation commissions--minus the pro-Sandinist CNT [National Transportation Commission]--reached an agreement this morning with the government for the reduction and freezing of the price of gasoline and diesel until 31 May and 30 April respectively. Lacayo insisted dialogue must continue to be the "weapon" Nicaraguans have in "this new stage." "He who resorts to another method has been left behind in the past, and the Nicaraguan people will withdraw their support for him." Regarding a question about the negotiations between the government and the International Monetary Fund, Lacayo reported that last year the IMF, known for its harsh adjustment policies, had recommended an "exaggerated" amount of saving that the people could not bear. He explained, however, that the intention is to have the state, not the people, control its spending so that the government will spend less, operating from the taxes it collects, he said. The intention is for the government to have a surplus so that part of the investments may come from revenues from the people, because "we suspect foreign aid will decrease gradually, and we Nicaraguans must be sure that we will be able to stand on our own feet through our own effort," he added. "Therefore, we have to start, as they say, becoming disciplined in order to live off our own effort, and that is what it is all about," he said. The IMF has told the government it has to save more this year in order to allot more funds to production so that it will take off faster. In principle, the government agrees with the idea of saving but disagrees with the extremely high amounts the IMF is trying to impose, he said. Nevertheless, the government and IMF have been negotiating since April and September and have agreed on a "more moderate amount," Lacayo said, adding that "even this way, it is costing us very much." "We believe, however, we already have different plans, including the privatization of part of Telcor [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute], which will help us achieve this goal this year."
