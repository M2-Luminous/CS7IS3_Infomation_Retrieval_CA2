Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, charge d'affaires of the local Russian Embassy, and registered "a formal diplomatic protest over circumstances" surrounding the arrest of the former chief of the Soviet Branch of the CIA's counter-intelligence group. At the center of the latest diplomatic bickering is Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, who was arrested Monday by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). Christopher "protested the allegations of the Russian intelligence service in engaging in the alleged espionage activities at issue in this case," State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said in a statement. Clinton has directed National Security Advisor W. Anthony and others to gauge the damages caused by ames' selling of the CIA's vital operations and personnel information to Russia. In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering also "raised this case with senior Russian officials," McCurry said. A senior administration official was quoted as saying that Moscow had been told to take responsibility for the case to avoid damaging the U.S.-Russian relationships. Washington was demanding that Russia recall their diplomats involved or, the anonymous official said, the U.S. would "take the actions ourselves." During the past nine years until his arrest on Monday, the Justice Department said, Ames and his 41-year-old wife Maia del Rosario Casas received more than 1.5 million dollars from the former Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving vital information on the CIA's operations and personnel. If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of life imprisonment and 500,000 dollars in fines. According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information to, and received cash from, Russians through "dead drops" in the Washington, D.C. area. A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign agent drops off or picks up material from his contact. It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of the couple's arrest. When telephoned for comments on the U.S. protest, a duty officer in the local Russian Embassy said nobody from the press office was available today. Attorney Fahey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife, a native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at least two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money they got from the Russians. The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000 dollar house, Jaguar automobiles and more than 165,000 dollars in stocks and securities. FBI agents have seized the couple's residence in Arlington, Virginia, and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or controlled by the couple in the United States and abroad. Ames' wife is a part-time student at Georgetown University and previously acted as a paid source for the CIA in Mexico City, Mexico. "FBi Agents worked doggedly on this case -- not for months but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every step of the way," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.
