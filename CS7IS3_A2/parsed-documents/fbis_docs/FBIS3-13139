Palestinian observers and diplomats dismissed the group as insignificant. Some said they never heard of such a group and others said it did not represent any large number of Palestinians and did not enjoy grass-roots support. The group, if indeed it has any membership that warrants such a description, appears to be one that first surfaced in Jordan in late 1990, mainly represented by one man who used to describe himself as a Palestinian journalist who was forced out of Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion of the emirate. The man, who gave varying names to different people, claimed that he represented "the sons of Palestine who enjoy grass-roots support in the occupied territories, particularly the West Bank." "We will show our real strength when the time is right, and we will take over the leadership of the Palestinian people everywhere," the man has reportedly told news organisations before disappearing from view for some time. According to some Palestinian sources, the man has supporters among a few of the Palestinian returnees from Kuwait who resented the PLO's sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. The PLO stand, they argued, had led to their ouster from the emirate. A copy of a letter from the group, addressed to "United States of America, Washington, White House, his kind attention his excellency the president of the United States Mr. Bill Clinton" (sic), was made available to the JORDAN TIMES Tuesday [8 March]. The typed message was on a letterhead bearing the name "Palestinian government -- provisional leadership council," and had an official-looking rubber stamp. A recorded voice answered calls to a telephone number given in the letterhead. No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Embassy here, whether it had received a copy of the letter or how it was treating the purported group. The undated letter said the PLO "doesn't represent the Palestinians under the occupation and immigrants all over the world," and that the Tunis-based organisation "represets only those who are employees and having orders and salaries from (Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat." "We as Palestinians are very grateful to your adminstration, which collected financial aid to the occupied territories," said the letter, written in poor English, in an apparent reference to Washington's role in securing international pledges worth more than $2.2 billion to support the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord. The rambling letter, parts of which did not make much sense, said economic development of the occupied territories was not possible if it was "run by military mentality people," and suggested that an international conference be held in Jordan to elect "a temporary Palestinian administration to run the occupied territories" with help from Jordan. The proposed administration should tackle the various aspects of the situation of the occupied territories, including economics, health, agriculture, education, public relations, industry and investment, it said. According to the group, participants in the proposed administration should include Palestine, Jordan and unspecified "other areas" and "some persons" from the PLO in their capacity as independents. A pre-qualification set by the group for anyone to take part in the proposed administration is "good behaviour" and a "behaviour certificate" from the country of residence. It called for the establishment of a "Jordanian-Palestinian national bank for development" with 50 percent of the equity for Jordan and Palestine and the rest for countries which have pledged aid. The capital for the bank could come from the pledged funds and the institution will be run by a committee under the "supervision of your administration," the letter told President Clinton. It also called for the establishment of a society "for old fighters" to be trained in civil administration and development and to "let them (old fighters) live a pure life by cleaning the military mentality that they (have) lived..." It argued that "any Palestinian state couldn't act without a link with Jordan" and expressed "hope that matters (will) turn back to (pre)-1967 June (as) a result of a survey (presumably a referendum)." "Let the Jordanians and Palestinians give any name to the new unity," it said. "This unity will (preempt) establishing different administrations... the nature of partnership between (the) West and East Bank(s) of (the) Jordan River could be not separated... "Jordan has given opportunities for immigrants to take their chances to grow up educationally and financially," said the four page letter. "People are fair will consider how much Jordan (spent) on such... matters..." [sentence as published] "If such a link takes place," said the letter, "the replacement of Jordan (as) Palestine will be completely" preempted.
