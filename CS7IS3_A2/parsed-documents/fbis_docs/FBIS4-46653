L. Lidov, N. M. Teslenko, Institute of Applied Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 521.1;523.44] [Abstract] Most gravitational maneuvers have involved the planets rather than the Moon, although as far back as 1959 the unmanned Luna-3 craft used lunar gravitation to produce a return trajectory that would be better for the transmission of images of the far side of the Moon. The researchers here show that a good number of missions to asteroids that are approaching the Earth's orbit can use lunar gravity to good effect, i.e., the fuel savings would enable larger payloads. Most profiles require that a velocity of 1.3-2.5 km/s be achieved, which means that more than 150 m/s could be saved with a lunar flyby in terms of characteristic velocity. The trajectory proposed would approximate sectors of conical sections. If used for the mission to the McAuliffe asteroid in the INEO project, the savings in characteristic velocity would be 183 m/s.
