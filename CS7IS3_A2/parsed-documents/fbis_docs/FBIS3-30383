The letter also reads: We are ready to work with the political and military structures of the alliance, participate in joint military maneuvers and consultations on defense and security, and take advantage of other possibilities offered by the PFP. We are willing to offer a company, as well as our naval and air bases for the PFP purposes. Albania is the first ex-communist country to have requested NATO membership. Albania's goal continues to be membership in the North Atlantic Alliance. The talks concluded that Albania will be prepared to draft the position paper and sign the PFP agreement in Brussels.
