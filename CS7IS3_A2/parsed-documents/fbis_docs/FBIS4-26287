Government officials said here today that the aim of the proposed consultations among various South Korean ministries was to promote intra-Korean economic exchange, which has been stalled due to the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program. The inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in the near future, with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam having accepted an invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song conveyed to him by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter last Saturday [18 June]. The officials said that the first stage of ministerial meetings will involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the Economic Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry. More detailed consultations will be held after the summit and an ensuing meeting between the prime ministers of South Korea and the DPRK, they said. South Korea's private sector in particular is expected to accelerate direct trade and joint investment with the DPRK, if the summit takes place and the obstacles to economic cooperation are removed, the officials added.
