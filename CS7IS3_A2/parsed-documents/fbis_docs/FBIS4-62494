For this particular reason, measures envisaged by the president's decree and the law on residential housing are targeted at both creating a national housing market and promoting construction. One of the specific steps in this direction is setting up a housing banks network which will make low rate mortgages available for building detached houses and blocks of apartments. These banks will give priority in granting mortgages to people in great need of housing. For the first time ever, mortgages will be given if secured against property collaterals. The state-owned housing will be built only for the socially unprotected groups of the population. Currently six housing banks are being set up in the Republic. One of them is located in Kokshetau. Now its leadership, together with the oblast administration and national bank's directorate, is training personnel and looking for finance. The oblast will now have 15 banks.
