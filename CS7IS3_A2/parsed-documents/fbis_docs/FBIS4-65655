The Union wishes to emphasise that these agreements do not limit Latvia's sovereignty and will not delay the development of closer ties between Latvia and the European institutions, for which the Union has often demonstrated its support. The signing of these agreements represents an important event in the history of independent Latvia and removes a major obstacle in the development of bilateral relations with Russia, based on good neighbourly relations and mutual respect. Followed by early ratification on both sides, the signature will form a tangible contribution to overall stability in the Baltic region and thus form part of the perspective created by the European Union initiative on a stability pact in Europe.
