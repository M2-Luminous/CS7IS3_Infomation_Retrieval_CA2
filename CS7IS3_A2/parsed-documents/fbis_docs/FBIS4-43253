At 1800 hours he gave a press conference to reply to Berlusconi and to present the League with a line to follow after its election defeat. It can all be summed up in one word, the one that Berlusconi has been using for some time -- "loyalty," which he repeated six times to journalists. Loyalty to the government, albeit together with a promise that there will always be "a trial of strength" on "matters of principle" -- legislation on television and monopolies. This came together with an announcement that the establishment of a separatist League faction will be made official [at a League rally] in Pontida. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a return to your origins? [Bossi] The League was born separatist, but we did not want to split the country. Over half the party is federalist, and this position is a strategic one within the government. However, there is a need for a separatist faction, and the time has come to establish a differentiation. [LA REPUBBLICA] This decision could lead to a loss of support from the more moderate voters. [Bossi] I have no idea how strong the separatist faction could be, but the path to be pursued is not dissimilar to that formerly traveled by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] in order to attract moderates and Communist Renewal, the angry votes. The League must follow this path: There is a moderate vote and a separatist vote; and we must work along separate channels. [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you judge the election result? [Bossi] It reflects the country's internal situation. There is a difficulty in terms of governability, and the vote went in that direction, rewarding Forza Italia. We opted to stand alone in order to clarify our position. There are two tendencies within the government -- one, neoliberal: the League; the other, die-hard capitalist: Forza Italia and the AN [National Alliance]. These two forces cannot be superimposed. [LA REPUBBLICA] You wanted a clarification but you lost. [Bossi] We chose the European elections, which have less impact than the general elections, to make it clear that we are not subordinate, but also to indicate to the country that it must not regard as fights what are in fact discussions between conservative forces and a force that one could define as neoliberal, namely, the League. [LA REPUBBLICA] Your allies accuse you of disloyalty. [Bossi] I am loyal to the government. There could be no other government. [LAS REPUBBLICA] For the first time in its history, the League has suffered a heavy defeat. [Bossi] The loss was expected. Of course, some percentages were not forecast. But this was the price that we had to pay after the establishment of the Freedom Alliance. [LA REPUBBLICA] A price? [Bossi] People saw Berlusconi as the cat and us as the mouse. If we had not made ourselves visible, this game would have caused the League to merge inevitably with Forza Italia. [LA REPUBBLICA] But you have waged guerrilla warfare within the government. [Bossi] I repeat: We have the utmost loyalty to this government. [LA REPUBBLICA] Why did Berlusconi win? [Bossi] It is no coincidence that someone who is involved with supermarkets won support. Berlusconi won because he was best at selling fantasies and hopes. [LA REPUBBLICA] He won, you lost. What do you have to say to him now? [Bossi] Good luck. [LA REPUBBLICA] You have 180 members of parliament, but only a little more than 6 percent -- an inconsistency which some people would like to reduce. [Bossi] What counts is the 180 members of parliament, not idle talk. [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government, but also about trials of strength. What if, let us imagine, the trial of strength over antitrust legislation were to result in a rupture? [Bossi] Perfect: Then the country will know who is to blame; it will know that Berlusconi, with all his television channels, does not want to change anything. [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government, but you seem to be looking to the Left too. [Bossi] We are advocates of economic liberalism; the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leaders could be so too, but the grassroots are marxists. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think there could be early elections? [Bossi] The country should fear them, because of the chaos they would cause. But the League is not afraid of them: When they come, we will be there. But I do not think that Berlusconi wants them. His strength lies in guaranteeing governability. [LA REPUBBLICA] There are signs of dissent within the League. [Interior Minister] Maroni is proposing an organizational union with Forza Italia and the AN. [Milan Mayor] Formentini says that there must be an end to the attacks on the government. What is going on? [Bossi] I fear that an organizational union would be inconsistent with the League's values: It would be a mess. Organizational integration would inevitably also entail political integration. [LA REPUBBLICA] [PDS Secretary] Occhetto has resigned after the defeat. Have you considered doing so? [Bossi] No, what happened was forecast.
