Will the "peace of the courageous," as President Clinton praised the historic agreement achieved by you and Israeli head of government Yitzhaq Rabin, now end in a capitulation of the discouraged? ['Arafat] There is no doubt that Hebron was an attack on the peace process. I had just signed an agreement with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Cairo, which dealt with confidence building measures and the loosening of the "iron fist" policy that is pursued by Israel. For instance, a large number of interned Palestinians were supposed to be released. [DER SPIEGEL] Peres promised you this action for the beginning of Ramadan, the month of fasting? ['Arafat] Yes, but this has not taken place. Instead, our people and the entire world were surprised by the massacre. Since the signing of the peace agreement last September, Israel's leadership has constantly engaged in maneuvers to avoid the implementation of the treaty. [DER SPIEGEL] You get the impression that Rabin is deliberately playing for time? ['Arafat] Of course. It was Rabin who said: "There are no sacrosanct deadlines or topics for negotiation." Thus, the Israeli leadership is fully responsible for the delays in implementing the agreement. [DER SPIEGEL] But Rabin called you immediately after the massacre and expressed shock about the bloody deed. ['Arafat] This is true. However, what happened there in reality? I was immediately in contact with the hospitals and the injured people. I got the impression -- and I told Rabin so -- that the Israeli Army had made common cause with the extremist settlers. [DER SPIEGEL] Because the guards at the Ibrahim Mosque did not intervene? ['Arafat] No one can enter this mosque without permission by the Israeli guards. How was it possible for a group -- because it can hardly have been an individual -- to enter there? The Israelis claim that the killer fired only 114 shots. However, the number of those killed and injured was 322. At least 1,000 shots were fired. some of the praying people were hit by several bullets. There were seven bullets in the muezzin's body alone. How can 114 shots cause so much damage? [DER SPIEGEL] How did Rabin respond to your assertions? ['Arafat] "Investigations are under way," he said. "What kind of investigations?" I asked him and I made it clear to him that I have clear facts. Several believers were shot directly by the Israeli Army -- at the portal, when they came out of the mosque.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...this sounds as if this had not been a mad deed by Jewish extremist Goldstein but a conspiracy. ['Arafat] And it continues like that. Since the massacre we have had 28 martyrs and about 300 injured. This is a constant bloodbath, committed by Israeli Army soldiers, who patrol together with armed settlers. And then Rabin just tells me: "Investigations are under way." [DER SPIEGEL] Do you want to say that Rabin has lost control or that he is part of a conspiracy? ['Arafat] He himself should comment on that. I just present the facts; others can judge them. But I have the right to ask: Is there a secret organization in the Israeli Army in league with the armed settlers? [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin and you probably knew what could happen. When the two of you met for the first time in President Clinton's presence before the ceremony for signing the agreement in Washington, you briefly discussed that. ['Arafat] Nonsense, we did not exchange a word at that time. [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin said in an interview with DER SPIEGEL that you both noted that implementing the agreement would be "very difficult." ['Arafat] When the three of us were together, we were silent. Clinton asked us not to make any comments before the agreement was signed. We adhered to that. President Clinton is my witness. [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless, both sides knew about the potential danger emanating from the extremists in both camps. ['Arafat] If Rabin knew it, then why did he delay the implementation of the agreement? I emphatically warned him during our subsequent meetings: If we do not make progress quickly, we will get into great difficulties. Therefore, we have to act quickly. [DER SPIEGEL] Obviously, Rabin was not quite of that opinion. ['Arafat] There is a very mean sentence by Rabin. He said: "I will let 'Arafat sweat." [DER SPIEGEL] It is undisputed that most Israelis are outraged and ashamed about the massacre of Hebron. ['Arafat] This would then be a very good opportunity for Rabin to put the curb on his people and to take specific steps, if he is really interested in peace. So far, he has not done anything except talk. Six months have passed since the Washington agreement, and Rabin is always just talking about the settlers' safety. Now, however, everybody realizes that the safety of the Palestinian people is in the foreground first. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you leave open the question of the Jewish settlements, which is perhaps the key problem for peace, at the secret negotiations in Oslo? ['Arafat] We did not exclude this topic at all; it is on our agenda. [DER SPIEGEL] But, according to the Oslo Declaration of Principles, this issue has to be negotiated only "at the beginning of the third year of the transition period." ['Arafat] Now you listen to me: The topic "Jewish settlers" was on our agenda in Oslo, in Washington, in Davos, and in Cairo. However, the Israelis are postponing discussion on this matter and remain inflexible, while I was very flexible. After the signing of the Cairo agreement, Peres boasted in the Knesset that he had repeatedly "defeated" 'Arafat. What is that supposed to mean? I did not react to that. Such statements show that the Israelis basically want to force us to make concessions. [DER SPIEGEL] The Israelis claim the same thing about you. ['Arafat] They interpret our flexibility as their victory. For us flexibility means coming a bit closer to peace. [DER SPIEGEL] How are things now supposed to continue? How can the train of peace be put back on its track? ['Arafat] This is not our responsibility. Now the co-sponsors should take care of that, those who signed the treaty together with us, such as President Clinton. [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin does not want to heed any of your demands, which exceed the formulations of the Oslo agreement. He wants neither to disarm the settlers nor to dissolve the settlements. ['Arafat] The Oslo agreement speaks only of two authorities: the Israeli Army in the territories where it is stationed and the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. It does not say a word about a third authority -- the settlers. The Israeli Army is supposed to ensure the protection of the settlers. For what do the settlers need weapons then? [DER SPIEGEL] After all, Jewish settlers have also been killed by Palestinians. ['Arafat] Do not forget that Hebron was not the first massacres committed against Palestinians. A massacre also took place in 1990 in the front yard of the al-'Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. [DER SPIEGEL] If it comes to calculating, the Israelis accuse the Arabs of the massacre in the synagogue in Istanbul, where 22 Jews were killed seven years ago. ['Arafat] Why do you say things like that? I was not responsible for that. These were extremists. [DER SPIEGEL] Once again, how do you want to make progress now? ['Arafat] Do not ask me but Rabin, because it is his business to make progress with the process. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that the Israelis do not want peace? ['Arafat] So far, it looks as if they did not want peace. I am a pragmatist and realist, and it is the facts that count for me. [DER SPIEGEL] After the disappointments of the past months, have you lost the courage to follow the path toward peace unfalteringly? ['Arafat] I am not joking about such things. The decision for peace is not my personal decision but that of the PLO Central Council. If I want to turn the helm around again, I have to go to the Central Council again. We are proud of our democracy; I am not a dictator. [DER SPIEGEL] You have repeatedly said that the peace process is irreversible. ['Arafat] Yes, but it seems that the Israelis, who signed the agreement too, do not respect this decision. [DER SPIEGEL] But what would be the alternative to the peace process -- did you and Rabin not long ago reach the point where one can only take the bull by the horns and not turn back again? ['Arafat] Rabin is obviously not willing to join in. He is still waiting for me to sweat, as he says. [DER SPIEGEL] How long can you still sweat? ['Arafat] Rabin should know how persistent I am. In 1982 he, together with Defense Minister Sharon, looked for me in vain in Beirut for three months. [DER SPIEGEL] Will the Hebron massacre not be evidence for many that peaceful coexistence of the 1 million Palestinians and the 120,000 Jewish settlers is impossible? ['Arafat] Rabin has insisted often enough that Israel does not need the settlements, which were established for political motives.... [DER SPIEGEL] ....but he wants to keep those of the total 144 settlements in Gaza and the West Bank that are relevant for security. ['Arafat] He could evacuate the settlements held by Jewish extremists and fanatics. We will see what happens. [DER SPIEGEL] This seems to be a path toward a solution: giving up the settlements in particularly sensitive places, such as Hebron, Gaza, and Nablus? ['Arafat] Yes, the elimination of these political settlements that are now hotbeds of danger. This would be my advice. [DER SPIEGEL] Will Palestinian policemen protect Jewish settlers, if they are attacked? ['Arafat] This must still be negotiated in the autonomy talks, but first the settlers must be disarmed. [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin would hardly survive this in domestic policy at the moment. ['Arafat] He could at least start with the fanatics. In any case, one of the most important points that we must discuss soon is the final status of the settlements. According to the text of the framework agreement, this should be done as soon as possible. But Rabin is delaying everything and is playing for time. [DER SPIEGEL] Why? What could he gain by doing that? ['Arafat] One of his goals is to weaken me. Can you explain to me why else he is insulting me and boasting that he is letting me sweat? [DER SPIEGEL] We do not understand this logic, because after you he will have to deal with the gentlemen of the more radical HAMAS. ['Arafat] You had better ask him that himself. Of course, I have my thoughts about that, but I prefer to keep them to myself. [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not absurd to assume that 100 years of hatred and distrust between Jews and Palestinians can be overcome within a few months, by decree, so to speak? ['Arafat] What does the term "peace of the courageous" mean? That one must be ready to face all difficulties. What did De Gaulle do, what are De Klerk and Mandela doing? Where there is a will, there is a way. [DER SPIEGEL] In Jerusalem fliers of your al-Fatah movement now call for "revenge by all means." A retaliatory massacre on Jews would probably torpedo the peace process once and for all. ['Arafat] How enormous do you think the pressure of our grass-roots is? The situation is extremely critical. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you no longer have your young people under control and those activists who accuse you of having made too many concessions to Israel? ['Arafat] These critics have not felt any improvement of the living conditions since the signing of the agreement in Washington. On the contrary, they see that the occupation army is getting increasingly brutal. Just because of this potential of danger we should come to an agreement as quickly as possible. The Israelis must withdraw quickly. As soon as the first soldiers and administrative officials have been withdrawn from the autonomous areas, the tensions will ease automatically. [DER SPIEGEL] Even your most loyal followers think that you are in hellish difficulties and that the radicals are on their way up. ['Arafat] Yes, we have to expect that. What is going on in the occupied territories now gives an impetus to the extremists. [DER SPIEGEL] On both sides. ['Arafat] The worse thing is that the peace process is pushed into a corner. I myself still have several options. [DER SPIEGEL] Who can save the peace process in the Middle East? ['Arafat] Washington together with the Israelis. [DER SPIEGEL] Abu 'Ammar, you have always led a dangerous life, but this agreement with Israel puts you under a particularly great risk. Is it still worth the danger? ['Arafat] The basic cause is worth it. The important thing is not I but our children's future. [DER SPIEGEL] Where is the threshold that you will not cross? ['Arafat] It will not be I who decide on this issue but the Palestinian leadership. At the moment we are discussing a new assessment of the overall situation. [DER SPIEGEL] When will you be in Jericho, and when will your wish to pray in the al-'Aqsa Mosque be fulfilled? ['Arafat] I should have been there long ago, but now I would prefer not to commit myself to a date. [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds like someone who has lost his illusions. ['Arafat] Are six months of waiting for the fulfillment of promises made in the agreement and then the Hebron massacre not sufficient to achieve that? [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin tells us that in 1994 the Middle East will reach a turning point: The signs are either indicating peace or new confrontations in the long term. Do you agree with him in this respect? ['Arafat] These words mean that Rabin will not withdraw from the occupied territories. He is the one who is holding the key to peace in his hands, not me. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chairman, thank you for this interview.
