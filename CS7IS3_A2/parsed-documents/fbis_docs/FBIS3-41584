Kozlowski: We already spend more than 12 trillion zlotys [Z] a year for that purpose. Our index of outlays is climbing steadily. Not so long ago our expenditure on environmental protection represented 0.5 percent of the national income, whereas now this has risen to a little above 1 percent. It is a new sphere of economic activity, and its development rate is quite dynamic. Bobecki: Does the Presidential Ecological Council endeavor to secure guarantees for pro-ecological investment projects? Kozlowski: The government is reluctant to extend its guarantees for ecological investment projects. Consequently, we intend to achieve a situation in which the National Fund, which is our richest source of funds, would extend certain guarantees to those Western companies which intend to invest in Poland. We have already lost a number of opportunities for securing foreign capital for investment projects because of the absence of government guarantees. This difficulty should be resolved as soon as possible. Bobecki: Could you share with us your personal reflections on certain matters which you have been monitoring closely for a number of years now? How do we look compared with the rest of the world? Kozlowski: Compared with the rest of the world, we are relatively busy in the field of pro-ecological activities. Much busier than our immediate neighbors -- except perhaps for the former East Germany. But that is because they receive colossal sums of money for environmental protection from the western part of Germany. Poland is undoubtedly in the forefront of our group as regards setting up integrated financing, organizational, and information systems, and it could continue to play this leading role in the future. There has been considerable and noticeable improvement in many areas. The construction of a number of effluent treatment systems has contributed to improved water purity in many of our rivers, while decreased production in certain sectors of our economy caused a reduction in atmospheric pollution and a drop in the content of sulphur in the atmosphere. However, a new area of environmental risk has emerged in the agricultural sector. Fertilizers washed down from our fields into ground waters are causing an environmental degradation of our lakes. Another great problem is caused by small industrial producers who notoriously ignore and bypass the requirements of legal regulations devised to protect the environment. Our liberal legislation allows virtually anyone to set up an industrial enterprise without the need to comply with any terms or conditions. In consequence, such enterprises become a nuisance and a potential danger not only to their immediate neighbors. Small industrial companies situated around Warsaw are particularly aggressive. I am very much concerned about certain moves made by the State Agency for Agricultural Property. It has been selling -- into private hands -- landed properties constituting some of our most valuable sites of special scientific interest, since only unspoiled natural areas are of interest to buyers nowadays. Most recently, the agency has offered a number of... lakes for sale! We believe that this should not be tolerated. Lakes could at most be rented out, not sold. The practice of selling lakes to private buyers contravenes basic principles of regional land and economic management and goes against the state's obligations to society, not to mention the fact that it also constitutes a threat to our most valuable natural resources. This underlines the fact that we lack satisfactory control mechanisms for regulating privatization schemes in agriculture. At the same time, we still lack a properly standardized procedure for ecological auditing to be carried out whenever a given enterprise undergoes a privatization process. Even the most major companies are privatized without an assessment of their potential for causing ecological damage. We have not been able to work out suitable solutions despite the work of the joint commission of the Ministry of Ownership Transformations and the environmental protection sector. When it comes to the reform process, we are definitely not forceful enough in introducing ecological protection mechanisms into privatization transformations. Bobecki: What causes this inability to be more forceful? Kozlowski: The fact that legislation work on the drafting of a new ecology law has been checked. In the 10th [old] Sejm we drafted and passed four laws, but another five are still awaiting action. The subsequent dissolution of the First [new] Sejm did not help to advance our work. This hiatus is very dangerous, because we have only reached the halfway mark in our work on the transformation of the ecology laws. Bobecki: Which are the most important ecology laws that the new Sejm should pass as soon as possible? Kozlowski: A truly dramatic situation obtains in our water management sector: We have no relevant legislation on water resources and their management, and Poland simply cannot function without such a law. We have no legislation concerning extraordinary environmental hazards. The chemical, transport, and (foreign) nuclear energy industries pose a whole range of dramatically increasing ecological risks. We have no adequate laws, organizational structures, or procedures to resort to in cases of specific extraordinary hazards endangering the environment. We have no law on industrial waste materials. Poland is at present virtually deluged with industrial waste. We struggle with this problem in every single parish and every single city in the country. These questions must be resolved as soon as possible, because speed is absolutely essential here. The fact that successive parliaments have been unable even to initiate a debate on these issues is highly alarming, to say the least. Another example, this time somewhat bizarre, concerns the situation in the sphere of game shooting and hunting laws. Two successive parliaments have failed to sort out things in this complicated area, and such issues as questions of property and ownership relating to game shooting and hunting and the principles of managing game stocks in Poland are still unresolved. Bobecki: Is our present legislation relating to ecology really as defective as that? Kozlowski: It is. All legal acts concerning the sphere of ecology were originally devised to fit the requirements of a totalitarian state. Now we must adapt all legislation concerning the sphere of ecology to the needs of a free market economy. Bobecki: Thank you for talking to us.
