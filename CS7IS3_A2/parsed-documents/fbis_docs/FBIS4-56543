One of the environmental groups, Greenpeace, currently attending the conference, says the SIDS conference is not addressing important environmental issues. Anna Toney, head of the Greenpeace delegation now in Barbados, spoke with Michelle Arthur about this matter. [Begin recording] [Arthur] According to Miss Toney, the [word indistinct] conference is not adequately dealing with environmental issues. She says the real conference promises were made to host the conference on sustainable development [words indistinct], but what is happening is Barbados is another talk shop. [Toney] Two years later, we come here to Barbados, and yet again a lot of rhetoric, and I really do believe that there be threats of environment [words indistinct] development are so big that they can no longer wait, so [words indistinct] action plan do germinate some of the issues with very much concern such as climate change, such as [word indistinct] (bleaching), fisheries and others. We really hope the developed countries will try to give in much more on the international side of the action plan because it is all very well to tell the small developing states what they should be doing at home when you know that they do not really have to contribute too much for the environmental problems they are now facing [as heard]. [Arthur] The Greenpeace delegate is also concerned about the amount of paper and plastic materials used at the UN conference. She said the number of press releases and plastic cups and plates being used should be reduced. Greenpeace also plans to meet with the Barbados fishing community within the next few days. Miss Toney says there are many common problems facing the fishing communities all over the world. The Greenpeace ship is now docked in Barbados. [end recording]
