As an example, he cited the discussion about the bugging of private residences, which is possible in all other European countries. "In Brussels, our great Europeans suddenly turn into completely narrow-minded people who insist on national competences," Stoiber stressed at a news conference in Brussels today, referring to the negative attitude of the Free Democratic Party on the issue of the bugging campaign. Stoiber accused Kinkel of preventing a standardization of the export regulations for goods that can be used for military and civilian purposes. Germany is the only country to reject that. Thus, there is the danger that German industry might transfer its activities to other countries of the European Union. A corresponding guideline for the so-called dual-use goods is currently under discussion. Since Germany has the strictest export regulations within the European Union for such products, Bonn insist on relative strict export regulations but is ready for concessions vis-a-vis other countries, experts have stated.
