Addressing a press conference tonight at the end of his three-day official visit to Bangladesh, Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific Raymond Chan said that Canada is not in favor of linking trade with the so-called "human rights" in China. It will strengthen it's trade as well as political, social and cultural exchanges with China, Chan affirmed. Replying to a question, Chan also said that "Asia-Pacific region is playing more and more important role in the world and is becoming a more important trade partner of Canada." Canada has to be more aggressive to seek out more trading partners in the region, the secretary for state said, adding: "Canada will continue to be friends of Asians." As regards water sharing dispute between India and Bangladesh as well as Kashmir issue, Chan noted that his country is in favor of resolving those issues through bilateral talks and negotiations. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is a good forum for resolving bilateral issues among SAARC member states, he stressed. Chan described Canada-Bangladesh relations as "very good," saying the recent economic and political developments here "make us optimistic about Bangladesh" and Canada would continue with its assistance to this country. Canada's development program for Bangladesh is its largest worldwide and Canada is one of the major contributors to development assistance here. Approximately 2 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) has been provided to Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. Chan arrived here on March 6.
