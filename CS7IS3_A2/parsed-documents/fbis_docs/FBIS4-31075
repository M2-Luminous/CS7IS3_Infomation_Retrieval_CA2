For Tirana, the population of which has reportedly reached 500,000, this problem has become rather pronounced. The figures made available to us by the Tariff Office of Tirana Municipality show that there are currently 2,322 Albanian companies employing 9,028 people, 586 foreign companies with 4,109 employees, and 1,007 joint ventures employing 4,100 people. In Tirana there are now 26,000 people employed in the private sector. There are also around 6,000 people trading a great variety of products from stalls that have sprung up on Tirana's pavements. However, unemployment in Tirana amounts to around 60,000, not to mention the influx into the capital from other districts, which is estimated at 100,000 people. Yet, in this overpopulation with a high degree of social wounds, there is a lack of a regional development plan. This remains to be done perhaps in the future.
