FR940825-2-00040 FR940825-2-00019 Objectives At the scoping meetings, the Commission staff will: (1) summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue, and (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS. Meeting Procedures The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and, thereby, will become a part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding on this project. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to identify themselves for the record. Concerned parties are encouraged to offer us verbal guidance during public meetings. Speaking time allowed for individuals will be determined before each meeting, based on the number of persons wishing to speak and the approximate amount of time available for the session, but all speakers will be provided at least five minutes to present their views. Persons choosing not to speak but wishing to express an opinion, as well as speakers unable to summarize their positions within their allotted time, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. Written scoping comments may also be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until October 7, 1994. All filings should contain an original and 8 copies. Failure to file an original and 8 copies may result in appropriate staff not receiving the benefit of your comments in a timely manner. See 18 CFR 4.34(h). All correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Scoping Comments, Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project, FERC Nos. 2404&hyph;017 and 2419&hyph;007, Michigan. All those attending the meeting are urged to refrain from making any communications concerning the merits of the application to any member of the Commission staff outside of the established process for developing the record as stated into the record of the proceeding. Further, interested persons are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures, requiring parties or interceders (as defined in 18 CFR 385.2010) to file documents on each person whose name is on the official service list for this proceeding. See 18 CFR 4.34(b). For further information, please contact Ed Lee at (202) 219&hyph;2809. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
