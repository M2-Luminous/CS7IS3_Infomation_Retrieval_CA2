The president's remark was part of his message read at the inaugural session of the international seminar on development in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Foreign ministers and academy heads of the Central Asian and Caucasian countries as well as academicians from 17 countries are attending the seminar. Unfortunately, the message read, the unsuitable economic situation in the world and financial and economic bottlenecks among the majority of the developing nations have hindered process of the development of human resources. President Rafsanjani deplored that the outbreak of civil wars between some of the newly-independent Central Asian republics, in addition to imposing heavy arms expenses, had created obstacles for the economy of certain regional counties. "In the contemporary era when the so-called new world order is taking shape, there are still drastic and growing economic imbalance between the developed and the developing nations," the message said. Such a deep gap would not only have its adverse impacts on eonomic relations, it would also threaten international peace and tranquility, the president noted in his message. He expressed hope that the seminar could take effective steps in consolidation of diplomatic, economic and cultural ties among Central Asian and Caucasian countries and in further upgrading living standards of their nations. Experts and statesmen from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Britain, U.S., Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China, Lebanon, Cyprus, Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and U.N. Development Program (UNDP) are attending the 3-day seminar.
