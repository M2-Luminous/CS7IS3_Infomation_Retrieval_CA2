FR941031-0-00009 FR941031-0-00003 The Committee also provided for $1,652,750 for certain expenses likely to be incurred in connection with the 1994&hyph;95 raisin reserve pools for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless and Zante Currant raisins. Pool expenses are deducted from proceeds obtained from the sale of reserve raisins. These proposed expenses are $766,150 more than the $886,600 for 1993&hyph;94 reserve pool expenses. The larger administrative and reserve pool expenses result from the Committee's takeover of certain industry export marketing activities and the fact that the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisin crop is expected to be significantly larger than last year. This large crop, and the pooling of Zante Currant raisins for the first time in many years, will result in a larger quantity to be pooled and increased costs. Reserve pool expenditures are reviewed annually by the Department. A California State raisin marketing order was terminated earlier this year. Its administrative agency, the California Raisin Advisory Board (CALRAB), formerly conducted marketing promotion and paid advertising activities here and abroad for the California raisin industry. The Committee is taking over the funding and administration of the Market Promotion Program (MPP). The MPP, administered by the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), encourages the development, maintenance, and expansion of export markets for agricultural commodities like raisins. Recently, the FAS redirected MPP funds allocated to CALRAB for foreign promotion and advertising to the Committee which desires to use the funds to continue the industry's strong overseas promotion and advertising activities. To receive the full allocation ($4,479,549), the Committee must be able to show that it plans to spend, from industry sources, an amount equal to 50 percent of that allotment ($2,239,975). This spending can be for administration or promotion. The Committee recommended that the increased spending necessary to meet the required MPP matching figure be funded through increased handler assessments, reserve pool funds, and merchandising incentive program funds. Under the marketing order's volume regulation provisions, marketing percentages (free and reserve) for a varietal type can be implemented to stabilize supplies. The free percentage prescribes the portion of the crop that can be shipped immediately to any market. The reserve percentage prescribes the portion of the crop to be held for later shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee. Funds generated from the sales of reserve raisins, after deduction of reserve pool expenses, are distributed equally to equity holders in the pool (producers).
