It exposes the weaknesses, incongruities, errors, and interference by the selfsame U.S. drug policy and shows, in that respect, Washington has gone from militarist attitudes of the Bush administration to something very close to inconsistency. Examples of that are: Although the U.S. State Department deplores the inefficiency or lack of will on the part of the governments of Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and Lebanon, among others, in the counternarcotics trafficking struggle, it refuses to place them on the list of "punished" nations, such as Iran, Syria, Burma, and Nigeria, for reasons of "national security;" that is, for reasons totally removed from the drug topic. The U.S. document praises the Colombian Government for killing Pablo Escobar, top leader of the Medellin Cartel, despite the fact this, as well as other actions by Bogota authorities, did not significantly reduce the production and trafficking of cocaine, nor did it prevent the recent illegal production of heroin. In other words, the exhaustive violence unleashed in Colombia by the government's war against the Antioquia band has caused infinite deaths but has not reduced drug trafficking. In another sense, the report criticized Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, a man of renowned moral authority in Colombia, for negotiating with certain narcotraffickers the reduction of their sentences in exchange for their surrender. U.S. officials can hardly condemn this practice, however, when it is a daily practice in U.S. courts for prosecutors to offer the accused, whether or not they are narcotraffickers, more lenient sentences, acquittals, and even money and protection in exchange for information. Continuing with the examples, the U.S. State Department has stated the Peruvian Government is plagued by vast corruption, which makes it difficult to fight drugs, but does not say a single word about the same phenomenon in the United States. It omits the fact that only the corruption of government employees can explain the massive entry of drugs to the nation which consumes the most drugs in the world. Panama's case merits separate mention. With the pretext of fighting narcotrafficking, Panama was invaded violently by U.S. troops, a country whose institutions were destroyed and in which puppets to Washington's liking were placed in power. They are the same ones now accused by the State Department of doing nothing to eradicate the laundering of drug money. This fact constitutes either a demonstration a priori of how false the Bush administration arguments were or proof the interfering imposition of pro-U.S. governments is no guarantee that that drug policy will meet U.S. demands. After viewing the confused, partial, and interventionist nature of the report issued yesterday in Washington, the inclusion of Mexico on the list of nations that "have complied" is encouraging only in the sense it can be considered a guarantee that U.S. authorities will not use the narcotrafficking topic as a pretext to exert undue pressure against our country, as they have done other times. The assessment of Mexico's counterdrug struggle and achievements, viewed as important and commendable, corresponds solely and exclusively to Mexicans' sovereignty and no foreign government has the legal or moral authority to give "grades" on this or other domestic issues. Finally, and strangely enough, it should be noted the U.S. Government in its report is capable of setting aside its anti-Cuban phobia, giving a report devoid of ideology, although no less interfering, on the efforts by the Havana government in the counternarcotics trafficking struggle. Concerning the rest, the document presented by the U.S. State Department yesterday depicts a combination of deplorable attitudes, which hinder reaching international agreements that are needed to confront the drug plight with a global, multilateral spirit, to attack simultaneously consumption, production, and the illegal sale of drugs, respectful of sovereignties.
