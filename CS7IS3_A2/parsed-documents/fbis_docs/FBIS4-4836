During these days: 1. Our forces continued to block the entire Sala Krau-Kon Damrei route. The invading forces were completely cut off from their communications and supplies. 2. The entire route north of Pailin remained disconnected. The invading forces tried hard to contact their colleagues by travelling in small groups on foot through the jungle. We kept attacking them, though, and they also hit our land mines, suffering continuous losses. The survivors fled, leaving ammunition, dried food, and medicine along the way. Some fled into the dense forests. No one knows whether or not they are still alive. 3. On 1 April, we launched four attacks on the invading forces along a stretch of road from Veal Cheng to Sala Krau, killing 18 of them on the spot and wounding others. 4. The road from Sala Krau to O Rum-el was blocked by our forces in several places. On 2 April, we attacked the invading forces fleeing from the western part of Sala Krau in waves, killing 42 of them. 5. We are continuing to cut off the invading forces from all corners, and are waiting in the bamboo forests to smash them. They only have a small number of tanks left. These tanks do not dare to dash about and launch operations. They are in hiding, fearful that we will smash them. 6. Every day, we cut off the stretch of road from Suosdei to Chisang and Treng. The battle is continuing within the perimeter of Pailin and along the communications lines the invading forces are trying to use to send supplies to their colleagues within the perimeter of Pailin. The invading forces cannot bring their dead or wounded colleagues out because they cannot get there either on foot or by air. More puppet soldiers are continuing to desert the Pailin battlefield for fear of being killed.
