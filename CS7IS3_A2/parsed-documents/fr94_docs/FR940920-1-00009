FR940920-1-00009 FR940920-1-00002 B. Schedule II, Service Company Property The Commission proposes to add a new Account 101.1_Property Under Capital Leases to this schedule. 14 Capitalized lease assets are not currently reported in Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60. The amendment is necessary to provide disclosure concerning this significant category of service company property. There would be a corresponding amendment to Schedule I, the balance sheet. 15 14 A capital lease is defined in Paragraphs 6(a) and 7 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, as a lease meeting one of four specified criteria concerning economic indicia of ownership. The criteria include length of lease term, present value of lease payments, and provision for transfer or purchase of the underlying asset at the lease term. 15 A capital lease generally is recorded on a company's balance sheet both as an asset and as a corresponding liability. C. Schedule IV, Investments Currently, Schedule IV contains three accounts: Account 123_Investment in Associate Companies; Account 124_Other Investments; and Account 136_Temporary Cash Investments. The Commission proposes to add a new Account 128_Other Special Funds. Account 128 would include investments that have been segregated in special funds for insurance, employee pensions, savings, relief, hospital, and other purposes not provided for elsewhere. The proposed amendment would provide detail, currently lacking, with respect to these investments. D. Schedule V, Accounts Receivable Schedule V requires the reporting of accounts receivable from associate companies in Account 146_Accounts Receivable From Associate Companies. The Commission is proposing to amend the instructions to Schedule V to require identification of associate company receivables that have been outstanding for 60&hyph;90 days and for more than 90 days from the due date. Companies that do not pay in a timely manner are effectively subsidized by the other system companies that do timely pay. The Commission believes that the proposed amendment will encourage service companies to adopt administrative controls to ensure that receivables are collected within ninety days. The Commission has proposed a $25,000 threshold for reporting under this account but requests comment on whether a higher threshold, such as a $50,000 limit, as suggested by AEP, would be more appropriate. In addition, the Commission is proposing to amend Schedule V to add a new Account 143 that would require the reporting of accounts receivable from nonassociate companies, to provide more complete information in this area. E. Schedule XIV, Statement of Income This schedule, currently under Schedule XV, requires the reporting of the income and expenses of the service company. Because the schedule does not contain any balance sheet accounts, a service company cannot necessarily report an item in a manner consistent with its treatment on the books of the associate company customer. As a result, commenters have noted that service companies are effectively required to maintain two sets of books, one for purposes of Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 and the Uniform System of Accounts, and another to comply with the FERC System of Accounts. 16 The Commission is concerned that the current system results in unnecessary expense and duplication of effort for system companies. 16 See supra note 8 and accompanying text. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to include two categories of expenses, one relating to the income statement and the other relating to the balance sheet. A number of new accounts would be added to the present income statement accounts. Specifically, the amendment would add new Accounts 500&hyph;557_Power Production, Accounts 560&hyph;598_Transmission & Distribution Expenses, Accounts 901&hyph;905_Customer Accounts, and Accounts 906&hyph;917_Customer Service & Information. New accounts would also be added in Accounts 927_935_Other Administrative and General Expenses, Accounts 403_407_Depreciation and Amortization, Accounts 409_411.4_Income Taxes, Accounts 426.1_426.5_Other Deductions, and Accounts 427_431_Interest Expense. In addition, the amended schedule would include the following balance sheet accounts: Account 107_Construction Work in Progress, Accounts 108&hyph;115_Accumulated Provision for Depreciation, Account 163_Store Expenses Undistributed, Account 174_Miscellaneous Current & Accrued Assets, Account 183_Preliminary Engineering, Account 186_Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, Account 188_Research & Development, and an unnumbered account for other balance sheet expenses. The Commission also proposes to add a new income account, Account 419_Interest Income. F. Schedule XV, Analysis of Charges-Direct vs. Indirect Under the current schedule, service companies must report the amount of charges to associate and nonassociate companies, and categorize the charges as either direct ( i.e., a charge for a specific service provided to a customer) or indirect ( i.e., an allocated charge for an overhead expense of the service company). The Commission proposes to amend the schedule to require consistent treatment of a charge on the books of the service company and its associate company customers, to eliminate unnecessary expense and duplication of effort in system company accounting. G. Schedule XX, Other Administrative & General Expenses Account 930.1_General Advertising Expenses and Account 930.2_Miscellaneous General Expenses are currently reported in separate unnumbered schedules. The Commission has found that separate reporting for these items is unnecessary since historically the amounts involved have been immaterial. The Commission proposes to combine the existing schedules in a new Schedule XX which would require a detailed description of these expenses and other service company billings corresponding to Accounts 927&hyph;935 of the FERC System of Accounts. 17 17 See 18 CFR 101, 201; 17 CFR 256 (the FERC System of Accounts and the Uniform System of Accounts, respectively). H. Schedule XXII, Other Deductions The Commission proposes to combine the requirements of Account 426.1_Donations, and Account 426.5_Other Deductions, and add Account 426.2_Life Insurance, Account 426.3_Penalties, and Account 426.4_Expenditures for Certain Civic, Political and Related Activities in a new Schedule XXII. The new schedule would require more detailed reporting in Account 426.5 to the extent that the annual aggregate amount of other deductions exceeded $25,000. The Commission believes that $25,000 is an appropriate threshold but requests comment on the need for a higher or lower threshold. In addition, the Commission proposes to modify the reporting requirement for Account 408_Taxes, Other than Income Taxes. Based on its experience in this area, the Commission believes it is appropriate to eliminate the requirement of detailed reporting. Instead, the account will appear as a single line item on proposed Schedule XIV, the income statement. I. Schedule XXIII, Miscellaneous Income or Loss Schedule XV, the current income statement, requires the reporting of income or loss other than from services rendered to associate and nonassociate companies in Account 421_Miscellaneous Income or Loss. Although significant amounts of income and loss have been reported in this account, service companies at present are not required to disclose the source of the income or the cause of the loss. To obtain such information, the Commission proposes to create a new Schedule XXIII that will require a detailed description of the items contained in Account 421. J. Schedule XXIV, Interest Expense Interest expense is reported on present Schedule XV in Account 427_Interest on Long-Term Debt, Account 430_Interest on Debt to Associate Companies, and Account 431_Other Interest Expense, and on Schedule I, the balance sheet, in Account 237_Interest Accrued. The Commission proposes to create a new Schedule XXIV that would differentiate between long and short term debt interest expense, and require more detailed information concerning the debt and debt holders. The new schedule will enable the Commission to monitor the overall cost of capital of the service companies. K. Schedule XXV, Notes to Financial Statements The notes to financial statements and notes to statement of income are furnished in current Schedules XIV and XVIII, respectively. The Commission believes it is more appropriate for the notes to appear in a single schedule, and so proposes to create a new Schedule XXV for this purpose. L. Schedule XVIII, Outside Services Employed The Commission also proposes to amend this schedule to require separate itemizations of legal, auditing and other services. M. Other Matters The Commission proposes to amend certain schedules to include a footnote that the amounts referenced in these schedules include charges to both income statement and balance sheet accounts. The footnotes would cross-reference the expenses related to the income statement of new Schedule XIV for a more particular breakdown of these expense items. 18 18 See, e.g., Schedule XVII (Departmental Analysis of Salaries), Schedule XVIII (Outside Services Employed), Schedule XIX (Employee Pensions and Benefits), and Schedule XXI (Rents). Finally, certain schedules would be renumbered, and the format of some items slightly changed.
