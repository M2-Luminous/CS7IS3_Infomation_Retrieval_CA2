FR941122-1-00082 FR941122-1-00019 With regard to Areas E and F, arrival traffic to Los Angeles from the east descends on the CIVET Southern California Terminal Airspace Realignment (STAR) arrival profile. This allows aircraft to descend on the glideslope, approximately 50 miles from the airport. This is the busiest route in the Los Angeles Basin. Traffic on this route must descend through an area surrounded by numerous VFR flyways with a mix of IFR traffic arriving, departing, and overflying the various airports in the Los Angeles Basin. Because of the analysis of near midair collision reports (NMAC), concern exists regarding the airspace between the outer boundary of the current Class B airspace and the Ontario Class C airspace, approximately 35 miles east of Los Angeles. In this area, high performance aircraft are descending out of 10,000 feet MSL, and VFR aircraft are navigating around the Class B airspace. This proposal would provide additional airspace for large jet aircraft within the Class B airspace area. Terrain features would be used to provide an easily discernible boundary to assist VFR aircraft in avoiding the Class B airspace. The extension of the Class B airspace area between 25 nautical miles (NM) and 35 NM east provides additional airspace for high performance aircraft in the Class B airspace area and provides better separation from other aircraft operating near the Class B airspace.
