Every week there is a new slice or resolution, without it becoming clear what is really wanted. These inverted salami policies are leading one general after another to leave the UN forces. That is the opinion of W.F. Van Eekelen, the secretary general of the Western European Union (WEU). Looking to a possible peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia, he called for stronger policies yesterday. In a speech to the Belgian Netherlands Association, Van Eekelen denied he was seeking a military solution to the Yugoslav problem. But military resources must be deployed better to achieve the objectives. However, that presupposes that the objectives are formulated clearly. And so far that has not been the case. Originally the WEU was responsible for enforcing the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, and now it is also responsible for enforcing the Danube embargo. The organization is prepared to contribute to organizing the administration of Mostar by taking over police duties and other tasks related to public order. The WEU was set up in 1948 and has 10 members: All the member states of the European Union [EU] except Ireland and Denmark, which are observers. Turkey, Norway, and Iceland are associate members. The Maastricht Treaty makes the WEU responsible for implementing the EU's decisions and measures in the field of defense. However, Van Eekelen pointed out that collective defense was no longer the priority of the WEU countries. After all, the former East Bloc is no longer an immediate threat. At present the military-operational aspect is becoming particularly important: How can the soldiers be deployed? European Leadership Like NATO, the WEU presently is also unable to offer the East European countries full membership, Van Eekelen said. Countries which have not joined the EU cannot become members of the WEU. WEU members are obliged to offer each other military assistance if one of them is attacked. Such a guarantee could be offered only to countries which followed the same policies, according to the WEU secretary general. For Van Eekelen, the recent NATO summit was virtually a revolution. He has long said that it must be possible for the armies of the countries concerned to be able to operate in both NATO and WEU contexts. The NATO summit decided, following a U.S. proposal, that NATO resources could be made available to the WEU. This brings an end to the competition between the United States and Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be maintained, but that does not mean that the United States will take part in all operations in Europe. U.S. leadership therefore will no longer be the same as in the past. It seems self-evident that this U.S. leadership will be replaced in Europe by a European leadership. But that is easier said than done, according to Van Eekelen. Because this European leadership must not become French, German, or British leadership. Therefore convergence is the watchword in this area.
