FBIS4-66551 "jpnea020___94059" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 8 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Janata Dal-Ajit Merges With Samajwadi Party Janata Dal-Ajit Merges With Samajwadi Party 94AS0229P Madras THE HINDU in English 8 Feb 94 p 1 94AS0229P Madras THE HINDU English CSO [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--The Janata Dal-Ajit [JD-A] leader, Mr. Rasheed Masood, today announced the merger of his party with the Samajwadi Party led by the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav. The formal decision was taken at a national convention of the JD-A held here today, which was later addressed by Mr. Mulayam Singh. The merger at the national level is likely to have its impact on the arithmetic in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly also and indications are that a section of Janata Dal MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] in the State will formally join the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] Government. Claiming that a majority of the 27 Dal MLAs were in favour of merging with the Samajwadi Party, the Uttar Pradesh JD-A secretary, Mr. Kailashnath Singh Yadav, said that a formal announcement in this regard will be made soon. Addressing a packed audience of JD-A workers from various districts of Western Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Mulayam Singh stressed his party's role in "containing and combating" the forces of communalism led by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. Extolling the virtues of the Charan Singh, Mr. Yadav extended an open invitation to all the followers of Ram Manohar Lohia and Charan Singh to join the Samajwadi Party. Source of strength: Even though the merger moves were anticipated for over a fortnight now, Mr. Mulayam Singh was visibly excited at the convention. Considering that the Samajwadi Party is relatively weak in the Western districts of Uttar Pradesh, the entry of Mr. Masood into the fold is indeed a great source of strength for the party, said his close associate. Describing that the JD-A decision to merge with the SP as one conditioned by the "ground realities in Uttar Pradesh" where the SP had emerged "as the centre of anti-communal forces," Mr. Masood claimed that the entire rank and file of the Janata Dal-A were with him. Referring to the possibility of JD MLAs joining the SP, Mr. Masood appeared confident of a majority falling in line. However, he added that for strategic reasons of not exposing the 27 strong State legislature party to a split, the MLAs were kept away from today's convention. Contesting Mr. Ajit Singh's claims that majority of the legislature party was with him to join the Congress(I), the Masood camp claimed all but five MLAs out of 27 were inclined to join the Mulayam Singh Government. Fellow MP [member of Parliament], Mr. Upendranath Verma submitted a note of dissent on the "timing of the merger." Though Mr. Masood claimed that the merger decision had the approval of Mr. Verma and the third JD-A MP, Mr. Ram Sunder Das, both of them were conspicuous by their absence at the convention.
