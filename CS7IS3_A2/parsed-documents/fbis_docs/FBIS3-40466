It is expected that new functions will emerge through high-order gathering of enzyme proteins, and we can now expect research to move in the direction of greater efficiency and higher functions in immobilized enzymes, biochips, and the like thanks to the establishment of this method. The group led by professor Kokubu has been conducting research to synthesize molecular ceramics. Researchers have combined enzyme immobilization with gel-sol techniques by making use of the fact that synthetic bimolecular membranes form precise gathering sites on the molecular level. This development originated in research that uses these gathering sites as molecular molds where the myoglobin is immobilized in a polysiloxane film. More specifically, an amphipathic compound with a phosphate group (Fig. 1) is dispersed by ultrasonication in solution and a specified amount of an alkoxysilane compound (Fig. 2) dispersed in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid is added. After additional ultrasonication, an aqueous solution of myoglobin is added, and the mixture is cast to form a film containing immobilized protein. The researchers then immerse the film in chloroform to extract and remove the bimolecular membrane, and they have studied the resulting siloxane polymer containing immobilized myoglobin (Fig. 3) by X-ray diffraction, etc. The researchers determined that protein plays a decisive role in memory formation because imprinting does not occur if protein synthesis inhibitors are injected. Then the Tsukada group focused on messenger RNA, which carries the blueprint for protein structure, and searched for mRNA that was present in particularly large amounts in the imprinted group. As a result they found two mRNAs. When they analyzed the base sequences, the researchers discovered that these substances were a kainic acid binding protein that strongly binds to glutamic acid, which plays a role in nerve signal transmission in the brain, and a calcium binding protein (calmodulin) that is closely related to nerve cell metabolism. Mr. Tsukada says, ``We cannot say definitively that the proteins we identified are the substance of memory, but at least we are certain that they are essential for the establishment of long-term memory.''
