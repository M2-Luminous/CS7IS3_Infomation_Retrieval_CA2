It now wants to enter the civilian market. At the request of the military market, BATS developed radars which are linked to other sensors, for example Doppler devices with video, infrared cameras, or image intensifiers. "The integration of radar with image technology provides an entirely different type of surveillance system," according to Gerald Lejeune, marketing director of BATS in the Sart Tilman technology park at Angleur near Liege. "The EUCLID (European Cooperation for the Long Term in Defense) consortium is talking about data fusion." BATS is now expanding on its experience with the SCB-2130A field radar. SCB stands for "Surveillance du Champ de Bataille" [Battlefield Surveillance]. Since 1990, the company has supplied 25 radars of this type to the Belgian Army. This radar has a range of between 100 meters and 33.5 km. It can "see" tanks at a distance of 30 km and people at 15 km, but also registers low-flying helicopters and ULM [undersea long-range missile] equipment. The practised eye of the operator picks out every dot on the Barco [Belgian electronics company] color screen. The entire surrounding area can be mapped out. The radar can operate in a network, via a connection to the BAMS field radio. "What is known as the 33-km line of sight is virtually impossible to find in Belgium. The original intention was to use the field radar in Germany," says Gerald Lejeune -- in particular with reconnaissance troops in Dellbrueck, where the radar would be fitted on top of three M-113 tanks in each of seven platoons. The restructuring activities implemented by Defense Minister Delcroix have turned these into four platoons, with the radar on three M- 133's and one UNIMOG. BATS is also exporting its radar. It has found customers in South America, the Middle East, and in Europe, but for a total of fewer than 20 orders. Gerald Lejeune denies that a BATS radar was exported to South Africa via Brazil. In Europe and elsewhere the company has issued tenders for an export version of the battlefield surveillance radar and the border surveillance radar. The price of the export version is between 10 and 15 million Belgian francs, depending on the configuration. "After all, every customer has individual requirements. If we adapt the software, the equipment is suitable for still more applications. An operational coastal version locates shipping movements. The radar can monitor airfields or register the impact of artillery and assist in directing the fire." Civilian Market Through the battlefield surveillance radars, BATS' expertise expanded in the field of signal processing. "We developed algorithms that were integrated into neural networks, fuzzy logic, and artificial intelligence," says G. Lejeune. Up until two years ago, the company directed its expertise exclusively toward the military market. Since then, however, it has been seeking out commercial applications in the civilian sector. An attempt to launch an ESA space project bore no fruit. As a partner in the European ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for R&D in Information Technologies] program, BATS is now developing a transmitter and a receiver for a wireless local area network. "In an industrial environment, the transmitter eliminates disturbing factors such as heat, vibration, shocks, and electromagnetic and other fields, using frequency hopping and spread spectrum. Until now, these techniques had only been used in military applications," explains G. Lejeune. This year, BATS is demonstrating its local area network in the Cockerill steel plant. "We are also developing the "autoreverse." This is a small ultrasonic device mounted to the rear shock absorber of a vehicle, which gives out a warning when the vehicle comes too close to an obstacle." The appliance is ready for mass production and contacts have been established in France and the United Kingdom. "We are hoping that services can be developed in the civilian sector in signal processing, microwaves, real-time software, quality control, and project management," says Lejeune. "If civilian activities expand, then a sister company will probably be set up." Other Products BATS' first product was a ground navigation system, for which Taman of Israel bought the production license. This inertial system tracks the positions of the Belgian artillery and the reconnaissance troops' M-113 tanks, as well as the Netherlands Patriot launchers in Germany. BATS has also spent three years working on a training simulator to train field radar operators in identifying typical signatures. The Belgian Army is buying one of these. With assistance from EUCLID, the company is working on an automatic target classification system, and is now also offering its software knowledge as a supplier. "For example, we would really like to take part in SEROS II, the Air Force program that monitors traffic over Belgium," explains Gerald Lejeune. As part of the CARAPACE program, BATS has been promised 300 million francs in indirect compensations. However, there is as yet no contract. Talks with main contractor Dassault Electronique are continuing. "We are confident," says Gerald Lejeune. Within the C-130 modernization program, BATS is building the so- called hot bench for Honeywell, due for completion at the beginning of 1994. This is a test bench for aircraft electronics. The company also receives direct compensations within the scope of the BEMILDAT program, which was allocated to the Canadian Northern Telecom. Until the end of this year, it will manufacture the electronic cards that will be integrated into the final product. BATS is also looking for a way into data fusion systems engineering. Mixed Origin In 1991, BATS and its 43 employees achieved a turnover of 425 million francs. Last year, that figure increased to 1.1 billion francs. Via Innotech, BATS is a 49 percent subsidiary of the Flemish Regional Investment Company. It belongs 51 percent to Eltem-Holding in Amsterdam -- a company with no employees. BATS was founded in September 1984. This was three months after the Ministry of Defense allocated 1.14 billion francs for the development and production of 25 ultra-modern battlefield surveillance radars. "Defense decided to develop its own radar from scratch, to satisfy specific operational requirements," explains marketing director Gerald Lejeune. The development took three years. Elta of Israel, part of Israel Aircraft Industries, contributed its experience in hyperfrequency. BATS, as integrator, used the services of, among others, Barco for the monitor, Britte for the precision mechanics, EMG for the support system and Electronic Apparatus for the circuitry. By the end of 1992, BATS had delivered all the systems and the logistics phase began -- supplying replacement parts and documentation, training and maintenance courses. The contract covered both the development and the production and improvement of the device. Since then, the company has concluded 14 follow-up contracts.
