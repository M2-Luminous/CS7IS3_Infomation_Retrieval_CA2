At a briefing in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan, deputy minister of defense of Ukraine, said that the Russian delegation had not been prepared to resolve the issues to be discussed. It proposed an unacceptable option whereby the Russian portion of the Black Sea Fleet would be deployed at bases in the Crimea and the Ukrainian share would be outside the Crimea. Furthermore, I. Bizhan noted, it could only be a matter of the brief presence of Russian seamen and ships within Ukraine. With respect to Sevastopol, the possibility has not been ruled out of temporary joint basing of the Russian and the Ukrainian parts only in different bays. Major disagreement also arose in approaches to resolution of the problem of the coastal infrastructure. As of 20 April the number of ships in the Black Sea Fleet was 833. Of these 164 belonged to Ukraine, 669 to Russia. It was planned for Russia to pay for 31.7 percent of the ships, which were to go to Ukraine under the treaty. In general, representatives of the Ukrainian Navy have long advanced the idea that the combat strength of the Fleet is a myth. The fact is stressed that the average age of the ships is 15-20 years. In recent years funds have not been allocated for their maintenance. If this continues, the Fleet will "go to the bottom" on its own by the year 2000. Ukraine's Navy, however, which commemorated the second anniversary of its founding in April, continues to be replenished with modern ships. And not so few of them--the administrative ship Slavuch, the patrol vessel Getman Sagaydachnyy, the airfoil landing ship Donetsk. The missile cruiser Ukraina will join them in the future. The crews of the patrol vessel Getman Bayda-Vinevetskiy, the small ASW ships Lutsk, Ternopol, Lvov, Zaporozhskaya Sech... are being completed and completely manned. And so, rumors of a premature end of the Fleet may turn out to be greatly exaggerated.
