He emphatically pointed out: "China will hold dialogues about human rights on an equal footing; however, China strongly opposes any country's interference in other country's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. Any pressure on other countries under the pretext of human rights and any statement or action which interferes in another country's internal affairs should be condemned." Zhu Qizhen pointed out: "The Chinese Government has advocated on many occasions the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order with peace and stability on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and of the recognition of the diversity of the world and differences among various countries." He said: The world is still turbulent and changeable, beset with many destabilizing factors, and is not peaceful. The peace and development so cherished by mankind face a serious challenge. Touching on the establishment of a new international economic order, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: All countries have the right to independently choose their own social system, economic mode, and ways of development according to their own national situation. The developed countries should respect and show concern for the interests of developing countries, provide aid to developing countries without adding political conditions, strengthen dialogues between the North and South, and promote South-South Cooperation. Zhu Qizhen briefly introduced China's great achievements over the past 15 years since the start of reform and opening up. He then said: "China is still a developing country with a low income. To develop into a mid-level developed country, it will require unremitting efforts for several generations. It is highly absurd for some people to consider China's economic development as a kind of `threat' and to disseminate the so-called `China threat.'" When he finished his speech, the audience warmly applauded. Delegates from a number of countries came forward to shake hands with him and expressed their admiration and congratulations for his speech. The current session opened on 21 March and is expected to end on 26 March.
