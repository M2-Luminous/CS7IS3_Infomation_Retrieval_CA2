This was stated today by Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who clarified that from the moment the EU Commission chose to deal with the issue as a legal one, it has lost its political character. As a result, he said, it does not relate to the EU Summit. Matthew Nimetz, U.S. special envoy on the Skopje issue, will come to Athens next week for contacts with the foreign ministry's political leadership.
