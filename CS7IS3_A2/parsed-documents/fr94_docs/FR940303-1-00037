FR940303-1-00037 FR940303-1-00010 In 1969, the Department amended the regulations for poultry and poultry products inspection to, among other things, provide labeling requirements for boneless poultry products, including a prescribed bone solids content of not more than one percent (34 FR 13991). This limit was based on an evaluation conducted by the Department of the operating results in a series of poultry plants that used mechanical deboning equipment. Analyses were made of 485 samples of raw, mechanically deboned product from nine commercial operations that used the three types of machines most often used in the process. The analyses showed that the equipment, at that time, could be operated under commercial conditions to produce boneless poultry that contained no more than one percent bone solids, on a raw weight basis, and the Department concluded that it was demonstrated that it was practical to limit the bone content in deboned poultry to one percent. In light of the improvements that have occurred with regard to the machinery used to mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from the muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS recently conducted a study of the bone solids content of mechanically deboned poultry. 2 The percentage of bone solids content (determined by calcium analysis) in boneless poultry products produced by mechanically deboning was collected from approximately 50 plants during August 1993, and represented a sampling of over 2000 products. The data indicate that the mean bone solids content of the samples of these products was approximately 0.6 percent; generally, half of the percentages were above 0.6 percent and half were below 0.6 percent. 2 Data available for public inspection at the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office. Prior Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) On June 15, 1993, FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 33040) soliciting comments, information, scientific data, and recommendations regarding the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and products in which such poultry product is used. FSIS indicated it was considering the need for rulemaking that would establish regulations on the labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and products in which such poultry product is used. Discussions of Comments on the ANPR FSIS received 2744 comments in response to the ANPR, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues. Two thousand five hundred and ninety comments were submitted by consumers, 113 by food manufacturers/distributors, 17 by food retailers, 14 by trade associations, 4 by individuals from the Federal government, 3 by academia, 2 by food consultants, and 1 by a law firm. The majority of the commenters responded to whether there was a need to identify mechanically deboned poultry (MDP) in the ingredients statement on the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used as an ingredient.
