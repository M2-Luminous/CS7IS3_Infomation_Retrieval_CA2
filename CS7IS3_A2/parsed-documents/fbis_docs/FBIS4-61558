Kiev Is Trying To Torpedo the CIS Collective Security System"] [Text] A recent visit to Kiev by Estonia Defense Minister Indrek Kannik continued the series of Ukraine's bilateral military contacts with various CIS states. His Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy promised the Estonian minister to share some of Ukraine's surplus arms. That there is really something to share is proved by a figure cited in his time by Colonel General Boris Pyankov, Russian Federation deputy defense minister: There are 15 million automatic small arms alone in Ukraine's arsenals. A little earlier a representative delegation led by Col. Gen. Ivan Oleynik, Ukraine deputy defense minister, visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. During the talks with the leadership of the national armies in these countries, expansion of bilateral military collaboration was discussed. In particular Ukraine expressed its readiness to resolve the question of returning to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan their military equipment which since the disintegration of the Union has stayed at Ukraine's maintenance factories. Right at the negotiating table, the Kiev paper HOLOS UKRAYINY reports, orders were issued to prepare military trains for shipment. The Ukrainian side expressed the readiness not only to make available its maintenance facilities to the Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan military departments but also to upgrade their existing armaments. For its part, Ukraine showed interest in ensuring the maintenance of its military transport aircraft at Uzbekistan enterprises. Commenting on the results of the Ukraine Defense Ministry delegation's visit to the Central Asian countries, the Ukrainian press states with satisfaction that the sides have come to an understanding that full-scale relations between their military departments should be formalized by direct treaties on military cooperation at head of state level. Such an unequivocal accent on the bilateral character of military ties promoted by Ukraine is seen by observers as Kiev's attempt to thwart Moscow's efforts to create a collective security system. The Ukrainian leaders read into the latter primarily "the imperial ambitions" of Russia which, in their opinion, is seeking to turn the other CIS countries into its exclusive "sphere of influence." Kiev is concerned that some of the former Soviet republics are showing increasing readiness to be inside such a "sphere," which will allow them substantially to improve both their financial and economic and military-political situation. Ukraine, whose leadership treasures above all its independence from Moscow, is running the risk of finding itself in a military- political isolation that can hardly be offset even by its participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace program. It is hard to imagine that the "counter-game" played by Kiev, whose ultimate goal is to torpedo the "pro-Moscow" collective security system and to surround Russia with a kind of "cordon sanitaire" formed with states minimally linked to it, would be crowned with success. The geopolitical contestants' weight categories are too different and moreover, the situation of the Kiev regime, oriented toward "super-independence," is such that hardly anyone in the CIS would wish seriously to get involved with it. In any event, Ukraine failed to engage into an anti-Russian military political game Georgia and Azerbaijan which, in spite of Kiev's readiness to continue to render them the broadest possible military assistance, nonetheless preferred to develop relations with Moscow, including joining the CIS and agreeing to the deployment of Russian military bases on their territory.
