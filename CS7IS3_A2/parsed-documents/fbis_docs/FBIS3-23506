Menshikov under the rubric "The Cosmodromes: Rockets and People": "Rocket Test Personnel"] [Text] The Unskilled Workers of Space Science The test and operational personnel at the cosmodrome were called the "the unskilled workers of the Earth." A song written by local composers even has the words, "The unskilled workers of the Earth are launching ships into space..." But far from everyone knows that Baykonur also has "unskilled workers' unskilled workers." People dear to my heart and soul--the officers, warrant officers, sergeants and soldiers of the units for combat support and maintenance. They include repair and reconditioning, railroad, power and water battalions, subunits for the heat and power systems, oxygen and nitrogen, bread-baking and many others. They are to the cosmodrome as air is to people--you don't notice it as long as you are breathing, but cut it off and you suffocate at once. Everything "hangs" on these battalions--the launches of the rockets, the well-being of the test personnel and their families, the normal life of the city of Leninsk, the launch pads--you can't list them all. The main incentive for their personnel is not to get chewed out by their superior officers. Imagine Baykonur in the forty-degree heat without water. It is not for nothing that they say in the water battalion that they pump the blood through the arteries of the cosmodrome. And there is no exaggeration there. It is in fact the life's blood of Baykonur. The sergeants and soldiers have recently been receiving, for these heavy labors, pay that is 200--300 times less than that of their civilian colleagues. But weather and climatic calamities remain the most terrible of all for the support battalions. July of 1988. The winds around the main substation of the cosmodrome seemed enough to blow all of Kazakhstan away. The wind speeds were more than forty meters a second, lightning was flashing constantly, the peals of thunder were rocking the broad expanse of the steppe. The hurricane winds, in a wild dance, even bent, twisted, broke off and twisted into a "ram's horn" the huge and strong towers for the electric-power lines as if they were made of nothing. The roofs of substation buildings were torn off, and windows and doors were knocked out. Powerful concrete towers were toppled like matches. I and German Stepanovich Titov, at the time the first deputy chief of the space units, got through with difficulty to the stricken substation so as to check out the situation at the scene. There was so much rain water that it poured over the door sills of the Volga and flooded the passenger compartment. It felt like the car was floating rather than driving down the concrete road. This was in the desert! No one would believe it. The cosmodrome and city of Leninsk were left without electricity and water. In the disaster area they scraped up some vehicles and brought in the power battalion of Major S. Fedorenko. The battle with the natural disaster lasted almost the entire day. The first two towers were restored, and the city received a partial supply of water and light. Power was supplied to all the facilities on the cosmodrome after five continuous days of hellish labors. They slept for four or five hours right at the work sites, because they understood that a cosmodrome without power was a dead cosmodrome. Captain O. Godlevskiy and Senior Warrant Officer P. Gonzilovskiy stayed up in the rebuilt towers of the power lines for 18 hours a day, installing insulator strings passed to them on the LEP-220 towers. Who can say whether this was heroism or not? For me, it unequivocally was. And thankfully no one cursed the power workers. A January night in 1991. I awake from a heart-rending wail--the safety valves had been triggered at the city's TETs [heat and electric-power plant], which was also serviced by the military. I grab one telephone--silence; a second--the same. Everything became clear--the TETs was "at zero." I looked at my watch--just after three. I open the hot-water tap--empty; the cold--not a drop. And now I understood that the whole power system of the cosmodrome, and not only the TETs, was out of service. Outside, thank God, it was only minus five degrees. Thinking quickly, I saw that if power could not be fed to the pumps in 18 hours, we would have to pour out the water, in the most direct sense. I got the creeps--God forbid. I ran to the TETs with the other officers. The cause of the accident was ascertained--a rupture in a pipe 1,200 mm in diameter near the 35-kV substation. The substation was flooded, the TETs was not operating and it was impossible to hook into the outside grid of the power system. And that meant that all of the boilers at the cosmodrome would stop in an hour, since there would be no water. The city and the cosmodrome were sleeping and dreaming. The "unskilled workers" of the battalion, the hard-working battalions, the invisible great laborers, went into action. It was they who started up the diesels, put the flooded substation back into shape, turned on the boilers and turbines. Behind every pump, boiler, valve or switch there was a soldier or officer. It was they who "warmed" the sleeping citizenry. But by two o'clock in the afternoon they had already been forgotten, since the city was receiving water and light. A few knew that people were then working for another seven days straight so as to make everything right. And what a nightmare frequently begins for the support battalions in the summer, when 15--20 cables suddenly burst into flames simultaneously owing to the two- or three-fold overloading in the forty-degree heat (in the shade), leaving 150--200 homes and service buildings without electric power. Phone calls, insults, blow-ups by superiors, complaints from residents... But as soon as the electric power is restored through three or four days of continuous labor by soldiers and officers under the searing sun, everything settles down again. And no one cares that the cables have been lying in ground permeated by salt for 35 years, when the standard is ten, and that is under normal operating conditions. It is also not taken into account that the demands on the power system are two or three times the maximum possible according to the design (the city and the cosmodrome, after all, have grown to 100,000 people). How much grief and misfortune has been caused people by this rotted-through equipment built at some time under the "whatever's-left-over" principle? Tragedy at the KAZ The end of December 1985--a year of great catastrophes. They affected the Baykonur cosmodrome as well. Two days before the new year, at the end of the day, the chief engineer of the oxygen-nitrogen plant [KAZ], A. Kozharov, reported that "there has been an explosion at the KAZ, someone has been killed, we are investigating." I went immediately to the plant. I heard the rest of the report: "There was an explosion during the welding of a barrier in the shop. One soldier has been killed, and about thirty have been injured." I went into the shop, or more precisely what was left of it. There was enormous hole about thirty meters in diameter where the ceiling used to be. Chaos, a heap of mutilated structural elements. A terrible picture, I had never seen anything like it. Among the debris were the shattered remains of the soldier, who had been thrown by the wave of the explosion into the concrete ceiling, where a bloody spot was visible. I had never seen a human death in such a naked form. I felt queasy and left the shop quickly. The injured--27 officers, sergeants and soldiers--were already being taken off to the hospital by medical vehicles. That was the price of the explosion. A cruel price. I began to look into the causes. It turned out that Oxyliquit--a mixture of oxygen with organic substances--had exploded. Long ago, back during the construction of the plant, the wooden framing had been left in the shop out of either haste or neglect. It had become a delayed-action bomb in the direct sense of the word. An oxygen drainage pipe ran over that framing, and it had seeped through the concrete into the wooden boards. This meant that a "bomb" had been erected. The sparks from the welding were enough for the tragedy to occur. The shop had been in operation for about 30 years--three times longer than planned. It had been proposed to be closed and written off many times. But it was producing its five tonnes of oxygen a day, and somebody higher up liked that; the documents for closing the shop were invariably returned to the cosmodrome. I would like to look the construction inspector in the eye who had "not noticed" the framing left in the concrete floor. After all, he knew full well, the bastard, that this was categorically forbidden, that is why he was assigned there, after all. The Cognac of the Construction Workers I would like to say, for the sake of objectivity, that the greater portion of the blame for such tragedies should be assumed by the test personnel of the cosmodrome who took part in the servicing of various systems and equipment. Once I was included on a commission to accept a "Greek hall"--accommodations for American astronauts and guests--from the military construction personnel. The basic work had already been completed, only little things remained--a week of work and it could be turned over ready to go. But they wanted to turn it over a little sooner, and "brighten up" the bonus. The system for turning over facilities by construction workers is not a new one, but someone, to put it bluntly, was acting with a great deal of inventiveness. They made particular use of the "current moment of profound love and devotion to their dear party and the wise Politburo, headed by the latest true Leninist." The commission gathered at one of its last sessions--matters were moving toward completion. We went into the "Greek hall" for the next session, and there were tables so covered you couldn't believe it. The members of the commission objected weakly--it's not time yet, we have to finish our work. Nothing of the kind! The chief of the UNR [office of the work supervisor] promptly poured cognac into the glasses and, ignoring the objections of the commission members, gave a rousing toast: "To our dear party and our dear Soviet government!" Try not to drink and they would stick you where they had to--you would end up a dissident. The next toast--"To the General Secretary," then "To the unity of the army and the people," and then any document was signed without reservation. Since many members of the working commission were also on the State Commission, matters were considered closed--the "Greek hall" was accepted. Welcome, American astronauts. How Good It Is to Be a General Time passed, and I progressed in the service, got a little older and wiser and got used to cosmodrome service, life and living. It was only impossible to get used to the heat or the cold. It got easier to endure, true, as I advanced along the service ladder. First I lived in a "pencil-box"--a twelve-meter room in a two-room apartment. Then one-, two- and three-room apartments. Seventeen years on the top--fifth--floor. The greatest torments were in the summer months. Many of the test personnel sent their families off to "the great land" during that time. The main problem during those times was to somehow get some sleep after a difficult work day. It was hellishly stuffy in the apartment. Everything was hot, even the doorknobs and dishes, nothing was cool enough. There was one way out--cover up with a wet sheet and try to sleep until it dried out. It got cooler toward the middle of the night. We went quickly to the balcony, on a folding bed. Even though the mosquitoes were a problem, they were tolerable, you could fall asleep by three at night. "And in the morning, the gasoline locomotive again," as they sing in the well-known Baykonur song. The locomotive! The great cosmodrome "hoe" in which the test personnel spent 10--20 percent of their lives while they were serving at Baykonur. The cars of the locomotives in the 1960s were very clean and very hot. It became cool and dirty in the modern cars with air conditioning. That is how scientific and technical progress and the decline in the cultural level and cultivation of the test personnel was reflected in the hard-working gasoline locomotive. What were the test personnel doing in the locomotives? Reading, playing chess and cards, sleeping. And arguing, arguing, arguing. About space and about their own difficult life, the fate of the military before and after pensions, universal problems and... the best recipe for diluting alcohol. And, of course, about women. And what locomotive folklore of the test personnel there was! Where are you, poets and writers? There are very rich, untapped strata for your righteous labors here. Take a look, take a ride there and back. You will hear more than you could write in a lifetime. I was hugely lucky in my last three years of service at the cosmodrome--I lived, in accordance with my official position, in the "wooden town" built at one time for the supervisors of the cosmodrome. What can I say? It is correct what they say in the song, of course: "How good it is to be a general..." An excellent cottage, a garden in the yard, fruit trees and grapes. The temperature in the rooms was four or five degrees lower than in the brick houses. And one wonders what kept them from building such housing then, at the very beginning, for all of the test personnel, and not just for the supervisors. Relaxing in the yard under the grapes for even just an hour in the evening gives you quite a different attitude toward the service, a different look at cosmodrome life. But most of the officers and soldiers still have to test themselves along with the rockets under the constant blows of the harsh climate of the Kazakh steppes, to which a Russian person is unaccustomed.
