[passage omitted] III. Reasons for the Change in Perception of Childbearing Among People in Poverty Regions At the hand of a large array of examples, the participants showed that although economic development was the ultimate cause that led to the change in the people's perception of childbearing, there was not at all a simple linear relation between economic growth and the change in the people's perception of childbearing. Under certain circumstances, economic growth would even stimulate the desire to have more children. As things are today, the limited economic growth in poverty regions is not sufficient to induce changes in the people's perception of childbearing. People in some poverty counties have been comparatively quick to change their perception of childbearing, mainly because of ideological education and the guidance of government policy. For instance, in the Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County of Guangxi Province and in Panan County of Zhejiang Province, the leading cadres at all levels had paid most serious attention to population control affairs and had devoted considerable manpower and material resources to propagandistic education. In the Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County, per capita investment in family planning is in excess of seven yuan. Moreover, the change in perception of childbearing among the people of poverty counties is also due to such factors as the development of educational and public health affairs, a relative opening up of society, and the spreading influence of the large and medium-sized cities. IV. Factors Restraining the Change of Perception of Childbearing Among People in Poverty Regions In the opinion of the participants, there are in the poverty regions more than in ordinary regions factors extant that restrain a change from the traditional perception of childbearing to its modern perception. The following are some of such restraining factors: 1. Poor natural conditions, backward productive forces. Production methods and tools are rather primitive in poverty regions, mechanization is at a low level, production relies mainly on human labor, and there is, therefore, indeed, objectively a need for many childbirths. 2. The educational level of the population is very low. For instance, in Luchun County of Yunnan Province, over 70 percent of the population are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Add to this the fact that as a society they are also isolated, a fact which seriously impairs their ability to accept new knowledge and new concepts. 3. The unitary system of the production structure has a detrimental effect on the employment of women. Women are occupying a very low economic and social position. 4. The weak social security system and the traditional ways of family-oriented care for the elderly has people believe in the need to "raise sons to provide for old age." 5. The very deep-rooted influence of traditional culture and customs. For instance, the people of Hani nationality in Luchun County of Yunnan Province have the customs of early marriages, of free premarital sex, the system of inheritance by the youngest son, the belief in the transmigration of the soul, and in the theory of the life-shortening effect of childbirths. All this makes people desirous of early births and many childbirths. The main group of Uygurs living in Shufu County of Xinjiang Province are mostly following the rules of the Islamic religion in matters of marriage and childbirths. 6. Some poverty regions have been receiving state relief for a long period of time, and this has some people develop a dependent mentality, which to some degree is hindering a change in their perception of childbearing.
