Klympush, Minister of Transport, by V. Mayevskyy; place and date not given: "Transport Will Bring Us Out"] [Text] When I received the assignment to interview Klympush, the minister of transport, as I walked to the ministry on Krasnoarmeysk Street and entered the reception area, as I read the name and patronymic of the minister on the door to his office, I was bothered by a persistent thought--where have I heard that name before? I am not too involved with transport issues at the editorial office, that is, I did not know Orest Dmitriyevich as a minister, but somewhere I had come across that name. It was not through personal acquaintance, since we have never met. It was only in the course of the conversation that my question was answered in a very unexpected manner, as you shall see below. [Mayevskyy] First of all, it would be good to know just what the Ministry of Transport of Ukraine unifies. [Klympush] We bring together the six main elements, formerly always owned by the state--railroads, aviation, motor, maritime, and river transport and motor highways. But, besides, let us say, the Southwestern Railway, many industrial ministries and agencies own their own railway tracks, and there are also private transport enterprises besides railways, with a clear government monopoly. Let us say Rechflot [River Fleet] was auctioned off, but after all, the waterways remain under government jurisdiction--we establish the state standards and determine tariffs. [Mayevskyy] Pardon me, but there automatically arises the question as to whether all of these forms of transport are independent and capable of managing without the ministry. [Klympush] They could manage without us, but the country, the state, could not. The client, the passenger, cannot manage either. After all, in their oblast the transport enterprises are most frequently monopolists, and they can demand any prices that are totally unfounded and manifest arbitrary behavior in other spheres of operation. We, however, must determine the rules, establish order, standards, restrictions, and requirements with respect to shipments. Transport in Ukraine today is a vast and complex system, which, on the one hand, determines the statehood of Ukraine, and on the other hand carries out domestic shipping and maintains foreign ties necessary in our society. I have conducted an insistent and unambiguous policy for two years now, which suits contemporary world concepts of a ministry. It must be an organ of state regulation, which certainly does not set as its goal the literal management of economic problems of an enterprise. The ministry embodies the policy of the state owner, and it historically developed so that there was also a need to engage in purely managerial matters. At the present time there are not only state enterprises, and it is necessary to work with all types of property. That is the principal difference as compared with past years. [Mayevskyy] But if an enterprise is operating well, it is also better for the state. [Klympush] Yes. But the task of the ministry is to create favorable conditions for the operation of all enterprises. Not to be the substitute, a drover, an overseer, or be restrictive, but most importantly, it must not to be a supplier for them. Naturally, the better an enterprise operates, the better it is for it and the state. We are interested in the formation of the budget and taxes, and we strive to determine where they should be increased or decreased, proceeding specifically from state interests. The ministry, however, cannot engage in routine economic management. [Mayevskyy] Supply, however, is also a very powerful management lever, which allows you to influence enterprises. [Klympush] Supply is no longer handled through the ministry; that phase has ended. At present there is no supply problem; there is only the problem of money. If an enterprise is profitable, if its expenditures are covered, then there are no problems. But the matter is that passenger transportation represents a branch that rarely yields profits from transportation itself. For industry transportation expenditures are always supplementary expenditures, and the smaller they are, the more efficient the operation and the cheaper production is. Passenger transportation always means subsidies; that is the way it is everywhere in the world. It is therefore the task of the ministry to defend and promote that part of the budget to be spent on transport before state organs, the planners, and the Supreme Council, to indicate its rational direction, determine the paths of development, and substantiate expenditures. Returning to supply, it is desirable for the country itself to manufacture everything needed for transport. It is our task to make certain all of that is in production, so that transport workers could acquire it. Secondly, we must create financial conditions for freight and passenger transport. After all, at present the tariffs are such that few can pay them. Right now, for instance, the shipment of a tonne of broken stone by railway is more expensive than its production. The same applies to concrete and much else. We are assisting building material enterprises with shipments, creating the most favorable conditions for transport activity and finding sources to cover the expenditures. In aviation at the present time there are already over 30 firms engaged in transport operations. We do not need the economic operation of Zhulyan, we want to transfer that airport to Kiev. But we do issue the operating license and the certificate, determine the degree of competence of personnel, and whether equipment meets established standards, and we also license various types of activity. After all, the process of transportation is a process presenting increased danger. Every transporter would like to see himself as far away from the ministry as possible. But people seek protection from us along with state justice. We must create equal conditions for everyone. During my tenure I have never issued a single order for Rechflot. We worked out tariffs and fees for transiting canals, which, by the way, do not go to us at all. Rechflot, however, earns income from its vessels. While the Danube Steamship Company is responsible for the state of the Danube navigable channel and the ministry works with it. We prepare operating rules in accordance with world requirements and establish safety standards. [Mayevskyy] City transport systems are under your jurisdiction. As you can understand, people have a special interest in them. [Klympush] As strange as it may sound, city transport has, of course, lowered its standards, but far from the way everything else has gone down in our case. We are attempting to support all of that with whatever strength we have. In speaking about transport in general, it is necessary, first of all, to remember that prices for diesel fuel have increased here by a factor of 200,000. Please note--not by a factor of two or 20, but by a factor of 200,000! This is what causes the large expenditures and unbearable prices. Subways, by the way, with a clear understanding of their importance by the city administrations of Kiev and Kharkov as well as by the government, have received an adequate budget, and are operating at a normal level. Motor transport, 20 percent of which was formerly renewed every year, is suffering. No new buses have now been purchased for four years. The current fare of 100 coupons covers 3-4 percent of the actual transportation cost. The rest must be compensated by someone. At the same time, 28 categories of people in our case eat free of charge. I am in favor of pensioners having benefits. But it turns out that they do not have these benefits in the countryside. Instead of tokens, people should be compensated for transportation with money, a certain sum. That would be fair. [Mayevskyy] Have you been working in transportation for a long time? [Klympush] All of my life. I am 53 years old. I graduated from the Road Transport Institute in Kiev with distinction, and did postgraduate work but left on my own to work in production. After acquiring experience in production, I returned to post-graduate studies and defended a dissertation. Then I progressed from an engineer to a director elected by the people at the Scientific Research Institute of Transport. Simultaneously I was also director of the scientific-research association that ensured technical progress and elaborated transport systems. I was ready for work and understood transport as a comprehensive system. [Mayevskyy] How about your private life? [Klympush] I am married. My wife is a speech therapist and works at the pedagogical institute; my daughter is a student. I have not had a vacation in two years. I frequently work Saturdays and Sundays. At one time I enjoyed mountain skiing and urged creation of a combined Ukrainian team--after all, I was born below Goverla. [Mayevskyy] My God! I though I knew you from somewhere. You were a well-known mountain skier, and I still remember your name. It was bothering me. [Klympush] On 8 March I visited my home during the election campaign. Recalling my youth, I made some runs on the mountain. That gave me a lot of pleasure. [Mayevskyy] You were elected a people's deputy. Will that mean more work for you? [Klympush] Yes. There are many problems. Transition to new methods took place with us, but it is necessary to organize transport under conditions of a market economy. Right now we have an economy in a state of transition. It is important to resolve the problem of ownership in transport in a clear-cut manner. In aviation and the river fleet, we are proceeding with auctions. But railways and highways must remain state-owned. With regard to the highways, it is necessary to designate some that may be auctioned and some that have strict government usage. In many areas we must decentralize, relinquish the right to determine costs and tariffs in the oblast to the local level, but programs for development of the means of transportation, adjustment of production, and production of railway cars and electric and diesel locomotives, as well as shipbuilding should be handled by the ministry. The production of the means of transportation, in our view, is a link that may be used to pull the entire chain. Aircraft, motor vehicles, and vessels represent the highest technical level in the entire industry. Their financing would help in the area of electronics, metallurgy, output of mechanical rubber products, machine building, as well as the raw material branches--everyone would have constant orders to fill. At the same time, the products may be sold both domestically and abroad. We work together with many ministries. Questions of standardization, certification, licensing of the means of transportation and transport activity--these are new areas of work representing main elements in the activity of the ministry. We are working on airports, railway stations, and bus stations. We are developing high-speed main lines so that a train could travel to Odessa, Kharkov, and Lvov in two to three hours, and to Simferopol in five hours. We requested that oblast administrations not occupy land areas where high-speed main lines may be built. The Aviation Code worked out by us and the law on road traffic have already been prepared, and railway transport regulations and the law on transport have also been submitted. All of these are standardization documents necessary in society. We are working together with the world community and have concluded more than 55 international and intergovernmental agreements on the interaction of various types of transport and coordination of rules. We are conducting a state policy in the area of transportation. In the long term we will be involved in the building of the trans-European railway, with construction from the western border to Kiev--some 770 kilometers of high-quality tracks, with all of the required infrastructure along both sides. Three million people work in our branch, and we are trying to do everything possible for them. [Mayevskyy] I wish you much success and thank you for the interview.
