In an interview with Interfax, he recalled that the Chechen government had taken a resolution under which all contacts with Russia were to be maintained solely through the Chechen Foreign Ministry. This decision was made last week in order to regulate Groznyy's relations with Moscow. The chief of the staff of the Russian president, Sergey Filatov, told Interfax that consultations with Groznyy were supposed to involve both the republican authorities as well as political parties and movements of the Chechen republic. However, after a recent meeting of Russian and Chechen representatives the Chechen side said further talks would be inexpedient, for there were "no political forces in control of the political situation" in Russia. In addition, the Chechen leadership had been making statements that the opposition's participation in the talks in any form would be unrealistic. In the meantime, Interfax learned from reliable sources that Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev consulted experts Monday on the possible imposition of a moratorium on talks with Russia. Interfax was told that the experts insisted on the moratorium in view of Russia's unconstructive position. The same sources said Dudayev had not yet made his choice.
