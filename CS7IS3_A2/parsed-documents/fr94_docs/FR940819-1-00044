FR940819-1-00044 FR940819-1-00011 (1) Inspect, install, repair, or maintain track and roadbed; (2) Inspect, repair, or maintain, locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars; (3) Conduct training and testing of employees when the training or testing is required by the FRA's safety regulations; or (c) Railroad managers, supervisors, or agents when they: (1) Perform the safety-sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; (2) Supervise and otherwise direct the performance of the safety-sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; or (3) Are in a position to direct the commission of violations of any of the requirements of parts 213 through 236 of this title. Example 1. A volunteer operates a locomotive for an excursion railroad. Since operation of a locomotive clearly falls within the realm of operation of on-track equipment, the hours contributed to the railroad by the volunteer would be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' on the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55). Likewise, if the volunteer sustains a reportable injury during operation of the locomotive, then the incident would be reported on the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) as an injury to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A), with the applicable job code series. Example 2. A volunteer sells memorabilia at a historic railroad. Since selling memorabilia does not fall within the scope of either ``the operation of on-track equipment'' or ``any other safety-sensitive function,'' the hours contributed by such a volunteer would not be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55. When such a volunteer sustains a reportable injury, such injury, however, would be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a as an injury to a ``Volunteer'' (Class H). Example 3. A volunteer sells tickets for train rides on a tourist railroad and also clears vegetation adjacent to roadbed. Note that the hours spent clearing the vegetation are reportable on Form FRA F 6180.55 as ``railroad worker hours'' because, under 49 CFR 213.37, vegetation is to be cleared from the roadbed for safe rail operations and is thus considered a safety-sensitive function. Any injury or illness sustained by the volunteer during the vegetation clearing would be classified as one to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) with the applicable reporting requirements for purposes of Form FRA F 6180.55a. The hours donated selling tickets would not ordinarily be reportable and, if any reportable injury was sustained by the volunteer during the process of selling tickets, such injury would be classified as one to a ``Volunteer'' (Class H). If, however, the volunteer sells tickets and then clears vegetation during the same tour, then all hours are reportable as ``railroad worker hours,'' and all injuries are considered as those attributable to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). Therefore, when an individual is engaged in ``mixed service,'' the railroad must report all the hours for that tour of service as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable injuries and illnesses must be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA F 6180.55a, with the applicable job code series of the service performed. Example 4. The employee of a contractor performs payroll as well as time-and-attendance functions for the railroad on railroad property. Such functions are not considered safety-sensitive because they are not related to the continued safety of the railroad. Thus, injuries sustained by this contractor performing those tasks would be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a as those attributable to a ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). Further, the hours contributed by this contractor would not be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55. Example 5. A contractor employee inspects and replaces roller bearings for the reporting railroad. The hours worked by this contractor employee performing this function would be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55, and injuries sustained by this contractor would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Under 49 CFR 215.113, cars with defective roller bearings should not be in service, thus any activity associated with replacement of roller bearings is a safety-sensitive function qualifying as hours attributable to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). b. Batch control form. As discussed earlier in this NPRM, the ``Batch Control Form'' for magnetic media would appear on the back of Form FRA F 6180.55. 5. FRA Form F 6180.56_``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State'' (Revised Title): Limited Changes A summary of all hours worked by railroad employees during the report year is made on Form FRA F 6180.56 and is included with the December submission. 49 CFR 225.21(d). FRA is proposing limited changes to this Form. Information on ``establishments included in this report'' and ``average employment in reporting year,'' which previously appeared on Form FRA F 6180.45, would be moved to Form FRA F 6180.56 because, as discussed previously in this NPRM, FRA is proposing that Form FRA F 6180.45 be eliminated. In addition, a column reflecting a count for ``casualties'' would be added to Form FRA F 6180.56. Therefore, the title for Form FRA F 6180.56 would be revised to read ``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State.'' The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.56 is set forth in Appendix 9 to this NPRM. Appendix 10, the currently used ``Annual Railroad Report of Manhours by State'' is provided for comparison purposes.
