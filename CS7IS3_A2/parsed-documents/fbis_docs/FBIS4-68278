Elaborating on the positions stated by General of the Army Pavel Grachev, the defense minister, in a speech the day before, Andrey Kokoshin noted that today the role of budget and financing organizations and of economic services of the armed forces has risen noticeably. A maximally careful attitude toward every ruble provided by the state at the expense of the Russian taxpayer is important as never before. Vigorous activity by specialists on financial and economic problems in regard to setting the prices of products and services used by the armed forces has enormous significance today. A constant effort is required to optimize the structure of expenditures on maintaining the armed forces, on purchases of military equipment, and on scientific research and experimental design work. There are many examples here of such successful work, as was discussed during the conference, Andrey Kokoshin said. In the opinion of the first deputy defense minister, far from everything possible has been done so far in the armed forces and in the Ministry of Defense. The latest information processing equipment and methods are being introduced too slowly. The forces of inertia still prevail in decisions of commanders of all ranks and executives of financial bodies of the Ministry of Defense, and many are slow in adapting to the new conditions. A commission to effectively develop proposals for determining the priority directions of financial support to the vital activities of the armed forces, created by an order of the Ministry of Defense, is operating in the Ministry of Defense under the chairmanship of Andrey Kokoshin. The membership of this commission includes the chief of General Staff, deputy defense ministers, and the chiefs of a number of main directorates, including Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the Main Directorate of Military Budget and Financing. Andrey Kokoshin illuminated the general status of the Russian economy. In his speech he noted the keen interest the army has in stabilization of the country's economy and its sociopolitical situation. Successful progress in military reform is, in the words of the first deputy minister, problematic in the absence of a stable economy, and of adequate solutions to the problems of financing the armed forces and enterprises filling defense orders. A very complex situation is developing here today, carrying the danger of a social explosion in a number of cases. Andrey Kokoshin singled out the nonpayment problem as one of the most acute and immediate of the Russian economy. Unless it is solved, the objective of halting the decline in industry and the decrease in the income side of the federal budget, in which the armed forces are keenly interested, cannot be reached. The problem of nonpayment cannot be solved by a single thrust: Planned, purposeful work is required. At the same time measures of an emergency nature are also needed. One of them, upon which the first deputy defense minister insists, is immediate repayment of the state's debts pertaining to military and civilian products manufactured on the basis of state orders, and to services based on state orders. Kokoshin estimates the amount of such a one-time injection through state clients at 5-6 trillion rubles. Tight control over passage of budget resources along the entire chain is also necessary today; financial bodies of the Ministry of Defense have an important role to play in this control.
