In a resolution approved on 9 June by the 24th OAS General Assembly, the OAS asks its Permanent Council -- made up of ambassadors from each OAS member country appointed to Washington -- to draft a report on juridical regulations that block integration and to submit a proposal on how to overcome them. According to the OAS, the work's objective "is to make an inventory of legislation that must be repealed to achieve an effective continental integration." The OAS, which defines integration as "an appropriate tool for achieving new economic and social realities that will help eradicate extreme poverty," believes it is necessary to eliminate all obstacles blocking hemispheric economic integration. Moreover, the OAS recognizes that it is greatly interested in promoting a greater cooperation and strengthening of ties with "regional and subregional integration mechanisms and organizations." The 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been going on since 6 June in the city of Belem do Para in the Amazon of northern Brazil, approved a resolution stating that its mission is to conduct several juridical studies to assist these organizations in their integration efforts. In the last few years, the countries of the Americas have negotiated regional and subregional agreements. They have established different economic blocs, such as NAFTA, the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact, the Group of Three and the Amazon Integration Treaty. According to Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranbiar Quiroga, true hemispheric integration is tantamount to "encompassing all countries of the Americas in NAFTA." In its resolution, the OAS also recommends that its Permanent Council "duly coordinate issues pertinent to the development of legislation promoting integration with the activities of other OAS organizations and offices to promote economic integration." Other organizations that work with the OAS in the integration process are the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
