Karadzic told a French official at the Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale near Sarajevo the 11 would be tried together, according to a French source. (In Paris, the French foreign ministry confirmed the meeting with Karadzic and again called for the volunteer workers' release.) The Serbs had earlier indicated only three of the men with the non-governmental organisation Premiere Urgence (First Aid) would face trial on Sunday while the other eight would be released. The 11 are being held near the Serb barracks at Lukavica, an important Serb military base just five kilometres (three miles) outside the Bosnian capital. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said the aid workers are the victims of Serb "manipulation" and described the 11 as "hostages." Paris has sent foreign ministry secretary general Bertrand Dufourcq to Belgrade to demand the workers be released, as it believes the Serbian government could hold the key to their fate.
