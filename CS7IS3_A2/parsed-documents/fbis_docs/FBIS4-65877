Inacker: "Signal From Karlsruhe for Bundeswehr Missions Abroad"] [Text] Bonn -- In the future, the Bundeswehr will be able to participate in international missions abroad without any restrictions. According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, it is expected that the Federal Constitutional Court will approve the participation of German armed forces in peacekeeping and peacemaking (combat) missions. This assessment is based on findings by legal experts close to the Constitutional Court. A corresponding decision is expected in late June. According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, this assessment is derived from an analysis of the course of the hearing at the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe to date and the questions by the judges in the hearings on 19 and 20 April on the complaints by the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and Free Democratic Party Bundestag groups against German participation in the monitoring of the UN embargo against Serbia, the AWACS monitoring of the Yugoslav airspace, and the now concluded German Somalia mission. It is said that the way in which the hearings are conducted by the constitutional judges permits the conclusion that the issue no longer is whether a future German participation should be permitted, but only procedural questions. The lawsuit is pending at the Second Panel of the Constitutional Court, to which two SPD members belong -- namely former Berlin Justice Senator Jutta Limbach as president and legal expert Ernst-Wolfgang Boeckenfoerde. The juridical assessment of the expected ruling, which was also conveyed to the Federal Government, is based on the following factors: -- The Constitutional Court dealt only briefly with the question whether the contents of the Basic Law generally permit Bundeswehr missions. -- In contrast, the questions asked by the constitutional judges during the hearings on 19 and 20 April dealt almost exclusively with mere procedural issues. Thus, it was discussed heatedly whether the Federal Government can decide on a foreign mission on its own or whether it requires approval by the parliament. In particular concerning the requirement of approval, the court did extensive historical research on the development of the Basic Law in order to be able to make deductions about the need of parliamentary decisions for foreign policy actions by the state ("parliamentary reservation"). However, since, as legal experts say, parliamentary reservations exist only for things that are basically permitted by the constitution, during the hearing the Constitutional Court obviously no longer discussed the legality of a state act as such but only the form of authorization. Therefore, it is to be assumed that, in the view of the Karlsruhe court, the Bundeswehr may participate in UN combat missions abroad. In Bonn, however, it is expected that in its ruling, the Constitutional Court will set down some sort of "parliamentary reservation" for Bundeswehr missions abroad. This reservation will probably not be a two-thirds majority, because this would endanger the ability of the respective government majority to act, but only an absolute majority, the so-called chancellor's majority. According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, conservative Social Democrats would welcome such a ruling by Karlsruhe, because this is the only way they see to change their own party's decision against UN combat missions.
