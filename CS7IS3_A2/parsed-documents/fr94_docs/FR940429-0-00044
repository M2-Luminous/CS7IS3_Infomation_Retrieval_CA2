FR940429-0-00044 FR940429-0-00010 Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes coordination of this is a federal responsibility. In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example, that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession. To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards. The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration, also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements of the different agencies are compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration. The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions, as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department, will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad. Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement, where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden, and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 602 in the Federal Register (59 FR 3578). The NPRM included, on pages 3578&hyph;3601, a thorough discussion of the major issues addressed by the proposed regulations. The following is a brief summary of the major proposed changes to the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies that were contained in the NPRM. 1. As required by section 496(m) of the HEA, the proposed regulations authorized the Secretary to recognize only those accrediting agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. 2. As required by section 496(a) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization. In accordance with the statute, the proposed regulations allowed the Secretary to waive this requirement under certain conditions.
