Security and stability are necessary conditions for the continuation of the economic reform and development programs. These programs have so far achieved results that have drawn praise from several international economic circles. In his first meeting with the newly formed National Democratic Party [NDP] General Secretariat, President Mubarak asked the Secretariat to get in touch with other political parties with a view to launching a national dialogue. Following Mubarak's meeting with the NDP Secretariat, Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that the Secretariat has been in touch with all political parties. Al-Sharif said that there are many points of agreement with those parties and only a few of disagreement. This boosts the hope that the national dialogue will produce constructive and positive results that would have a beneficial effect on the country's future. There is no doubt that this clear desire of the Egyptian political parties [to hold a national dialogue] is a response to the sincere call made by President Mubarak some time ago, in a bid to serve the interests of the country and the nation. President Mubarak called for that dialogue to be a fair and honest one in which all parties, including the NDP, should rise above their rivalries. President Mubarak promised that the NDP's role, as the majority party, will be one of creating the appropriate atmosphere for a successful national dialogue. We have not the least doubt that we are all patriots, seeking to promote the general interest of our beloved country and nation. Our profound commitment to democracy, reiterated by President Mubarak, is an endeavor in which all of us should get involved. Democracy is the wind that will bring country's ship to safe shores. It is the only and best guarantee against excesses of all sorts. Democracy involves much more than rhetoric. Every one of us should insist on democracy being upheld. We have to create the right atmosphere for every citizen to exercise his constitutional rights in such a way as to shore up the country's national unity and ensure that anyone who is tempted to jeopardize the nation's security and stability and undermine the livelihood of the citizens is brought to justice. It is our firm belief that the responsibility of protecting the nation does not rest solely with the government, but is a joint responsibility for both the people, who care for the country's future prosperity, and the government. A look at the circumstances through which the country and nation are passing is enough to persuade us that our only recourse is to correct our mistakes. This, of course, is easier said than done. It involves a strong resolve and definite desire to repair the damage that the evil hands have done to our country's security and stability. The consequences of our failure to do that could be grave. Therefore, we affirm that the outcome of national dialogue will lay the groundwork for national policies for many years to come, during which the nation may look forward to an improvement in their standards through the joint effort of the country's political parties.
