According to Foreign Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh, the prime minister informed the German leaders that Pakistan is not against bilateral talks, but our experiences from previous rounds of talks show that India is neither serious nor sincere in finding an acceptable solution to the Kashmir dispute. The prime minister said the German leaders greatly appreciated Pakistan's efforts to establish peace in Bosnia. She held detailed talks with Carl-Dieter Spranger, German minister of economic cooperation, on financial assistance to Pakistan. The German financial assistance and technical expertise will greatly help in overcoming the energy crisis in Pakistan. The prime minister stressed the need for changing the strategy on providing German economic assistance in order to make part of it available for annual development programs which will help implement welfare and development programs. The German minister informed Benazir Bhutto that his government has initiated steps under which a private company will provide [word indistinct] protection for German investment in Pakistan. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to Islamabad early this morning after her four-day official visit to Germany. When she left Berlin for home yesterday evening, she was accorded an extremely dignified send-off. [passage omitted] Radio Pakistan's representative says the most important objective of the prime minister's visit to Germany was to acquire technical and financial assistance for welfare and development programs of the present government and to muster support and cooperation for Pakistan's stance on regional and international issues, including Kashmir, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan; there has been considerable success in achieving that objective. A high-level delegation of the German parliamentary Economic Committee will soon visit Pakistan to review development needs. Chancellor Kohl assured Benazir Bhutto that this committee and the ministries concerned will seriously consider her suggestions in order to give a positive response to them as soon as possible. Radio Pakistan representative Yunus Khokar says the visit has created a better understanding between Germany and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and effectively exposed the human rights violations and Indian atrocities in Kashmir, which in turn has created sufficient sympathy from the German leaders and people to Pakistan's stand on Kashmiri people and the Kashmir issue. There was total coordination on the views and stand of the two countries on the Bosnian issue and lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government to enable it to defend its people against the savage Serb attacks. Germany lauded Pakistan's efforts for peace and normalizing the situations in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Somalia.
