He has said the more than 80,000 meetings at work centers, attended by more than 3 million people, undoubtedly had had a positive outcome. The objective of the meetings, which started in late January, was to consult with the rank and file on solutions to the economic problems. The labor movement's biggest accomplishment has been in promoting a change in mentality, even in its own union groups, the CTC leader has told the newspaper GRANMA. After saying the assembly process, popularly known as workers parliaments, had yielded high political gains, Ross said the main demands had centered on greater control of material and financial resources and the implementation of penalties on those who steal government assets. The workers explicitly understand a revamping of the country's finances requires an increase of production based on improved productivity and efficiency, he has said. Ever since Cuba lost its commercial partners in the former socialist bloc, it has been confronting an adverse economic situation that can be translated into an excess of currency greater than $10 billion--equivalent to dollars in the official exchange--a fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion [no currency specified] and high subsidies. [sentence as received] Furthermore, the U.S. blockade, in effect for more than 30 years, was intensified, causing losses calculated at more than $40 billion, according to local authorities' conservative estimates. The Cuban Parliament agreed last December to hold a special meeting to discuss the restoration of the country's internal finances. The date of the meeting has still not been announced officially, but media sources estimate it will be in April.
