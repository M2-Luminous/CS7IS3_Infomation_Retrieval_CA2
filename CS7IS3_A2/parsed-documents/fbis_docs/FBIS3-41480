Ukraine has no facilities to process nuclear fuel waste. Earlier, processing was done in Russia. Ukrainian nuclear plants have stockpiled a lot of used magazines after Russia's refusal to receive waste for processing. They are now kept at ``cooling'' ponds which are virtually filled up. If the problem is not resolved in the next 12-18 months, operating power units of nuclear plants should be switched off one by one. The UKRINFORM news agency reports that storage facilities of the Duke Power Company have a general licence of the U.S. leading control organisation and are already in operation at three American nuclear power plants and two nuclear laboratories. The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant has already started work to implement the contract: an ecological and technological feasibility report is now being drafted. If this and following work is successful, Ukraine will have the first stage of such a storage facility for nuclear waste by the end of 1995. In the agency's opinion, the construction of similar storages at other nuclear stations will help stabilise the situation in this field and to resolve the problem of temporary storage of nuclear fuel waste.
