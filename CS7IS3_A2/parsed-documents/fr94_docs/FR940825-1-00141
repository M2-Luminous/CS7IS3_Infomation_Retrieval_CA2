FR940825-1-00141 FR940825-1-00010 Thursday August 25, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 91 Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 164␣/␣Thursday, August 25, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 26242, Notice No. 94&hyph;28] RIN 2120&hyph;AF30 Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This notice proposes to reinstate as SFAR 62&hyph;1 and modify expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation and use of automatic altitude reporting (Mode C) transponders. On December 5, 1990, the FAA published SFAR No. 62, which suspended the Mode C transponder requirement for certain operations to and from specific outlying airports located within 30 miles of a terminal control area (Class B airspace area) primary airport (the Mode C Veil). The operations and routings specified in SFAR No. 62 included operations within a 2 nautical mile radius of the designated airports and along a direct route between those airports and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. No airports were excluded from the Mode C transponder requirement if those airports were primarily served by aircraft required to install and operate Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS). SFAR No. 62 was issued with an expiration date of December 30, 1993, to allow sufficient time to upgrade ATC radar systems at the Class B airspace areas listed in the SFAR. Scheduled radar system upgrades have not been completed and operationally assessed in all of the Class B airspace areas. This notice proposes to reinstate the previous exclusions at those Class B airspace areas that have not attained improved radar coverage, amend the list of exempted airports affected by the movement of the Denver Class B airspace and Mode C veil associated with the closing of the Stapleton International Airport and opening of the Denver International Airport, Denver CO, and reinstate and amend the previous exclusions in the 4 Class B airspace areas that have attained improved radar coverage. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1994.
