Bolivia will be the only South American country which will not have significant reductions in the aid which it receives in the form of financial cooperation with the United States Government in the struggle against narcotics trafficking. This was officially announced by Minister of Government German Quiroga Gomez. In the course of the exclusive interview he granted to the editors of LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz Quiroga stated that in the framework of "uninterrupted North American aid" Bolivia expects to receive about $180 million in 1994. These will be new resources earmarked for providing support for the struggle against drug trafficking, as well as for undertaking alternative development strategies through an effective program of substituting other crops for coca leaf production by peasant farmers. This assistance will be based on "promises made by the administration of President Bill Clinton to Bolivia during the visit by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to New York on 28 September, during the most recent meeting of the United Nations General Assembly." Growing External Aid According to the explanation provided, North American aid in the field of fighting against illicit drug trafficking is directed at the interdiction of the traffic, alternative development, crop eradication, and the implementation of integral development projects in the Chapare and Yungas areas, where coca leaves have been traditionally produced. Quiroga said: "Bolivia has signed financial and technical cooperation agreements with the United States since 1990." At the same time he pointed out that North American financial cooperation is closely related to the help which it provides to the Bolivian balance of payments. He added: "For this purpose it has been spending between $40 and $60 million annually." However, at the same time he made clear that this significant amount of help has been conditioned on the eradication of a certain number of hectares of fields in the Chapare and Yungas areas which were planted to coca leaves. On this point he emphasized that it is possible that in 1994 the total amount of aid for this purpose "will decline because of the fact that Bolivia, as of this date, has not eradicated the number of hectares planted to coca leaves which it promised to complete by December 1993." The second type of United States cooperation is related to the Ibta-Chapare Project, which essentially is aimed at the industrialization of a large part of the tropical area of the Department of Cochabamba. Quiroga explained that this technical aid is aimed at promoting alternatives, in terms of products and crops, in areas producing coca leaves. New Projects During the meeting of the Consultative Group of the World Bank which took place a short time ago in Washington, Bolivia proposed to the international financial community the possibility of approving "greater economic support and better programs for the promotion of products other than coca leaves." Alternative development plans of this kind are presently being carried out in areas where coca leaves have traditionally been planted. According to the minister of government, the Bolivian committee which visited Washington and was led by the minister of finance and economic development presented for the consideration of the international financial community a new proposal for alternative development for the areas which have traditionally produced coca leaves.
