The commission's report -- which was due to be handed to President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday, but was delayed at the last minute -- could contain the hardest evidence to date of an organised third force within the security forces. The Goldstone report could blow the police general staff right out of the water, said sources inside the SAP. Several other police generals are understood to have been under scrutiny in the case, which has been under investigation by the commission since mid-February. Sources close to the investigation expect De Klerk to move against Smit within days. Smit is widely believed to have survived an attempt by De Klerk to purge the SAP of conservative generals in August 1992, because it was felt that Smit's previous positions on the highest state security councils had given him access to information which would be damaging to the government and SAP if released. Smit is the former head of the 12,000-strong Crime Combating and Investigation Unit, which amalgamated the Special Branch with other detective branches of the SAP. As senior deputy-commissioner he is the number two policeman in South Africa after SAP Commissioner General Johan van de Merwe. He is currently in charge of staff functions in the SAP which include all administrative and auxiliary services. The other deputy commissioner, Lieutenant-General Johan Swart, heads the executive branch in charge of police on the ground. Smit has headed the security police in the Northern Transvaal and was chief of the SAP Special Branch. He has been described as "harsh" and as having "political ambitions". Judge Richard Goldstone said on Wednesday the report into gun-running by senior figures within the security forces had been delayed because "the commission has been conducting further related inquiries." But the delay may also have been the result of threatened legal action by some of the generals the commission was planning to finger, said one source. Revelations of a high-level gun-running operation and a plan to instigate political violence could help explain violent incidents which have cost thousands of lives in recent months. Van der Merwe was in emergency meetings with members of general staff this week. Smit was said by his secretary to be "in very urgent meetings until Monday. He is in the commissioner's office." Swart was on annual leave for three weeks, according to his office. The Goldstone Commission is believed to have delayed its report in order to give De Klerk time to fire the SAP generals involved. "That would allow De Klerk to seize the initiative in time for the election," said one senior source. ANC [African National Congress] intelligence is understood to have co-operated with the Goldstone Commission's investigation. A senior ANC source said: "This involves very high-level police officers, including generals." The investigation was made public early this week by Transkei leader Major General Bantu Holomisa, who is number 13 on the ANC's list of candidates for the national assembly. Judge Goldstone confirmed an investigation had been underway since mid-February, saying he had kept both De Klerk and Nelson Mandela informed throughout. A highly placed source described one of the generals involved in the gun-running operation as "the second-in-command of one of the security forces", but refused to name him. The number two slot in the South African Defence Force, chief of Defence Force Staff, is currently unoccupied after the departure late last year of Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn. It is understood Holomisa forced the commission's hand over the results of the investigation because of continuing ANC suspicion that Goldstone is vulnerable to pressure from De Klerk.
