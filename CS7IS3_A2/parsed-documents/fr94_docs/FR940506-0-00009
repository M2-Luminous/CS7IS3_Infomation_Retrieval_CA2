FR940506-0-00009 FR940506-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;ASO&hyph;22] Alteration of Jet Routes; FL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida. Alteration of the current jet route structure between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, will enhance safety by increasing separation between Jet Routes J&hyph;79, J&hyph;121, J&hyph;174, and J&hyph;103 and the western boundary of Warning Areas W&hyph;157, W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On April 5, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida (58 FR 17541). An increase in the separation of the current jet route structure between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, from the western boundary of Warning Areas W&hyph;157, W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159 will enhance safety. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. One comment objecting to the proposal was received from the Air Transport Association (ATA). The ATA believes that readjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is a better option for increasing the airspace clearance between the jet routes and the warning areas rather than creating doglegs. ATA contends that these changes will increase route mileage approximately .7 nautical miles, which translates into increased flight times, and increased operating costs to the airline industry. In order to ensure adequate airspace separation between the warning areas' western boundaries and Jet Routes J&hyph;79, J&hyph;121, J&hyph;174, and J&hyph;103, it is necessary to realign these jet routes. Experience has shown that during the winter months, very strong westerly winds exist at the jet route altitudes which can cause aircraft to rapidly drift east of course toward the western boundaries of the warning areas. By moving the jet routes further to the west, this action will enhance safety by increasing the distance from the warning areas. Adjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is not a feasible alternative at this time. Radar, telemetry equipment, and other range resources are strategically located based on existing warning area boundaries in order to support the essential military activity. Relocation of these resources would be a costly and lengthy process. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the most expeditious and cost-effective alternative is to alter the current jet route structure. Except for editorial changes, and the previous amendments to Jet Routes J&hyph;79 and J&hyph;174 (contained in Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;45; effective May 27, 1993), this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet routes listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida. Alteration of the current jet route structures between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, will increase separation from the western boundary of Warning Areas W&hyph;157, W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159 and the jet routes. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
