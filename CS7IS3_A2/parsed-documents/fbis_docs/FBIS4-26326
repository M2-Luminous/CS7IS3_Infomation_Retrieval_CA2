Sources in Shenzhen said the municipal leadership yesterday lobbied Mr Jiang to allow the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to continue its role as a ground for experimenting with market reforms. Mr Jiang arrived in the zone on Sunday and will leave today or tomorrow. A team appointed by Mr Jiang and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongli is in the final process of drafting a document on the "next stage" of economic reform, which will be endorsed by the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee scheduled for the autumn. Sources familiar with the drafting process said the document would spell out the desired kinds of "macro-level adjustments and controls" under a socialist market economy. While the document recommends that most of the market reforms outlined at the Third Plenum last November be continued, it will also introduce means in which the Government can ensure that they can be accomplished without disruptive effects such as inflation and unemployment. The sources said since the spring, Mr Jiang had made trips to different parts of the country to solicit support for the programme. They pointed out Mr Jiang, who is also party General Secretary, took the opportunity to warn regional cadres they must put the "overall situation of the country" ahead of local interests. Recommendations that are expected to be passed by the Fourth Plenum include ways to control excessive fixed-assets investment by localities and to ensure that sufficient land be devoted to farming, especially grain production. Mr Jiang's team is also working out strategies to restructure government-owned enterprises without leading to unemployment or the loss of state assets. Sources in Shenzhen said municipal leaders presented Mr Jiang with a blueprint for economic reform through to the mid-1990s. "While assuring that Shenzhen would abide by national priorities, SEZ cadres indicated they hoped the zone would be allowed to go on experimenting with market reforms," a source said. "These reforms will set the pace for the entire country, and also facilitate the economic integration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong." For example, one reform being carried out in the SEZ is to promote the separation of Government and business by ensuring even state-owned companies no longer need remain the subordinate units of government departments. It is understood Mr Jiang gave a general support for Shenzhen's reforms, which also enjoy the backing of the State Commission for the Reform of the Economic Structure. Last week, Mr Jiang spread the message of liberalisation, coupled with restraint, to leaders of other Guangdong cities of Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.
