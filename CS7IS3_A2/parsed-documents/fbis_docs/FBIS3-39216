Today, it is a natural foundation of our political culture. Even though it has become fashionable again among some people to preach "Europessimism," no one can ignore the fact that Germany's integration into a union of European democracies has, meanwhile, become irreversible. We would fail in the eyes of history, yes, we would deliberately gamble away great capital, if we were to bow to that advice today that says we should, first of all, deal with the challenges resulting from German unification and only secondly take care of European unification. Leaving European integration would not only be suicidal in political terms; it would also destroy the bases of our prosperity and, not least, millions of jobs. I deliberately say this in such dramatic terms, because many people have meanwhile forgotten why we have lived in peace for such a long time. We owe this to European integration to a decisive extent. It has contributed to overcoming rivalries and conflicts that had existed for centuries between the various nations. As a result of the process of European unification, we have been able to unite our strengths in Europe for mutual benefit. In view of the dramatic changes in the world over the past years, common action by all Europeans is as important today as it was during the years after the end of World War II. It is now necessary to prove that this old continent does not suffer from decrepitude, but that it is able to develop its entire dynamism and a really youthful strength. This is not only a question of economy and finances. Whoever believes -- and this is understandable in times of high unemployment and difficult economic problems -- that he can solve all problems via the economy, will be wrong. We have seen again and again that the decisive precondition for a change for the better is remembering one's intellectual-cultural bases. Therefore, the issues of education and training belong at the center of the discussion about safeguarding our future. The German education and training system has a traditionally good reputation. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves today whether this system fully lives up to the changed requirements and conditions. Whoever undertakes university studies in Germany after leaving school is almost 30 years old on average when he enters professional life. At the same time, the average retirement age of men is 59 years. This means that, in many cases, 50 years of training and retirement are set off by only about 30 years of productive work. This calculation cannot be positive. What we need is a young generation that is confident it can live up to the challenges. However, we need an older generation that conveys this confidence and also points out opportunities just as much. Furthermore, our country needs the creativity and the intellectual mobility in particular of young people in professional life. On the international labor market, the German university graduate has clear disadvantages compared with his younger foreign competitors. Structural reforms in the university sector leading to a reduction of the average studying time are long overdue. This is also necessary to strengthen our universities in research and scientific teaching. The number of drop-outs is too high. In addition, almost one-fourth of university graduates work in a job that does not correspond to their academic training. The time is ripe to also come to structural decisions in education policy that make the overall system of education and training, science and research more efficient and flexible. This is not so much a question of finances, but, rather, one of being open-minded to new ideas. As a convinced federalist, I respect the distribution of powers between the Federal Government and the laender, which is set down in the Constitution. However, the questions of education and training are also issues of national importance. Whoever is responsible is also obligated to act. I cannot understand it at all when the laender block urgently needed modernization measures. It is the laender that can and must make decisive progress with the necessary structural reforms. University reforms cannot be carried out successfully against the universities, but only together with them. Our country's ability to face the future is decided in the university sector, in science and research. We depend more than others on innovations, on intelligent products and qualified services, that is, in particular, from the creativity and the training qualifications of our working people. In this connection, it is particularly important to bring together at the universities young scientists and future managers from the most varied range of countries. Despite the need for broad education at a high level, one thing is indispensable: Our universities must once again be able to work under conditions that facilitate and promote top achievements. Liberal democracy, more than any other form of a state, needs a good atmosphere, a common will to promote achievements. This has nothing to do with a so-called elbow mentality, but is an important precondition for a country having a future at all. The essential element of a university is autonomy. In our German university system we must expand the leeway for the individual universities' own responsibility. The universities in Germany must have the opportunity -- yes, they must be motivated -- to try out new approaches themselves and to give themselves an independent profile with innovative forms of teaching and research. Basically, it is a question of internal readiness and intellectual attitude whether we will be able to manage the breakthrough to structural changes and to overcoming ossification. This applies to the education sector just as to other fields of politics. Ladies and Gentlemen, progress in European integration also requires further modernization in economy and society in our country. Already in the past, the opening of borders in Europe essentially contributed to growth and employment in Germany and among our neighbors. We must realize that international competition is intensifying. In addition to the expanding national economics in the East Asian and Pacific area, we now have an industrious and highly motivated competition right in front of our own door. I am thinking of countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, or Hungary. Their production costs only a fraction of what it costs here. We want these countries to be economically successful. They should not remain dependent on Western aid, but be able to earn their foreign currency themselves. Also with a view to these developments, we must make changes in our country and change our way of thinking. Even though some people no longer want to recognize this today, we Germans owe the European Community an unprecedented degree of prosperity. About three-fourths of our exports today go to the European economic area, about two-thirds of our imports come from there. Thus, whoever today calls for "less Europe," puts at stake many millions of jobs that are safeguarded by the interlacement with our partners in Europe. What we have achieved in Europe in the past must be safeguarded and expanded for the future. The Maastricht Treaty, which came into force on 1 November last year despite all the pessimistic predictions, gives us new opportunities for that: First: In order to lastingly ensure employment, growth, and prosperity in Europe and in Germany, we will implement the economic and monetary union. The future European currency will be as stable as our tested German mark. In order to ensure this, we have pushed through strict criteria for participation in the economic and monetary union in the Maastricht Treaty. In part, these preconditions include a solid economic and financial policy. We will never agree to weakening the criteria of stability! For us, the decision of the European Council in favor of Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the European Monetary Institute, and thus also of the future European Central Bank, was particularly encouraging for us. This is a convincing sign of trust in our stability policy and an encouragement to continue on this course with determination. Second: We want a common European policy in the important field of internal security. For many years I have stressed this necessity to the German and the international public -- in particular in view of the spread of organized crime and the international drug mafia. We must assume that, in 1993, the drug mafia has smuggled an amount into Europe -- primarily, of course, into the hard-currency countries -- that corresponds to the budget of the Kingdom of Belgium. One need not be an expect to realize the changes that can be caused by this in the substance of our community. Since the wirepullers and helpers of crime operate all over Europe and all over the world nowadays, we must organize the struggle against them accordingly. No country in Europe is able to master this growing danger on its own. In the interests of our citizens we want open borders in Europe. However, this must not go hand in hand with a loss in internal security. With Europol we have taken a first step toward pursuing the struggle against international organized crime together and with determination. In talking with my European colleagues, I emphatically express the conviction that the instruments of the Maastricht Treaty are not yet sufficient. Beyond them, we must think about what we can do specifically -- not least on the basis of the experiences gathered by the U.S. authorities -- in combating organized crime and the drug mafia. Third: In particular from the German viewpoint, the development of a common foreign and security policy is an existential question. We have more neighbors than any other country in Europe. We have lived in peace for 48 years now, but it would be a fateful error to believe that this is guaranteed for eternity. The evil spirits of the past are not only alive in the Balkans. We need Europe's political unification so as to prevent any relapse into the national rivalries of former times. Some sort of elevated free-trade zone is not sufficient for this purpose. War and peace in Europe depend on whether we manage to build this "European home" firmly, so that it can weather any storm and cannot be destroyed anymore. In the future, the Europeans can only master the great foreign and security policy challenges together. The war in the former Yugoslavia, not least, has demonstrated the current limits of the European Community in crisis prevention and crisis management. For two years, we have seen the terrible pictures of the suffering people in Sarajevo and elsewhere on the television news every evening. What is at stake here is the credibility of the European democracies. In many countries -- also in Germany -- the efforts to end the conflict are considered to be insufficient. In view of the horrible pictures in the areas of war, many people ask whey the West and, in particular, NATO are not doing more to end the conflict. I have much understanding for these questions. However, here one forgets how much this war is characterized by hatred and irrationality, which have grown over centuries. In reality, there is no omnipotent prescription for solving this conflict. We Germans in particular should be especially careful with our advice. We do not have the moral right to demand more of those responsible in other countries than we ourselves do. Rather, we should express respect for those young soldiers, and their relatives, who risk their lives and work there for the United Nations. Ladies and Gentlemen, a common foreign and security policy of the European Union would remain piecemeal if European defense were not added. The WEU [Western European Union] has a key role in this. Atlantic alliance and European defenses must supplement and strengthen each other meaningfully. In this connection, it was a great success of the latest NATO summit in Brussels that cooperation between NATO and the European Union will be essentially expanded. In the future, the WEU will be able to use NATO forces for its own mission. At the same time, the Eurocorps, which was established by President Mitterrand and myself, will soon be available for the common defense of the alliance, for peacekeeping missions, and for humanitarian tasks. Ladies and Gentlemen, we want to build this Europe as a Europe of the people. This Europe is to be a federal construct. Federal means that the authority and decisionmaking power lies there where the decision can best be made. In case of doubt, this is at the level that is closer to the citizens. Only those things that really have to be decided there are to be decided in Brussels. Some EC guidelines are certainly superfluous. However, for the sake of fairness, one must also admit that many of these guidelines are due to initiatives of national interest groups. Therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen, a year ago in Edinburgh we decided to establish criteria and control mechanism so as to make such developments impossible in the future. We do not want to build a European superstate, we want a European community, a "European home," in which people feel comfortable and in which many things will remain different. This Europe is not to have a uniformly gray facade, but all the facets and the entire wealth of colors, the entire colorful bouquet of Europe is to become visible. In the Europe of the future, we will remain Germans, Britons, Italians, or French. We remain firmly rooted in our home regions. In this sense, Maastricht does not stand for a European leviathan, but for a decentralized and democratic Europe that is close to the people. In particular, the variety of the peoples in Europe offers the preconditions for a synthesis that links the best qualities of the peoples. Europe's strength lies in the fruitful relationship of tension between the unity and lively variety of our cultural heritage. In this connection, it must also be noted that the European Union, as it now stands, is only a torso. I hope that in 1995, Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will join the European Union as planned. Certainly, there are still difficulties in the current negotiations. However, we must try to follow the difficult path in the future together. Just as the accession of the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states is a natural part of the development of the European Union, in my view, it would be unacceptable for me, if, in the long run, the border of the political union were to remain the Oder-Neisse border. Therefore, at the European Council in Copenhagen last June, we also opened up clear prospects for membership to our eastern neighbors. Ladies and Gentlemen, I know we are facing enormous tasks in Europe. I know that one could despair because of that. However, I also know that it is not the business of one single generation, but these are tasks of generations -- still, we can make progress in Europe. This path has brought us much happiness. It has brought German unification. When we now say in the spirit of Thomas Mann: "We are German Europeans and European Germans," then this is a wonderful thing for the future -- to be able to live in freedom and in peace! We can do something with a view to the hopes of large parts of the Third World, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, those countries and peoples who have not only experienced good things from Europe, but also many unpleasant things in the course of their history. We must make wealth of cultural assets, of intellectual developments of the most varied kind usable. It is a very essential basis of human creativity, and thus also a basis for political and economic success. I believe that we should think primarily of the next, the young generation, and act in its spirit. Young people in Germany -- that is you, who are studying here -- have the opportunity to live in peace and freedom in the future, a bit of luck that no other generation in Germany has ever had. However, we must also do something for that. Today, we have the opportunity to link up with good traditions -- from that time before the era of nation-state rivalries -- when one began one's studies in Oxford, for instance, continued them in Bologna, and then went to Paris. You, dear students, live a life in Europe already, now, that we want to achieve for tomorrow: a continent of open borders, of good neighborliness, and friendship. What is needed is your initiative, your creative intelligence, your self-confidence, and also your ability to make a contribution to the future of our country and of Europe. In particular, I address you, the students, because actually it is rather more your Europe of which I am speaking than mine. When your are 63 or 64 years old, you naturally think of how much time you still have. You think differently than the 20-year-old student I was in 1950. But I remember one thing, namely that we were a generation that was confident it could build this Europe. Therefore, there is no reason for that cultural pessimism that is, unfortunately, paid for highly in Germany. I feel primarily gratitude that in my generation it has been possible to continue the work of the wonderful founders of the FRG. Europe -- that is the future that I wish for us. In particular, however, for you, the students.
