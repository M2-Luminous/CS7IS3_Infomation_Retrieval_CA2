Brigadier General 'Abdallah al-Watiri, head of the Counternarcotics Department at the Cairo Security Directorate, said today that the Counternarcotics Department succeeded in the past nine months in eliminating most drug trafficking dens in Cairo, particularly the areas of al-Batniyah, al-Jayyarah, al-Husayniyah, and Birkat al-Hajj. Al-Watiri said that the intensive campaigns by counternarcotics personnel led to the seizure of a number of kiosks that sell the bango plant, which is a cheap drug compared to other types. The price of one kilogram of bango ranges from 600 to 900 pounds, whereas one kilo of heroin sells for 400,000 pounds. He noted that campaigns were launched against certain pharmacies, which resulted in the closure of many pharmacies that trade illegally in certain medicines and tranquilizers that contain narcotic and alcoholic ingredients. The Health Ministry and the Pharmacists Association have been notified.
