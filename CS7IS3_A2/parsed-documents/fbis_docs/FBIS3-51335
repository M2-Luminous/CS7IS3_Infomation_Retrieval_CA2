Vargas begins by discussing the government's decision to change the municipal tax system. This is a controversial decision, he says, and mayors have reacted strongly against cuts in its revenues. Vargas adds that Finance Minister Jorge Camet has supported the decision of President Fujimori, who said that he will prove that municipalities will indeed receive more funds. His guests include Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont; Enrique Espinosa, Metropolitan Institute of Planning president; Enrique Labarte, municipal economic adviser and assemblyman; and Arturo Castillo, Chiclayo mayor and Association of Peruvian Municipalities president. Belmont says this hasty decision does not surprise him. A similar situation, he adds, happened when Democratic Constituent Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama urged Peruvians to vote for the new Constitution in the referendum regardless of whether they had read it. Vargas asks Belmont what he did when he learned that President Fujimori was about to make this decision. Belmont says that he protested sternly. He details the works his administration has accomplished so far. Labarte quotes a congressman who said that municipalities will get more funds, except Lima, whose revenues will be redistributed. LA REPUBLICA reporter Ismael Leon asks Belmont what he thinks about certain mayors' decision to support the redistribution of funds from rich municipalities, such as Lima, to poorer municipalities. Belmont says that he has been unable to meet with President Fujimori to discuss this issue and that it is a shame that the president refuses to let anyone do anything good. Belmont lists the major achievements of his administration. Vargas asks how this decision will affect Lima in 1994. Belmont says that many projects will not be built, that many jobs will disappear, and that prices will go up. He compares this situation to being in a boxing ring with tied hands. Vargas asks if other mayors agree with Belmont's viewpoints. Mayor Castillo says he does, and Chiclayo will also be affected by cuts in municipal revenues, he says. Belmont says "Peru is suffering from divisions." He adds that congressmen should visit Chiclayo, Puno, and other poor municipalities to learn firsthand of their realities. Vargas agrees with him. Belmont adds that he has visited Huaycan, a poor neighborhood. He says he has performed many works, but the media have not been invited to the openings or covered such events. Belmont says Peru is a whole nation, but "Lima is not responsible for the lack of development elsewhere in the country and for governmental mistakes." Lima has many problems too, he adds. Reporter Leon wonders whether municipal governments are more important than regional governments. Castillo says he believes that the two governments are necessary to decentralize the administration. Vargas cites Economy Minister Camet, who has said provincial governments have kept all the funds instead of distributing them among municipalities. Castillo replies that this is a big lie. Vargas also wonders if this issue is being politicized, and Belmont insists it is. He adds that President Fujimori is polarizing Peruvians, saying, he is "playing political games." Belmont concludes that the new Constitution will let Fujimori stay in power for many years, because he will seek reelection, but Castillo says he harbors doubts about this possibility.
