He is of the view that the 20 Hawk aircraft being acquired to replace the A-4 Skyhawk are insufficient. The Air Force plans to increase the number of Hawk aircraft in the future. He told reporters this at the RMAF [Royal Malaysian Air Force] base in Butterworth. Earlier, Datuk Abdul Gani was present at the handing-over of a Hawk 100, one of the two aircraft acquired from Britain for the purpose of training. The purchase of the 20 Hawk was made under a memorandum of understanding signed by the Malaysian and British Governments three years ago.
