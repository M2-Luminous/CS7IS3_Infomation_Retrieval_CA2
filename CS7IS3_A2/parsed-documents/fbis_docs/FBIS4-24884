A tearful Ding, whose son Jiang Jielian was shot by soldiers on June 3, 1989, said she and her husband Jiang Peikun had only drunk water since after dinner Thursday, according to a reporter who succeeded in telephoning the protesters Friday despite official efforts to isolate them. Jiang Peikun, also a professor, said this week that if police officers outside their home had not left by Thursday the couple would begin their protest at 6:25 p.m. (1025 GMT) and continue until Saturday, the anniverary of the army's crushing of pro-democracy demonstraters on June 4, 1989. The hunger strike's starting time marks the moment of the birth of Jiang Jielan, who celebrated his 17th birthday one day before being killed. The couple lit candles on a birthday cake Thursday to mark what would have been his 22nd birthday. "My son was shot between 11:05 and 11:15 pm on June 3," Ding, a 57-year-old philosophy professor who suffers from heart problems, told this reporter. "I don't know when he actually stopped breathing. I will continue to fast till June 4 because I want to commemorate others who died with him," she said. Ding said her heart had been bothering her Thursday night but insisted that she was now better and lying in bed very calmly. The reporter said however that Ding was crying and sounded weak and shaky. The number of plainclothes police visible from her window had increased from about four to eight Thursday night, the professor said, confirming that the reporter was the only person to succeed in calling her in almost 24 hours. The authorities began blocking all incoming and outgoing calls to Ding's appartment around midday Thursday. "The police don't want people to know what I'm doing," she said. Jiang said Thursday that police had followed him and his wife everywhere in recent days and harassed anybody who tried to visit them. The couple sent an appeal to the Chinese Government last week to restore their freedom. The houses of all dissidents and their families have been placed under heavy surveillance recently, as part of an intense security clampdown here in the run-up to the anniversary of the massacre.
