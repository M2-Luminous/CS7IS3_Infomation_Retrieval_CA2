FR940527-1-00124 FR940527-1-00014 The hospital-specific rate for each hospital was calculated by dividing the hospital's Medicare inpatient capital-related costs for a specified base year by its Medicare discharges (adjusted for transfers), and dividing the result by the hospital's case mix index (also adjusted for transfers). The resulting case-mix adjusted average cost per discharge was then updated to FY 1992 based on the national average increase in Medicare's inpatient capital cost per discharge and adjusted by the exceptions payment adjustment factor and the budget neutrality adjustment factor to yield the FY 1992 hospital-specific rate. The hospital-specific rate is updated each year after FY 1992 for inflation and for changes in the exceptions payment adjustment factor and the budget neutrality adjustment factor. To determine the appropriate budget neutrality adjustment factors and the exceptions payment adjustment factor, we developed a dynamic model of Medicare inpatient capital-related costs, that is, a model that projects changes in Medicare inpatient capital-related costs over time. The model and its application are described more fully in Appendix B. In accordance with section 1886(d)(9)(A) of the Act, under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, hospitals located in Puerto Rico are paid under a special payment formula. These hospitals are paid a blended rate that takes into account their geographical designation and is comprised of 75 percent of the applicable standardized amount specific to Puerto Rico hospitals and 25 percent of the applicable national average standardized amount. Section 412.374 provides for the use of this blended payment system for payments to Puerto Rico hospitals under the prospective payment system for inpatient capital-related costs. Accordingly, for capital-related costs we compute a separate payment rate specific to Puerto Rico hospitals using the same methodology used to compute the national Federal rate for capital. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid based on 75 percent of the Puerto Rico rate and 25 percent of the Federal rate. A. Determination of Federal Inpatient Capital-Related Prospective Payment Rate Update For FY 1994, the Federal rate was $378.34. With the changes we are proposing to the factors used to establish the Federal rate, we are proposing that the FY 1995 Federal rate would be $353.87. In the discussion that follows, we explain the factors that were used to determine the proposed FY 1994 Federal rate. In particular, we explain why the FY 1994 Federal rate has decreased 6.47 percent compared to the FY 1993 Federal rate. We also explain that aggregate payments under the capital proposal are estimated to increase by 2.24 percent. The major factor contributing to the decrease in the FY 1994 rate in comparison to FY 1993 is the requirement at ยง412.352 that estimated payments each year from FY 1992 through FY 1995 for capital costs equal 90 percent of what would have been payable that year on a reasonable cost basis. Based on the most recent data, we now estimate that capital payments for FY 1992 were approximately 92.98 percent of reasonable costs, that capital payments for FY 1993 were approximately 97.44 percent of reasonable costs, and that capital payments for FY 1994 were approximately 93.05 percent of reasonable costs. The data thus indicate that the budget neutrality adjustments for FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 were not sufficient to meet the 90 percent target and that, as a consequence, the Federal rates for both FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 were higher than they should have been. While we do not retroactively adjust the budget neutrality factor and the Federal rate for previous years to account for revised estimates, we do employ the most recent information available to refine the budget neutrality adjustment for subsequent years. The result is a lower budget neutrality adjustment factor for FY 1995 than FY 1994, which is the cause of the decrease in the Federal rate. Although the Federal rate for FY 1995 is 6.47 percent lower than the FY 1994 Federal rate, we estimate that total capital payments per case will increase 2.24 percent in FY 1995. The increase in total payments per case is due to the increase in the budget neutrality target to equal 90 percent of estimated FY 1994 capital costs per case. Since section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that estimated payments equal 90 percent of estimated reasonable costs for capital-related expenses, payments under the capital prospective payment system can be expected to increase as capital costs per case increase. The increase in payments per case from FY 1994 to FY 1995 (2.24 percent) is less than the total estimated increase in capital costs per case between FY 1994 and FY 1995 (5.70 percent) because estimated FY 1994 payments were 3.39 percent higher than the FY 1994 budget neutrality target. As a result, payments must increase less than the full increase in costs to prevent estimated payments for FY 1995 from exceeding 90 percent of reasonable cost. Specifically, the increase in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is determined by dividing the increase in cost per case by the excess of FY 1994 payments over the budget neutrality target (that is, 1.0570/1.0339 = 1.0224, an increase of 2.24 percent). We discuss the determination of the budget neutrality target in section III.A.3 below. Finally, it should be noted that total payments to hospitals under the prospective payment system will be relatively insensitive to changes in the Federal rate even after the expiration of the budget neutrality provision in FY 1996. Since capital payments constitute about 10 percent of hospital payments, a 1 percent change in the Federal rate yields only about a 0.1 percent change in actual payments to hospitals. 1. Standard Federal Rate Update Section 412.308(c)(1)(i) provides that for FY 1993 through FY 1995, the standard Federal rate is updated on the basis of a lagged 2-year moving average of the actual increase, adjusted for case-mix index change, in Medicare inpatient capital-related costs per case for the fiscal years 3 and 4 years before the fiscal year in question. For FY 1995, the increase is based on the increase in Medicare inpatient capital-related costs per case from FY 1990 through FY 1992. These are the most recent fiscal years for which cost report data are available. To determine the amount of the increase, we apportioned a hospital's costs and discharges to each fiscal year based on the number of months in the hospital's cost reporting period that occurred during the applicable fiscal year. Thus, an individual hospital may have more than one cost report included in the calculation. We are proposing that the FY 1995 update factor for the Federal rate be 2.22 percent. The following chart, based on the December 1993 update of HCRIS, shows how this figure was computed:
