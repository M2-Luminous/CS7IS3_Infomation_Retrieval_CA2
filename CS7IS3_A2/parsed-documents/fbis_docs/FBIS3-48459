The formalization of the revolutionary ideology of the respected and beloved great leader [suryong] by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il occupies the most important position in his ideological and theoretical achievements gained in developing and evolving the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary spirit. Scientifically formalizing the leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideology is of basic significance in advancing the revolution and construction as intended by the leader [suryong] and in consummating the working class' revolutionary cause. We can make the working class and popular masses cherish the immortal revolutionary banner to endlessly consummate the revolutionary cause only if we formalize the revolutionary ideology of the leader [suryong]. The cause of formalizing the leader's revolutionary ideology cannot be easily achieved by anyone because it is regarded as a lawful requirement in the developing revolution, but it can be achieved by the leader's [suryong] successor, who is endless loyal to the leader and who has a far-sighted extraordinary wisdom and a scientific insight. The historic cause to scientifically formalize the respected and beloved leader's revolutionary ideology was brilliantly carried out by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the genius of ideology and theory and great leader [yongdoja] of the chuche cause. The dear comrade leader scientifically formalized and announced the leader's revolutionary ideology by reflecting the warm aspiration and unanimous desire of the people, who want to comply with the indispensable requirement for our party and the developing revolution and the revolutionary ideology of the great leader [suryong] in combination with the esteemed name of the leader [suryong]. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly solved the question of comprehensively systematizing the principle of the chuche idea by energetically conducting the ideological and theoretical activities and he has taught: Based on his deep study of the basic principle and essential contents of the chuche idea, he has formalized our party's guiding ideology as a monolithic system of theory and method of chuche idea. As formalized by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the revolutionary ideology of the great leader is a system of the theory and method of the chuche idea. In other words, it is a monolithic system of the chuche idea, as well as the system of the revolution and construction based on embodiment of the idea. The scientific formalization of the great leader's revolutionary ideology by the dear comrade leader is a significant event in effecting an upturn in the development of our party and the revolution and in our people's ideological and spiritual lives. It is also a historic declaration that announced the respected and beloved leader's [suryong] revolutionary spirit as the highest stage of the development of the working class' revolutionary ideology. This, indeed, becomes an immortal achievement contributed to the development of ideology of mankind and to the consummation of the revolutionary cause of the working class. Thanks to the formalization of the revolutionary ideology of the respected and beloved leader by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, his revolutionary ideology has been a great guiding ideology for the revolution and construction in our times, the chuche era. As a result, its historic truth has been disclosed. One of the basic characteristics of the revolutionary spirit of the great leader [suryong] lies on the fact that it is a system of ideology and theory -- the essence of the great chuche idea -- which was founded for the first time in the ideological history of mankind. The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of the chuche idea -- indicates that all of its contents has been developed and systemized based on the theory and method of the chuche idea. The revolutionary ideology of the leading working class regards dialectical and historical materialism as a basis for the outlook of the world. The world consists of materials based on the revolutionary ideology of the leading working class. The world is based on a principle of dialectical materialism, which means that it is constantly being changed and developed by the material movement, as well as on a principle of historical materialism that applies to the history of society. The primitive philosophy of the working class greatly contributed to overcoming the mystery, subjectivity, and fatalism on the question of mankind's fate, but could not handle the question of mankind's fate because its direct mission is to reveal the essence of the objective world and the lawfulness of the development of its movement. The question of the fate of the working popular masses is raised profoundly for the first time by the chuche idea as a question of the outlook of the world. The chuche idea has solved all problems of the outlook of the world centering on mankind, the working popular masses, as well as an outlook of the world which its direct mission is to contribute to pioneer the fate of the working popular masses. The chuche idea has developed the essence of the world based on mankind. Also, it has expounded the lawfulness of the global change and development in combination with mankind. As a result, it has clearly presented ways to pioneer the fate of mankind, of the working popular masses. As stated, the chuche idea fully elucidates all problems of the outlook of the world centering on mankind and is the most scientific and revolutionary outlook of the world centering on mankind. The progressiveness and historic system of socialist ideology can be determined on how much it can correctly elucidate a way for the pioneer of the fate of the popular masses. The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of the chuche idea -- is one that elucidates most correctly the way for the pioneer of the working popular masses' fate. Because of this, it has entered the highest stage of development of the working class' revolutionary ideology. Therefore, it becomes a great guiding ideology for the revolution and construction in our times, the chuche era. Also, the basic characteristics of the great leader's revolutionary ideology lies in the fact that it has a completed compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche. Because the great leader's revolutionary ideology has the compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche, its historic position, as the highest peak of the development of the working class' revolutionary ideology, exists, thus giving a perfect solution to all theoretical and practical problems in the revolution and construction in the chuche era. The compositional system of Marxism includes philosophy, political economics, and scientific socialism. The historic mission of Marxism is to prepare the working class for the revolution and to improve the labor movement based on scientific foundation. To fully carry out this mission, therefore, Marxism had to abolish [tapa] religion, idealism, and metaphysics, but instead establish a materialistic and dialectical outlook of the world. Also, it had to scientifically disclose the secrecy of the exploitation by capitalism; had to explain the origination and the development of the capitalist economy and the lawfulness of the collapse of capitalism; and had to elucidate the inevitability of the victory of the socialist revolution. After then, Marxism consisted of three major systems of dialectical and historical materialism, and socialism of political economics and science. Marxism, which is a theory formulated at a time when the working class entered the stage of history waging a struggle against capitalism, greatly contributed to clearing up the exploiting class and system and achieving a class liberation for the popular masses. However, as the times change and history develops, Marxism also could not avoid historical limits. Unlike the previous revolutionary ideologies of the working class, the constituting systems of the great leader's revolutionary ideology are ideology, theory, and methods. The great leader's revolutionary ideology had the unique constituting systems because the great ideology is related with the sacred historic mission of the times and revolution. Our times consists of a new historical era--the chuche era--in which the working popular masses, who were once exploited and oppressed, emerge as the master of history, independently and creatively carving out their own destiny. Revolutionary implementation of our times demanded that the revolutionary ideology of the working class consist of guiding ideology which gives ideology, theory, and methods. For the working popular masses to independently and creatively carve out their destiny as the master of the world, they should be given chuche-based opinion and view of the world and the self-consciousness of their position and role, correctly be taught with the inevitability, strategy, and tactics of the birth and development of revolutionary struggle for independence, as well as the methods to accomplish their responsibility and role as the master of revolution and construction. Based on such a demand of our times, the chuche era, the great leader's revolutionary ideology was constituted with the systems of chuche ideology, chuche revolutionary theory, and chuche leadership methods. By constituting the three major systems of ideology, theory, and methods, the revolutionary ideology of the great leader gives the working popular masses a great view of the world, and a powerful ideological and mental weapon for them to independently and creatively carve out their own destiny as the master of the world. It not only thoroughly clears the way for the struggle to achieve the historic cause of national, class, and human liberation, and nature, society, human remodeling, and completely achieve independence, but also teaches the leadership methods for the popular masses to maintain their position and accomplish the role as the master of revolution and construction. The revolutionary ideology of the great leader has three major constituting systems of ideology, theory, and methods so that it gives perfect answers to all theoretical and implementation problems arising from the struggle for independence in our times. Here lies the historic value of the revolutionary ideology of the great leader as the leadership ideology, theory, and methods representing the chuche era. The revolutionary ideology of the great leader is formalized by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il so as to add luster to the revolutionary ideology of the great leader as a great leadership ideology of our times, the chuche era, and to give the working popular masses an immortal revolutionary banner to complete the socialist and communist cause. Following the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our people will complete to the end the socialist cause and chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by upholding the banner of the revolutionary ideology of the great leader.
