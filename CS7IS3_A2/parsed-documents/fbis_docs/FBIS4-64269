This outrage also -- and not without justification -- included a bit of injured pride. In this connection it was, however, strange that it was precisely those who were outraged who had actively participated in hammering one lump after the other out of the "defense budget quarry." The fact that less money means less Bundeswehr is simple arithmetic. No matter how you look at it: If the Bundeswehr continues to be the target of attacks, then one day Theo Waigel -- like his Austrian colleague Karl Ludwig von Bruck in the past -- will have to cry out: "May God maintain the Army; I, the finance minister, cannot do so anymore." What else can Volker Ruehe consider aside from cuts in the size of the Bundeswehr? Of course, he was right that a smaller and effective Bundeswehr has more political weight than a large and militarily inferior one. Helmut Kohl should think along similar lines, because, according to the constitution, he has a special position vis a vis the armed forces: In case of emergency he becomes the commander in chief, that is, in the event for which our state is, after all, maintaining the Bundeswehr. Even the conceivable use of crisis reaction forces can -- not in terms of constitutional law but in terms of constitutional policy -- bring him closer to this burden. Other things are no less important: Sooner or later NATO will realize again how essential it is for safeguarding peace in Europe to return to a policy of balance. We then have to be able to put a Bundeswehr on this political scale, which constitutes a weight that must be taken seriously. Therefore, Kohl would have to be the last person to agree to a further disassembly of the Bundeswehr. After all, he cannot be interested in commanding a ridiculous army in an emergency. In the current controversy in Bonn it is constantly said that the Bundeswehr must not be made the playing ball in the party quarrel. However, it has long since become that, the most recent instance being the parties' race to the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. As long as we have an army of conscripts, it will always be an issue in the quarrel among the parties. If one accepts the former, one should not complain about the latter. After all, during the years of its development, the Bundeswehr had to weather quite different political storms than it does today. However, at that time, it had a clear course outlined. Today, on the other hand, some political statements look as if some kind of vivisection of the Bundeswehr were intended. All too easily it is forgotten that the armed forces are a living organism. It comprises not only soldiers, officials, and employees, but also their families. They all cannot be used for arbitrary experiments without weakening the Army's combat strength. Today there are various movements that affect the Bundeswehr. One says their reduction to 340,000 men or fewer is bad for foreign policy. The history of the Bundeswehr says something different: Franz Josef Strauss reduced the deployment sites of the Bundeswehr far more dramatically than Ruehe intends to do now. He convinced NATO that effective units are more important than militarily inferior ones. German foreign policy was not harmed by that. A second movement claims that Ruehe's plans are too vague. Yes, they lack the basis of solid staff work. The planners must do additional work if they want to be convincing. However, the critics are not thinking of that. With justification, in the super election year they fear a discussion about which other garrisons must be closed down. This is, indeed, Ruehe's toad -- which these politicians do not want to swallow. Even those forces that would prefer to reduce the Bundeswehr to zero are complaining about that. No quarrel about garrisons just now! A third group thinks that Ruehe's proposal does not go far enough. They want to reduce the armed forces to 300,000 men. Who is right could be decided only if a detailed balance sheet of the situation of the Bundeswehr were available. However, this has always been lacking. Therefore, all figures are just rough estimates. Even though the accusation that the official security policy is conceptually dubious is correct, none of the three groups of critics offers a convincing alternative. Helmut Kohl's decision to establish a committee now, which -- without time limit -- is to clarify the Bundeswehr's future, is a politically understandable delaying tactic to avoid problems in the coalition and to get through the election year. Regarding the matter itself, however, this solution is dangerous. So far, it has been the task of the military to present to the minister a very detailed concept, which is arrived at in solid staff work. This staff work was based on orders from above and was thus permeated by a unified will. Things are different in the planned committee. It is unavoidable that all those differences that are now already shaking up the field of security policy will clash in it. Then one will probably settle for the lowest common denominator of agreement. This solution corresponds to the general trend in Bonn to involve as many politicians as possible in the military decisionmaking processes. How this is supposed to work in an emergency remains an open question. One can democratize decisionmaking processes until they are ineffective, even if Ruehe may then have done everything to make the Bundeswehr fit. Its efficiency can be negated at any time via decisionmaking. It is time to think about this seriously. It is to be regretted that a high-level discussion about the future form of military service did not take place in the Bundestag. Even when President Richard von Weizsaecker suggested thinking about the idea of a "general service duty," the political echo was just an embarrassed silence. What Volker Ruehe is now envisaging -- half compulsory military service, half army of volunteers -- is certainly acceptable as an interim solution. However, it will not be a lasting solution. Bonn will not be spared the pain of choosing between an army of conscripts or an army of volunteers. Hopefully, both models will be calculated in the Defense Ministry in such a serious way that the respective costs can be presented to the public at any time. The potential support of one or the other model with general service duty should also be included.
