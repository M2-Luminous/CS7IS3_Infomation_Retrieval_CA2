As a matter of fact, in what way is East Europe different from West Europe? Back in 1945 it ended up in the Soviet zone of influence, deprived of an opportunity for normal development, but an event which had fatal consequences for the East Europeans occurred even earlier, in August 1939. It was the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with all its secret protocols, which divided this part of Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany. This is why two Europes exist. As far as the West Europeans are concerned, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is just a vague memory of the dark past. For the East Europeans, this division of the continent was a reality. East Europe can be defined as the group of countries which became the objects of trade between Moscow and Berlin in 1939. A reduction to the role of historical object leaves deep scars, Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz remarked, and calls for caution toward the two large neighbors -- Russia and Germany. Decades of pain and humiliation -- this is what distinguishes the East European countries from those in West Europe. All the arguments cited by Moscow, Washington, or Paris against East Europe's inclusion in NATO are sensible and rational: "It is not worth investing large sums of money to reequip and retrain the East European armies to NATO standards. The East Europeans themselves would find it more useful to aim for membership of the European Union and worry more about the economy than the army. And the main point is this: There is no need to antagonize the Russians, many of whom still consider NATO to be their enemy...." To put it briefly, a great power enjoys some advantages in geopolitics -- people try not to insult it unnecessarily. But the perfidious scar of Europe's prewar division has not disappeared off the face of the continent. Another question: Is it worth the Lithuanians or the Poles exploiting this tragic past and exciting anti-Russian feelings in the West now, when there are no grounds for it? It is, however, obvious that the inbred fear of a fresh division will govern the policy of the present and future generations of East Europeans. Historical guilt is a metaphysical term which is rejected by many people. But it is, nonetheless, not worth while expressing enthusiasm because of NATO's decision and gloating over other people's humiliation.
