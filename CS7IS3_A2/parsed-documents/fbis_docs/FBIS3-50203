The agreement was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kocarnik (chairman of the tripartite), Vaclav Vanek, deputy chairman of the Czech and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), Jan Fencl, representative of employers, and Antonin Foldyna, chairman of the Confederation of Arts and Culture. Kocarnik called the General Agreement balanced and a good basis for further work of the tripartite. He said that it slightly differed from that signed for last year which was caused by a certain shift of the tripartite towards general activities. The essential aims of the agreement remained preserved, Kocarnik stated. The agreement aims at preserving social peace in the period of transition from the central-command economy to a market system. Vanek said that no agreement can substitute for the will to observe it. He noted that the current general agreement was the fourth signed since the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in late 1989. Fencl said the signing of the agreement sealed the fact that all the three partners would stay behind the negotiating table in 1994 and would jointly search for settling problems in the economic and social spheres. The signing was preceded by a series of talks. The Thursday talks resolved the last disputed point which concerned the extension of the collective agreements of higher degree. It was established that these agreements would be discussed by the tripartite commission to which the trade unions and employees would be able to turn. All the three parties to the general agreement confirmed that the employers' possible disagreement with the extension of the agreement would not be sufficient to prevent it from being extended.
