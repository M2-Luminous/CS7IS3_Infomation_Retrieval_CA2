Defence ministers Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy met privately before the two delegations went into a full-scale session. Experts on both sides meeting later in the day on Thursday had failed to reach agreement on the location of the headquarters of Russian and Ukrainian parts of the Fleet, one negotiator told INTERFAX on condition of anonymity. Ukraine wants to hold back to Sevastopol as its naval stronghold or share it together with Moscow. The source believes that a sharing out of the Fleet is the only issue the two sides are most likely to resolve. He said Kiev might settle down for 18 pct of the BSF with the remainder going to Russia. Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk meeting in Moscow a week ago had agreed that Ukraine's share of the Fleet would run at 15-20 pct. Moscow has remitted more than 250 billion karbovantsy for the upkeep of the Fleet this week though the April bill runs at 257 billion, member of the Russian military delegation Vasiliy Vorobyev told INTERFAX. He said Kiev had stopped BSF financing since the end of last year.
