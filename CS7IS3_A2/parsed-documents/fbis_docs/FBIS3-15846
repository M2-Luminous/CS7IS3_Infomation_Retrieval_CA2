Defense Ministry Threatens Loss of `Control Over the Armed Forces'"] [Text] The Armed Forces' chiefs believe that the 1994 budget proposed by the government will bring about a catastrophe unless defense expenditures are approved according to the existing official draft. At a recent (not expanded and closed-door) government meeting, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said "at the request of the defense minister and the ministry's collegium" that "neither the country's defense capability nor the maintenance of the defense industry will be possible at this level of financing. Clearly, the trend is toward the loss of control over the Armed Forces." In 1993, the defense budget was 7.1. trillion rubles [R] (taking into account repeated indexations), but actual military expenditures were greater, so by year's end the Defense Ministry owed suppliers and its own staffers R2.2 trillion. Defense Ministry representatives think that if the current inflation rate (around 1,000 percent a year) holds on, at least R80 trillion will have to be spent on the maintenance of the Armed Forces. The new budget earmarks R37.1 trillion rubles for defense, which accounts for approximately 20 percent of the budget expenditures. Andrey Kokoshin claims that this amounts to a more than two-fold decrease in actual expenditures. In 1992, when market reform began, the government slashed its defense orders by 67 percent. At the time, the government assured the Defense Ministry, however, that there would be no new drastic cuts, and that the level of defense appropriations would remain unchanged until 1995. Now the plans for military reform, personnel and arms procurement cuts that were drawn up in view of a certain amount of financing are in jeopardy. Government orders for arms procurements in 1994 have already been approved, but Defense Ministry specialists estimate that its implementation will cost R28.3 trillion, whereas the draft budget calls for only R5.5 trillion. The Defense Ministry is drawing up an official letter to the government demanding that: first, that the cessation of armaments production in Russia be openly declared; second, that the 1994 government defense orders be canceled; and third, that contracts with enterprises for the supply of weapons be abrogated. Andrey Kokoshin believes that the implementation of the draft budget will result in the closure of over 3,000 military-industrial enterprises; as a consequence, around 4 million people will be out of work, 15 million of their family members will be left without a living, and many Russian "defense" cities will turn into social disaster areas. Moreover, the army will have to fully stop signing up soldiers under contracts, and also urgently to discharge from service 400,000 servicemen (over 20 percent of the entire strength). Half of them are officers and warrant officers, who will have to be discharged without legitimate service benefits and accommodation. The struggle for the budget continues, and each department, according to an old Soviet tradition, is trying to grab as much as it can. The Defense Ministry is currently losing to more influential sectoral lobbyists. But the Armed Forces have yet another, last argument in store. SEGODNYA has learned that the president has written on General Grachev's letter stating the army's budget arguments: "I share the defense minister's concern. I ask you to weigh everything one more time. A solution should be sought without detriment to Russia's defense capability."
