The Assembly convened yesterday evening under the chairmanship of Vefa Tanir and discussed the recommendation regarding the extension of the state of emergency in force in Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and Van. Expressing the views of the government regarding the recommendation, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said that the state has the right to legally defend itself against those that want to attain political gains by means of terrorism. Mentese further explained that the state is waging this struggle within the framework of international rules. Stressing that the terrorist organization is perpetrating ruthless actions in the country causing great sorrow to the nation, Mentese remarked: Should not everyone be reacting to these actions? All the parties, especially those that take advantage of the legal system to hide behind these laws, should react to these actions. The leader of the party that receives money from the budget will probably make fun of this situation [as heard]. Our reaction to these actions -- inhuman actions -- is to rise against them together and show the necessary rage. Mentese also indicated that the terrorist organization is trying to put the pressure on the candidates and the people with the approaching regional elections. Explaining that every measure possible has been taken in order to avoid this pressure, Mentese said that the terrorist organization is showing great fear due to the extension of the state of emergency at this period when the national conciliation is at its peak. Noting that intensive efforts are conducted to eradicate the issue of terrorism from the country's agenda, Mentese stressed that they are determined and decided on their struggle. Mentese said that the state of emergency should be extended once more -- within the unity and political will displayed at the TGNA -- in order to properly fight terrorism and thus establish public security, protection of human rights, and respect of the law. Following Mentese's statement, discussions on the government recommendation began. Oral Gullu, Usak deputy of the Social Democrat Populist Party [SDPP], expressing his party's views, stated that nobody has the power to divide the Turkish Republic. ANAP [Motherland Party] whip Hasan Korkmazcan, stated that they agree with the reasoning of the government regarding the recommendation but that they are against this issue being exploited politically by the goverment. Prosperity Party Bitlis Deputy Zeki Ergeten stated the government is not taking any measures to prevent terrorism adding that Western countries are behind the terrorist actions. Murat Karayalcin, SDPP leader, state minister and deputy prime minister, stated that terrorism which started in 1984 has been institutionalized by politicians who underestimated it as the work of three to five bandits. Explaining that the statement he issued a couple of days ago was erroneously interpreted by the press, Karayalcin reiterated that he has never used the word coup and that he has never linked anything to the chief of the General Staff or other military forces commanders. Karayalcin pointed out that he interprets some of the recent incidents as the ploys of those that want to obstruct democracy. Ismail Kosebe, True Path Party [TPP] Erzurum deputy, expressing his party's views, said that significant developments were achieved as a result of the government's determination and that the brains behind the PKK have been destroyed. The TPP deputy also stressed that 1994 will be the end of terrorism. Answering criticisms and views on behalf of the government, Mentese said that the military forces, the gendarmerie, and the security forces serving in the state of emergency region are working in coordination adding that they are inflicting great losses to the separatist organization. Indicating that the government is decided on eradicating this issue from its roots, Mentese added there is a significant decrease in the number of bandits as a result of the government's determination and the success of the security forces. Noting that tranquility has been established in the southeast Anatolia cities, Mentese announced that the bandits will be wiped out in extensive operations which will be conducted in the coming days. On the lifting of the immunities of the deputies who support the PKK, Mentese said that the Assembly will fulfill its historical responsibility on this issue. [passage omitted] Following the discussions, voting took place and subsequently the recommendation submitted by the Prime Minister's office was approved.
