This is a despicable attempt to frustrate the DPRK-USA talks aimed at a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and a heinous challenge to the North. When he said ``the United States would make no concessions,'' he probably took into consideration the ``definite answer'' of the United States on the maintenance of an ``international cooperation system'' which he got during his U.S. trip in November in return for rice market opening. No one but flunkeyist traitors could do that. The traitor Kim again raised the questions of ``inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency'' and ``North-South dialogue,'' making quite a noise as if they were ``preconditions'' for third round DPRK-USA talks. In the final analysis, this was also a sinister attempt to drop the checkbar on the way of DPRK-USA talks. It is the biggest tragedy for the traitor Kim that he does not know that frustrating the DPRK-USA talks means, in the long run, cutting his own throat. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must know this clearly and refrain from such mean acts as imprudently poking his nose into others' business.
