He vowed that acting on advice of the General Staff he will veto the 1995 Budget Law if it does not allocate more funds for the Defence Ministry. Earlier in the day, the president who is also the superior of the armed forces attended a ceremony of promoting the graduates of Wroclaw's Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers' College to the rank of second lieutenant. The promotion was carried out by chief of the army's General Staff General Tadeusz Wilecki. Congratulating the newly-promoted 241 graduates, Walesa said the homeland will never dissapoint them and added he will do his best to improve the army's bad financial situation, claiming that one mustn't "economize on the army." Asked by journalists about the forthcoming visit of the U.S. President to Poland, Walesa vowed to tell Bill Clinton that Poland wants to rapidly and strongly integrate economically and militarily with Europe. He said he will stress that it is in the the United States's interest that Europe is included within one security system. Walesa touched upon the 1995 presidential elections and told newsmen that he will conduct his next presidential campaign in a way that is different from what journalists and politicians "imagine and contrive." The president stated he wants to be re-elected because he has not completed his work and built democracy in Poland. The promotion ceremonies were also held in Poznan, Deblin, Koszalin, Jelenia Gora, Zegrze and Torun, with the presidential chancellery ministers attending. Also on Saturday, head of the National Security Bureau Henryk Goryszewski handed a banner to the elite airborne troops of the Krakow military district. Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk attended the ceremony. A similar event was held in Bydgoszcz where a banner was given to an air defence unit by secretary of state at the presidential chancellery, minister Mieczyslaw Wachowski. A mass was later said by the Polish Army's Field Bishop Leszek Slawoj Glodz.
