Section 3833.0&hyph;3 is amended by revising the first sentence of paragraph (a), revising paragraphs (e) and (f), and adding new paragraphs (g) and (h) to read as follows: §3833.0&hyph;3 Authority. (a) Sections 314(a) and (b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1744) require the recordation of unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, and the filing of information concerning annual assessment work performed or a notice of intention to hold mining claims in the proper BLM office within specified time periods.*␣*␣* * * * * * (e) The Act of October 5, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381, 106 Stat. 1374, 1378&hyph;79), and sections 10101&hyph;10106 of the Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312), require an annual rental or maintenance fee of $100 to be paid to the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-exempt mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site located or held under section 314(b) of FLPMA for the assessment years beginning on September 1, 1992, and ending on September 1, 1998. With certain exceptions provided in §3833.1&hyph;6, this fee is in lieu of the requirement to perform and record annual assessment work under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and section 314(a)(1) of FLPMA. Failure to pay the fee within the time limits prescribed by the Acts of October 5, 1992, and August 10, 1993, constitutes a statutory abandonment and forfeiture of the non-exempt mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. Provisions relating to rental and maintenance fees and exemptions are contained in §§3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7. (f) Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242) requires oil shale claim holders to pay an annual fee of $550 per oil shale claim, notwithstanding any other provision of law, including the Act of October 5, 1992. In addition, the Act of August 10, 1993, specifically states that the maintenance fee provision shall not apply to any oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid under section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The $550 fee requirement for oil shale claims remains in effect. The $550 fee is first payable on or before December 31, 1993, and each December 31st thereafter. (g) The Stockraising Homestead Act of December 29, 1916 (SRHA) (43 U.S.C. 299), as amended by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60), provides that no person other than the surface owner may locate a mining claim on SRHA lands after October 13, 1993, until a notice of intent to locate has been filed with the proper BLM State office and the surface owner is notified of the filing.
