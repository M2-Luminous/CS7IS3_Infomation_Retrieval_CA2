They say the process may take several months to implement despite the resolution's demand for an immediate release of Lefortovo prison inmates. One source said the main problem was how to enforce the resolution in a legal way. Nor is clear how the Duma's constitutional prerogative of declaring amnesties will be interpreted, he said. The source says that the amnesty covers those convicted but not those under investigation or trial which gives a wide room for legal interpretation of the Duma resolution. Even if experts arrive at a conclusion that the prisoners must be set free immediately, there is always a chance of delaying the resolution indefinitely for various reasons such as failure to return a book borrowed from the prison library, he said.
