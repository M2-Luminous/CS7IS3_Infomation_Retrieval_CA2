After Ukraine signs in Brussels a document about joining the NATO programme, it intends "to put its possibilities into practice as soon as possible", he noted. Answering questions from journalists, Radetskyy flatly dismissed assertions about increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. "Quite the contrary, now we are solving the problems which have long complicated relations between Kiev and Moscow, at least military technical aspects of these problems", the minister stressed. When asked about the Crimean leaders' aspirations for a greater autonomy, Radetskyy assessed the current situation on the peninsula as "a normal and sound process". "The Crimea is part of Ukraine, therefore one can speak only about an autonomy stipulated by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and subordinate to them... This issue should not give rise to any problems or illusions", the minister emphasised. Radetskyy also told reporters that during the talks with Jeszenszky, the two ministers came to the conclusion that "all existing problems should be solved by means of a calm and well-considered dialogue". The Ukrainian defence minister believes that all problems are eventually rooted in economic conditions. It is the economy that determines a country's policy, inter-state relations and public order on the whole, Radetskyy noted.
