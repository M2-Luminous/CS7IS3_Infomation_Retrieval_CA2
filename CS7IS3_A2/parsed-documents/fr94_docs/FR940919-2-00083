FR940919-2-00083 FR940919-2-00046 The high workload level is expected to continue and will adversely affect SSA's ability to timely process initial disability claims and appeals. Recent management initiatives to improve service through resource reallocations and productivity enhancements have not been sufficient to deal successfully with the workload demands and it is expected that disability processing times and backlogs will continue to grow under the present process. In FY 1995, it is estimated that 2.9 million initial disability claims will be forwarded to DDSs for disability determinations_a 69 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. Similarly, in FY 1995, annual requests for administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings will rise to 542,000, a 75 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. The average time to process an initial disability claim (the combined average for both DI and SSI claims) is expected to rise to 154 days in FY 1995; the average time from ALJ hearing request to decision is expected to rise to 342 days in the same period. Demographic Trends American society has changed dramatically since the DI program began in the 1950s. This is reflected in an increased demand for SSA's services, changes in the characteristics of claimants seeking benefits, and new complexities in claim-related workloads and processes. The demographic character of the SSA disability claimant population has changed as well. The enactment of the SSI program in the 1970's added individuals who have limited or no work histories, increased the number of individuals filing based on disabilities such as mental impairments, and provided for eligibility of disabled children. Additionally, the requirements of the SSI program added complex and time consuming development of non-disability eligibility factors such as income, resources and living arrangements. The 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Sullivan v. Zebley, resulted in increased claims for children; children comprised 21 percent of all SSI claims in 1992, up from 11 percent in 1988. Homeless individuals and others with special needs have strained the delivery system. These claimants require significant intervention and assistance to navigate the disability claim process. A trend in the general population which is reflected in SSA's disability claimant population is the increased number of people in the United States for whom English is not the native language. Recent national Census data indicate that 1 in 7 people speak a language other than English in the home; this is an increase of almost 38 percent in the last 10 years. SSA will need to accommodate the special communication needs of these claimants in its ongoing claimant contacts and in public information vehicles.
