On 10 April, citizens will elect 305 members of a Constituent Assembly that will be responsible for reforming the Constitution. Numerous radio and television surveys indicate that a good percentage of Argentine citizens are not aware of what is involved in the reform except that it will permit President Carlos Menem to run for reelection. Other surveys indicate that more than 25 percent of eligible voters will not vote despite the fact that voting is compulsory, or they will submit blank votes, as during the 3 October 1993 legislative election. Yesterday, former President Raul Alfonsin, candidate for the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in Buenos Aires Province, asked people to vote for his party "to make sure that the Constitution will be a guarantee of justice and security for all." Carlos Menem, in turn, presided over a ceremony in Santiago del Estero during which he called on citizens to vote for the party of their liking and not submit blank votes, as blank votes "are of no use." The progress made by the center-left coalition Grand Front (FG) in the Argentine capital, where surveys place it behind the ruling Justicialist Party (Peronist) and ahead of the UCR, has been the significant event of the two weeks leading up to the election. The FG is headed by Deputy Carlos Alvarez, a dissident Peronist who has occupied the most important sections in local newspapers over the last few months because according to observers, he is the Argentine leader who understands best that political campaigns must be carried out in the communications media. Over the past few days, Menem and Alfonsin have defended the agreement the two leaders signed at the end of 1993 to have a project for reforming the Constitution approved by Congress. Their remarks were aimed at accusations made by other parties' candidates that "the pact" was signed behind the people's back. The Peronists and Radicals association opened a deep breach between them and the other political groups which are also fighting for votes. Jesus Rodriguez, who is in first place on the UCR ticket for the capital, said "people know the UCR alone can control Menem's growing power," and called on citizens "to concentrate votes for the opposition." Fernando "Pino" Solanas, Argentine actor and candidate for the FG, proposed the election of Neuquen's emeritus bishop, Monsignor Jaime de Nevares, as Constituent Assembly president. De Nevares left his provincial diocese when he turned 75, at the beginning of the year. He will be the main speaker today at the FG campaign closing act in a Buenos Aires theater. The prelate was one of the few leaders who maintained a critical position against the political repression unleashed by the military regime (1976-83). He has also criticized the market economy system Menem adopted ever since he came to power in 1989.
