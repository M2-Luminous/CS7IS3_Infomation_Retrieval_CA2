FBIS4-4323 "dreas062_j_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 Indonesia * Non-Performing Loans To Be Investigated * Non-Performing Loans To Be Investigated 94SE0091A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in Indonesian 9 Feb 94 p 1 94SE0091A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA Indonesian CSO [Text] The DPR [Parliament] will continue to `go after' 49 companies which have non-performing loans at BUMN [State-Owned Enterprises] Banks; at the same time, the BKPM [Capital Investment Coordinating Board] considers that the construction of the integrated chemical industry project owned by the Golden Key Group is not yet in the non-performing category. "At the present time, there is only one client who is known to have a non-performing loan and the other 49 don't. We will continue to pursue them at not just one bank but at all the banks involved," said Yahya Nasution, deputy chairman of the DPR's Commission VII, when he and A.A. Baramuli (a member of the DPR's Commission VII) spoke to the press yesterday. Yahya said that the case is being pursued because it had been uncovered by Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and the governor of the Bank of Indonesia. "Considering that the non-performing loan was granted by a bank syndicate with Bapindo [Indonesian Development Bank] as the lead arranger, that is the bank that we will question first." "From Bapindo's response to Commission VII on Wednesday we will find out whether it will be necessary to invite in other state banks," said Yahya. At the same time, Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, state minister for investment (Meninves) and chairman of the Investment Board, stated that the construction of the integrated chemical industry project owned by Eddy Tansil in Cilegon--which has been mentioned as a cause of non-performing loans--cannot be categorized as non-performing yet because it has not yet gone past its deadline. "We are continuing to evaluate the three companies. If there is a good reason for the arrears, we will give them additional time," he told the press on 8 February after a working meeting with the DPR's Commission VI. The BKPM, Sanyoto said, is still giving Graha Swakarsa Prima (GSP) Inc, Hamparan Rejeki (RP) Inc, and Pusaka Warna Polypropilen (PWP) Inc--the three subsidiaries of the Golden Key Group supporting the integrated chemical industry--the opportunity to continue constructing the plant. The license granted to the three projects is still in the form of a Permanent Approval Certificate (SPT), but the BKPM has still not granted them a Permanent License Certificate (SIT). "The BPKM will not grant an SIT until the three companies have had a trial run. However, it seems that the three companies have not had a trial run yet," he said in response to a question from Tadjuddin Nur Said, a member of the DPR's Commission VI, concerning the integrated petrochemical industry which is reported to have 1.3 trillion rupiahs in non-performing loans with BAPINDO. Sanyoto said that an SPT was granted to GSP Inc on 5 June 1989 and renewed on 24 May 1991 with an investment of 228 billion rupiahs, which included the importation of engines worth $96 million. Every year this company produces 120,000 tons of styrene monomer, 50,000 tons of polystyrene, 15,000 tons of acrylonitrile butadene and 10,000 tons of styrene acrylonitrile. Sanyoto said that GSP Inc had authorized capital of 200 billion rupiahs, subscribed capital of 60 billion rupiahs and paid-in capital of 60 billion rupiahs. The BPKM approved the PTHR [expansion unknown] as a PMDN [Domestic Capital Investment] on 28 November 1988 to be constructed with at least 214 billion rupiahs in capital, including the importation of $96 million worth of engines. The source of funding included 60 billion rupiahs of its own capital, 154 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital, 200 billion rupiahs of authorized capital, 60 billion rupiahs of subscribed capital and 60 billion rupiahs of paid-in capital. This company plans to produce 40,000 tons of acrylic fibers per year. PWP Inc was founded with a capital of 269 billion rupiahs consisting of 169 billion rupiahs of borrowed capital and 100 billion rupiahs of its own capital. The company will produce 140,000 tons of polypropylene. According to Baramuli, the problem of non-performing loans, which were uncovered right from the start, was reported to the chairman of the DPR's FKP [Functional Development Faction]; the head of the FKP had never prohibited the problem from being revealed, but his faction would go along if they were forbidden to speak up. Baramuli admitted that he had received support from the businessman Probosutedjo. In fact, he continued, Probosutedjo mentioned a figure of one trillion rupiahs in non-performing loans, beyond the 1.3 trillion rupiahs, but Baramuli did not want to reveal this to the press. A. Sutomo, junior attorney general for special criminal matters (JAM PIDSUS), said that his agency had tried to take anticipatory steps about the 1.3 trillion rupiahs in non-performing loans from Bapindo. "But the Attorney General's Office is committed to respecting the bank secrecy mandated by law," he said at breaks in his speech to legal-affairs reporters here yesterday. Penetrating bank secrecy, he said, cannot be done until the Attorney General's Office is sure that a criminal act has been committed and is sure who the suspected perpetrator is. This means that bank secrecy cannot be penetrated until the Attorney General's Office is already at the investigatory stage. Sutomo said that his people are limited right now to collecting data and information from various parties about cases of non-performing loans taken out by Eddy Tansil. According to banking-law expert Rasjim Wiraatmadja, based on the provisions of banking law Number 7 of 1992, collateral for loans does not have to be in material form; it can be based on the banker's convictions about the debtor. If a banker is convinced that the credit granted can be paid back and if he knows the debtor very well, according to the provisions of the law the credit is justified. "Under Law Number 14 of 1967, in fact, there always had to be some material collateral in order to grant credit. But under Law Number 7 of 1992 that provision was eliminated so that collateral can be based on the banker's convictions about the projected being funded," he told BISNIS here yesterday. Even though bankers can grant credit on the basis of their convictions, material collateral is still required because in the February regulation package (PAKFEB) of 1991 there is a provision about obligatory reserves which was renewed in the May regulation package of 1993. In legal terms, said Rasjim, Law Number 14 of 1967, which required material collateral, is no longer valid since it was superseded by a later law. Now one must refer to Law Number 7 of 1992. "In the May regulation package banks are obliged to set aside a reserve of 0.5 percent for current loans and 100 percent for non-performing loans. To meet these provisions, material collateral which can easily be turned into cash is really necessary." Subagjo Joyosumarto, head of the Bank of Indonesia's Banking Development Bureau, said that the way to solve the non-performing loan problem is to write the loans which are not non-performing off the books. "Another way is for the government to order the banks to carry out mergers, consolidations and acquisitions," he told the annual meeting of members of the Perbanas [Private National Banks] Auditors Club (ACP) here yesterday.
