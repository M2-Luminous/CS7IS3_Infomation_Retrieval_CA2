Secretary Li Changchun stated in his speech at yesterday's closing session: The ongoing anticorruption struggle is an important strategic measure aimed at consolidating and enhancing ties between the CPC and the masses in the new situation, bolstering the CPC's ruling-party position, and enabling the CPC to more successfully undertake the important historical mission of guiding reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. The ongoing anticorruption struggle is at once the most effective way to mobilize more than one billion Chinese people to participate in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive with burning enthusiasm and the prerequisite of reform, development, and stability. Secretary Li Changchun noted: In the next stage of the anticorruption struggle, we will make continued efforts to attain the three anticorruption goals put forward by the central authorities, will conscientiously investigate and tackle local and departmental problems, will implement to the letter the five regulations on ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among party and government cadres at the county or provincial department section level, as mapped out in 1993 by the central authorities, will conscientiously carry out the five new regulations promulgated this year by the central authorities of ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among party and government cadres at the county or provincial department section level, will make redoubled efforts to build an anticorruption system on the basis of self-examination and self-rectification among party and government cadres, and will expedite the pace of investigating and handling major and serious cases, especially those exposed this year. Secretary Li Changchun maintained: The party committees and governments at all levels throughout the province should strengthen leadership over the investigations into and the handling of each and every major and serious case, should resolutely punish corrupt elements irrespective of their rank or position, and should make continued and redoubled efforts to straighten out professional malpractices and resolutely wipe out unreasonable and indiscriminate charges. Secretary Li Changchun emphatically noted: To successfully further the ongoing anticorruption struggle, it is imperative to combat corruption by looking into both the root causes and symptoms of corrupt phenomena, fundamentally remove the soil that breeds corruption, and work hard to build a restriction and supervision mechanism capable of combating corruption and ensuring a clean government. To this end, it is imperative to strengthen education and guidance in this regard and step up legal system building, thereby making it possible for people from all walks of life in the society to supervise party and government cadres. Secretary Li Changchun asserted: The fundamental difference between the CPC and other political parties lies in the fact that the CPC has all along maintained close ties with the broad masses of the people, this being one of the CPC's fine traditions and styles. Carrying forward such a fine tradition and fine style still has great significance in the new situation of socialist market economic structural building. As long as we continue to maintain close ties with the masses and resolutely eradicate corrupt phenomena, the CPC and the broad masses of cadres and people will be able to forge ahead with one heart and one mind and maintain long-term political stability. Secretary Li Changchun stressed: The on-going anticorruption struggle is an important political task for the entire party. Party committees and governments at all levels in the province should attach utmost importance to, should earnestly strengthen leadership over, and should protractedly further the struggle in accordance with a series of principles and policies mapped out by the central authorities. The principal party and government leaders should take personal charge of and assume overall responsibility for the ongoing anticorruption struggle and should also study, coordinate, arrange for, and press ahead with the on-going anticorruption struggle in a timely fashion. Yesterday's closing session was attended by a number of provincial party, government, and military leaders, including Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Lin Yinghai, Wu Guangxian [provincial military district political commissar], Zheng Zengmao [provincial higher people's court president], Song Guochen, Zhang Deguang, Zhang Wenbin, Liu Yujie.
