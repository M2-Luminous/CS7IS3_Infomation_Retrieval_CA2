The reference by Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh to a technical mistake is curious from the point of view of international relations and only indicates of various understanding of political tactics by various Russian leaders, said faction head Maris Grinblats. It's not enough to consider that Russia has given up its aggressive plans. Grinblats characterized the anticipated signature of the agreement on the Skrunda radar functioning and the status of military retirees in Latvia as a "political suicide."
