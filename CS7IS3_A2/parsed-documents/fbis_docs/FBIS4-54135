He said the Patriots were brought here by the United States for its own deterrence purposes as to send the message to Pyongyang that the South's defenses are strong in a speech at the Press Center sponsored by the Parliamentarians' Society of Korea. He also brushed aside reports that the United States was exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula, saying Washington was neither cooking nor imagining threat from North Korea. He cited reports by the safeguards team of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), now in Pyongyang for additional nuclear inspections, that no spent fuel has been diverted since 1989 based on camera surveillance. "This means there was no diversion since 1989," he said. Laney, however, quoted U.S. intelligence which states that diversion might have occurred during the discharge of fuel rods in 1989. He said the U.N. nuclear watchdog is now working to clarify the history of the process before 1989 by taking samples. Laney reiterated that North Korea must satisfy not only South Korea and the United States, but the whole world that it is not pursuing a nuclear program. "With this assurance (that Pyongyang has given up its nuclear ambitions), we will be prepared, in full consultation with South Korea, to begin the process of normalizing both diplomatic and economic ties with North Korea," he said. "North Korea must open up to the point for their interests, not for U.S. interests," he said. To reduce tension, he said, "they (North Koreans) have to make a move." "We (the United States) have our doors open...It is not us isolating North Korea. North Korea has isolated itself," he said.
