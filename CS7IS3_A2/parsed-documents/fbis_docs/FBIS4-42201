The Foreign Office described the decision as "a gold letter day for the Commonwealth and for South Africa." The Queen sent a message of congratulation to South African President Nelson Mandela immediately the announcement was made, and John Major sent best wishes from the Government. South Africa's official return to the 50-nation community was announced in London by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku, who told a news conference: "It is with a special sense of joy that I announce that South Africa will from tomorrow return to full Commonwealth membership after a break of 33 years." Mr Mandela said immediately after South Africa's recent general election that he would be seeking the country's re-admittance to the Commonwealth, which it quit in 1961 amid international criticism of apartheid. The Foreign Office said it was hoped that South African athletes would take part in the Commonwealth Games in Canada in August, and that it looked forward to its contribution within the organisation.
