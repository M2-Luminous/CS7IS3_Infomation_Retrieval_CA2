These forces had earlier participated in the 30-state aggression against Iraq and attacked our trucks and oil tankers, burning them and killing their occupants--our sons--while driving along the road in Jordan. Allowing the U.S. forces of aggression to pursue training on fighting us or resting and recreating in Jordan requires all the national forces and their representatives in the House of Representatives to firmly prevent this provocation and stop these exercises, which are due to last one month.
