You have called the Brussels membership agreement the most important treaty that Sweden has concluded in this century. Why? [Bildt] With the accession of Sweden and Finland the EU will adopt a northern European dimension. It would become even larger and more fleshed out if Norway were to join the EU as the fourth north European country. However, with Sweden and Finland the EU will acquire a strong northern part, which will also provide it with new strengths. In any case, Sweden will make its contribution to that, as soon as the people have approved accession, as I confidently expect they will do. Of course, Sweden will fulfill the Maastricht Treaty and support the entire construct as a full partner. We will also participate in the common foreign and security policy without any reservations or deductions. Similar to Finland, my country has a special regional importance for northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area, which means also for the relationship with the three Baltic states and with Russia. Here a new situation will develop for Europe. [Ruehl] Some people fear or expect that the expansion of the EU might loosen it and will, perhaps, even dissolve the political consolidation and the economic ties again. What are the Swedish interests? Will Swedish foreign policy move away from traditional neutrality to such an extent, as you have always indicated, that Sweden can act as a full, active security partner also in the case of crises? [Bildt] I do not share such fears about a loosening of the EU ties, and I agree with Chancellor Kohl on this matter. Quite certainly, Sweden has not decided to join the EU to dissolve it or to weaken it. On the contrary. Sweden has always been part of the liberal-democratic Europe; Swedish policy has always been guided by its values. In the new situation in Europe, which has developed since 1990 and which is no longer based on the policy of blocs and on confrontation, accession is easier but no less important than in the past. Another European prospect has been opened up, not only by the Maastricht Treaty on the EU but also toward the north and the east, toward those countries in Europe which belonged to the Warsaw Pact and to the Soviet Union in the past, including Russia. In this larger Europe there lies a historic challenge for the expansion of freedom, which must be consolidated together. Establishing common security is our historic assignment. As an old European state, with its own history of empire and its varied international experiences, in particular in United Nations peacekeeping, Sweden will contribute to that. [Ruehl] What is the particular importance of northern Europe, the usefulness of the northern European dimension of the EU? [Bildt] Quite clearly the changed geopolitical situation. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, especially the independence of the Baltic states and of Ukraine, Russia has been cut off from direct territorial contact with West Europe, in particular since the last Russian troops will withdraw from Germany this year. This new reality gives Sweden's accession to the EU, with the consequence of West Europe's expansion to northern Europe and to the Baltic Sea area, a particular significance, because this establishes neighborhood with Russia and with the three Baltic countries, which will naturally be intensified by Finland's accession into the EU, which we expect. A new ensemble is developing in the EU, which will link Europe's northeast to the West. However, this does not mean a delineation toward Russia but a bridge for coming closer together. Northwest Russia is of great importance for Europe, politically and culturally as well as economically and in scientific-technological terms. [Ruehl] Give us a specific example, please. [Bildt] St. Petersburg as a large city and a region is twice as large as Berlin. This area will be a focal area of modern development that will radiate to the east, the Baltic, and the center of Europe. Russia's ties with West Europe will develop anew via the Baltic Sea, with the Baltic states and northern Europe. Sweden is located in the center of this area with historical ties and experiences toward both sides. Therefore, it is important that it participate in formulating the interests of the EU in East Europe and in the EU policy toward and together with Russia as an EU partner. In the field of security, the EU will border in the north on the Western focus of Russia's Armed Forces and Navy: the deployment area of the North Sea Fleet with missile-armed submarines, whose importance as high-sea-capable, globally mobile carriers of nuclear deterrence will even grow -- compared with the Soviet past -- as a result of the START [Strategic Arms Reduction Talks] agreement between the United States and Russia. Therefore, too, it is good that Sweden, as a country experienced in dealing with Russia and the Russian empire, can exert direct influence within the EU on the EU's security policy. [Ruehl] This also appeals to the Western European Union [WEU] as the military policy defense pact of West Europe and annex of NATO. What is Sweden's attitude toward the WEU and toward this prospect? Does this touch upon the issue of neutrality? [Bildt] Neutrality, which has existed up to now, will not hinder Sweden in this respect, because the preconditions for neutrality in Europe have changed fundamentally; this means the historical sense and purpose of neutrality have disappeared as a result of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. We are primarily interested in helping to build democratic national defense systems which are oriented toward international cooperation, in the former Warsaw Pact states, whose security needs are to be covered by NATO's Partnership for Peace. For that we can use Sweden's rich experience with our own defense system as well as with our participation in UN peacekeeping missions. However, the most important thing for Sweden is active participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy, because this means playing a key role in establishing stability and security spread to all of Europe. When Sweden has become an EU member, we will decide whether Sweden is to join the WEU or whether it is just to have observer status. I think that the latter is the more likely option. [Ruehl] What is NATO's importance for European security in the future? Should it expand toward the East and could all of northern Europe become part of the Atlantic-West European alliance system? [Bildt] Not the latter; northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area should be reintegrated in an all-European security structure, together with the Baltic states, which are also part of northern Europe. Of course, the Russian Federation, just as well as other European states which belonged to the former USSR should also be included in such a security structure. There must not be a new delineation along a new dividing line through Europe, after the division of the Cold War has now been overcome. The EU, too, must find its place in such a security structure. NATO has its focus in the West, as a counterweight, so to speak, to Russia as the big power in East Europe and on the Eurasian continent. NATO remains important for the anchoring of the United States in Europe and for the defense of West Europe. It essentially contributes to all-European security, for instance as a result of the U.S. commitment to Norway's security, which, for its part, is indispensable for security in all of northern Europe. Sweden will develop special relations with the Baltic states to strengthen their independence and security and to exert influence on them so that they establish special security ties with West Europe. The EU as well as the system of Partnership for Peace with NATO are suitable for this purpose. [Ruehl] Is the development not moving further into the direction of NATO expansion to the east, beyond the "Atlantic West Europe" toward Central Europe and beyond Poland and Lithuania to the eastern Baltic Sea area? [Bildt] This is correct, as far as Lithuania is concerned in the Baltic area. However, the concept of NATO's Partnership for Peace is flexible. Flexibility is the most important element of the whole thing. It permits various solutions, tailored to the specific security situation of the individual partners. In general, one can say that this initiative can, to a certain extent, bring about a gradual expansion of NATO in Europe. However, the actual function of NATO, its central function, lies in the West, in the relationship between North America and West Europe in the narrower geographical sense, which also includes Norway and Denmark and Germany. In addition, the specific situation of the individual countries remains the basis of common security. [Ruehl] What does this mean for common security policy? [Bildt] European security policy -- including that of NATO and the EU -- must take this diversity into account and, therefore, distinguish between the individual countries in the spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO cannot organize unified security for all of Europe. However, it can form a focus and thus be a major part of the foundation of the European security structure. As regards the three Baltic countries, they are realistic; they know that their acceptance into NATO is not likely in the foreseeable future. In the long term, however, everything is open. The NATO Partnership for Peace, which they want to enter, offers them contact. Sweden will help them, for instance in military cooperation with NATO within the framework of the UN for international peacekeeping: The "Nordic battalion" of the four northern European states in the UN Protection Forces, in which Sweden is essentially involved, can serve as an example for the establishment of a "Baltic battalion." The northern European countries can advise the Baltic states and support their military training and organization. Cooperation with NATO within the UN framework is necessary and useful, e.g. for taking over and applying NATO standards and NATO procedures, which have proved their worth at the international level. Sweden can participate in this outside the formal NATO framework, and the Baltic countries can as well. A pragmatic policy permits this without expansion of the NATO alliance framework. [Ruehl] What are your expectations regarding the development of the security situation in Europe between Russia as the superpower in the East, and the Atlantic Alliance and the EU in the West? [Bildt] The threat of Soviet imperialism and an aggressive ideological power policy has disappeared for good; it will not be reestablished regardless of what trends will influence Russia's foreign policy in the future and the relationship with the outside world. The Soviet empire will not be revived. After its loss of the empire and its position as an international power, which the Soviet Union mainly held due to its military strength and armament, Russia is currently unsettled after the secession of large territories in Europe and Asia and the independence of the former Soviet republics and the ongoing state and economic crisis. [Ruehl] And this unsettled situation does not exactly help to stabilize the political situation in the region. [Bildt] Well, this crisis will not be over soon. Nevertheless, despite its weakening and the internal confusion, Russia remains a major power due to its sheer size, its huge population, its natural resources, and its still existing industrial-technological potential. It also remains a potential international risk factor, yet so far I do not see this developing. On the contrary, Russia has so far remained ready to cooperate, which can be seen in Russia's policy in the Bosnian conflict. [Ruehl] Is the resurgence of nationalism in Russia a danger? What do Zhirinovskiy and the new majority in the Duma mean? [Bildt] There is, of course, Russian nationalism, which is being strengthened by the crisis and the misery; but this has happened in the past too, and is currently also happening in other countries. Russian nationalism is even necessary to a certain extent. Russia must restore national pride and its national identity after the humiliation it suffered as a result of the decline of the Soviet Union. Yet this has to take place in a democratic system. The nationalist and the old national-Bolshevist forces are gathering; this is the disquieting aspect of the development; but so far Russia has not been overwhelmed by a wave of chauvinism. [Ruehl] But Zhirinovskiy is a political nuisance. [Bildt] No doubt about that. He is a political clown, who is making a caricature of Russia, but who is certainly not backed by a majority of Russians. The large cities, in particular, Moscow and St. Petersburg, neither followed him nor the other nationalists and the communists, with whom he entered into a kind of "brown-red" front. Many Russians are ashamed of Zhirinovskiy's excesses, which tarnish Russia's reputation; they think it is a shame that Russia is being disfigured by a charlatan. Zhirinovskiy will destroy himself, because he is yelling for war, for invading all territories reaching to the Indian Ocean, for the borders of the Czarist empire from the beginning of the century. [Ruehl] So you do not think that the people will follow his slogans? [Bildt] The Russian people will not follow Zhirinovskiy and, after its experience in the Afghanistan war, the army will not do so either. He is a grotesque phenomenon that will pass by as others did before him in the history of Russia. Today, he is personifying social protest in a situation of misery and national frustration. Yet, it is doubtful that people will follow him for a long time. [Ruehl] What is your assessment of Russia's foreign policy in general? How should one handle the "near abroad" as a sphere of Russian interests? [Bildt] Russian rhetoric about the "near abroad" and a "special Russian role" there is incompatible with good-neighborly relations and CSCE rules, particularly with the Paris Charter for a new Europe of 1990, and the UN Charter. Nobody must accept those claims because they mean interfering in affairs of other states who have become sovereign and independent. There is no "near abroad" that can be politically controlled by Russia or any other power in Europe. The Baltics are as close to Sweden and Finland as Russia, historically and culturally even closer. In Estonia and Latvia there are problems of political integration with the Slav part of the population, which was transferred there in the Soviet era to annihilate the national identity of these small peoples and to control these countries from the inside. Yet, this is no reason for Russia to claim a right to a say. Russia must not be permitted to intervene there or anywhere else. The Russians are also wrong when they claim that the "human rights" of the Russian minorities would be violated. That is not true: The new laws on citizenship are correct as is the treatment of the Slav groups of the population. The Council of Europe helped to work out these laws. [Ruehl] How should Russia act toward its neighbors? [Bildt] Russia now has a historic chance to find its way back to Europe, to which it belongs. A new European order requires equal rights and mutual respect. Spheres of interests are not compatible with it. Neither is a security condominium between Russia and NATO, including joint security guarantees for former allies of the old Soviet Union. The litmus test for Russia's intentions and its relationship toward Europe is Russia's policy toward the Baltic states. This is the criterion for European security and cooperation. [Ruehl] Apart from the Baltics there is the question of East Europe and the CIS. Ties that developed over a long period were suddenly interrupted in 1991. Do you see that as a risk or as a chance for a new beginning? [Bildt] Geography, joint history, economic and human ties between the peoples of the individual states rather speak for careful rapprochement after the separation. It will not be a return to the Russian empire or under Moscow's hegemony. Yet, Belarus is already looking to Moscow again for guidance. There are forces that are working toward voluntary association, but there are also tensions that speak against it. The situation in Ukraine is extremely critical, particularly since the reformist forces do not dominate there, as could be seen in the election. The post-Soviet and postimperial era has only just started, and many things can still change; the current situation in East Europe is one of transition. Rapprochement between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and maybe even Kazakhstan for a great Slav confederation appears to be possible. A CIS that is politically and economically organized around Russia is one possibility that would be geographically and economically plausible and, moreover, would be historically founded.
