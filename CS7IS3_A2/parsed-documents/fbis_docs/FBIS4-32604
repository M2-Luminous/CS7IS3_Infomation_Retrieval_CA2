Abdic, Izetbegovic's moderate rival, told the local radio Velika Kladusa that he would organise a nation-wide resistance front against Izetbegovic's loyalists. He accused the Moslem regime in Sarajevo of a determination to crush the struggle of the army and people of western Bosnia for autonomy, which he said enjoyed the support of Moslems in the diaspora. For months past, the army loyal to Izetbegovic has been trying to subdue the province, which was proclaimed by Abdic's supporters last September in opposition to the war-mongering policy of the regime in Sarajevo. The provincial leadership has signed separate peace accords with Bosnian Serbs and Croats, pursuing free trade with them even at the height of Moslem-Serb and Moslem-Croat fighting elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
