FR940817-2-00084 FR940817-2-00043 The exposure estimates shown in Figure 3 are in the range of or exceed some candidate RfC estimates as well as the current RfC. Exceeding the RfC does not necessarily indicate that a public health risk will occur. At present, it is impossible to state whether projected exposures above the RfC would result in an adverse health effect for either an individual or the general population. At a sufficiently high level of exposure, adverse effects would be expected to occur, first in any sensitive subpopulations, then with greater prevalence in the general population and extending to other types of effects (e.g., reproductive and/or respiratory as well as neurobehavioral effects in the case of Mn). However, the relationship between such ``sufficiently high'' levels and the population exposure levels estimated by the projection methods employed here is unknown. Expressed differently, given the gap between observed or modeled effect levels and the RfC values obtained by applying uncertainty factors of orders of magnitude, it is impossible to state whether projected population exposures would lie above or below a presumed threshold level on the actual concentration-response curve for Mn neurotoxicity. This gap between projected exposure levels and the lowest concentrations obtained by modeling the concentration-response relationship (at least, by the quantal linear model) makes it impossible to make any assertion regarding the likelihood of a health risk at projected exposure levels. However, this conclusion should not be interpreted to imply that, therefore, no health risk is expected to exist at exposure levels exceeding the RfC.
