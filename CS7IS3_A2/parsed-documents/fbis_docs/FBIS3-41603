Participants in the expedition were Russian and foreign scientists and representatives of the RF [Russian Federation] government's Committee for Conducting Special-Purpose Underwater Operations (KOPRON). The data that was brought back does not simply say, but shouts, that it is necessary urgently to raise, if not the entire submarine, at least the missiles with nuclear warheads. A PLUTONIUM LEAK IS POSSIBLE AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR As long as two years ago Igor Spasskiy, the general designer at the Rubin KB [Design Bureau], and the father of the Komsomolets, stated that the sea water had ``cracked'' the torpedo heads and the nuclear warheads had ``started to leak.'' After the most recent expedition returned, KOPRON chairman Tengiz Borisov announced an even more threatening situation and the possible leaking of plutonium into the sea as early as late 1994. Tengiz Borisov says, ``As early as a couple of days after the Komsomolets went down, it became clear to me that this was possibly the prelude to a much more serious catastrophe. Once, in the North, a barge to which a titanium submarine had been moored for four months sank before my very eyes. It was even thought that that had been an act of sabotage. But when the barge was raised, it turned out that, while it had been in an ideal condition above the water line, below the water line it had been `eaten away' like Swiss cheese. And it was only at that time that people began thinking for the first time about electrochemical corrosion.'' ``The Komsomolets also has a titanium hull, and in the presence of titanium other metals are subjected to corrosion at a very great speed. The designers, of course, stipulated an electrochemical shield, and it operates excellently, so long as the submarine is operating normally. But as soon as the submarine is filled with water, it immediately becomes a galvanic cell. And, according to the most modest estimates, a current of the order of 500 amperes is generated on the hull. The speed of the corrosion is greater than the usual speed by a factor of the order of 1.5-2 -- that is the finding of the academy's Institute of Physical Chemistry. On average, the water eats through 0.2 mm a year, but in the presence of titanium, as much as 20 mm.'' The 1991 expedition revealed the presence of a radioactive background -- that is, within 2.5 years. True, the traces of radiation were insignificant. But the most terrifying thing was that it was discovered that the torpedo tubes had been damaged, and the warheads with the plutonium were in contact with the water. Plus the tremendous breaks in the hull. Last year's expedition confirmed the worst fears: the warheads had actually broken apart, and in at least three torpedo tubes with nuclear warheads there is a long trail of products of corrosion. And it is only the design of the charge itself that, so far, is keeping the plutonium in the warheads. A month ago, for the first time, the telescopic ``hands'' of the MIR-1 and MIR-2 deep-water bathyspheres made their way inside the submarine and took water samples for analysis. And an attempt was also made to raise a rescue chamber with the remains of the ship commander and several crew members. Unfortunately, because of the stormy weather, the cable broke as the rescue chamber was just 200 meters from the surface, and the chamber sank... NYeG [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA] DOSSIER Most specialists agree that the leakage of plutonium into the sea, with regard to the force of its effect upon the environment, could prove to be much more frightening that the Chernobyl catastrophe. Nuclear leaks on land can be localized, if only theoretically, but in water it is impossible to collect the radioactive elements. For the time being, fortunately, no leakage of plutonium has been recorded. But when it does get into the water -- and there are several kilograms of it in the torpedoes -- that will be too late. That amount is sufficient to make the Norwegian Sea unsuitable for fishing for hundreds of years. ``The situation is worsened by the fact that it is rather complicated to detect plutonium. Very precise analyses are needed. Plutonium does not have natural gamma-radiation, but only alpha-activity. And in order for the instruments to indicate its presence, it is necessary to have the precision of a sniper to get to the place where, at the particular moment, there are considerable accumulations of it.'' ``The ship lies within a 200-mile zone of Norway's economic interests. And if -- God forbid -- the Norwegians catch even a single herring with traces of plutonium, the area will be closed to fishing. The half-life of plutonium is 24,000 years. Taking into consideration the mixing of it with sea water, and its washout, that period is 600-700 years. We will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation... I daresay that those amounts of money are not comparable with what is currently necessary to raise the ship.'' CARRY OUT THE PLAN AT ANY COST? According to T. Borisov's data, at the present time there do not exist, anywhere in the world, the technical means capable of raising the Komsomolets. Moreover, there is only one ship that is capable of sealing it off -- the American ship Glomar Challenger. More than 20 foreign companies are ready to finance both the raising of the submarine, and the work of sealing it off, which the committee is planning to carry out no later than next summer. Finally, the method of doing this has been selected. NYeG DOSSIER A large number of technologies were proposed, but as of this moment none of them has been fully developed or approved. In addition, there is no longer any time for this The proposal was made to fill up the submarine with concrete. But in that instance it will be impossible to remove the warheads from it. Also, how will the concrete behave under the conditions of those depths and the salty sea water? No one knows. The plans to encase the submarine in a sarcophagus also failed. The biotechnologists of the Sitek SP [joint venture] of the Far Eastern Branch of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] proposed their solution. In September 1992 the scientists patented in the United States ``a method for isolating radioactive materials submerged in a water environment,'' with the aid of the biopolymer chitosan. The substance, which up until now has been used only in medicine and in the processing of waste products, is obtained from chitin -- the basic component of the shells of shrimp and crabs. Chitosan is one of the best adsorbents and excellently traps the ions of heavy metals. In a mixture with other components it forms a gel which, upon entering the water, turns into a hard sponge -- it is not damaged by washout or corrosion. It is proposed to pump this substance under pressure into all the capacities of the sunken submarine. The radioactive elements that previously leaked through the cracks in the hull and in the torpedoes will be absorbed by this material. Taking into account the use of chitosan to ``catch'' the heavy metals for up to 80 percent of its own weight, the nonleakage of radioactive elements is guaranteed, because their weight is never compared with the weight of the solution. Incidentally, by no means everyone agrees with this plan. Some scientists, without denying that the sources of radioactivity have to be raised as quickly as possible, nevertheless express their fear: won't the reactor, to which the access of water will be closed, explode? That is why they propose using the chitosan to fill up only the reactor compartment and the torpedoes, and to cut them out of the submarine in sections and raise them to the surface. It is easier and quicker to do this than to attempt to raise the entire submarine from the tremendous depth. But Tengiz Borisov gives these arguments: ``Technology with the use of chitosan makes it possible to encase any ship at a depth of as much as 8000 meters -- with a safety guarantee of a minimum of a hundred years. Of course that is not enough. But it will be necessary to await the appearance either of new technology or new techniques. Or, if quantity makes the transition to quality, to build a special ship for this job.'' There is one more paradox. Unlike our specialists, our Western colleagues worry more about the reactor than they do about the warheads. Some of them who also participated in the expedition on board the Mstislav Keldysh assert that the Cesium-137 from the reactor which appeared in the water analyses and the plutonium from the warheads settle excellently in the mud at the bottom of the sea and constitute absolutely no threat of ``killing'' the Norwegian Sea. And they cite a large number of examples with sunken reactors -- both ours and theirs. At such time, for some reason, they fail completely to take into consideration the Russian data to the effect that sea-bottom currents that have not yet been explained have been discovered in the area of the Komsomolets -- currents with a speed of up to 1.5 meters a second. Periodically, underwater gales occur in this area. In our country one can also hear voices stating that everything is not really so frightening, and that Borisov is just attempting to get more money for his committee by stating that the submarine has to be sealed off not only within the near future, but also at any cost... It is difficult for us journalists to evaluate disputes among specialists. We are convinced of one thing: it is only in work that experience is accumulated. The proponents of raising the submarine have one more iron-clad argument with which it is difficult not to agree: it is necessary, to the extent possible, to raise the submarine in order to analyze the causes of the catastrophe and to avoid its repetition. In confirmation of this argument the chairman of the RF government's Committee to Conduct Special Underwater Operations, captain first rank, experienced submariner and scientist Tengiz Borisov, says, ``I, as a career military man who has served on submarines, doubt that within the near future submariners will be threatened by unemployment.'' P.S. It is proposed to carry out the operations to seal off the submarine next summer, after first using a Dutch cutter to cut away the forward compartment in exactly the place where the missiles with the warheads are located. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA pledges to keep you informed about the course of these operations.
