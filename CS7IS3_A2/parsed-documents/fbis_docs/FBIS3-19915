Between today and tomorrow, once the examination of the general state accountant's work is completed, the prime minister will release the "prognoses," making known, almost certainly prior to Sunday's [27 March] vote, the state of health of the government budget. Figures for the first three months are good, but the results will once again be weighed down by the recession, which will contribute decisively to the almost 15 trillion lire deviation from forecasts already ascertained following the past few days' indiscrete leaks. This means that the deficit, by the end of the year, should amount to around 160 trillion lire. The document put together by General State Accountant Andrea Monorchio's men can be summarized in a few figures: receipts will be 10 trillion lire below forecast, more than half of this due to lower tax receipts (personal income tax, VAT [value-added tax], municipal real estate tax). Additionally, the state will be spending some 6 trillion lire more than originally estimated. This figure is made up of greater expenditures, mainly transfers for social security and assistance. Included in the expenditures, however, are both a reduction in interest paid to holders of government securities (approximately 3 trillion lire) and a drop in investments, which by the end of the year will be less than initially calculated by the government. Personnel expenditure, on the other hand, should be in line with forecasts. The expenditure savings to be achieved during 1994 include those relating to supplies to public authorities. The "Cassese package," that is the measures devised by the civil service minister aimed in particular at rationalizing the public procurement of goods and services, makes provision for a savings of 2.9 trillion lire. The first data available on the government budget contradict the indiscretions which labeled these measures to be ineffective. In fact, in the first two and a half months of 1994, despite a larger budget allocation, procurement expenditure fell 6.5 percent compared with the same period in 1993. Payments too have reduced by 4.7 percent. In substance, the Cassese package is beginning to produce the expected effects. The ending of the pubic auditor's work provides clarification on the public accounts, about which all sorts of rumors and figures have been whirling round in recent days. It was a genuine war in which the most disparate suggestions have been made. Initially it was rumored that Cassese's measures had not provided the expected results. This indiscretion, however, proved to be unfounded. Following this, a table was circulated, purported to come from the general state accountant, which while confirming the 16 trillion lire deficit, announced a heavy fall in tax receipts. It even suggested a figure of 13 trillion lire below forecast, with a substantial VAT shortfall, a figure which immediately brought down a storm of fury on the head of Finance Minister Franco Gallo. At the ministry they quickly pointed out that this figure was unfounded, and that the Finance Ministry's estimates were much lower: 4-5 trillion lire less revenue, 6 trillion lire on a worst-case basis. The same mysterious table "gave the figures" on other headings. For example, it mentioned 10 trillion lire lower receipts from the sale of goods and services (including those planned with the restructuring of the postal system and the sale of real estate by the social security agencies), while the economic transactions expect to make a net 1,800 billion from this income item. There was then forecast an incredible savings of 11 trillion lire in personnel expenditure, contrary to the government's plans and the accountant's own estimates. This ballet of figures has now been going on for several weeks, and is so bizarre that someone has begun to suspect that this has to a certain extent been intentional; that there has been a desire to dramatize the situation of public finances and to place the blame on first one, then another minister. The publication of the quarterly budget report should therefore put an end to these polemics and more or less guided indiscretions.
