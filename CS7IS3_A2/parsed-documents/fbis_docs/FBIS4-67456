If one discards the mutual personal dislike that is typical of Russian administrators, the essence of the differences of opinion expressed by the two respected ecologists and ex officio state figures can be summarized as opposing evaluations of the state of the natural environment -- which is almost apocalyptic, according to Yablokov, or one that suggests restrained optimism, according to Danilov-Danilyan. Accusing each other of incompetency, the learned gentlemen, who indisputably occupy, in today's ecological table of ranks, the first and second places (I shall not undertake to make a judgment about who occupies which place), cite extremely weighty arguments as the basis of their positions. And it would scarcely be worthwhile for a journalist to interfere in this almost scientific discussion if it had not revealed an underlying natural law that it would be a mistake to ignore. Despite all the difference of the views expressed by the administrators of Minprirody [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] and the MVK, they completely coincided in the view that the resources available to their departments and, in particular, the executive power's vertical line in general for resolving or at least mollifying the ecological problems are obviously inadequate, and that new steps are necessary here. Being consistent individuals, neither one delayed in putting his words into action. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, as a member of Russia's Choice, continued his march into power and, intending to achieve the development of civilized environmental-protection legislation, added to the title of minister the rank of deputy to the State Duma. Aleksey Yablokov, on the contrary, declared politics to be an unworthy matter and, as a sign of protest against President Boris Yeltsin's ignoring of ecological problems, submitted his resignation from the position of his advisor on ecology and the protection of health, while reserving the right, even after leaving the MVK, to concentrate completely on the creation of a broad ecological movement. The opposing nature of the actions taken by people who possess in Russia ecological power to the highest degree only seems to be such. Actually it attests to a situation when a few ecologists, professionals and amateurs, have been completely deprived of public attention and support, while remaining one-on-one with numerous problems. The hopes shared by the optimists, among whom Danilov-Danilyan himself was included, that, after the upsurge of the ecological movement in the second half of the 1980's and its damping as a result of the economic and political crises in the early 1990's, the population that had adapted to the new realities of the democratic market would turn its gaze to the mess in the ecology, were not justified. The results of the recent election serve as the best confirmation of this. The "Green" party, which united the activists of the ecological organizations, having failed to collect the necessary 100,000 signatures, came crashing down as early as the registration stage. The Cedar bloc, which made statements under ecological slogans, despite an intensified advertising campaign, suffered as a result a no less impressive defeat and, with 0.1 percent of the votes, ended up in last place. Incidentally, as for Cedar, whose voter list included just about anyone, so long as he was not an ecologist, that movement, which had been created shortly before the beginning of the election campaign, did not recommend itself by anything in particular, other than tinsel advertising posters with elements of ecology, and, after its defeat, went back into the underground, presumably until the next election. Such a crushing defeat for the ecological bloc cannot be explained simply by its fractionation or lack of organization. Both situations, of course, exist, although one of the leaders of the Socioecological Union, enraged at an item published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the eve of the election, did attempt to prove otherwise, ascribing to his movement nonexistent merits and accusing the press of doing no more and no less than unleashing an informational war against the "Greens." However, even the small size of the ecological organizations -- which lay as the basis of these shortcomings -- actually only reflects another, much more serious tendency. Its essence lies in the fact that the chief antiecological center, that previously used to be located somewhere at the summit of the party-nomenklatura-departmental pyramid, has today shifted sharply downward, and the person who acts as the ecologists' chief opponent is no longer the state official, the director corps, or the "new Russian" businessman who is chasing profit at any cost, but actually that very same average-statistical Russian man in the street who, not too long ago, demanded the closing of practically all the dirty production entities and the establishment of strict ecological order. According to Minprirody data that was cited in the summer of 1993, the precise following of the already enacted laws and statutes governing the protection of the environment would lead at that moment to the bankruptcy of more than 60 percent of the Russian enterprises. A year later, the economic crisis has definitely not loosened its embraces, and today the number of enterprises that guarantee their survival, including those doing so thanks to the ruthless exploitation of nature, is even greater. They can be made ecologically safe only by investing tremendous amounts of money in environmental-protection measures, which, either as a result of an increase in cost, will convert their output into something that is completely uncompetitive not only in the world market, but also in the domestic market, or will force the compensating of the environmental-protection costs at the expense of people's wages. Either of these situations will have an immediate negative effect on the population's standard of living. That is why the ecological slogans that previously seemed to be a reflection of man's legal right to have a normal environment, are evaluated today by the same population as green extremism. Incidentally, one should not think that the problem of the price of ecology is pertinent only for Russia. A few years ago in Germany, a country that is ecologically favorable as compared with us, in response to a compliment concerning rabbits that were running across the lawns, the burgher who was giving me a ride only slapped the pocket in which his wallet was presumably located and, with a rather sour face, said that he would gladly trade all the rabbits for a new BMW. But whereas the West Europeans who have achieved a certain level of prosperity have to pay for the preservation of a normal living environment by rejecting a part of their welfare in the form of a second car or a country home, for Russians, 60 millions of whom live in areas with unfavorable ecological conditions, the alternative is much harsher. The smog that hangs over the city and the growing figures in the disease rate seem a much lesser evil than the much more tangible threat of unemployment, poverty, and fuel crisis. As a result, the resolution of the most painful environmental-protection questions, with increasing frequency, comes up against not the inactivity of the executive authority, an economic depression, or imperfect legislation, but the population's elementary unwillingness to sacrifice anything at all for the sake of the ecology. There are more than enough examples of this: from the small Karelian settlement of Nadvoitsy, the residents of which, in exchange for their economic welfare, have reconciled themselves to ecological misfortunes, to the cities around the Caspian, where the local authorities took the money that had been allocated to combat flooding and diverted it to other purposes.
