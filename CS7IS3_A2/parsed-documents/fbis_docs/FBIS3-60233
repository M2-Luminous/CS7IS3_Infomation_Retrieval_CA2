This forum was primarily devoted to studying how to orient the protection of environment and natural resources to the demands of the new situation and to explore how to take up the new challenges facing environmental protection. Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the NPC, made a speech at the forum. He said: As a fundamental national policy of our country, environmental protection has always attracted high attention from the party and the state. The vast numbers of the people have also strongly demanded the prevention and control of pollution and improvement of the ecological environment. Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should actually list environmental protection work as a major item on their daily agenda and strive to do the work well. The NPC and the people's congress of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should accelerate the pace of protecting environment and further strengthen inspection and supervision over the implementation of the laws on environmental protection in order to give rise to a new situation in which the NPC, people's congresses at various levels, governments at various levels, various circles in society, and the broad masses of the people make concerted efforts to manage the work altogether. At the forum, Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the province, extended a welcome to the comrades of the environmental protection committee under the NPC and the comrades from various fraternal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, on behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, and the provincial government. Qu Geping, vice chairman of the environmental protection committee under the NPC, presided over the forum and made a report entitled "People's Congresses at All Levels Should Strengthen the Protection of Environment and Natural Resources." Attending the forum were Lin Zongtang, Yang Jike, Qin Zhongda, and Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairmen of the environmental protection committee under the NPC; and Li Zhen, chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee.
