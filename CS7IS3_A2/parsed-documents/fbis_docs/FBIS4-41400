What has happened here is perestroyka of the purest kind," the leader of the "Yabloko" group in the State Duma, the well-known economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, claims. For most people in the country "things are exactly the same as they were before," he writes in an article published in the latest issue of the weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. "The most important elements of the old Soviet way of organizing socio-economic affairs still exist and operate here. The monopolies and the former structures of production remain unchanged. There is no real private ownership or competition. Land reform is not being carried out. Democratic procedures for public accountability have not been worked out. A system of local self-government has not been established. There is no real separation of powers." People are now talking about stabilization, but stabilization of "such a system is not a blessing," the deputy warns. "This signifies that Russia continues to be an oligarchical and super-monopolized state. All that's changed is the `political superstructure'," Yavlinskiy says. "The CPSU has gone, but it has been replaced by strong criminal influence on government." "It is impossible to run such a system by normal democratic methods," Yavlinskiy warns. "In the Soviet era Politburo decisions were the most effective instrument of government. Taken by a small group of people, without public discussion, without adherence to democratic `conditionality', their implementation was mandatory. Unfortunately, the latest edicts issued by the president are very reminiscent of those decisions." "The main danger is that undemocratic, unlawful and even unconstitutional methods of administration are being openly resorted to," he believes. He says that "the culmination of this deviation from previously proclaimed principles was the edict on `Urgent Measures To Protect the Public Against Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime'. This edict violates virtually everything that can be violated: human rights, a number of federal laws, the constitution itself. The whole country can see that not only the `spirit of the law' but its actual `letter' is being contravened. Furthermore it is being contravened by the sole guarantor of the constitution - the president."
