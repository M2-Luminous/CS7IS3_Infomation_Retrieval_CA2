The SUNDAY MORNING POST reported yesterday that, as a result of a clerical error in the Foreign Office, changes allowing John Swaine to replace the Governor as President of the Legislative Council [Legco] last year had not undergone the essential steps of becoming law -- believed to include being signed by the Queen -- when they were gazetted on February 18 and 19, 1993. Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal was invalid and would mean that Mr Swaine lacked the legal authority to preside over Legco, raising doubts about the validity of the 125 laws passed since then. The laws include the two Budgets, the first part of the 1994/95 electoral reforms, the Western Harbour Crossing Ordinance and the Boundary and Election Commission Ordinance. But a Government spokesman said yesterday the amendments were "approved by Her Majesty at the Privy Council meeting on December 19, 1992". It is understood that the Queen approved the amendments in draft form only. The spokesman said: "Although the two sets of amendments were published in the Hong Kong Gazette before the residual formalities were completed, Her Majesty's Government was satisfied that this would have no effect on the validity of any acts by the Hong Kong Legislative Council." A legal source said the issue was about "the legal meaning of an amendment being made to the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions". The British Government's position was that it accepted the Queen's signature on the draft as sufficient. The source said it remained to be seen whether this was a correct statement of the law and it was unacceptable for doubts to linger over the effectiveness of amendments to the Letters Patents. Legislators are set to query officials of the Constitutional Affairs Branch on the issue today. United Democrat chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming said he wanted a clarification from the administration. He noted that anyone with an interest in one of the 125 laws could challenge their validity which would be disastrous. His colleague Simon Ip Sik-on said they had to get the full details first. "I don't think it is a simple issue," he said, adding that it was unwise to rush to conclusions.
