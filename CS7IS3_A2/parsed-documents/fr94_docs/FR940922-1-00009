FR940922-1-00009 FR940922-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [ID 1&hyph;1&hyph;5528; FRL&hyph;5076&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Idaho AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to take action on the state implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (State or IDEQ) for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) in the Ada County/Boise area. The SIP was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Ada County/Boise, Idaho. In summary, EPA proposes to grant full approval of the emissions inventory and PM&hyph;10 precursor exclusion elements of the SIP because they are separable and independent elements. EPA proposes limited approval under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) of the control measures that have been submitted by the State to date. This limited approval of the control measures is for the limited purpose of making them federally enforceable and thereby advancing the Clean Air Act NAAQS-related air quality goals. At the same time, EPA is proposing to disapprove the control measures as not satisfying the specific requirement under sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the CAA to submit a SIP revision that includes provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 and to disapprove the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because the State has not adopted and submitted to EPA the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by October 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Air Programs Development Section, 1200 Sixth Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, Washington, 98101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Fry, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Air Programs Development Section, 1200 Sixth Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, Washington, 98101, (206) 553&hyph;2575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Ada County/Boise, Idaho area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 1 (see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.313). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of title I of the Act. 2 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action on the State of Idaho's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address indicated above. EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on today's proposal. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or Act). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information.
