FR941206-0-00141 FR941206-0-00019 8. Inspection and Monitoring Requirements The inspection and monitoring requirements under the subpart CC standards have been revised since proposal. The requirements for inspection and monitoring of closed-vent systems and control devices have been changed to be identical to the inspection and monitoring requirements under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. The required interval for the visual inspection of covers installed on tanks, surface impoundments, and certain containers has been changed to once every 6 months. After the initial cover inspection and monitoring for detectable organic emissions is completed, the owner or operator is only required to inspect and monitor those cover openings that have been opened (i.e., have not continuously remained in a closed, sealed position) since the last visual inspection and monitoring. Special inspection and monitoring provisions have been added for cover fittings that are unsafe or difficult, as defined in the rule, for facility personnel to inspect and monitor. The subpart CC standards have been changed to allow leak repair on tank and surface impoundment covers to be delayed beyond 15 calendar days if both of the following conditions occur: (1) Repair of the leak requires first emptying the contents of the tank or surface impoundment; and (2) temporary removal of the tank or surface impoundment from service will result in the unscheduled cessation of production from the process unit, or operation of the waste management unit, that is generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment. Repair of a leak must be performed at the next time the process, system, or waste management unit that is generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment stops operation for any reason. 9. Recordkeeping Requirements The subpart CC standards have been changed to require cover design documentation only for floating roof-type tank covers, surface impoundment covers, and enclosures used for control of air emissions from containers. Also, the recordkeeping requirements have been revised as appropriate to address the changes to the final rule described previously in this section of the preamble. 10. Reporting Requirements The reporting requirements in the subpart CC standards are the same as proposed with one exception. The time interval within which TSDF owners and operators subject to the subpart CC standards under 40 CFR part 264 must report to the Regional Administrator all circumstances resulting in noncompliance with the applicable conditions has been changed to within 15 calendar days of the time that an owner or operator becomes aware of the circumstances. B. TSDF Miscellaneous Units Today's action amends 40 CFR 264.601 by adding to the permit terms and provisions required for RCRA permitting of a miscellaneous unit the appropriate air emission control requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC. This amendment is the same as proposed. C. Generator 90-Day Tanks and Containers The conditions with which a hazardous waste generator must comply, pursuant to 40 CFR 262.34(a), to exempt tanks and containers accumulating hazardous waste on-site for no more than 90 days from the RCRA subtitle C permitting requirements are amended by today's action to include compliance with the air emission control requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA, BB, and CC. This amendment is the same as proposed. D. Other RCRA Regulatory Actions The EPA proposed several amendments to existing RCRA air standards. One amendment proposed adding requirements for the management of spent carbon removed from a carbon adsorption system to the closed-vent system and control device standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA and BB, and 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA and BB. The final amendment has been revised to allow the owner or operator the additional option of burning the spent carbon in a boiler or industrial furnace that is permitted under subpart H of 40 CFR part 266. A second amendment promulgated today updates the leak detection monitoring provisions under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA and BB, and 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA and BB for closed-vent systems to be consistent with other air standards recently promulgated by the EPA. Under this amendment, annual leak detection monitoring is not required for those closed-vent system components which continuously operate in vacuum service or those closed-vent system joints, seams, or other connections that are permanently or semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe, a bolted and gasketed pipe flange).
