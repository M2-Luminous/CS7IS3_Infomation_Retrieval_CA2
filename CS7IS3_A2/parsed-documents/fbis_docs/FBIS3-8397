The party was formed last November through the merger of some breakaway factions of the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP). The FKGP was originally a member of the governing coalition but later on party Chairman Jozsef Torgyan and some other deputies went into opposition. Thirty-six Smallholders, however, turned against Torgyan and remained in the coalition. Some of them are now leaders of the EKGP. The EKGP manifesto lays emphasis on economic development, mainly in the provinces, and covers home policy, foreign policy, nature protection, education, and health, too. The United Smallholders seek to develop an efficient agriculture based on private ownership. To attain this aim, they wish to join the next cabinet in any case. The EKGP says Hungary's agriculture should be duly prepared for European integration, which is an indispensable condition of economic growth. The EKGP criticizes the current banking system for its failure to finance private farms appropriately. The party is of the view that the whole food industry should be transferred to the scope of the Ministry of Agriculture. The United Smallholders say the new Parliament should draft a new Constitution to be confirmed by a referendum. According to the manifesto, the president of the republic should be elected in a referendum, and the government controlled more efficiently by a bicameral parliament.
