The Kurds are accused of breaking the law. The deportation at any cost, which is propagated by the FRG interior minister, is nothing else -- namely the announcement that international agreements will be violated. To what extent the rule-of-law self-poisoning has progressed is shown by the plans that were discussed at the level of ministry officials in Bonn: The German Kurds are to be imprisoned in a special prison in Turkey, some kind of prison for terrorists. Minister Kanther has denied that he is tending toward such ideas. Nevertheless, such considerations are a symptom of the time because they take the unscrupulousness of the official policy to its end. Turkey is interpreting this (not without justification) in its own way, namely as follows: Bonn supports our war against the Kurds. If the Lower Saxon farmers block the A-1 highway for a day, this is despair. If the Kurds block the highway, this is a serious violation of the law relating to civil disorders and rioting, dangerous interference with road traffic, and resistance. If German truck drivers block the border checkpoint, the politicians express understanding and share their concern for their economic existence. However, if the Kurds despair because of the killing of their families in Kurdistan, they are killed as terrorists. The point is not condoning crimes. Rather, the point is to punish them appropriately. Bonn politics does something else: It uses the Kurdish protests to fan the mood for destroying the remnants of a humane aliens and asylum law.
