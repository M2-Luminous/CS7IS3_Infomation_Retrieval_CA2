During the grand gathering of the two academies, physicist Prof. Zhou Guangzhao, president of the CAS, told XINHUA about the strategic thinking of China's scientific and technological development. He said that the advancement of modern productivity comes largely out of progress in science and technology. The key to the solution of problems plaguing China, such as those related to resources, the environment and development, lies in no more than science and technology. "Only by relying on modern science and technology, can we create a productivity bringing good economic returns, high efficiency and sustainable development," said Zhou, a renowned theoretical physicist. He said that China must base its scientific and technological developmental plan and strategy strictly on its real national conditions, as economies at different development stages call for different industrial and technological structures. "Once any scientific and technological development scheme deviates from its corresponding economic development stage, it will have negative effects on economic growth as well as on the progress of science and technology itself," the professor said. China's strategy for scientific and technological development must therefore be forward-looking and far-sighted in nature, and must serve the development of the upcoming economic stages, rather than a stage now passing, Zhou said. He listed four basic facts which had to be taken into account when China draws up its scientific and technological development program: -- Compared with developed countries, China is in an inferior position in terms of the overall economic strength and scientific and technological development level; -- China's vast population, a lack of resources in per capita terms, and environmental deterioration have combined to cast a great burden on development, and will restrain development; -- China's huge market and potential can push forward the world economy; -- China's high savings rate, low salary standard and the fact that Chinese people are hard-working can create favorable conditions for capital accumulation and industrial development. The first two facts indicate that development is an arduous task and a sustainable development is therefore ever more necessary. The other two facts have made it possible for China to utilize both domestic and foreign capital and technology, accelerate scientific, technological and industrial progress and achieve the relatively quick development, the academy president said. Overall, China should adopt a strategy marked by sustained and coordinated development and get ready for a long-term economic battle, Zhou said. Meanwhile, China must be ready and able to fight "quick-victory economic campaigns" in some specific domains, by pooling capital and manpower and leaping over some links and stages in the technical development process. This will help China achieve quick development, he explained. In some of the world's emerging high-tech spheres, which have potentially immense impact on future industrial development, China should adopt a strategy with a mechanism that reacts swiftly and such a strategy must be supported by a guarantee of manpower, materials and funds, the professor stressed. "In some selected spheres, China should strive to make breakthroughs by introducing market economy mechanism," he noted, adding that this was quite possible, especially in some high-tech fields that need limited funds but much intelligence. Talking about scientific and technological competition worldwide, Zhou said that it is of little meaning to repeat past discoveries. The Chinese scientific and technological community should tap the superiority and potential of research institutes and universities and colleges as well as encourage academic pace-setters, particularly young scholars and technicians, to set up comprehensive scientific research centers and compete in the most advanced frontiers of the world's science and technology kingdom. However, he pointed out that China, as a big country with a still low economic, scientific and technological development level, would meet with ever intensifying international competitions in all spheres in its whole process of opening wider to the outside world. "In these conditions, Chinese scientists, young scientists in particular, must get themselves well prepared and grasp all opportunities so as to win a foothold in the international scientific arena and eventually make contributions to our times," the president urged.
