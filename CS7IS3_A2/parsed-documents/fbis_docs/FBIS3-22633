In Rio de Janeiro County the death rate from meningitis is also subject to debate. According to National Meningitis Commission [CNM] Chairwoman Marilia Bulhoes, the death rate is declining. Meanwhile, Municipal Health Secretary Ronaldo Gazolla and Keyla Marzochi, head of the biological sciences department of the National Public Health School sponsored by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, claim that the death rate from meningitis is high and worrisome. Approximately 5 million doses of expired anti-meningitis vaccine still are being kept in cold storage at the Athaualpa de Paiva Foundation facilities in a Rio de Janeiro suburb. The Cuban Government promised to replace the lot free of charge as soon as news about the loss worth some $50 million hit the press. The CNM chairwoman advised Health Minister Henrique Santillo against importing the vaccine on the grounds that it does not protect children younger than four, the age bracket most vulnerable to meningitis. The champions of the Cuban vaccine argue that despite the fact that it does not offer total protection, the Cuban vaccine is the only one that has been tested in Brazil with an average success rate of 70 percent. The matter is far from closed. On 8 February, the CNM will meet in Brasilia once more. Meanwhile, the United States is testing a similar vaccine in Chile that could become available on the market very soon. According to Bulhoes, the CNM chose not to use the Cuban vaccine after the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo conducted studies that showed a significant increase in antibodies, meaning immunity, in only 22 percent of the children ages 23 months or less, in 45 percent of the children between 24 and 47 months, and in 42 percent of children between 48 and 53 months. When used in Amapa State, the same vaccine increased the immunity of only 12 percent of the children who had been vaccinated. Health expert Keyla Marzochi claims that studies showed that the vaccine was effective in "at least" 70 percent of the children four years and older in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Marzochi reported that in Rio de Janeiro County the vaccine's average rate of success for children between six months and nine years was 74 percent, while for those four years or older the rate of success was 82 percent. Marzochi stated that the Adolfo Lutz Institute conducted laboratory rather than epidemiological studies. Laboratory testing uses significantly smaller samples. Marzochi argued: "Bearing in mind that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a vaccine against leishmaniasis, a nonfatal disease, whose rate of success is only 50 percent, why shouldn't we use a vaccine that gives protection to an average of 70 percent of those who have been vaccinated?" The first lot of 5 million doses of Cuban vaccine against B-type meningitis were purchased at $10 per dose on instructions from former Health Minister Alceni Guerra, on the advice of then-Health Ministry Secretary General Augusto Farias, the brother of Paulo Cesar Farias. In 1990 and 1991, the death rate from meningitis stood at 15 percent of those who caught the disease; in 1992 it climbed to 19 percent, and in 1993 it reached 23 percent. Rio de Janeiro Municipal Health Secretary Ronaldo Gazzola spoke in favor of using the vaccine in Rio de Janeiro and pointed out that the main concern that prompted him to suggest to Health Minister Santillo to import the Cuban vaccine was the upswing in the death rate. Marozchi feels that just replacing the Cuban vaccine would not be enough. "The best thing for Brazil would be for the deal to include an agreement on the transfer of technology so the vaccine could be produced in Brazil."
