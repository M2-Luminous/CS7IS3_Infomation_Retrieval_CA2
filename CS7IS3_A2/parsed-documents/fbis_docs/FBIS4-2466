Several million farmers are joining forces in the selecting, cultivating, testing and promoting of quality crop seeds and animal stock. Jiangxi hopes to lift its agriculture to a new level by doing so. Last year more than 90 percent of its major crops such as soy beans, peanuts and cotton used quality seeds. The use of quality stock has also been promoted in raising pigs, cattle, sheep and aquatic products. Governments at all levels have offered financial and technological support for the cultivation of quality seeds and stock and the construction of such centers. Jiangxi has also set up organizations to make sure that no inferior seeds or stock can find their way onto the market.
