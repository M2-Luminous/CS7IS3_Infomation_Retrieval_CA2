"The Serbs simply have the right to Sarajevo and they will persist in this, while I hope that whoever wants peace has to understand this," Krajisnik said. "I know what the intentions of the other side are -- that the city should be mixed and as such become a part of the Muslim republic," Krajisnik said, adding that Sarajevo as a divided city enables the normal functioning of the Serb and Muslim parts, makes life easier for the population, and eliminates causes for fighting. Krajisnik said that these are all the conditions [as received] and that after yesterday's signing of an agreement opening up blue roads in the Sarajevo area for the civilian population and humanitarian needs, all those advocating war will remain in a minority. In conclusion, he said he hopes that complete peace in Sarajevo would be restored in the foreseeable future.
