This is the common understanding reached by economists attending a national seminar on the economic development of major grain and cotton production areas. Over the years, for historical and many other reasons, China's major grain and cotton production areas have, on the one hand, provided large amounts of commercial grain and cotton to the whole country and made important contributions to the national economic development and improvement of the people's living standards; on the other hand, these areas have seen a low level of overall economic development, slow growth of local financial revenues, and comparatively low income for farmers. To properly resolve this outstanding problem in the Chinese rural economy, leaders, experts, and scholars from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi -- the major grain and cotton production areas -- attended a seminar cosponsored by the State Council Research Office and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to discuss measures to promote grain and cotton production areas' economic development. Yuan Mu, director of the State Council Research Office, gave a keynote speech at the seminar. The seminarians held: China has always attached great importance to grain and cotton production. The Central Rural Work Conference, convened last October, explicitly called for prioritizing support for major grain and cotton production areas' economic development. However, in the past we paid more attention to grain and cotton production within the context of promoting production, than to systemamtic study and solutions of questions related to these areas' all-around economic development. As a result, many areas faced the predicament of "major grain and cotton production counties having weak industry and being in financial straits," causing fluctuations in grain and cotton markets. A summary of historical experiences and lessons shows that we should make the promotion of major grain and cotton areas' economic development a systems engineering project. This is a new strategic concept for solving problems related to grain and cotton production under the condition of a socialist market economy, about which leaders at all levels and relevant departments should reach a common understanding. In line with this new concept for major grain and cotton production areas' economic development, the seminarians suggested that attention be paid to identifying and solving problems related to the following 10 issues: Defining a comprehensive and correct economic development goal for the major grain and cotton production areas by shifting from the previous simple mode of grain and cotton farming to the establishment of a comprehensive goal that organically combines steady growth of grain and cotton production with all-around economic development and a rapid increase of farmers' incomes; making agricultural modernization the foundation of economic development, with the emphasis on extensive popularization and application of science and technology to revitalize agriculture; bringing into better play the areas' advantages in grain and cotton production as they form the foundation and pillar as well as provide the source for steady growth of farmers' incomes in these areas; continuously readjusting and optimizing these areas' production structures, ensuring a stable growth in the total grain and cotton output while actively developing diversified management and nonagricultural undertakings; transferring surplus laborers from these areas through various channels and strengthening efforts to organize, guide, and manage such transfer; gradually introducing large-scale operations to these areas and, first of all, utilizing these areas' advantages in grain and cotton production by promoting large-scale comprehensive agricultural development projects; establishing a pricing system conducive to a stable increase of grain and cotton output and in line with the principle of production cost plus reasonable profit; establishing a new system for grain and cotton procurement and market in keeping with a market economy; establishing fair and reasonable relations of interests between grain and cotton producing and marketing areas; and adopting effective goverment preferential policies toward major grain and cotton production areas, mainly in terms of providing funds, loans, major scientific and technological projects, the pattern of processing industries, and foreign trade exports.
