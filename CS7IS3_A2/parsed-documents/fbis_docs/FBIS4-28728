FBIS4-28728 "dreas114_h_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Russian Dumping of Arms Surplus Alleged Russian Dumping of Arms Surplus Alleged BK1306152294 Kuala Lumpur NEW SUNDAY TIMES in English 12 Jun 94 p 2 BK1306152294 Kuala Lumpur NEW SUNDAY TIMES English BFN [By Sufi Yusoff] [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Sat -- Malaysia denied the move by Russia to sell 18 MiG-29 fighter jets was part of that country's surplus defence equipment, adding the decision to buy was after a thorough aircraft evaluation, and tough negotiations on securing the best contract. Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak also denied that Russia was going to supply the air superiority fighter planes from its air force war surplus. "What we will get will be new aircraft, and there is no question of dumping arms here to revive the so-called ailing Russian defence industry," he told the NEW SUNDAY TIMES here. "We made a thorough evaluation of the aircraft before finally deciding on the purchase for the Royal Malaysian Air Force [RMAF]," he said. The negotiations for the US$550 million (RM1,419 million) [RM -- ringgit Malaysia] deal to be paid in cash and barter involving palm oil began two years ago. Seventy five per cent of the payment would be in cash and the rest in palm oil. He was commenting on a AFP report last Thursday, quoting Russian political commentator Rustam Narzikulov as saying in the authoritive newspaper, SEVODNYA, that the June 7 contract amounted to dumping of Russian military technology on the world market. [passage omitted] Najib said Narzikulov's statement was unfair criticism especially he was not aware of the tough evaluation of the aircraft by the RMAF and the protracted negotiations. Under the contract, the RMAF had extracted a guarantee on the supply of spare parts, engine reliability and performance, integration of Soviet avionics with Western equipment, and the installation of the most advanced weapons systems. Asked if Malaysia would have problems getting spare parts if the defence industries were to close down, he said: "I cannot comment on Russia's ailing defence industry, but under the deal, the Russian Government has made a commitment to supply us with the necessary spare parts." He further said the success of the deal was as important to Malaysia as it was to Russia, and this alone would ensure they would not fumble on their contract commitments. "This is because they see Malaysia as a stepping stone for them to break into the lucrative regional arms market," he said. He added spare parts for the MiG-29s were easily available in other former Warsaw pact countries which are operating the aircraft, and India which has 60 such jets. He said the contract, which stipulated the setting up of a US$220 million (RM572 million) Technical Service Center [TSC] on a joint venture basis between the government, the aircraft manufacturer, and the Russian defence export agency, was also another strategy to ensure adequate supplies of spare parts. He said if it was economically viable, the TSC, to be set up after the arrival of the first MiG-29 next April would jointly manufacture certain aircraft components. Najib also clarified the value of the deal was closer to US$550 million, and not US$600 (RM1.56 billion) as some newspapers had reported. On the report which said Moscow chopped off US$65 million (RM169 million) from the initial price tag to clinch the deal, he said, a certain amount of "discounts" had been obtained in the process of negotiations. However, he declined to say how much. [passage omitted]
