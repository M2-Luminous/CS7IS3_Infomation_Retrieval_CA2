He noted, however, that NATO's concept - partnership for peace - should take into account the interests of all states, not only the NATO members. Grachev believes that this concept should apply not only to NATO, but also to the all-European security system and said that Russia was ready to develop cooperation with NATO on the basis of the following principles: the development of general political contacts, coordination of positions, and practical and coordinated actions. Commenting on the basic principles of Russia's military doctrine at the senators' request, Grachev stated that this document was political rather than military, and that the renunciation of the principle not to use nuclear weapons first puts it on a par with similar documents on other nuclear powers. Russia views nuclear weapons as a deterrent, not as a means of warfare, he said. He noted in this connection that the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first was at variance with this assumption. He expressed the opinion that this commitment had not been taken seriously by the west. It was viewed simply as a propaganda statement undermining the former Soviet Union's military policy, said Grachev. He remarked, however, that the former Soviet Union had no plans to deal preemptive nuclear blows on any country.
