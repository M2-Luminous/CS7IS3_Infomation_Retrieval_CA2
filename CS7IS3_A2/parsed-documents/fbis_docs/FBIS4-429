FBIS4-429 "drafr070_a_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda UN Spokesman on Efforts To Broker Cease-Fire UN Spokesman on Efforts To Broker Cease-Fire AB1104211394 London BBC World Service in English 1830 GMT 11 Apr 94 AB1104211394 London BBC World Service English BFN [From "Focus on Africa" program] [Excerpts] Fighting has continued in Rwanda today, five days after clashes first broke out in the wake of the plane crash which killed President Habyarimana. A force of RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] fighters has been advancing on the capital and fighting has also been reported between the RPF and government troops in some northern districts. [passage omitted] UNAMIR, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, has clearly had little success in brokering a cease-fire between the RPF and the government. Both the Presidential Guard and the gendarmes have been involved in clashes with the rebels. And today the United Nations began to withdraw some of its military police from the country. On the line to Kigali, Robin White asked UN spokesman (Mokthar Guei) what they have been doing to bring about a cease-fire today. [(Guei)] Well, indeed over the past five days, we have been trying to bring the two parties together to agree to a cease-fire. Our efforts are continuing, not very successul, but we have not given up any hope to bring them back to relaunch the stalled peace process. [White] Why is it you cannot stop the fighting in the capital? [(Guei)] Well, our mandate is not to impose the peace. We are here to assist. It is up to the parties to stop the fighting. [White] How much fighting is actually going on in the capital today? [(Guei)] Well, as all the other days, very intermittent. Sometimes very, very intense and sometimes very light. All types of arms, we understand, are being used: light machine guns, shellings, mortars, [words indistinct]. [White] Are you yourself beginning to get frightened? [(Guei)] I have no comment on that.
