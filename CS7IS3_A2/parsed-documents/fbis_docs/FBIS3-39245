Diez and L.R. Aizpeolea: "Gonzalez Convinced That He Can Count on Pujol's Support To Govern Through 1996"] [Text] Head of government Felipe Gonzalez is convinced he has assured the survival of his government for the next two years by obtaining a commitment from the Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition to lend its support in parliament to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in the 1995 budget battle. CiU's backing would absolutely guarantee the Socialist cabinet's staying power. In the next 10 days, with the general strike over, Felipe Gonzalez will meet with the president of the Catalonian autonomous government, Jordi Pujol, to discuss the so-called autonomy dividend. Gonzalez is confident that the Catalonians will not insist all their demands be met immediately, and that Pujol will not present them as a nonnegotiable package. CiU Spokesman Miquel Roca says the government can count on its support so long as its policies are reasonable. In private, the nationalists are more open in pledging continued support for the government, though they acknowledge some friction will be inevitable. On the socialist side, Felipe Gonzalez readily admits the vital importance of CiU's collaboration, which implies Spanish Government espousal of Catalonist policy tenets. The socialists say they are prepared for the possibility of an electoral setback in June--in the European and Andalusian elections--and will continue to concentrate on the medium-term economic recovery they confidently expect, striving above all for the [social and labor] tranquility which, with the indispensable help of the CiU, will virtually guarantee them a continued parliamentary majority. Gonzalez thinks the nationalist coalition will guarantee his government's survival at least to the end of next year, since he has a verbal promise--CiU balked at signing any document--that it will support his 1995 budget bill. Despite highly publicized indicators that the economy may be stabilizing, Gonzalez admitted in a talk with a group of journalists that the economic situation is of extraordinary gravity. By way of example and to dash any false hopes, he cited the fact that the unemployment rate is now equal to what it was in 1982. Back then, Gonzalez considered labor's plight intolerable, and he painted a grim picture of the legacy bequeathed to him by the UCD [Democratic Center Union] governments. Gonzalez notes the seriousness of the current situation and is very pleased with progress on the CiU accord, which will allow legislation to go forward. He is also pleased that the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], despite some harsh verbal exchanges, supported his investiture as prime minister, refrained from trying to amend the budget bills, and has supported labor reform. All of which is to say that the Basques of PNV have contributed with their votes, as they are wont to say these days, to those important elements of socialist policy from which in the past they had notably distanced themselves--an aloofness somewhat alleviated by the well-publicized meeting last Wednesday [19 January] between Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and PNV leader Xabier Arzalluz. The socialists have plans on the books extending as far as the end of 1995. For example, they are counting on CiU's support in that year's budget battle, though they admit there is not and will not be a written pact with the Catalonian nationalists, as the latter prefer to take one day at a time without making commitments for the future. In official statements, Miquel Roca and other leaders of his party boast that the government's survival depends on their cooperation and say their continued support will depend on the specifics of the government's policy. In private, however, they take pains to give virtual guarantees of continued collaboration so long as the socialists move forward on issues they feel are important. Furthermore, cooperation is very close in all fields and in all the ministries. As evidenced, for example, by the close collaborative ties which Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch and Transport Minister Jose Borrell maintain with CiU representatives. Friction Ahead The head of government is under no illusions; he is well aware there will be some inevitable friction with the nationalists, and among the nationalists themselves, though he does not think disputes between Convergence and its Union partners will affect CiU's relations with the central government. Ten days from now Gonzalez will be meeting with president Jordi Pujol to resume the suspended transfer process with Catalonia, which Catalonians call the "autonomy dividend." Gonzalez's initial impression is that Pujol will be moderate in his demands at this meeting and give the government a reasonable period of time to meet them. Also, leaders of the Basque government will meet next week with the minister for public administration, Jeronimo Saavedra, in an effort to renormalize relations between PNV and PSOE. At the same time, the PNV spokesman in Congress, Inaki Anasagasti, will be resuming the "democratic impetus" dialogue. Stay the Course Both in the People's Party [PP] and in United Left [IU], the idea has been gaining currency that Gonzalez will dissolve parliament next fall because of the supposedly chaotic situation that will result from the fall-off of parliamentary support, the continued rise of unemployment, and the expected drubbing of the PSOE in the European elections and the Andalusian regional elections next June. Gonzalez is aware of these prophesies and has strongly and insistently denied there is any truth to them. There will be no early elections, even in the event of an electoral debacle in June, Gonzalez insists. The government has already analyzed the unfavorable electoral environment for European incumbents regardless of ideological orientation. Opposition Laborites in Great Britain are rising in the polls against conservative John Major, and the same phenomenon is working against Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. European governments are going to lose elections, members of the Spanish cabinet say, because the wave of pessimism now sweeping the continent will result in voters casting ballots to "punish" incumbent political leaders. With this stoic hypothesis the socialists will try to endure the "bitter cup" they must drink in June and set their sights on future economic recovery. They realize, however, that even when recovery comes the opposition PP will continue to gain in strength, and Jose Maria Aznar's party is just biding its time until after the 1995 regional and municipal elections. Only then, assuming the PP meets its goal of winning in the majority of city hall races, will Aznar demand early elections. Within the PP, there are divergent views respecting when would be the opportune moment to make their big bid for power. If elections were held this October, the PP would be prepared. But the difficult economic situation frightens them, and some in the party would prefer to come to power after 1994, when the economy is on the road to recovery.
