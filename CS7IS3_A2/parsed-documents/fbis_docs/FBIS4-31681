FBIS4-31681 "dreeu114_k_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-114 Daily Report 6 May 1994 CROATIA Zagreb Linked to Attack of HSP Leaders Zagreb Linked to Attack of HSP Leaders 94BA0299A Zagreb GLOBUS in Serbo-Croatian 6 May 94 p 18 94BA0299A Zagreb GLOBUS Serbo-Croatian CSO [Interview with Anto Djapic, Croatian Rights Party vice chairman, by Vlado Vurusic at Djapic's office in the Croatian Assembly building; date not given: "`Mladen Tuta Naletilic Is Responsible for Destruction of the Mosque in Livno!'"] [Text] Anto Djapic, Assembly deputy and vice chairman of the HSP [Croatian Rights Party], who together with Karlo Varjacic, chairman of the HSP Supervisory Committee, and Velimir Kvesic, an official from party headquarters, was severely beaten on Sunday, 1 May in Siroki Brijeg, which he accuses soldiers of the controversial Herzegovinan commander Naletilic of doing, alleges in an interview with GLOBUS that Mladen Tuta Naletilic is responsible for the destruction of the mosque in Livno. Mladen Tuta Naletilic is the commander of a unit known as the "Legion of Honor." He and the semiliterate General Ivan Andabak take orders from the top leadership of so-called Herceg-Bosna, but they in turn get their orders from Zagreb: This is the Zagreb-Herzegovina vertical. The Herzegovina police has not dared even to launch an investigation into the attack on the HSP leadership. If it were not for General Roso, Herzegovina's UDBA [former Yugoslav State Security Administration] and KOS [former Yugoslav Counterintelligence Service] agents and criminals would have recommenced the war with the Muslims. The recent brutal attack on the leadership of the HSP--at a rally in Siroki Brijeg--when Karlo Varjacic (chairman of the party's Supervisory Committee), Velimir Kvesic (official from headquarters), and HSP vice chairman Anto Djapic were beaten black and blue with baseball bats, mallets, and pistol handles, has elicited a great deal of interest, especially since Djapic has said that the government of Herceg-Bosna, the Croatian state leadership, and the Croatian minister of defense are responsible for the attack. We spoke with Anto Djapic about this occurrence and about his opinion on the situation in Herceg-Bosna at his office in the Assembly building. Anto Djapic walks cautiously; the consequences of the beating are obvious.... [Vurusic] What happened at your party's rally in Siroki Brijeg? [Djapic] That was an example of an assassination attempt. One slap is enough to qualify it as that, given our position in the Assembly, let alone when the attack is carried out by 50 armed people, some of whom were in uniform. The attack was painstakingly planned and has a strong political background. I believe that an explanation of this incident is due from not only the government of so-called Herceg-Bosna, but also, and most of all, from the Croatian state leadership. If they do not speak up, that I will feel like "he who remains silent agrees with what happened." For days, we were warned by Tuta Naletilic's people not to go to Siroki Brijeg, that we could go there but that we would not leave alive, and so on. Nor does that surprise me about him. Ruffians from his unit (which, ironically, is known as the "Legion of Honor") frighten and terrorize the local population. We decided precisely for that reason to go and hold a rally there, to restore the people's hope, but we knew very well who was waiting for us there and what all could happen to us. We wanted to dispel the fear among the local population, fear that has insinuated itself into them because of the precarious conditions under which they live. [Vurusic] What is happening in Herzegovina? [Djapic] A dictatorship in power there. Especially in Siroki Brijeg. UDBA and KOS agents are still wreaking havoc. There are only two people in the government of so-called Herceg-Bosna who were not employees of those two notorious services. We arrived there as an alternative, which naturally bothered them, so they wanted to frighten us and other potential party leaders who were planning to go to Herzegovina. The situation there--and the attitude of the people toward the local authorities--is such that I have the impression that any alternative political option would win if elections were held in Herzegovina today. Herzegovina today is fertile ground for crime, smuggling, wartime profiteers.... They have arrived from all directions, and against the will of the vast majority of Herzegovinans. All the political riff-raff from the former regime has remained in power there. However, to make things worse, nothing in Herzegovina happens by accident.... The Herzegovinans are despondent!!! [Vurusic] Are the people in Herceg-Bosna opposed to implementation of the Washington agreement on a federation between the Croat and Bosniak nations? [Djapic] The people want the agreement to be implemented. This policy of various Tutas and Andabaks in so-called Herceg-Bosna represents a desire to dash the Washington agreement. Because the smugglers and criminal structures there do not want peace between Muslims and Croats; peace means that there will not longer be as much lawlessness (and you must know that some people have managed to turn over hundreds of thousands of German marks a day) and that all the facts will finally be learned, because of which they want to channel the people's dissatisfaction toward the Muslims, not toward eradicating crime of unseen proportions. They accuse us in the HSP of having come to scheme against the Washington agreement, which is ridiculous. The HSP has always advocated an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and opposed the fighting between Croats and Muslims, and that is even the core of the HSP program principles. They want to block implementation of the agreement, because it is clear to them that as soon as the federation comes to life, Tuta and his ilk will be put on trial for war crimes. They are steeped in blood and there is no turning back for them! Herzegovina is the backbone of our nation-building ideal and that is why they had to impose a reign of terror there, to compromise both the Herzegovinans and the nation-building ideal itself. They have indeed been partially successful in that, so that in some parts of Croatia a certain animosity has arisen toward Herzegovinans. We must not be duped by the tricks of a handful of UDBA and KOS agents! These people are "as thick as thieves" with Karadzic and Vucurovic, with whom they trade and smuggle.... The other 95 percent of Herzegovinans are for the agreement, democracy, and peace. [Vurusic] You said that the policy of the HR [Croat Republic of] Herceg-Bosna is being guided from Zagreb? [Djapic] Yes. But it is not that simple. Actually, our policy is turned around and refracted in Herzegovina, it is the key to the solution to our problems there. If things were put in order in the so-called HR Herceg-Bosna, if the current group of politicians were to leave, things would change in Zagreb too! We must undertake the transfiguration of Herzegovina for the sake of our own lives. The top-most state leadership in Croatia, and thus even President Tudjman, is answerable for the fact that it is not disassociating itself from these sorts of occurrences that are rocking Herzegovina. I expect both President Tudjman and Minister Susak to say something about the attack on us in Siroki Brijeg, because the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is in power there! [Vurusic] You mentioned Mladen Tuta Naletilic and Ivan Andabak as the men who ordered the attack. Why? [Djapic] Ivan Andabak is a semiliterate man with the rank of general, Naletilic is an executioner. Mladen Tuta is a so-called emigre with a dubious past and employer. I say "so-called emigre" because after the first elections many people returned who had been sent abroad by UDBA. The majority of emigres who joined the Croat government--both here and in Herzegovina--are former UDBA agents, previously infiltrated into Croatian emigree circles. Moreover, Tuta was also directly involved in the murder of our knight, HOS [Croatian Defense Force--armed wing of HSP] commander Blaze Kraljevic. He has built a house above Siroki Brijeg worth several million German marks. Where did he get that much money? He gives orders to Andabak, the leadership of so-called Herceg-Bosna gives orders to Naletilic, and they get their orders from Zagreb. This is the Zagreb-Herzegovina vertical! This Naletilic is an officer (but no gentleman) in the HVO [Croat Defense Council]. The fact that the Ministry of Defense reported the attack on us to the HVO clearly indicates their involvement. Why is the local police not saying anything--it has not even begun an investigation, much less dared to undertake anything concrete. [Vurusic] Do you think that the HVO leadership is behind the attack? Are you also accusing General Ante Roso? [Djapic] No, Gen. Roso is not connected to this. He is one of the rare people in the leadership of the so-called HR Herceg-Bosna who genuinely supports implementation of the Washington agreement. If it were not for him, these KOS and UDBA people would have already recommenced the war with the Muslims. Moreover, I think that Tuta is also responsible for the destruction of the Livno mosque 10 days ago. Tuta is the lord of Herzegovina, the lord of life and death in that region of ours. [Vurusic] You said that Naletilic and Andabak are only the executors of someone's orders? Could you be more specific and say whose orders? [Djapic] It is no secret that Tuta is a favorite of Mr. Gojko Susak! Still, I do not want to prejudice the matter. That is why I call upon the minister of defense of the RH [Republic of Croatia] to make a statement. Let him confirm or refute my suspicions. We spoke on Monday, right before the press conference. Her asked me what was going on. I told him that he was in a better position to tell me what was actually going on. And why! He had no answer for me! I will raise this question at the next session of the Assembly. I have already asked the president of the Assembly House of Representatives, Stipe Mesic, to put this subject on the agenda of the next session. [Vurusic] You always call the HR Herceg-Bosna "so-called Herceg-Bosna." How did the people attending your rallies throughout Herzegovina react to that? [Djapic] Our rallies in Tomislavgrad and Grude were extraordinary, well-attended, and we got an exceptionally warm reception. The people know our positions, they know that we support the Washington agreement. It is a little ridiculous that we, as an opposition party, have to go around Herzegovina promoting the agreement that Tudjman signed while his people attack and kick us. Moreover, why would the prefix "so-called" offend them? Since the Washington agreement the HR Herceg-Bosna has no longer existed, there are only cantons or zupas and velezupas. They signed the Washington agreement that abolishes this entity, and now they are acting as if it still exists. It is ridiculous that we from the HSP are working on promoting the Washington agreement, instead of Vukojevic or Milas, and the so-called HDZ right wing. But ultimately we must ask ourselves: Is the Washington agreement Croatian state policy? I hope that it is, but after everything that has happened to us I am beginning to doubt that. But we were there and we will go back. Our rally in Siroki Brijeg was not finished, and I am someone who finishes all his business. We have to go down there without fear, even if it means getting hurt. Because I know that they will not stop at beating us. We must not lose Herzegovina! Let Budisa and Racan go to Herzegovina, if necessary--at the same time! We must show that there is an alternative, that democracy and a multiparty system must ultimately come there too. At the rally, I managed to say: "Gentlemen, we have come here to show you that we are not afraid. We have shown that we are even willing to die for the Independent State of Croatia." We cannot open fire on Croats, even though they wanted to provoke us into doing that. [Vurusic] You have brought up the suspicion that Minister of Defense Gojko Susak is behind the attack on you and your party colleagues. However, in the Assembly you recently defending him when the opposition sought his dismissal because of the explosion in Duboki Jarak. [Djapic] I said that he is responsible until he makes a statement. That is disinformation by news commentators, including yours at GLOBUS. This is a question of principle. The opposition must unite around key questions, not around less important ones. [Vurusic] There are reports that now, after the split in the HDZ and the departure of Stipe Mesic and Josip Manolic from the party, the HSP will become a coalition partner of the HDZ, because you are close to its right wing, which is now in the majority.... [Djapic] That is fantasy. Moreover, I no longer even know what the HDZ is. We have a neutral stance toward the conflict within the HDZ. [Vurusic] Do you think that the Washington agreement is in danger and that the fighting between Croats and Muslims could resume? [Djapic] I am afraid that that could happen. The people in power in Herceg-Bosna are the same ones who initiated the fighting. Because of their whims, our young people perished at Vakuf and Vitez, instead of fighting the Serbs with our combined forces, instead of defending the corridor, which was closed. What would there be of so-called Krajina and the so-called republic of Srpska today if the corridor had remained in our hands? We would be at the Drina today! The bombing of the mosque in Livno and the attack on us, as representatives of a party that has supported the alliance with the Muslims the whole time, is the best indication of how much individual leaders of so-called Herceg-Bosna do not want the Washington agreement to succeed.... They are defending their positions, not the position of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are thwarting the multiparty system in Herzegovina! But they will not halt the arrival of democracy to Herzegovina with one beating. We must settle scores with this gang. The entire government of so-called Herceg-Bosna is responsible for this situation. [Vurusic] Does the thing that is conditionally called the Herzegovinan lobby exist? [Djapic] I do not believe such reports. That is an erroneous expression, which compromises Herzegovina. The leadership of the HDZ is behind the attack on us, the ones who formulate policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because we are their stained conscience. If they are for the Washington agreement, why not dismiss those people who are undermining it? Or rather, why does Tudjman not go to Herzegovina to promote the agreement? That would reassure the local population, which is not guilty of anything, but is living in fear. I would clip the wings of that gang of criminals that is in power. The government of so-called Herceg-Bosna was not able to prevent the bombing of the Livno mosque, but it was able to prevent--in hooligan fashion--our rally in Siroki Brijeg. We have had enough of the Herzegovinans paying the price of flawed policies, lost wars, suffering at Bleiburg. We do not need another Bleiburg!
