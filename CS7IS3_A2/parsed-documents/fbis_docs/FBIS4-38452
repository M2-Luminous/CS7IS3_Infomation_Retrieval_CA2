Georgia celebrated this holiday as befits a state and a military parade was also held. We can recall heated arguments just before 26 May. Some people expressed the opinion that defeated troops should not hold a parade. However, it was not merely a parade of defeated or victorious troops; it was a celebration of the 26 May holiday with a military parade. The parade was eventually held, as well as numerous other fetes which you also attended. How necessary do you think it was to celebrate this day in this way? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Now that we have an opportunity to analyze everything that occurred in the past days pertaining to 26 May, I believe the authorities' decision to hold a parade has proved to be right. One often encounters the view that we do not have a sense of statehood, and we also hear many other nihilistic remarks about our country, our state, our independence, and so on. This sort of celebration was necessary simply in order to demonstrate to the world not only that we have a sense of statehood and realize the necessity to build our statehood, but also the fact that appropriate structures and attributes have already been created. This was necessary to prove the above and in order that the people could see what had already been done. You are well aware that many opponents were categorically opposed to holding the parade for understandable reasons. Some, I suppose, intended to hold a grandiose antigovernment and antistate rally, or, rather, rallies directed against the authorities; naturally, this parade and other fetes would frustrate their plans. They were probably afraid that the rallies they had planned could lose their grandeur. Nothing terrible has happened. The parade has been held. The people have celebrated the day. The rallies were also held. Let the people judge which was more significant. The idea that defeated troops never hold parades is wrong and even harmful. The people, even defeated people, restore their strength, build an army, and establish a police force, and the authorities support the people in this great deed. All of this is a guarantee of success in building a state. [passage omitted] Just before the 26 May holiday, I signed a few documents, later discussed by the Cabinet of Ministers, about speeding up the process of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The documents stipulate active participation in this process of the enterprises' employees, including their managers. All provisions will be given finishing touches. All this will be published in the press, and the printing of vouchers for the purchase of shares will be speeded up. The idea is that members of labor collectives, their managers, and the corps of managers, as well as each citizen of the republic, will become actual proprietors. They will not be big owners, but each citizen will have a definite share in the wealth created in the country over the past decades. Provided the wealth expands, the citizen's property will also become more significant. I would also like to support an initiative launched by the Georgian savings bank and its newly appointed president, Mr. Chkhartishvili. He is a brilliant young man with a very good way of thinking, and he has started his job very well. In accordance with this initiative, every depositor -- and there are many thousands of them -- will become a shareholder, in effect one of the owners of the bank. Yesterday, I decided to support a request to reduce the state's share, which is very big and comprises dozen of billions [unit not specified], and the sum will actually be distributed among the shareholders. [passage omitted] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, on 25 May up to 40 political and social organizations signed a declaration of national accord and unity. It was a document you called for at the meeting of the board of the Union of Georgia's Citizens on your return from a Moscow summit of the CIS countries on 16 April. The board consented and the response was very good. Apart from its symbolic significance of this, do you think there are any prospects of real unity, as you said after the parade when you quoted a verse by Galaktion [Galaktion Tabidze, a Georgian poet] calling for unity? [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] I would say that this lays a foundation for future deeds. Some will join the movement, others will probably dissociate themselves from it. However, the movement for unity and integrity and the apprehension of responsibilities for the state will take deeper roots among our people and in the country generally. Like many citizens of our country, I am categorically opposed to an unhealthy politicization of the community. However, I will support politicization if it means that politics is associated with the idea of statehood, with a concern for the state, with tasks of building the state. In this respect, the declaration is undoubtedly a step forward in the sense that it fosters concern for the state and its building and helps unite all forces. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the topic of Abkhazia was in the air last week. We know that a working team led by Lieutenant General [Aleksandr] Sokolov arrived from Moscow to study issues regarding the stationing of peacekeeping forces. Have any practical steps been taken in this respect? [Shevardnadze] I am still reluctant to speak of details. However, it was a necessary and useful meeting. I am reluctant to speak about any details because the UN Security Council resolution on the issue is to be made public this week. The resolution is to be passed this week. Thus far, the Security Council has not passed a resolution consenting to the deployment of peacekeeping forces and extending the role of UN observers and their new mandate. This issue, I mean a draft resolution, is also being considered by the heads of CIS countries. The draft has been distributed, and I have received my copy. That is natural, because it was initiated at my request. The Russian president, Mr. Yeltsin, has sent the draft to the heads of all states. As far as I know, the first response is positive and an adequate resolution may be passed. In fact, almost everything is being prepared, everything is done to secure the earliest possible beginning of a peacekeeping operation. However, as I have already said, it will take a certain time to make a political decision. It may take several days or one or two weeks. After the decision is made, almost everything will be ready for starting a stage-by-stage peacekeeping operation. This is what we have recently been considering in Tbilisi with Mr. Sokolov and others. I would also like to say that people should not imagine that the return of refugees to their homes will happen like this: that one day all bridges will be opened and 250,000 or 300,000 people will return simultaneously. This is unbelievable. This is impossible. An enormous amount of preparatory work will have to be done. I will sign an edict in this connection later today. The beginning of the process is approaching and a great deal of preparatory work has to be done. There is no doubt that the refugees will return to ravaged and destroyed properties. Nothing has been sown there; nothing has been looked after. One can say, if you will, that life will have to start from the very beginning. How can this be accomplished? What resources are available in the country? Who will help us? How can we help each family and each refugee? All these questions are causing great concern. On their return, the refugees should be given a minimum of essentials required for their existence and work -- I mean bread, fuel, building materials, and fundamental things to enable a person to come back and start work. We will have to do all this. [Oniani] Thank you. A tragic event occurred in Ingushetia last week: eight Georgian specialists were killed, or rather slaughtered. In addition, this was done in the territory of the people with whom Georgia has always had warm, good, and really neighborly and friendly relations. Do you think this crime had a political aim? I realize that it is difficult to speak of this until the investigation is completed. [Shevardnadze] I would say that we have had an exceptionally friendly and fraternal relationship with the president of Ingushetia and the Ingush people, like many other peoples, for instance, the peoples of Dagestan or North Ossetia. Although our relations with North Ossetia have lately become complicated, we used to have really magnificent relations. Well, this is the truth with almost all peoples. However, our relations with the Ingush people have been remarkable for decades and even for centuries. I have to tell you that the Ingushs have intense feelings about the tragedy similar to those we experience here in Georgia. Some sequences have been shown on our television. It goes without saying, first of all, that I would like to express my sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased. The road that is being built should by all means be built, and it will be named after them. The bridge linking the two peoples will undoubtedly be linked with their names. Whoever committed this savage act naturally intended to ruin Georgia's relations with someone, to ruin Ingushetia's relations with someone, to ruin Ingush-Georgian relations. Perhaps they intended to obstruct the process of improving Georgian-Ossetian relations, or to hinder the ongoing development of contacts with Dagestan, North Ossetia, and other republics -- and with Russia in general. This was a provocative plan. However, I would like to reiterate that whoever the executioners were, whichever nation they represented, terrorists remain terrorists. We will never identify them with the people in general, and I am convinced that this event will exert no influence on our friendship with the Ingush people and with other peoples, and we will do our best to build new relations with the peoples of Caucasia, especially North Caucasia, on the basis of what is called the best age-old traditions of friendship and fraternity. [Oniani] Finally, Batono Eduard, in your address dedicated to 26 May -- which was entitled: We will build a new independent democratic Georgia -- you said: I would not say that the world has been currently divided into spheres of influence between superpowers, the giants of East and West. However, one thing is clear, that when the sun shines, a shadow is cast somewhere on the earth. This is definitely natural for every region. How about Georgia? [Shevardnadze] This will undoubtedly lead us to the question of where the sun rises. This is a figure of speech, of course. In the language of politicians, this means a balance of interests. The share of various countries in the balance of interests differs. Its volume and its extent differ. Russia is not the only country with which Georgia has a balance of interests. We have a balance of interests with other countries too. Turkey has interests in our country, and we have interests in Turkey. The same is true of Iran, of other neighbors, and of other countries, say the West, say the United States of America and so on. Since Russia has always been considered the most interested party, I can say that Russia really has definite interests in Georgia. I do not conceal this, neither does President Yeltsin. He has said so. Nor do we conceal that Georgia has even more interests in Russia. Thus, a shadow falls not only in Georgia but also in Russia. The same can be said about other countries. We should speak less about spheres of influence and more about a balance of interests, a proportionateness of interests, and a compatibility of interests with processes taking place in the world. Thus, when speaking about spheres of interests we have to consider that this sounds different today. This is not a post-World War II or a post-World War I period; nor is it a situation similar to that in past centuries, when this was an established practice. Nowadays, the approach is a little different. [Oniani] Thank you very much.
