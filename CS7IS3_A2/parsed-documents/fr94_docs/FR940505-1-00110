FR940505-1-00110 FR940505-1-00012 If the state and local agencies are able to identify and adopt measures which effectively lower the rate of VMT growth from what is currently projected, then EPA could entertain the removal of certain FIP measures which impose the most stringent controls. EPA invites public comment on which of the FIP measures might be a candidate for earlier removal. State and local action now on measures to reduce growth will also make it easier in the long term to replace the bulk of the FIP with a State Implementation Plan, since there will be more flexibility for the state to choose an optimum set of measures. Although the FIP contains an attainment strategy for the South Coast area, it does not contain the fully adopted regulations that will ultimately be needed. In fact, attainment there will clearly require at least all the elements proposed today or their equivalents. EPA does not envision an adjustment process for that area although the flexibility that lower growth provides would still hold true. Also, because of the limited time before 1999, EPA does not think it would be possible to revisit VMT growth in the Sacramento area soon enough to affect the strategy for the 1999 attainment option. It is a requirement of the Clean Air Act that every SIP and FIP attain as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the date specified by statute. In any VMT revisitation and strategy adjustment process, EPA could not and would not remove reasonably available measures from the FIPs. EPA believes, however, that some of the measures proposed today and likely to be finalized go beyond the test of reasonable availability. These are candidates for later removal as described here. 2. Programs for Onroad Light Duty Vehicles and Engines. a. Overview_Despite requiring vehicles to meet increasingly rigorous certification standards, California's air quality is among the poorest in the country. High emission levels have persisted even though emission standards for light-duty vehicle (i.e., passenger cars) (LDV) and light duty truck (LDT) exhaust hydrocarbon emissions have dropped more than 90 percent since 1970. The continuing high emissions derive from considerable increases in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), the increased expected life of vehicles in the temperate California climate and the failure of many in-use vehicles to meet the standards to which they are certified when new. In order to reduce the emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources, EPA has developed two distinct control strategies. The first strategy, described in detail in section III.D.2.c, is the implementation of a centralized test only enhanced I/M program. In the second strategy, described in section III.D.2.d, EPA is proposing to complement the California LEV program with enforceable requirements providing lower in-use emission levels. EPA believes that both of these strategies are necessary in order to bring all of the California FIP areas into compliance.
