The Rukh faction in the parliament has now been reduced from 60 to 28 persons, the Democratic Party went from 30 down to 5 persons, and only the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] maintained a stable number of 9 persons. However, the left-wingers are celebrating a clear victory. Whereas in the old parliament the left-wing portion of the political spectrum was represented by the ideologically vague "Group 239," nowadays we have 118 precisely oriented party deputies (from the KPU [Communist Party of Ukraine], SPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine], and SelPU [Peasants' Party of Ukraine]) plus an unknown number of non-party persons. Having received a push in the Donets Basin, the left-wing wave rolled all the way to Kiev, where--even though an absolute majority of the voters did cast their ballots for the democrats--only 5 of their deputies out of 23 were elected. The reasons why the National Democrats lost at least 16 seats in the capital have become evident following an analysis of the results of the second round of balloting. In Kiev elections took place only in those districts where there were political contests between candidates. In those places where two representatives of the National Democracy were contesting a seat, or where democrats were running against members of the UNA [Ukrainian Assembly] the left-wing voters ignored the elections. The split between the "Ukrayina" bloc, which includes Rukh pro forma, and Rukh itself, which decided to play its own election game--placing the party principle above all else--together with a 50-percent rate of visiting election wards, worked to the advantage of the communists' successful tactics with regard to disrupting the elections. The great amounts of money spent by Rukh in printing up posters with pictures of its candidates in the second round of balloting (candidates which the people called the "blue team" because of the color of the paper used) and on distributing them by the state services did not justify themselves: In 21 districts only 3 Rukh persons were elected, and--judging by the political circumstances--they would have won anyway, even without the above-mentioned posters (their opponents were communists). The struggle for Kiev's seats will be continued in the runoff elections, which--most likely--will be held in the autumn. The National Democrats in the new parliament will attempt to alter the electoral law in such a way as to reduce the 50-percent barrier of voter attendance and the 25-percent quota for determining a winner. The left-wing faction--not being interested in the Kiev representation--will act as quickly as possible to prevent changes in the above-mentioned law, basing their arguments on the position that a precedent must not be allowed whereby a single Supreme Council is to be elected by two different legislative norms. Therefore, unless Rukh revises its principle of "One's own party is closest to one's own skin" prior to the runoff elections, we can anticipate a new disruption of the elections in Kiev. And that would mean a new victory for the communists' tactics. The National Democratic leaders' habit of palming off their defeats as victories (in the case of the past elections as well as in the case of their unsuccessful attempt to conduct a referendum on a pre-term re-election of the parliament in December 1992) could play a bad joke on them and on the entire state. The communists evidently will strive to reinforce their own success and will press for holding the presidential elections also on 26 June. They will either put up their own candidate or else support Kuchma's candidacy for the post of chief of state. But if these elections do not take place, or if a president is not elected (realistically speaking, the candidacies of Kravchuk, Plyushch, and Kuchma have approximately equal chances, whereas the candidacies of Chornovol, Lukyanenko, and Yukhnovskyy cannot be viewed as serious), this will provide grounds for the left-wing faction to attempt to abolish the post of president. Without a doubt, the communists--together with their left-wing allies and the Kuchma-Hrynyov faction--will bring up the question of forming an economic and political union with Russia and federalizing Ukraine. A hundred deputies from the non-party "party of power" will obviously support them because they lean toward whatever side is the strongest. The "struggle for the party of power," which has been proclaimed by the Rukh leaders, seems to be lost ahead of time. The results of the 1994 elections signify not only a communist revenge; they also threaten the very existence of the Ukrainian state. And--analogously to this--the fact that the new parliament has lasted for three or four years, despite numerous attempts to overthrow it. The tactics of the National Democracy have failed utterly, and it is extremely important that its leaders come to understand and acknowledge this. And they must revise the strategy of their own political activities in accordance with this. For one can be a radical, a liberal, a fighter for justice, as well as a buffoon on the political stage; but to leave power in alien hands is dangerous for Ukraine and for its citizens. Nor do childish games in the "blue team" and lists of candidates from variegated parties create grounds for anticipating that power will someday pass into the democrats' hands.
