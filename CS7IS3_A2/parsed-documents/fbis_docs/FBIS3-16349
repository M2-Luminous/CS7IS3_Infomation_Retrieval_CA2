Signature to Memorandum -- Society Will Finally See Who Is Interested in a Political Breathing Space, Who Does Not Want To Reach Agreement, and Who Violates the Accords"] [Text] President Yeltsin had a meeting in the Kremlin with representatives of parties, political movements, the parliament, and the government on the subject of preparing a draft memorandum on civil peace and accord. An idea that arose as a result of the emotional events of late February and early March connected with the political amnesty has thus begun to acquire organizational dimensions. Boris Yeltsin believes the draft document may be ready in two weeks. We would remind you that the package of amnesty documents which the State Duma adopted 23 February included the "Memorandum of Accord," which spoke of the need to exclude violence from political life. However, statements by one body -- even one as prestigious as the State Duma -- are patently not enough to secure civil peace. Accord presupposes agreement among all parties to the political process -- the authorities, the social forces and their leaders, who should probably also encompass those people who today more than anything generate suspicions regarding the intention to or possibility of destabilizing the country's political life. That was why the president started off the process of preparing the memorandum, which is designed to be the means of maintaining tranquillity. The plan is for the document to be signed by as many political parties and movements as possible. However, can a document -- even such a reputable and representative document -- prevent the country slipping into chaos? Hardly. A memorandum is not a law, it is a political statement of intent. Everything depends on whether the country's leading political and social forces with influence among the masses really intend to do everything they can to maintain civil peace, or whether for some people this is nothing more than a tactical maneuver. Whether people who disagree with the reform course, as well as its supporters, are really prepared to use constitutional and legal means and methods alone in their political campaigning. And, last, whether politicians are ready to renounce for a while quite legal but "drastic" and therefore dangerous methods (rallies, demonstrations, strikes) that may capsize the ship of state. In order to ensure that the memorandum does not become just another piece of paper without any real force, I believe that these intentions should be announced in public before the agreement is signed -- after they have been seriously and thoroughly discussed by all structures in society. Signatures to the memorandum will only mean something once these signatures are backed up not just by leaders' personal aspirations but the clearly expressed will of political and social groups large and small. Definite steps and statements on the part of the president and the government would probably also not be superfluous to the achievement of trust: Stability in society does not only depend on political leaders' activeness but also on the actions taken by the authorities, their readiness to heed public opinion, take a calm view of dissent, and cooperate constructively with all social structures. Needless to say, no one will provide absolute guarantees that, first, all significant forces involved in the political process will want to subscribe to the memorandum and, second, that even if they do sign, they will not breach the agreement. But even in that case the idea of a memorandum has one plus going for it -- its visibility [naglyadnost]. A social contract primarily means the redistribution of responsibility. Social structures voluntarily assume some of the duties of maintaining social peace in the common interest. But that does not mean that the state authority can thus shift its responsibility onto society's shoulders. The memorandum on civil peace and accord may indicate to the authorities whether they are capable, in conditions of a political breathing space, of creating a material base for real and not just "agreed" political stability -- primarily to stabilize the economy, curb crime, and limit bureaucratic tyranny. Society is getting a chance to test not only the strength of its own influence but also the real strength of the authorities -- the extent of its competence, political will, reformist potential, and responsibility to the country's citizens.
