At the meeting, the NSC reviewed and assessed the security and public order situation in the country in general and the domestic and foreign developments that affect it. It determined that the successful results being obtained in the struggle against separatist terrorism, and that the support our people give our security forces in this struggle, increases daily. The NSC also determined that, faced with the heavy losses incurred by the separatist organization recently, surrender would be beneficial for our youths who have been used as tools in this adventure against the unity of our country. The NSC decided to recommend to the government to continue with economic and social measures in parallel with antiterrorist efforts in the area. 2. Considering the need for existing measures and for the exercise of authority, the NSC unanimously decided to extend the state of emergency currently in effect in Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and Van by another four months as of 1700 on 13 July 1994.
