FR940127-0-00021 FR940127-0-00004 Although it may not have been clear from the proposal, the requirement that a loan not be 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status was intended to be an ongoing test that would have to be met at the time a multifamily housing loan was placed in the 50 percent risk weight category and thereafter. The FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines currently contain the same ongoing requirement for one-to-four family residential mortgages to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. In contrast, the statutory requirement that timely contractual principal and interest payments must have occurred for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan can qualify for a 50 percent risk weight is a one-time requirement. To eliminate confusion, the final rule separately lists these two eligibility criteria and clarifies that timely payments must have been made for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan is placed in the 50 percent risk weight category. Prudent Underwriting Standards The proposal's final eligibility criterion required the multifamily housing loan to have been made ``in accordance with applicable lending limits and other prudent underwriting standards.'' Two commenters asked what was meant by ``prudent underwriting standards.'' Guidance for prudent real estate loan underwriting standards is outlined in appendix A to part 365 of the FDIC's rules and regulations, ``Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies'' (12 CFR part 365, appendix A), which was adopted by the FDIC in October 1992 (57 FR 62896, December 31, 1992). A third commenter suggested that this criterion was unnecessary and that it should go without saying that a bank should comply with applicable lending limits. This commenter also questioned why lending limits were singled out in this criterion when compliance with many other statutory and regulatory requirements is expected during the underwriting of a loan. The FDIC has deleted the specific reference to lending limits in the final rule. Optional Nature of Lower Risk Weight One commenter who supported the proposal nonetheless requested that the FDIC ensure that banks are aware that, under the final rule, they have the option of assigning multifamily housing loans that meet the criteria specified in the rule to the 50 percent risk weight or continuing to treat such loans as 100 percent risk weight assets. One of the commenters who opposed the proposal did so because the cost associated with substantiating that a multifamily housing loan was eligible to be placed in the 50 percent risk weight category would exceed the benefit of the lower risk weight.
