The axe will inevitably fall on the grossly inefficient public sector, the sick industry and inefficient state power boards, Congress economic policy resolution adopted by the AICC here declared. There will be more reform as the people want more reform, and these will have to travel down to the district level. Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar led the Government's defence of its economic policiers while participating in the debate on the economic resolution . The resolution was later passed after a four-hour debate. Role of the Government in the new environment already stands transformed, the Congress document stated. The State will gradually shift out of industry and trade in order to concentrate on education, rural, development, and healthcare, the party resolution said in what is a complete and clean break from the baggage of socialist ideology. This, as the party bosses including N D Tiwari and Pranab Mukherjee who opened the debate on the economic policy stated, was the essence of the middle path advocated by Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao in his Davos speech earlier this year. The middle path meant unleashing the economy, with the Government assuming the responsibility of social tasks. Launching a veiled attack on the public sector, Congress declared that "social obligations are best met when public enterprises make profits, and not losses." Taxpayers had invested Rs 140,000 crore in the Central public sector, while returns are less than Rs 300 crore per year. Government would have to give the highest priority to "technological, organisational, and managerial restructuring of the public sector so that it operates commercially in a businesslike manner.' Rarlgarajan anl Goswarni committee reports on the restructuring of the public sector must be implemented. In similar vein, Congress has cracked the whip on inefficient state electricity boards.
