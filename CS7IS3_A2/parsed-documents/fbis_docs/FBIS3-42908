Chernomyrdin-Yeltsin, Or Look Who Just Arrived"] [Text] Carte blanche. And so many hours of conversation between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin about the composition of the new government ended with the withdrawal from the game of key "market" figures, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, and the destruction of the president's last stronghold in the government. Since that day one can say that the prime minister quietly but openly removed himself from the president's chain of command and began to move in his own autonomous orbit which is aimed, quite obviously, toward a future presidency. The prime minister's new inner circle must clear a starting space for this. And so we know who left. Who came to replace them? Individuals who are personally devoted to Chernomyrdin, especially trusted figures. Oleg Soskovets. Completely "his"--only such a person can be trusted with the distribution of quotas for preferential government credit. In other words--quotas for the approach to the government by large and medium-sized financial and commercial structures. Yuriy Yarov--a fairly good person and a convenient one since he holds no position or real power in the government. Yuriy Shafranik--a nominee from the petroleum and gas complex and thus by virtue of his mentality he has also fallen from the common "nest." These people can always reach agreement among themselves. But this government will not conquer inflation, instability, or the decline of production. With the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov, on whom it was possible to place the blame, these economic troubles will be linked in the public consciousness to the name of Chernomyrdin personally. But the prime minister does not want to bear all the responsibility for his failures. Thus in the government Aleksandr Shokhin will become minister of economics. He is a figure of a somewhat different level from that of Gaydar or Fedorov but he is suitable as another lightning rod. In this group the appointment of Anatoliy Chubays remains something of a mystery--he is the only figure among the top individuals of the current cabinet who is formally supported by the president. But if we look carefully we will see that he is assigned the role of embodying the failure of privatization. Quite reliable rumors have already been leaked to the press and television: Behind the facade of loud and tasteless advertising of innumerable age-old investment funds was concealed financial impotence, if not out-and-out swindling. They were incapable of paying solid dividends to the investors, and soon their secret will be told. The failure of checkbook privatization and the collapse of the majority of so-called investment funds will be linked to the name of Chubays. This spot will not stain Chernomyrdin--again far-sightedly and adroitly he sidestepped the president: Chubays was appointed by a personal edict of the president "in excess of the established limit of deputy prime ministers." Chernomyrdin has nothing to do with this. There are also lesser figures in Chernomyrdin's inner circle. As though always in the shadows, they nonetheless do important work for advancing him toward his goal. Vladimir Kvasov. One of the strongest apparatchiks who, possibly, will become the driving force the future election campaign. "Temporarily assigned" by the prime minister as a deputy to the Federal Assembly, Kvasov then, by an edict from the president, will also become a minister. Chernomyrdin adroitly placed this figure in the field, while successfully working on both flanks--the legislative and the apparatus. Gennadiy Petelin is a personally devoted person, the leader of the secretariat, and he can do a great deal to bring the candidate for the presidential office closer to influential industrial and financial groups. Valentin Sergeyev. An unsinkable bureaucrat who came from journalism. He is now a cabinet member in Chernomyrdin's government. A commander without an army. A minister of information without a ministry, but with delicate functions: to coordinate the work for creating the image of the future president. A Chernomyrdin Party? On whom besides his inner circle can Chernomyrdin rely in such far-reaching plans? On the one hand, on the industrialists with whom he is literally "blood brothers." On the other hand there is indirect information that the prime minister is also supported by other large new financial and commercial structures. But with the foresight typical of such significant organizations this support, of course, is not given unconditionally. It is, as it were, based on the concrete situation, depending on where the new government policy leads. But for now Chernomyrdin, playing on the interests of national industry and large Russian banking structures (where he parts company with his partner--the country's chief banker, Viktor Gerashchenko, and this will be discussed below), is actively preparing for the battle for the presidency. Judging from certain symptoms, we will soon witness the birth of a new party--the Chernomyrdin party. It is possible to predict with a good deal of certainty that it will consist of two different blocs. On the one hand--political structures of the regionals being created today by Sergey Shakhray. With them the prime minister obviously has a personal agreement on positions in the '96 elections. On the other hand there is a certain absolutely controllable bloc of industrialists in parliament, which is now being organized with the direct participation and coordination of Chernomyrdin's staff. Skokov-Chernomyrdin The poignancy of the situation consists in that most likely Chernomyrdin achieved the formation of a large faction of his like-thinkers in the party and the overt assistance from Shakhray's party with the president's consent, finding some convincing arguments for this. But the outcome is obvious: As a result of these efforts, fairly strong groups have been created which are in political opposition to the current president. It is worth noting that in order to achieve his goal Chernomyrdin selects people with a great deal of political ambition. Following his logic he is entering into an unambiguous political game with Yuriy Skokov. It is difficult to imagine that these contacts were not sanctioned by the president. But the motives for returning Skokov to the political arena presented to the president might very well be one thing (for example, the need for tactical concessions), and the real intentions for whose sake some time ago Chernomyrdin spoke with Skokov for several hours--are quite a different thing. We do not know whether they agreed upon the conditions under which the parties would coordinate actions in the '96 elections. But a step toward interaction between the prime minister and a person who is known for his haughty and condescending attitude toward the president has already been taken. Let us repeat: All the aforementioned steps are apparently being taken with the president's consent. But is he aware of how cleverly he is being "led"? Does he notice how quickly the opposition to himself is being reinforced? A special role in this sly game belongs to the team of Chernomyrdin-Gerashchenko. The country's chief banker was advanced to this key post by Chernomyrdin. The prime minister has protected him from being ousted several times during the past year. This concern is no accident: Both of them protect domestic industry, the military complex, and former state banks. But they play on differences of opinion in one fundamental issue. Gerashchenko, in spite of economic logic and decisions of the higher authorities, with inexplicable persistence is doing everything possible to bring foreign banks to our country. His partner in the game opposes him. Nonetheless it is clear that in reality both today and in the future this is a very solid team. Well, in 1996 (or perhaps much sooner?) history will show how this game of solitaire plays out in the corridors of Russian power.
