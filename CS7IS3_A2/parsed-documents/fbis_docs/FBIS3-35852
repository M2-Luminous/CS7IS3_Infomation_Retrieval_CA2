There is the widespread opinion that this document has decisive importance for our state and conforms to the goals of its policy and people's hopes. Are there different opinions on this issue? Scientists from the Academy of Sciences Institute of Semiconductors received an answer to this and many other questions at a meeting with Ukrainian People's Deputies Yuriy Kostenko and Ivan Zayets. Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's minister of ecology and head of the Committee for Issues of Nuclear Disarmament, outlining his position on the tripartite agreement, emphasized that one should have proceeded on the path to nuclear disarmament gradually. What happened in Moscow did not comply with the interests of our state. Explaining his viewpoint, People's Deputy Yuriy Kostenko recalled certain facts. In particular, he said that there are no nuclear warheads which have surpassed their predetermined shelf life. The majority of them will expire in the year 2005. The terms of payments for nuclear weapons cannot satisfy us. The tactical nuclear weapons which were transferred to Russia contained 90 tonnes of highly enriched uranium and 10 tonnes of plutonium. Estimating that 1 kg of uranium costs $100,000 and 1 kg of plutonium -- $1 million, Russia's debt for our nuclear components exceeds our debt for energy sources. In the opinion of Yuriy Kostenko, the widespread belief that we would have ended up in complete isolation if we had not signed the documents on nuclear disarmament are not true. While proceeding on the path to nonnuclear status, we should have concentrated our efforts on accelerating economic reforms. The same opinion was voiced by Ivan Zayets, head of the Kiev branch of Rukh, who dwelled on ways of reforming the executive branch. He appealed to the participants for voting for politicians who endorse the interests of an independent Ukraine. Listening to the people's deputies, I recalled something my grandmother would say when somebody failed to complete his work: "She could cook, but she could not serve." Having cooked a nuclear dish, we probably did not serve it well at the tripartite meeting's table.
