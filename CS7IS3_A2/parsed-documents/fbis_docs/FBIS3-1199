Announced by a UN spokesman, the postponement, for which no explanation was given, put the future of UN-sponsored talks in Nairobi into jeopardy. It was the second delay in the meeting, which had originally been planned for last Sunday [20 March] before this too was canceled at the last moment. On Monday, the UN spokesman had high hopes for the planned ceremony, saying it represented a major step forward for Somalia and he was certain it would go ahead. The faction leaders, including bitter rivals Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, have been engaged in talks in Nairobi for the last eight days.
