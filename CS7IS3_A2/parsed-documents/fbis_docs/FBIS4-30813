Karadzic was speaking at the founding assembly of the SDS Municipal Committee in Subotica today. Bogoljub Zelen was elected the committee's first chairman. The founding assembly was attended by Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the SDS Executive Committee, and numerous guests from town in Vojvodina where branches of this party already exist. [passage omitted] Speaking about the republic of Srpska and the current situation, Karadzic said that during the coming talks "part of the territories will have to be ceded, but either the Srpska Assembly or the people at a referendum will decide which ones and how many." When the war is over the Serb people will have the least reasons to feel ashamed. Many crimes they did not commit have been attributed to them. Everyone knows who committed them and when and which units were involved, said Karadzic who spent three and a half hours in a packed hall of the Open University replying to numerous questions about the organization of a future state and the ties between the republic of Srpska and Serbia.
