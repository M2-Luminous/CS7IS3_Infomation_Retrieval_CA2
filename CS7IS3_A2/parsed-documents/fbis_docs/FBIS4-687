According to the CP, the new constitution does not recognize the Holy Trinity, making other gods equal with the Almighty God. References to Christian values which have been removed from the constitution, will make South Africa a totally secular state. 2. This election is the final process of the handing over of power which has been initiated by the communists through war, terror, negotiations and peace accords. Participation in the communist-dominated transitional structures will tantamount to the recognition of all these illegal structures, and the participation in them by the Boer-Afrikaner nation. 3. If the CP participates in the election, it will be forced to recognize the result and other constitutional elements such as the flag. 4. The so-called amendments effected fail to bring us even a step closer to obtaining a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. They will in fact only speed up the reality of unitary state. A volkstaat is therefore out of the question. 5. The election will in no way be free and fair. Large-scale irregularities in the registration of voters are taking place as no control whatsoever exists. 6. The ANC-controlled SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV is being unashamedly exploited for propaganda by the National Party-ANC conspiracy. According to the CP, the election is nothing else but the paving of the way for the coming of an atheist, communist ANC government in the country. The CP added that the Afrikaner nation, with the traditionally bound Zulu nation, could never take part in the election. Those who participate will be associating themselves with this highly unacceptable situation in our fatherland.
