Asked if there had been any fiddling Mr. Kinnock, who is leading some 20 British parliamentarians acting as monitors and observers, said: "We have seen no evidence. Any problems have been inadvertent problems of distance or supply or simply inexperience. There has been no attempt by any of the parties to interfere in any malign way with voting procedures." Mr. Kinnock, whose group has visited 19 polling stations over several hundred square miles, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that an extension of voting to midnight tonight would be very sensible.
