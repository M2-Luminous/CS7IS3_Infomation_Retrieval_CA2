The small engine "4J" for China and Thailand that is being produced at the Fujisawa plant (Fujisawa city) will be boosted in May from the current 20,000 units a month to 30,000 units. The company is starting process production of the midsized engine "4H" at the Tochigi plant (Ohira Machi) beginning this spring. They are increasing engine production capability and preparing to expand overseas business and make full-scale the engine supply business to other companies at home. The "4J" is a small engine with a displacement of 3100 cc that is carried in small trucks with a load capacity of 1.5 to 2 tons. The increased production portion chiefly will be exported to the China joint venture, Jiangling 50 Ling Qiche Limited Corp. (Jiangxi Province) and the Thai joint-venture company, Isuzu Engine Manufacturing Company, Thailand (Bangkok). Truck sales have greatly increased in both countries and they are handling it by increasing engine exports from Japan. The Tochigi plant previously had been in charge of machine processing of engine parts, but starting this spring, it will begin production of the medium engine "4H" with a 4300-cc to 4800-cc displacement that is carried in the midsized to small truck "Elf." They are producing the engine with a monthly production of 5,000 units in order to begin supply of the engine to Mazda this summer. Isuzu will begin OEM [original equipment manufacturer] supply of the Elf to Nissan Motor and Nissan Diesel Motor beginning in the summer of 1995. For this reason, prospects are that they will further increase production of the "4H" at the Tochigi plant in the future.
