Ambassador Khalid al-Jarallah, director of the Gulf Cooperation Council's affairs at the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, said that consultations are now under way between the Damascus Declaration countries' foreign ministers to set a new date for the meeting, adding that there is a proposal to hold it next week. In an exclusive statement to MENA's correspondent in Kuwait, he said that a number of issues will top the agenda of the meeting, the most important of which are the situation in Yemen in light of the expected Security Council resolution, Iraqi intransigence in implementing the UN resolutions, the Middle East peace process and its developments, and other issues of concern to the member countries.
