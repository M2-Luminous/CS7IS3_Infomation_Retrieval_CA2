Officials at the French Embassy, the UK High Commission, the US Embassy and the Canadian High Commission said last week that they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements of the T&T Government and how best they can each serve these needs. The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The French have been identified as the experts on money laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the US on drug interdiction and the British on training. Jacques Venne, delegate for the Eastern Caribbean Technical and International Police Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the French Embassy, said that Trinidad and Tobago was designated the regional centre of SCTIP operations on September 27. Director of SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening on his way to Aruba to attend an Interpol Conference. This country, he said, was chosen because of its geographical location and because of this Government's interest in dealing with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in Trinidad and Tobago. The Paris Government, he said, has already released "a good budget" for training a special team of police officers in money laundering, starting from the end of October. The officers are expected to undergo an intensive training session in Martinique. Emphasising that his Embassy offers assistance on the basis of discussions with this Government, Venne said: "We are here as advisers, not to say what to do." Head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Lance Selman pointed out that the Customs and Excise Division as well as the banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering. "One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering. In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he commented. His office, Selman said, has been mandated to develop the capabilities to deal with money laundering. Stating that his country's contribution has been "very modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner Jean Nadeau said on Friday that Canada has been offering participation in short-term observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained, involved exposure to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their drug control operations. Two T&T officers will be attending such a session later this month. Besides training sessions, Nadeau said, Canada has donated a small amount of communications equipment to the Ministry of National Security and has made a financial commitment to assist in the renovation of the Narcotics Unit. Indirectly, the Canadian Government has also provided assistance to Trinidad and Tobago, he said, through a 1992 contribution of Can$800,000 to the Inter-American Drug Control Commission (CICAD) and Can$2.5 million to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). Canada, said Nadeau, is also discussing with Trinidad and Tobago the setting up [of] a communications trunking system linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise. Press officer at the British High Commission Simon Bond said that the UK is placing emphasis on training especially in money laundering within the Customs and Excise Division. "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance to the police and Coast Guard. But more significant from the UK's point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said. Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective services, the US Government in August funded a US$18,000 drug prevention programme aimed at young people.
