Organized crime is irresistibly infiltrating our authorities. In construction offices, foreigners' offices, offices responsible for imposing fines -- everywhere there are bribes and cover-ups. In a confidential report the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] warns: One in three investigations into "organized crime" is aimed against corrupt officials. BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert says in this confidential analysis: "For a long time we used to look down arrogantly on the bakshish mentality in other countries. Corruption was a phenomenon that was primarily associated with other cultures. There is no longer any reason for this smug indifference." The worst cases came from the reports of the land offices for criminal investigations: - At the Russian military airport of Sperenberg in Brandenburg police seized 10,000 smuggled guns ("Makarovs"). Thirty of the guns seized were stolen -- by a young criminal police officer with connections with the mafia. - In Munich a five-man special commission is investigating employees of construction and planning offices, who reportedly received several 100,000 German marks [DM] in bribes for orders involving purification plants; 66 of the accused have been sentenced to prison terms totalling 94 years and fined DM1.5 million. - The Bavarian Land Office for Criminal Investigations is currently investigating another 49 officials; 53 investigations have already been concluded. - In Hesse, 1,400 employees of authorities have been investigated for corruption over the past five years. - In Frankfurt an employee of the Social Welfare Office granted a total of DM3 million of unwarranted social welfare to 80 Czechs. - In Hamburg 18 employees of the foreigners' office are being investigated for allegedly issuing almost any stamp or any permit in return for cash. BKA Chief Zachert warns of a "morass": "We must dry it up before it is too late."
