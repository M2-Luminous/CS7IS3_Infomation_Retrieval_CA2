The following is the essence of the meeting: On behalf of the Thai Government and the Thai people, the ambassador expressed pleasure that the king's health has improved, which enabled him to return to Cambodia to the delight of the Cambodian people. The ambassador also congratulated and expressed support for the king's proposal to hold a round-table meeting of the leaders of Cambodian factions -- Samdech Norodom Ranariddh, Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan -- during 2-5 May. The Thai envoy expressed the view that due to the respect and acceptance of all Cambodians, King Sihanouk is currently the only person to be able to achieve national reconciliation. The Thai Government sincerely wishes to see national reconciliation materialized in Cambodia as well as peace and progress there like in other countries in the region. On Thai-Cambodian relations, King Sihanouk felt that accusations and counteraccusations through the mass media should end. It would be better for the two countries to use diplomatic measures or government-level contacts. The Thai envoy emphasized that the Thai Government recognizes the Cambodian Government as the sole legitimate administration of Cambodia and that it does not support the Khmer Rouge. The Thai Government is determined to maintain good relations and see the neighboring countries, including Cambodia, enjoy stability and prosperity. It reiterates continued support for the Cambodian government's national reconstruction efforts.
