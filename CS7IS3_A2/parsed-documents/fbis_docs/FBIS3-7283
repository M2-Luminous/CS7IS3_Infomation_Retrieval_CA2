It is a great pleasure to welcome President and Mrs. Kim Yong-sam as our state guests this time, following our recent talks in Kyungchu. At the current summit talks held following the last talks, we were able to have a broad exchange of views in a frank way on relations and cooperation between our two nations. As one who is also engaged in reforms, I would like to express my sincere respects to President Kim Yong-sam for his continuous efforts in carrying out reforms at home with his excellent leadership. It goes without saying that to promote development of Japan-ROK relations, it is important to further deepen the understanding between peoples of our two nations on the basis of lessons learned from past history. And, it is based on this concept that we have recently decided to provide new support for ROK students studying in Japan. To enable Japan-ROK relations to mature further, I would like to talk with the president on the need for the diversification and internationalization of bilateral relations. Diversification means promoting exchanges in various fields and between the people of various generations. As for internationalization, this means that Japan and the ROK should promote cooperative relations between our two countries in the international community. I believe that with the approach of the 21st century, our cooperation in the international community will become more and more extensive. And, I feel that through such cooperation, we will be able to actually realize that Japan and the ROK are two irreplaceable partners for each other. The issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons has now become the most serious concern in Northeast Asia, where our two countries are located. We have discussed this issue at the current talks, and President Kim and I share the view that it is important to settle the issue through close cooperation with China, the United States, and other concerned nations. I am convinced that through President Kim Yong-sam's current visit to Japan, we have been able to further develop the friendly relationship between our two nations. And I believe it is important for us to solidify this friendly relationship for the future of the peoples of our two nations as a whole, and with the president, I would like to do my best for this purpose. Thank you very much.
