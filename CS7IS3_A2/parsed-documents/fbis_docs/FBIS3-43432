Also last week, there were reports of Cameroon gendarmes crossing into Nigeria and raiding villages. Now the Cameroon Foreign Ministry says about 500 Nigerian soldiers have landed on two islands in the Gulf of Guinea and have been occupying them since Monday [3 January]. The two Islands, Diamond and Jabane Islands, are officially Cameroonian territory. On the line to Yaounde, Herbert Saleh asked Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, Francis Nkwain, what he thought the Nigerian soldiers were up to: [Begin recording] [Nkwain] You know that we have a very long border with Nigeria, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic. But this area which is close to the sea has been giving some problems for obvious reasons. It is a fishing ground and also beneath the water there we have a little bit of petrol. Things like that might be exciting the people. So we do not know because we have been discussing all these. So what we did was to register our protest in the normal way and in the spirit of good neighborliness. [Saleh] You said you registered your protest. What have the Nigerians done? Have they responded? [Nkwain] No, that is what I am saying that we registered our protest the day before yesterday by issuing the usual note to the Nigerian ambassador and he sent it home. And the reaction to it is that the foreign minister of Nigeria accompanied by the minister of industry are to arrive today with a message from President Abacha to President Biya. [Saleh] So they are coming to resolve the issue? [Nkwain] I think so. [Saleh] So what can you tell us about the two islands which you say are occupied now by the Nigerian troops. Who lives there? [Nkwain] The two Islands concerned are Jabane. One is called Jabane and the other one is called Diamond. They are islands on which some fishermen live but the fishermen are of the Ibidip. That is they are of Nigerian origin. They have always lived there. You know that this area is part of Alaja area that was southern Cameroon. And that is before our independence and it was treated as Nigeria and so anybody could live anywhere. But after the new maps were drawn, the people continued to live where they were living. And we in Cameroon are not opposed to their living there. As long as they recognize that they are living on Cameroon grounds, they can go on doing whatever they were doing and they will be doing it right into the future, no problem. But as long as they know that the law which operates there is Cameroon law. Now and again some of these actions come up because of pressure from them that they want to be Nigerians and that they don't want to obey our own local laws. [Saleh] I understand that Cameroon has sent troops to the island. Is that correct? [Nkwain] No, it is not a question of sending troops to the island. You cannot hear that there is a strange presence on your territory and just leave it. So obviously, the troops which supervise the area will make adequate movements to contain the situation but I do not think that there has been direct confrontation so far. [Saleh] Do you have any idea what the Nigerians might be doing there now. [Nkwain] We cannot... [pauses] I cannot say I have any idea. The report only said that they were landing by ship and by helicopter. It could be part of an exercise -- a training exercise. It could be anything. It could also be an act of war. It could be an act of occupation. But all these, I think, will only be clearer when we the two sides have examined the facts.[end recording]
