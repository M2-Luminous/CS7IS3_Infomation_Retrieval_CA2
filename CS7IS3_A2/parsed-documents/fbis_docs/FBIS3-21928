The drug plants, interspersed with corn on a farm known as Mumucuera, in the Sonora municipality of Navojoa, would have produced slightly over 40 tons of the drug. This announcement was made by the office's representative in the state, Fausto Destenave Kuri, who reported that more than 2 million drug plants, of the types known as "lamb's tail" and "lemon-lime," were destroyed manually. Backing was provided by Mexican Army, and both State Judicial and Municipal Police personnel. He added that, based on a series of investigations, Federal Judicial Police agents assigned to the state, under orders from the deputy representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, detected several marijuana plantations three km from the Km Six by-pass of the Navojoa-Huatabampo highway. They were located on an earth fill road, "protruding" from a corn crop. When the forces invaded the farm, they observed that the marijuana was interspersed with corn, and that the crop's dimensions were of considerable size. Therefore, an inspection by topographical experts and reconnaissance flights over the zone by military personnel were required. It was determined that the farm had been divided into six plots, on an approximate area of 58 hectares. Destenave Kuri noted that, a few days earlier, the local office headed by him had received reports concerning the presence of armed persons on that site, as well as an unusual movement of vehicles through the region. During an operation conducted on the farm known as Mumucuera, it was discovered that the plants had reached a height of one-two meters, with a density of four per square meter. This land was supplied with water through a complex irrigation system, consisting of pumps to extract the vital liquid and hoses. The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, for its part, stressed that, on the borders of the plantations, six camps were found, supplied with food, bedding, and cots. There were two dryers for the drugs, as well as bags of fertilizer and insecticides, fumigation pumps, shovels, hoes, plastic drums, and other household equipment. The participation of Federal Judicial Police personnel was required to destroy the marijuana crops. They began uprooting all the plants for subsequent incineration. Finally, the representative of the Attorney General's Office in the state remarked that preliminary investigation 029/94-Obregon-III, initiated after these incidents, now contains data on the likely owners of that land and of the drugs. Criminal action will be taken against them for crimes against health in the form of planting and cultivation, and any other forms proven to exist.
