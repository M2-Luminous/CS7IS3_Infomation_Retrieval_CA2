For the first time, as Mr. Smirnov, the president of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye, stressed, we saw a sincere desire of the Republic [of] Moldova to settle long existing problems. Apart from the main document, some other agreements were signed. The agreement between the National Bank of Moldova and the central bank of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye, the protocol of intentions on the social order, fighting against crime and other documents. The sides, in particular, decided to start the negotiating process without delay and preliminary conditions on all the questions the sides are interested in, to remove all the obstacles that block normal economical, social and cultural relations, provide to [as heard] their restoration and development, normalize business, trade, and financial relations for mutual benefit in interest of the entire population. The sides came to the conclusion that it was necessary to determine the political and legal status of Pridnestrovye -- a step by step program of creating and carrying on political and legal relations on division of powers between [the] sides and a transitional period for realization of mutual agreements on every concrete direction of activity. Finally, on the necessity of creation of the system with mutual guarantees, including international ones in order to fulfill the reached agreements completely and unconditionally. [sentence as heard] More than a month has passed. However, attempts of the leadership of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye to speed up the (?status) activity, face once again a (?solid) blockade which we know pretty well. The president of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, actually evades further development of the negotiating process, specifying no reasons of such a behavior to the leadership of Pridnestrovye. Relations between Abkhazia and Georgia, other hot regions, have now more and more good prospects on the way proposed and adopted by Russia. Agreements signed by Russia and Tatarstan may also be a kind of pattern for further work. It is being proposed to borrow from the experience of relations between Crimea and Ukraine. However, they reject the accumulated experience in reference to our region. Relations between the Republic of Moldova and Pridnestrovye are being frozen artificially again. The position of the leadership of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye remains the same. Only peaceful and negotiating activity can settle all the problems. Besides, we don't see any reasons for the artificial delay of the settlement of vital problems and coordinating the determination of the status for Pridnestrovye with the problems of Gagauzia. Expressing his concern about the nonfulfillment of the signed statement and the number of documents, the president of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye, Igor Smirnov, addressed Russia's resident plenipotentiary envoy to Pridnestrovye, (Vasiv), with the request to use all his influence on the president of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, in order to speed up the negotiating process and the realization of the signed document.
