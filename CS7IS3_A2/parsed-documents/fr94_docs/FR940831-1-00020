FR940831-1-00020 FR940831-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 622, 625, 628, 649, 650, 651, 652, and 655 [Docket No. 930771&hyph;4237; I.D. 071994A] Northeast Region General Fisheries Permit and Reporting Procedures AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS withdraws its proposed regulations for consolidating permit and reporting requirements. NMFS has determined that fishery-specific reporting requirements are necessary. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bridgette S. Davidson, Fishery Management Specialist, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 14, 1993, NMFS published proposed regulations (58 FR 53172) to consolidate NMFS Northeast Regional administrative and permitting provisions in a new part 622 of title 50 CFR. This rule proposed to amend 50 CFR parts 625, 628, 649, 650, 651, 652, and 655 by consolidating the permitting, recordkeeping and reporting provisions of these parts into a new part 622. The purpose was to eliminate redundancy, ensure consistency, and ease revision of permitting requirements. Since the proposed rule was published, many of the regulatory provisions affected have been extensively revised by FMP amendments. The proposed rule is now obsolete because the regulations it proposed to change no longer exist. In addition, although the permit application has remained essentially the same for all the fisheries affected, the major provisions for each of these regulations, e.g., the requirements, qualifications, and restrictions, are now fishery-specific. For these reasons, this proposed rule is withdrawn. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: August 24, 1994. Gary Matlock, Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service.
