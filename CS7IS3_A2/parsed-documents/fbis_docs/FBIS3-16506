[Rizayev] It is considerably more calm and stable in our republic today than it was a year ago, let us say. Naturally, the war which Armenia has now been waging against Azerbaijan for approximately six years has been and still is the chief barometer here. It must be emphasized that it is precisely Armenia that is fighting, not the mythical "Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense forces." Where has Karabakh's present tiny Armenian community gotten this tremendous military might, these tanks, missiles, and aircraft? Where has it gotten the fuel that powers the death-dealing war machines? The economic damage to the republic resulting from this war exceeds U.S.$4 billion. Today there are 1,000,200 [figure as published] refugees in Azerbaijan; the lot of these people who have been forced to leave their homes in order to escape annihilation is terrible. Old men, women, and children perish and die every day from cold, hunger, and disease. Ravaged by war, Azerbaijan cannot cope with this disaster, and the humanitarian aid, for which we are grateful to everyone who gives it, provides only poor support. [Gurbanov] What can you say about the role of intermediaries in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict? For example, about Russia's mediation mission.... [Rizayev] We are grateful for any peacemaking efforts which might help to end the bloodshed, which neither the Azeris nor, I am sure, the Armenian people want. As for Russia's role in a peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, it must proceed from the premise that Russia's geopolitical and economic interests require stability on its southern borders. Approximately half a million Russians live in Azerbaijan, and they regard our republic as their homeland and share the burdens of the war equally with everyone. We therefore consider Russia's active participation and that country's objective position as very important factors in resolving this complex problem. Russia is taking peacemaking steps, and the activity of Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's special ambassador in the conflict zone, deserves particular mention. We joined the CIS and signed the Collective Security Treaty, and we believe that this treaty must produce a considerably greater return than hitherto, because it is absurd when one CIS member, Armenia, wages an aggressive war against another, Azerbaijan. We also want more active participation by the United Nations, the CSCE, the Security Council, and, of course, Russia and other countries in resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. [Gurbanov] After everything that has happened, do we have any chance of hope in the "all-Caucasian home"...? [Rizayev] This idea has arisen before in history. It still sounds only a fine metaphor, a dream. What question can there be of a common home when, alas, there is still no peace and accord in it? Let us first stop the bloodshed. [Gurbanov] Mr. Ambassador, how does Azerbaijan perceive the cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government? [Rizayev] We do not interfere in Russia's internal affairs. Naturally, we welcome the policy of democratic transformations in Russia. Russians are pinning their hopes on it, and we sincerely sympathize with them at this difficult time. One of the most important elements is the fact that the internal political situation in Russia largely determines the overall political and economic climate in the Commonwealth. [Gurbanov] Is the need felt in the republic to adopt a statute on dual citizenship? Please tell me about the position of Russians and the Russian-speaking population in Azerbaijan, and also about the position of Azeris in Russia.... [Rizayev] In Azerbaijan, as in other republics of the former USSR, the problem of dual citizenship is being discussed and constructive ideas about it are being accumulated. As regards Russian-speakers, here I would like to emphasize the following. The first Russian settlement in Azerbaijan appeared back in the time of Patriarch Nikon of Rus, at the end of the 17th century. Azerbaijan is their motherland. The good relations between Russians and Azeris have stood the test of time. The Slavs' Culture Center and the "Sodruzhestvo," "Azerbaijan-Russia," and "Russkaya Obshchina" societies are now operating in Baku. Newspapers and television and radio programs are put out in Russian, Russian schools and theaters are functioning.... The war brings suffering not only to Azeris. Baku is gasping for breath and is unable to accommodate refugees from the territories occupied by the Armenian armed forces. There have been instances of unauthorized takeovers of both Azeris' and Russians' apartments, but the situation is being strictly monitored and obstacles are being placed in the way of lawlessness. I would like to speak about one other thing here. During very difficult times for Azerbaijan, particularly after the January 1990 bloodshed in Baku, part of the Russian-speaking population left the republic. But we are very glad that the majority of them have come back. As regards the second part of your question, there are fellow countrymen of ours who have been living in Russia for long years and who have made a tremendous contribution to Russia's culture and economy. It is possible to name Aydyn Imamaliyev, Russia's chief trauma expert, and the artist Tair Salakhov. USSR People's Artiste Muslim Magomayev lives in Moscow; General K. Kerimov, who stood at the cradle of Soviet cosmonautics and was involved in the development of some highly interesting space projects, recently retired on pension. The list of such examples could be long. But there is, unfortunately, something else. It so happens that Azeris are also involved in so-called mafia altercations. There is a lot of talk about the presence of Azeris at markets, about their behavior.... Here it is necessary to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. When, for example, a Russian guy from Ryazan stands and sells meat at an exorbitant price, this seems not to be noticed. When "persons of Caucasian nationality" sell tomatoes, let us assume, for 1,000 rubles too much, from the Russians' viewpoint, indignation at once erupts. And yet the struggle must be waged not along ethnic lines, so to speak, but against the phenomenon of speculation, corruption, etc. Take the campaign mounted against Caucasians after the October events in Moscow -- very many offenses occurred. At any rate, we proceed from the premise that Azeris have no right, while living on Russian territory, to show disrespect for Russian laws, customs, and traditions or to forget about their national responsibility, because we represent our people far from our motherland. As regards criminal elements, all the severity of the law must be applied to them. [Gurbanov] What do you think about the prospects for Azerbaijan's relations with Russia? [Rizayev] Here we cannot manage without talking about the problems of the CIS. As is known, the Commonwealth emerged from the ruins of the Union, which was destroyed at a speed and with consequences which were disastrous for the peoples who populated it. Ties -- above all, economic ties which had just about "worked" for 70 years -- were severed overnight. All the burdens of such ultraradical, supposedly democratic "renewal" were also felt in full by the people of Azerbaijan. Let us take just one sector -- petroleum machine building. During the thousand-times cursed "era of stagnation" Azerbaijan produced approximately 80 percent of all the Union's oil-field and drilling equipment. After its breakup this indicator fell sharply -- which hit hard at oil extraction in Russia and, in the final analysis, also at the prosperity of Russians and the population of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijan's normal contacts with Russia are hampered by customs barriers and robbery on the railroads. This cannot be tolerated. The policy pursued by the republic's former leaders virtually brought Azerbaijan to self-isolation -- isolation from many other countries, including Russia. We are now endeavoring to rectify this situation and have already largely done so. We are pursuing a policy of strengthening and expanding ties with Russia. I am sure that both the Russian people and the Azeri people need this.
