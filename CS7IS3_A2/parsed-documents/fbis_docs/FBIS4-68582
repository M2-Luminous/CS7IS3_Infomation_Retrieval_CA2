State Program for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets (Main Avenues and Priority Measures) 1. General Provisions The state program for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets (main avenues and priority measures), hereinafter referred to as the State Program, establishes the goals, priorities, and place of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition in the overall state policy of economic reforms, the stages and methods of the formation and development of a competitive environment, the tasks and measures to demonopolize the economy and develop competition at federal, sectorial, and regional levels, and also restrictions in this field. The aim of the state policy of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets is to increase social production efficiency on the basis of the market regulation of economic processes. The main task of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets in 1994-1995 is to reduce the concentration of production and to create the necessary conditions for the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets for priority groups of commodities (operations and services). The implementation of this task envisages: --the analysis of the commodity markets which have taken shape and the behavior on them of enterprises and various associations of enterprises which are not the subjects of a natural monopoly; --the formation of the necessary economic organizational prerequisites for effective competition on the Russian Federation markets; --the establishment and maintenance of a single economic area on the territory of the Russian Federation; --the creation of a system of state control and regulation of the activity of subjects of natural and state monopoly; --the creation of legal and economic organizational conditions for activating the market mechanisms for optimizing commodity flows and forming prices and tariffs for socially important goods and services which are relegated to the sphere of a temporary monopoly; --the consideration of the market structure when privatizing enterprises with a view to enhancing the competitiveness and effectiveness of their activity; --the development of entrepreneurship. The demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets are interconnected with financial stabilization, anti-inflation measures, and investment and export and import policy. The provisions of the State Program are used when forming other federal programs, including programs for the structural restructuring and development of the economy as a whole and of its individual sectors and also programs for the regions' socioeconomic development. The direct protection of the competitive environment and businesses [khozyaystvuyushchiye subekty] against monopoly activity is effected on the basis of the Russian Federation Law "On Competition and the Restriction of Monopoly Activity On Commodity Markets" and is not the subject of this State Program. The process of the formation and development of a competitive environment for markets is geared to the long term, with the annual specification of priorities. Sectorial programs for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition are an inalienable part of the State Program. They include the analysis of the structure of commodity markets broken down by sector output and of the level and forms of the manifestation of sectorial monopolism, validated proposals for the list of subjects of a natural monopoly, and plans for the demonopolization of the economy and development of competition on the markets of temporary monopolies at federal level. Plans for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the markets of temporary monopolies which have geographical market borders inside national-state and administrative-territorial formations are coordinated with the organs of executive power of components of the Russian Federation as regards measures affecting the economic interests of national-state and administrative-territorial formations. Regional programs for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition are included in the programs for the region's socioeconomic development and are an inalienable part of these programs. They include an analysis of the structure of commodity markets, validated proposals for the list of subjects of a natural monopoly, and plans for the demonopolization and development of competition on the markets of temporary monopolies at local level. Within regional programs proposals are formed for demonopolization and the development of competition on interregional commodity markets. The process of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets stipulates a consideration of the following general requirements: --orientation toward the creation of a competitive market and the protection of consumers' rights and interests; --the comprehensive nature of the solution of the tasks of demonopolization, privatization, and the structural restructuring of the economy; --a differentiated approach toward the targets of demonopolization wit a consideration for social interests and sectorial (product) and regional features; --the interconnectedness of the solution of demonopolization problems and the development of competition at the federal, sectorial, and regional levels; --a consideration of factors of the Russian economy's integration into the world economic system and the openness of commodity markets to international competition combined with measures to protect Russian commodity producers; --the monitoring of the change in the structure of the market and the compliance of the program implementation mechanism for demonopolization and the development of competition with its structure; --the ensuring of publicity for the measures which are implemented and for their results. Temporary monopolies which have arisen as a result of the use of inventions and the introduction of patents and equipment produced under license are not subject to demonopolization for five years as of the moment the license or patent is acquired or the invention is registered. The State Program does not include among demonopolization measures the establishment of state control and the regulation of prices for temporary monopolies. When high (or low) monopoly prices are set, the suppression of this abuse is in accordance with article 5 of the Russian Federation Law "On Competition and the Restriction of Monopoly Activity on Commodity Markets." For the purposes of the State Program the following concepts are used: --commodity market -- the market for each commodity, type of operation or service (hereinafter referred to as commodity) or for each group of interchangeable commodities; --interchangeable commodities -- commodities which are close to each other in terms of consumer properties and satisfy basically the same needs; --the market's commodity borders -- the selection (list) of goods which are interchangeable or satisfy a specific need; --geographical borders of the market -- the sphere of circulation of a commodity and its substitutes, defined on the basis of the economic opportunities of consumers for acquiring the commodity on the relevant territories and the lack of such opportunities outside the territories' borders (by relevant territories, together with national-state and administrative-territorial formations is also understood groups of population centers or other territories within the borders of these formations); --demonopolization -- the reduction of the concentration of the production of goods and the creation of the necessary conditions for the development of competition on commodity markets; --natural monopoly -- a monopoly whereby the creation of a competitive environment on the commodity market (including through the import of output onto a given market) irrespective of the level of demand is impossible or economically ineffective given the existing level of scientific and technical progress; --state monopoly -- a monopoly created in accordance with Russian Federation legislation defining the commodity borders of the monopoly market, the subject of the monopoly (monopolist), the forms of control and regulation of his activity, and the competence of the contrloling organ; --temporary monopoly -- a monopoly under the conditions of the temporary absence of competition; --group of enterprises -- amalgam of businesses having relations based on direct or indirect property control of one business over one other (or other) businesses through the possession of a controlling block of shares (holdings, stakes) in the incorporation capital or by exerting decisive influence by other means on the decisions which are made. With regard to the aims of demonopolization a group of enterprises is seen as a single business. 2. Priorities of Policy of Demonopolization of the Economy and Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets for 1994-1995 The following priority avenues for the policy of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets are defined for the immediate future: --the creation of a legal normative and organizational basis for state control and regulation of the activity of the subjects of natural and state monopolies; --the implementation of priority measures to demonopolize economic complexes: the trade, construction, communications, transport and road (except for railroad), and machine building complexes; --the implementation of state control over the progress of the privatization of state and municipal enterprises with a view to observing antimonopoly requirements and preventing the creation of new monopoly structures which are not natural monopolies; --the elimination of economic and administrative barriers for the free movement of commodities, services, and capital on the Russian Federation markets; --the reduction of financial and economic, organizational, and legal barriers to the entry of new competitive structures onto the market (footnote), (by financial and economic, organizational, and legal barriers is meant the usually non-returnable expenditure when organizing and carrying out production, various restrictions when investing in projects and providing credits, leasing premises, making use of land, and gaining access to sources of raw material, technologies, sales markets, and commercial information); --the propaganda of the policy of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets and the training of cadres for the implementation of antimonopoly legislation and the demonopolization of various spheres of the economy. 3. Policy of demonopolization of the economy and development of competition on the Russian Federation markets under the conditions of integration processes in industry The Russian Federation law "On Competition and the Restriction of Monopoly Activity On Commodity Markets" stipulates the absence of opposition to structures which dominate the Russian market if: --their activity is economically justified, accords with consumers' interests, and does not lead to the narrowing of the market's competitive environment; --they do not abuse their dominant position on the Russian market and do not allow monopolist actions, defined by articles of the Russian Federation law "on competition and the restriction of monopoly activity on commodity markets." That is why, when determining the expediency of creating industrial or financial and industrial groups operating on Russian markets, there must be a consideration of the predicted likely impact of a group's activity on the state of competition. Here it is essential to observe the following conditions: --to avoid abuse of a dominant position large industrial or financial and industrial groups are not allowed to acquire monopoly influence on local commodity markets or to restrict access to them to other businesses, including foreign subjects; --an industrial or financial and industrial group must not include supplying firms or consuming firms if they occupy a dominant position on the relevant markets; --when creating industrial or financial and industrial groups on the basis of the principles of export cartels, firms which are competitors on a particular commodity market should not unite if the inclusion of these firms in the group will lead to the substantial complication or restriction of competition on the domestic market. 4. Organizational and Cadres' Backup for the State Program for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets. The implementation of measures to demonopolize the economy and develop competition on the Russian Federation markets provides for the creation of the relevant organizational mechanism for implementing the State Program. The implementation of the State Program is assigned to the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New Economic Structures and its territorial administrations and organs of executive power of the components of the Russian Federation. The coordination of the actions of ministries and other federal organs of executive power and the organs of executive power of components of the Russian Federation in implementing the State Program is implemented by the interdepartmental commission for competition policy. Regional commissions for competition policy can be created at regional level by a decision of the organs of executive power of components of the Russian Federation. To ensure the implementation of the State Program it is essential to implement measures to form a positive public opinion of problems of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets and of the work of the organs assigned the implementation of the State Program. Propaganda support for the State Program envisages: --the holding of regular consultations between antimonopoly organs and societies for the protection of consumers' rights, unions of entrepreneurs and industrialists, trade unions, and other public organizations; --acquainting representatives of ministries and other federal organs of executive power and organs of executive power of components of the Russian Federation, businesses, entrepreneurs, trade unions, and the population with the State Program and antimonopoly legislation; --disseminating in the mass media items on questions of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets. The training and retraining of cadres in the field of demonopolization envisages: --the study of the need for cadres and the development of training programs for avenues of demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets; --the preparation of complete sets of training and methodological manuals, the translation and adaption of foreign materials on questions of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets; --the organization of training, retraining, and the improvement of qualifications for workers in the organs assigned the implementation of the State Program; --the formation and development of the relevant centers for training cadres and the organization on their basis of a consultative service for questions of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets. 5. Information and Technical Backup for the State Program for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets Antimonopoly regulation, demonopolization, and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets require information on the level of monopolization of markets and the monopoly actions of businesses on them. To this end an information and reference system should be created for antimonopoly regulation and the demonopolization of the economy and development of competition on the Russian Federation markets. To implement this task it is necessary: --to put in order the Russian State Committee for Statistics' existing system of statistical reporting with a view to ensuring the comprehensive provision of information on the reforming of the economy, expanding the use of selective methods of collecting information about businesses of all organizational and legal forms of ownership operating on commodity markets, and determining the procedure for obtaining information on the activity of businesses on commodity markets and the transmission of this information to the organs assigned the implementation of the State Program; --to integrate the information resources of ministries, other federal organs of executive power, and the organs of executive power of the components of the Russian Federation, to simplify information exchange procedures, to organize the collaboration of organs assigned the implementation of the State Program with the organizations holding the relevant information, and to ensure the use of existing data bases and banks and the creation of new ones to analyze quantitative and qualitative indicators of the commodity markets; --to create software for the proposed information and reference system and automated work stations for the solution of tasks and the implementation of plans for demonopolization and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets. 6. Financial Support for the State Program for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets The sources of finance for measures and work to implement the State Program and to elaborate, amend, and implement the sectorial and regional programs for demonopolization and the development of competition which are being implemented within the framework of the State Program are the funds of the federal budget and the budgets of national-state and administrative-territorial formations of the Russian Federation and also the funds received from the privatization of state and municipal property and the relevant extrabudgetary funds and voluntary contributions from enterprises, institutions, and organizations. Here measures and operations for the information backup for the implementation of the state program, for the conducting of the relevant targeted research, the preparation of legislative acts and methodological norm materials, the organizational and technical backup for the organs assigned the implementation of the State program, the training of the relevant specialists, and the monitoring of the progress of implementation, are financed predominantly through federal budget funds allocated directly to the Russian Federation state committee for antimonopoly policy and the support of new economic structures. The financing of measures and work to elaborate, amend, and implement regional programs for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition is through the budgets of the relevant components of the Russian Federation and the money received from the privatization of state and municipal property. The financing of the elaboration, amendment, and implementation of sectorial programs for demonopolization and the development of competition is mostly through the relevant extrabudget funds and voluntary donations from enterprises, institutions, and organizations. The diversification and deamalgamation of enterprises, institutions, and organizations with a view to creating competing structures are implemented and financed as a rule within the framework of programs for the structural restructuring of the economy and conversion. Tax benefits stipulated by legislation can be used to encourage initiative-driven deamalgamation of businesses. Specific shape to the provisions of the State Program set out in sections 1-6, the most important work and measures to implement it, and the basic tasks of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets and also general methods of resolving these tasks are given in appendices 1-5 of the State Program.

Appendix No. 3. Standard List of Tasks for the Demonopolization and Development of Competition on the Commodity Market with a Stable Structure The standard list of tasks for the demonopolization and development of competition on the commodity market with a stable structure is used to form sectorial and regional programs for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition. It is based on an analysis of the relevant market and the provisions of the State Program for the demonopolization of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets and proceeds from the goal of creating conditions for the development of competition on a specific commodity market. I. General Signs of the Presence of a Competitive Environment on the Commodity Market 1. There should be operating on the market suppliers -- independent in property and organizational terms -- of goods in a quantity sufficient for the emergence of competition between them. The independent suppliers of a commodity under review can be independent producers of this commodity or sellers of a commodity from independent producers, or independent sellers of the commodity of one producer on condition that there is no vertical agreement between suppliers and producers restricting the freedom to set prices and delivery volumes. The quantity of suppliers on the market sufficient to create a competitive environment depends on the form of commodity, the nature of consumption, and the level of demand. That is why the task of creating a competitive environment for each commodity requires its own special implementation mechanism. 2. There should be operating on the market purchasers -- independent in property and organizational terms -- of commodities in a quantity sufficient for competition between them and for the formation of a certain level of effective demand. Independent purchasers can be the final consumers of a particular commodity or middlemen in its sale. To implement the real independence of middlemen it is essential that they supply their commodity to consumers who are independent in property and organizational terms. The number of purchasers on the market sufficient to create an independent environment depends on the type of commodity, the nature of its consumption, and the level of demand. 3. To ensure effective competition on the market under review, the economic dimensions of enterprises should be comparable (footnote) (the economic dimensions of enterprises competing on the market depend on production expenditure, the level of demand, and the market's geographical and commodity borders and as a rule are measured by the annual turnover of capital and volumes of production or deliveries). 4. The market's competitive environment is maintained by the lack of economic and other obstacles in access to raw and semifinished materials, subassemblies, capital, manpower resources, technologies, and information backup for market relations and of barriers to entering the market in the form of territorial, legal, property, and other economic restrictions. 5. A competitive market is characterized by the independent economic behavior of suppliers and consumers (the lack of deals and horizontal agreements). II. Requirements for Indicators Characterizing the Economic Situation on a Competitive Commodity Market. (These requirements determine guidelines in the process of making decisions on demonopolization and in the choice of methods for demonopolizing markets with a stable structure. Specific markets dictate their own individual conditions for the development of competition.) 6. The total number of suppliers of output to a given commodity market should meet the requirements of competition. The minimum necessary number of suppliers for the creation of a competitive environment can be set by proceeding from the specifications of the output, the size of the market, and other indicators. If the actual number of suppliers on the market is less than standard, measures to demonopolize it should include an increase in the number of suppliers. 7. All suppliers of output to a given commodity market with a view to effective competition and to avoid abuses of a dominant position must to a certain extent be comparable in terms of volumes of deliveries to a given commodity market in physical terms. This requirement does not apply to markets in the period of the alteration of their structure, for instance thanks to the expansion of the volume of deliveries or to deliveries of new output as a result of the improvement of the organization and (or) technology of production. III. Standard List of Tasks for Demonopolization and the Development of Competition on the Commodity Market 8. The standard list of tasks for demonopolization and the development of competition on the commodity market includes: a) the formation of proposals for the composition of natural monopolies with a consideration for the possibility and economic effectiveness of creating a competitive environment on the commodity market under review, including through the import of output. The inclusion of natural monopolies in the system of observation, control, and regulation of activity on a legislative basis; b) the definition of commodity priorities and stages of demonopolization and the development of competition on commodity markets of temporary monopolies at federal and regional levels on the basis of an analysis of the volumes and structure of output consumption and the distribution of levels (groups) of consumption of output according to degree of priority; c) the determination of the geographical borders of commodity markets categorized as commodity priorities in the relevant stage of demonopolization and the development of competition; d) the assessment of the actual structure of the commodity market and the indicators characterizing the economic situation on the commodity markets which have been hived off and their recording as standard markets. This work is performed with the aid of the information and reference system for antimonopoly regulation, the demonopolization of the economy, and the development of competition on the commodity market. The actual structure of the commodity market and the indicators characterizing the economic situation on it are to be published regularly. On the basis of the results of an analysis of the actual structure of the commodity market and the economic situation on this market the standard number of suppliers on the market under review is selected and a decision is made on the sufficient number of suppliers of output to a given commodity market or on the need to increase them. A business which has undergone registration at the relevant organ of executive power or which has a license to supply output to the commodity market under review can be described as a supplier of output to a given commodity market provided that the business' property is not controlled by another business supplying output to this market. Otherwise both businesses must be regarded as a single supplier. A decision is also made on the absence or presence of the domination of businesses on the commodity market under review and the need (or absence of need) to take steps to change the structure of this market; e) the formation of a list of subtasks for the stage of demonopolization of a given regional or federal commodity market whose composition and content are determined by the need to encourage the transformation of these markets' monopoly structure into a competitive structure; f) the elaboration of measures for demonopolization and the development of competition on the commodity markets which have been hived off, which must be synchronized and can include successively: --an increase in the number of suppliers and the volume of output deliveries through the import of output from abroad or from other regions; --the lowering of barriers to entry onto the market; --the abolition of interregional barriers to commodity exchange; --the privatization and hiving off of independent enterprises from their associations; --the creation of corporate bodies on the basis of structural subdivisions of existing enterprises on condition that the main production is preserved and there is a demand for this output; --the development of entrepreneurship and the creation of small enterprises to saturate the market with these enterprises' finished output or to create a competitive environment for the repartitioning of technologies; --the inclusion of the output of monopoly enterprises in market systems for its sale on competitive markets, including foreign markets; --the sale of output through the organization of marts and auctions; --the extensive provision of information for purchasers on prices for commodities in other regions.
