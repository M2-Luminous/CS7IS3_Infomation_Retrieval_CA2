This came in a statement by the Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, in answer to a question by the Jordanian News Agency. He said this decision was announced in a statement by the French Foreign Ministry's spokesman on Wednesday [4 May] on France's decision to halt its participation in naval inspection operations in al-'Aqabah Port. Al-Hasan said the decision reflects France's understanding of Jordan's positive and constructive role in the region and the fairness of its request to reconsider the mechanism for implementing the embargo, which inflicted major losses on the Jordanian economy. The decision, he said, also reflect France's compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and its conviction that Jordan is fulfilling all of its commitments and responsibilities toward the implementation of these resolutions. Al-Hasan also praised the distinguished relations that are based on understanding and mutual respect between Jordan and France and the ties of close friendship between His Majesty King Husayn and His Excellency President Francois Mitterrand.
