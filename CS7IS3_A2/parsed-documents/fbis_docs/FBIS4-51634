FBIS4-51634 "dreas084_d_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 South Korea Papers Examine Policies of New Security Team Papers Examine Policies of New Security Team SK0205145494 SK0205145494 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of articles published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 2 May on the nature and characteristic of the new diplomacy-security team in the ROK Government and on the prospect of their policies. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by reporter Kim Cha-su, under the headline, "What are the contents of the policies to be implemented by the new security team?" The article points out that the very "difficult" impending problems facing the new diplomacy-security team are the North Korean nuclear problem, the North Korean escapees from logging sites in Siberia, and the important task of deciding "the method and form" of North- South dialogue to be held in the future. The article notes, however, that the government's position is that it will not "unilaterally decide" the form of dialogue, but will make the decision after "sounding out" North Korean intent through the United States, which began holding working-level contacts with North Korea in New York. The article predicts that the issue to which the government will pay primary attention to is the resumption of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee and to review the possibility of resuming contact between delegates to North-South high-level talks. Concerning the time of resuming dialogue, the government stresses that the North Korean side should be the "first to propose" dialogue because North-South dialogue should be resumed without fail before a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks, which North Korea "eagerly desires." The article notes that the new diplomacy-security team will review the issue of North Korean escapees from logging sites in Russia wishing to defect to the South, adding that the government will not decide "hastily" but will "calmly" resolve the issue because the Russian Government complained over the "hastiness" of the ROK Government and stressed appropriate "legal procedure" be used in handling the loggers. Pointing to North Korea's "strong rejection," the article notes that the government decided to reveal its position to handle the issue of North Korean loggers from the viewpoint of a "human rights issue" of compatriots. The new diplomacy-security team will work out "measures" to cope with the North Korean proposal for changing the Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement but, the article writes, the government has had no "effective means" to counter such a "propaganda offensive" by the North, except the principle of solving the problem by "the parties concerned in the North and the South." Thus, the team will again "intensively study" the plan to "annul" the Armistice Agreement "after" building a peace system according to the North- South Agreement, as well as other issues that have been discussed within the government. It is highly likely that to answer the people's comment that previous policies on the North Korean nuclear issue and other diplomacy and security-related issues "lack consistency," the new team will "intensively review" means to make "one harmonized voice." The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a 1,600-word article by reporter Ko Tae-song entitled, "Prospect for New Policies by Diplomacy-Security Team Headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yi." Describing new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku as a widely recognized "expert in reunification and diplomatic affairs," the article predicts "no drastic change" in the diplomatic and security policy pursued by former Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. The article, however, notes that there will be "some changes" in details in implementation methods. The task presently facing the team after withdrawal of the North-South envoy exchange-first policy is the North Korean nuclear issue, which is advancing in "a new direction." The article assumes that the new team will "refrain" from "impulsive [kamjongchok] means" in solving the North nuclear issue but will seek "reasonable ways" that represent new Deputy Prime Minister Yi's work style and that represent the position of Foreign Minister Han. Observing that the new team will have to take "considerable pains" in deciding "when" and "in what degree" it should propose resumption of North-South dialogue in the course of dealing with the North Korean nuclear problem, the article writes that new Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed "implementation" of the North-South agreement and joint denulcearization declaration, and notes his position expresses "the will" not to be "alienated" from resolving the nuclear issue. Another issue for the new team to deal with is "accepting" the North Korean escapees from logging sites in Russia for settlement in the ROK. The article predicts that the new team will try to resolve this issue in a "quiet" manner without "irritating" China, Russia, and North Korea by carefully reviewing and discussing it with relevant government offices. The new team will "effectively operate" the recently formulated "Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council" in its future endeavors. The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 1,200-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon, under the headline, "The new reunification-diplomacy team will seek middle, moderate- progressive policy on North Korea." The article notes that the new reunification-diplomacy team will attach great importance to the "international cooperative system" and "dialogue" in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, and stresses that the attempt to define the new security team only as "conservative" or "progressive" is "unreasonable." The article concludes that although key members of this team have some personal preferences in playing their roles, the team's overall "team work" will work effectively.
