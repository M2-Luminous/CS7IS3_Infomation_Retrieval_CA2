[passage omitted] Asked about the nature of the problem facing a possible direct meeting between southern and northern Yemeni delegations, Ibrahimi said: I cannot speak in behalf of Yemeni sides. The two parties have agreed to accept the cease-fire and a mechanism should be created to stabilize that cease-fire. This mechanism, Ibrahimi stated, consists of observers monitoring the cease-fire on the battle lines. He pointed out that the northerners want to revive the military committee but the southerners reject the idea, pointing to the committee's failure to end the fighting in the past. The UN envoy said that a compromise solution must be found and that a new formula for this mechanism should be found that is acceptable to both parties. Answering a question on whether he will hold other meetings with the Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said that he will not hold further meetings for the time being, but will fly to New York to report on his mission to the UN Secretary General. The UN envoy said that he will, however, remain in touch with the concerned parties and with the Arab League in an effort to resolve what he described as a difficult problem. Asked to comment on Sanaa's refusal to deal with Aden as a state, Ibrahimi said that there are real problems involved but the solution should begin with effecting a cease-fire. He said: If someone wants to establish a state or preserve unity, why does he wage military operations? Commenting on reports about the internationalization of the crisis, Ibrahimi said that the United States is a superpower that has international concerns and it is worried about the situation in Yemen. Washington, he emphasized, supports UN efforts to end the fighting and initiate dialogue. Third parties have the right to worry, he remarked. For his part, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The Arab League Council is still in open session with regard to the Yemeni crisis. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed every effort exerted to resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said that he backs Ibrahimi's call for an end to the fighting in Yemen, saying that the devastation and bloodshed are detrimental to everything that the Yemenis have achieved in the past.
