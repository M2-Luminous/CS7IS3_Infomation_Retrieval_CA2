Under the Constitution, the Federation Council is to consist of 178 lawmakers, however the ballot in Tatarstan and the Chelyabinsk region was declared invalid and new elections are to be called there, Chechnya did not hold parliamentary elections at all, and one deputy only has been elected in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous district so far. After their rights were confirmed, the lawmakers elected working bodies of the first meeting -- a secretariat, a vote-counting commission which is to count the votes until the conference hall is computerized, and an editing commission. Then the deputies passed on to discuss a procedure for the Federation Council's first meeting. The discussion was quite calm and short. Even the item on a procedure for electing the upper house speaker did not provoke heated debates, although the vote itself is likely to become the most acute and difficult event at the meeting. The gathering agreed that candidatures for the post of chairman are to be nominated by deputies by secret ballot. Only one name can be written on the ballot. To become the Federation Council chairman, a deputy must poll over half the total votes. A special reservation stipulates that the speaker and his deputies cannot represent one and the same subject of the Federation. When discussing the issue of "notorious quorum" and keeping in mind the constant lack of it at sessions of the former Supreme Soviet legislature, the lawmakers ruled that "a meeting is regarded as having legal powers if the attendance is no less than two thirds of the elected deputies".
