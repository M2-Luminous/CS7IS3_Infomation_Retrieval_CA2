The time has come to launch "true coordination of macroeconomic policies" which does not yet exist. This is what President Delors told Parliament in his statement on the forthcoming European Summit. He added that it will be necessary, in Corfu, to "keep the white paper at the centre of discussions and economic and social debates." Public opinion would not understand if the Summit did not adopt a concrete programme to be implemented immediately and financed by the major networks, said President Delors who said he hoped there would be an end to the "ridiculous polemic on the question of knowing whether the Community may or may not borrow, as if this was the first time it had borrowed." The group chaired by Mr. Christophersen must reach a conclusion, and there must be an annexed document in Corfu with a list of concrete projects, added Mr. Delors. He pointed out that the report of the other group set up in the context of the white paper, the Bangemann Group is "almost ready." Employment must remain the white paper's top priority, stressed Mr. Delors, and the Commission should propose new initiatives, not only in Corfu but also at the December summit meeting in Essen and after.
