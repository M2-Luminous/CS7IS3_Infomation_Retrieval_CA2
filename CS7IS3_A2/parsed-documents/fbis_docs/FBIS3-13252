When he arrives Foreign Minister Kozyrev will hear Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' reservations about Russia's latest initiatives with regard to the peace process. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: [Begin recording] [Raz] Israel's political leadership would gladly forgo Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's unexpected visit. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres have both officially rejected the initiative, proposed one week ago by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov, to reconvene an international conference or send a Russian official on a shuttle mission to the Middle East. That is why they were surprised by this afternoon's report. [Rabin] I heard about it on the radio. The deputy foreign minister also made this proposal. We have no intention of holding a second Madrid conference. We have no intention of permitting any international presence beyond what was agreed upon in the Declaration of Principles -- and I am clearly referring to a nonmilitary international presence in the Gaza Strip and Jericho after agreement is reached with the Palestinians on the Gaza-Jericho First proposal, and following or during the implementation of the agreement. [Raz] Prime Minister Rabin expressed concern about the very future of the political process in light of Russia's desire to become more involved without prior coordination with the United States. [Rabin] I prefer that things continue the way they have been handled up till now. I hope this step will not complicate the chances of renewing the peace negotiations both with the Palestinians and with the relevant Arab states. At any rate, we will graciously receive any visitor here but at the same time unequivocally explain our position. [Raz] Israel's position will also be expressed by Foreign Minister Peres, who is annoyed by the Russian attempt to reconvene the Madrid conference. [Peres] I do not understand why. First of all, we have to implement what has already been agreed upon. The Middle East cannot constantly be inundated with declarations. It is time to take actual steps. [Raz] So this proposal is unacceptable to Israel? [Peres] We said that it does not strike us as particurlarly constructive. [Raz] When he arrives on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will be apprised of the Israeli leadership's reservations and doubts with regard to his proposal. [end recording]
