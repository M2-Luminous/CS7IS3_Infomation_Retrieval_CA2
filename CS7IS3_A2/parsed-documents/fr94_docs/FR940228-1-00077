FR940228-1-00077 FR940228-1-00010 Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional certification for institutions that seek a renewal of participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility under proposed ยง668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient financial and administrative resources to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement. For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow arrangement where an approved third party controls the institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last complete award year for which figures are available; the Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV, HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of liabilities that may be identified during the institution's period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received by an institution during the last complete award year for which figures are available provides the most accurate indication of the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an institution that could meet this proposed standard has established a track record for meeting its financial obligations. The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last complete award year for which figures are available because the institution would not have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any institution that has not been considered financially responsible under proposed ยง668.15 at any time within the past five years, or if the institution is not considered financially responsible for one of the following reasons (as delineated in ยง668.15(c)(2)): (1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon a final decision of the Secretary.
