Platelets are activated when they come in contact with foreign objects and lose their shape, but in blood this newly developed polymer membrane has a surface similar to that of the inside of a blood vessel, so it can extract platelets without causing their deformation. It is expected that this membrane will find a wide range of applications such as in the manufacture of platelet-derived preparations used for hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, in the diagnosis of illnesses, etc. The research group will announce its results at the meeting of the Society for Polymer Science to be held in Kyoto on 31 May. To remove platelets the newly developed membrane is placed in contact with blood for about one hour. Because the platelets attach themselves to the membrane, when it is removed from the blood and washed in physiological saline, non-activated platelets can be obtained. The polymer membrane is a sheet of the biocompatible organic material MPC (methacryloyl hydroxyethyl phosphorylcholine) to which positively and negatively charged substances have been bound. When blood comes in contact with the MPC membrane, the phospholipids in the blood adhere tightly to the surface of the membrane. Because phospholipids are components of the cell membranes in blood vessels, etc., the membrane is not recognized as a foreign object in the blood. The group believes that is why the platelets do not become activated. Blood component preparations made from platelets are used for hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, but activated platelets cannot be administered because they cause blood clots. Currently platelets are extracted from blood by centrifugation to avoid activation, but it appears that they can be separated much more easily when this membrane is used. It appears that it is possible to extract erythrocytes and leukocytes as well by varying the substances bound to the MPC membrane. In the future this membrane may find wide-ranging applications such as in the study and diagnosis of diseases in which blood cell abnormalities occur.
