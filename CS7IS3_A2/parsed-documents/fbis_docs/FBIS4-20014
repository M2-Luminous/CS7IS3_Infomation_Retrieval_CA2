Partly alarming facts that caused the IAEA to call for its closure were shown. Ukraine will continue its operation. In their report, the IAEA experts state that the probability that the nuclear power plant will break down has been reduced; at the same time, however, they expressed concerns in the event that the reactor is operated outside normal conditions as a result of wrong handling. In the opinion of the IAEA, the training and safety concepts of the radiation protection staff should remain a subject of criticism. The computer program by which operations are controlled has been improved, but the hardware restricts the possibilities. Further shortcomings that the IAEA ascertained are the absence of a second shutdown system and an emergency control room for blocks I and II. The three main steam tubes run above the only control room.
