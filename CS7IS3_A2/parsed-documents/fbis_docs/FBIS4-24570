Commission on Sustainable Development. Zhang Kunmin, head of the Chinese delegation, made these remarks while addressing high-level members of the commission on Thursday [26 May]. He said that trade policy measures for environmental purposes should not be turned into means towards unjust discrimination or limitations on international trade. He added that any environmental measures aimed at solving cross- boundary and global environmental issues should be based on international consensus. The commission, a watchdog body set up to monitor progress after the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development--known as the Earth Summit--held its second session on May 16-27. The Chinese delegate called attention to the following points in taking a positive approach toward the question of trade and the environment. First, development and trade and environmental protection should be made to promote and compliment each other instead of being antagonistic. In handling the relationship between trade and the environment, a long-range, positive approach should be followed, and efforts should be made in both fields. Any unbalanced approach which would hurt one or the other should be avoided. Second, the focal point should be on measures benefiting the greatest number of people, he said. Since only a limited number of countries possess advanced and environmentally sound technologies and products and the financial ability to popularize them, efforts should be made to ensure that mankind can benefit from them through open, nondiscriminatory and equitable international trade, and through technology transfer and cooperation. He urged particular efforts against trends based on narrow business interest considerations, and those unjustly harmful to the trade opportunities of developing countries. Finally, he said, emphasis should be placed on assistance and support. To combine trade with sustainable development, corresponding means and abilities are needed, particularly financial and technological resources. He urged the international community to help developing states build and improve their abilities through real action, including financial support, technology transfer and the opening of markets. The Chinese delegate called on the international community to carry out the commitments made at the Earth Summit as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. Zhang said he expects the commission's deliberations on trade and the environment to have a positive impact on the relevant discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the U.N. Conference On trade and Development.
