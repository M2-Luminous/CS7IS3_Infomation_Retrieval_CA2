Subpart B of part 658 is revised to read as follows: Subpart B_Management Measures 658.20␣Fishing years. 658.21␣Allowable levels of harvest. 658.22␣Size limits. 658.23␣Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. 658.24␣Southwest Florida seasonal closure. 658.25␣Shrimp/stone crab separation zones. 658.26␣Texas closure. 658.27␣Prevention of gear conflicts. 658.28␣Specifically authorized activities. Subpart B_Management Measures §658.20 Fishing years. The fishing year for royal red shrimp begins on January 1. The fishing year for other species of shrimp begins on May 1. §658.21 Allowable levels of harvest. (a) Quotas. The quota for royal red shrimp is 431,200 lb (195.6 mt), tail weight.
