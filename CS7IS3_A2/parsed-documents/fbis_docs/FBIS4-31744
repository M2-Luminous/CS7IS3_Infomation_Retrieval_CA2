Magvasi has expressed himself in favor of abolishing clearing between Slovakia and the Czech Republic [CR]. He based his statement, among other things, on the positive increase in the two states' foreign currency reserves. In that connection, Deputy Prime Minister B. Schmognerova told CTK that, in a memorandum to the IMF, the Slovak Government committed itself to rendering accounts in convertible currencies in trade with the Czech Republic by the end of 1995 at the latest. Slovak National Bank (NBS) Deputy Governor M. Jusko has told SME that, officially, the Slovak Republic only declared that it is interested in abolishing the so-called clearing account old-block. Unfortunately, in this context, the two governments have adopted resolutions that are not consistent with each other. M. Jusko sees three possible alternatives. First, that the governments will agree upon an acceptable compromise. Second, that one of the sides will make concessions. The third alternative would be if one of the sides, in harmony with its interests, were to make a sovereign decision and withdraw unilaterally from the payments agreement. According to M. Jusko, the fact that the CR is striving to introduce a fully convertible currency quickly means that interest in abolishing the payments agreement will come more from the Czech side. On the other hand, in view of the fact that the foreign currency reserves are increasing and that measures to liberalize foreign currency relations may be expected, "we also must consider certain steps that do not have to be in harmony with the payments agreement," added M. Jusko. According to M. Jusko, the situation in clearing is favorable for the NBS at the moment. The overall balance recently amounted to around 44 million ECU in Slovakia's favor.
