Colonel 'Ali Qasim Taleb, the sacked Yemeni Navy chief, told the Aden daily OCTOBER 14 the northern targets were hit late Wednesday in the Kharaz region, near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Straits on the Red Sea. Earlier the northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih claimed they had captured a southern mechanised brigade based at Kharaz. A northern military communique quoted by the official news agency SABA said northern forces had captured all the tanks and artillery of the southern 25th Mechanised Brigade, and many of the brigade's 1,200 soldiers had surrendered. Southern leaders told AFP Wednesday that the north was attempting to open up a new front in the Bab al-Mandeb Straits area. Both sides appeared to be heading for a stalemate along the pre-unification border formerly dividing conservative North Yemen and the Marxist south. Salih's southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, sacked by the northern-dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire depended on the withdrawal of northern forces from the south. "The return of forces to their positions (before unification in May 1990) is an important condition for ending the fighting," al-Bid told reporters at his home overlooking Aden. A simmering feud between Salih and al-Bid over political and economic reforms boiled over into all-out war a week ago.
