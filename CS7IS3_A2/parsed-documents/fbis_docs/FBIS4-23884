"There is a lot of fighting, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is putting the Army under heavy pressure but it is defending itself very well," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. In France, military sources said that the Central African Republic, located to the northwest of Rwanda across Zaire, would serve as an operational platform for the operation France hopes rapidly to mount. The RPF strongly opposes French intervention in Rwanda, arguing that Paris armed the government army and helped train extremist militias from the Hutu majority accused of slaughtering hundreds of thousands of minority Tutus. The mainly Tutsi rebels are laying siege to Army positions in Kigali, but Plante said the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) had "not noted a significant change in the positions of one side or the other." The fighting was particularly intense in Kigali city centre, in the southwest of the city and around two military camps in the north and east. On Sunday night, the sky over the city was streaked with flares and tracer bullets, while the sound of rocket launchers thundered from the surrounding hills. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Sunday that French officials would begin contacts this week with Rwandan Government officials and with Rwandan guerrilla representatives in New York. He told French television station TF1 on Sunday that "we are making a great efforts to convince the Rwandan Patriotic Front that this operation is not aimed against them." Juppe has also stressed that his plan was humanitarian and ruled out going alone or without backing from the UN Security Council, but so far only Senegal has made a concrete pledge of sending troops to join the French. Italian Defence Minister Desare Previti headed for Paris on Monday, as the daily REPUBBLICA published an interview in which he said Rome would join in a military operation in Rwanda, but only if the deployment was based on an international accord. Military sources in France said French troops, numbering from 1,000 to 2,000 men, would be stationed in countries bordering on Rwanda, probably Zaire and Tanzania, but would not fly into Kigali for security reasons. The sources said the operation would be "strictly neutral" and also ruled out neighbouring Burundi for the deployment of troops, since it too has a Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, with a history of ethnic strife. [passage omitted] An informed source in Paris said the planned French operation would begin in an area where Tutsis are under threat. Tutsis were said to make up about 15 percent of the population of some 7.5 million before the latest bloodletting claimed up to 500,000 lives. The United Nations said Monday it was hoping that fighters would observe a truce so that civilians sandwiched between the front lines could be evacuated. Such operations were interrupted Sunday because of ferocious fighting. A UN plan to reopen Kigali Airport, closed for the past two weeks, on Sunday came to nothing after officials failed to obtain written security guarantees from the government forces, Plante said. Last month, the RPF seized the airport which is also the base for the Ghanaian contingent of the UN mission, which is currently using Uganda's Entebbe Airport to receive its supplies and humanitarian aid which is then trucked into Rwanda. [passage omitted] Juppe and other French officials have indicated that any French- led operation would be a limited one preceding the UN redeployment. Military sources said troops would come from France and from French bases in the Central African Republic, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire or Djibouti.
