Murad's secretary refused to acknowledge official receipt of the resignation, forcing Ghazi to send it with a bailiff on Sunday morning to the party, but party officials also refused to acknowledge receipt of the resignation. Having failed to get either the party leader, or the party itself, to recognize his resignation, Ghazi again asked a bailiff from the Public Prosecution Office to hand the resignation either to the party leader or the party's secretariat. AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that Ghazi's resignation is due to his disapproval of the party's recent shift from liberal to Nasirist and fundamentalist policies. Ghazi says that the change is unprecedented and contradicts the party's program. Party leader Murad this week ordered the discontinuation of the weekly edition of AL-AHRAR, the newspaper for which Ghazi served as chief editor for the past 14 years. Murad also appointed Ghazi as chief editor of the daily [as published] newspaper AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH. It is worth noting that AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH basically functions as a vehicle for legal announcements. Speaking to AL-MUSAWWAR, Ghazi said: We respect the Nasirists and anyone whose political views vary with ours. But we are against sudden changes of the party's program and orientation about which party members are not consulted. It is unacceptable for one person to make party members alter their principles and doctrine against their will. Such actions violate the law of political parties.
