Moreover North Korea has transferred most of its military facilities underground, so an attack by U.S. forces on the missile facilities is difficult.'' The Nodong-1, a modified Scud-C ballistic missile having a 1,000-kilometer range, is capable of reaching most areas of Japan except parts of Hokkaido.
