During my visit, I have met with the major Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Hosokawa, and have frankly exchanged views with them regarding the direction in which the ROK and Japan should move to promote their friendly relations amid rapidly changing international trends. Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have agreed that both the ROK and Japan, as neighboring countries jointly pursuing freedom, democracy, and the market economic system, should cooperate anew on leading the Asian-Pacific era. Toward this end, both the ROK and Japan must establish multilateral friendly relations as soon as possible. Also, we have agreed to practically strengthen cooperation to promote these relations. Peace and security on the Korean peninsula, located in the center of Northeast Asia, are very important in maintaining peace and security in that area. For the stability of the Korean peninsula, first, North Korea must dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development and North-South dialogue must be earnestly carried out. Despite our efforts to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, the nuclear issue has been finally referred to the UN Security Council because of North Korea's insincere attitude. I think it is very regrettable. The North Korean attitude is an important factor. If North Korea changes its attitude even at this moment, we will take corresponding steps. Regarding this, during these talks, the ROK and Japan have agreed to further strengthen their close cooperation to immediately resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, including cooperation in the UN Security Council. Prime Minister Hosokawa and I hope that the ongoing reform in political, economic, social, and all other areas -- both in the ROK and Japan - will be successfully carried out, and we are of the same opinion that the reform will ultimately consolidate the new relations between the ROK and Japan. The conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations and the beginning of the new world economic order are expected to aggravate the trade competition among countries. In the recent talks, the ROK and Japan have agreed to make joint efforts for continuous development of Asian-Pacific economic cooperation and to closely cooperate with each other to cope with the new trade round [saeroun tongsang raundue taeunghame issoso]. We also agreed to break the trade imbalance between the two countries and try to restore balance by expanding economic relations through close economic cooperation. The two countries also promised to make joint efforts to further develop mature [songsukan] ROK-Japanese relations, which began to ripen last year, with the inauguration of the ROK civilian government and Prime Minister Hosokawa's ROK visit as momentum. If the ROK and Japan deepen mutual trust for the bright future with a correct understanding of these promises, the road for a good-neighbor relationship will open wide. Next year will be significant because it will mark the 30th anniversary of the normalization of ROK-Japanese diplomatic relations. I expect the peoples of the two countries will make efforts to further mature ROK-Japanese relations on this occasion. I am sure my visit to Japan will serve as an important turning point in establishing mature ROK-Japanese relations extending toward Asia and the world. Thank you.
