During the visit, he met with His Majesty King Husayn and several senior Jordanian officials. In press statements, Papoulias said that the EC understands His Majesty King Husayn's great role, and fully understands both Jordan's needs and the necessity of extending aid to it after it has sustained damages as a result of the Gulf war and the inspections in the port of al-'Aqabah. Papoulias added that he conveyed to King Husayn a letter of thanks and appreciation from the EC for his majesty's role in the reconciliation among Yemeni leaders. Asked about the possibility of requesting the EC to disarm the Israeli settlers in the occupied Arab territories, Papoulias said: There is a joint declaration by the EC. We believe we can push this request forward. He noted that an appropriate atmosphere should be created to resume the peace negotiations by pooling various efforts. Papoulias said that after ending his regional tour on Sunday, he will head for Brussels to meet with his EC colleagues in order to brief them on the outcome of his tour. He expressed hope that the EC will take new initiatives on the region in order to promote the peace process. Asked whether it is possible to convince Israel to allow the deployment of international troops in the occupied Arab territories to protect the civilians there, Papoulias said: We will seriously discuss this problem. An alternative solution would be to send international observers, so we can secure the resumption of the peace negotiations and dialogue. We will also discuss various ways and means to guarantee security for the Palestinians. Papoulias was seen off at Amman airport by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; the Jordanian ambassador to Greece; and the Greek ambassador in Amman.
