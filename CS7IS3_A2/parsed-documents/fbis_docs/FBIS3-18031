The warning came as senior ministers stepped up their efforts -- in advance of Sinn Fein's annual conference near Dublin this weekend -- to persuade the IRA's political wing to accept the Downing Street declaration. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, used speeches in Birmingham and London to offer fresh reassurance to nationalists about the government's aims and intentions. Sir Patrick sought to cover new ground in explaining how London expected north-south relations to develop. He emphasised that a settlement could provide new safeguards against discrimination. As unionists in Ulster reacted suspiciously to Sir Patrick's remarks Mr James Nicholson, UUP [Ulster Unionist Party], chairman and leader of the party's team in the political talks process, warned that London and Dublin should "in no way" take the position of the province's largest party for granted. Mr Nicholson, an MEP [member of European Parliament], said from Brussels that the UUP would not return to roundtable talks unless there was "a strong possibility that the process would move forward in a positive manner." He emphasised that the UUP had not endorsed the declaration. Mr Nicholson complained that his last meeting with Mr Michael Ancrarn, the Northern Ireland minister co-ordinating the talks process, was "quite frankly, a waste of time." He said: "The process was going nowhere. The whole thing does not add up as far as we are concerned." Sir Patrick said there was a role for "new institutions which will recruit...the talents of all the people in the island of Ireland, so as to develop purposefully and profitably the relationship between the two parts of the island." He said that as trust and confidence grew north-south institutions could "help transform the relationship between nationalists and unionists and -- but only if it was so agreed they could take on an increasingly dynamic role on the island and beyond it." There was "no necessity for these institutions to impinge on either country's sovereign independence." Sir Patrick said a political accommodation "might well" include "some form of entrenchment of human rights." He added: "There could be agreement to ensure that the nationalist and unionist identities would genuinely and in practical ways, enjoy parity of esteem."
