The sources told AL-HAYAH that the security authorities arrested two leading Muslim Brotherhood figures on suspicion of links with the "Jordanian Afghans" groups and seized a quantity of arms and explosives in their possession. They said that among those arrested and interrogated were 'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, who was released on bail, and 'Abdallah al-Hashayikah, a leading Muslim Brotherhood figure suspected of links with an Afghan group. The same sources said that the security authorities also arrested 'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali on suspicion of belonging to an Afghan organization after the discovery of explosives at a children's nursery run by the Muslim Brotherhood in al-Karak. They added that the nursery, which is attached to the city's Islamic Center, is managed by Muslim Brotherhood member 'Imad al-Sawalimah, who was also arrested. The security sources stressed that "all the arrests, without exception, were made on the orders of the attorney general after the seizure of large quantities of arms and explosives." They added that the number of people detained in connection with the explosions in two movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' as well as incidents of burglary and planting of devices discovered before exploding, has reached 70. Those against whom evidence is unearthed will be referred to trial. According to government sources, some of the detainees have links with foreign Islamic organizations whose aim is to undermine Jordan's security and stability through explosions and theassassination of Jordanian figures. Asked about the reasons for the arrest of members of Fatah--the Revolutionary Council [FRC], they said that members of Abu-Nidal's organization in Jordan were arrested after the Lebanese judiciary authorities obtained evidence of the organization's complicity in the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah on 28 January in Beirut, and on the basis of that evidence "the organization is now considered a terrorist organization." They added that "members who, in the view of the attorney general, had close links with the organization were placed under precautionary restrictions and the rest were released." The Islamic Action Front issued a statement the day before yesterday criticizing the security authorities and accusing them of "practices and violations which are worrying to the Jordanian public and which have revived the specter of martial law in the guise of democracy."
