FR940207-2-00050 FR940207-2-00028 Public Notice and Comment The procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions, 10 CFR Part 903, have been followed by Western in the development of the P&hyph;DP firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission rates. The provisional P&hyph;DP rates for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service represent an increase of more than 1 percent in total P&hyph;DP revenues; therefore, it is a major rate adjustment as defined at 10 CFR §§903.2(e) and 903.2(f)(1). The distinction between a minor and major rate adjustment is used only to determine the public procedures for the rate adjustment. The following summarizes the steps Western took to ensure involvement of interested parties in the rate process: 1. A Federal Register notice was published on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19904), officially announcing the proposed P&hyph;DP rate adjustments for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service; initiating the public consultation and comment period; announcing the June 19, 1992, public information forum and the June 30, 1992, public information and comment forum; and presenting procedures for public participation. 2. A letter was mailed to all P&hyph;DP customers and other interested parties on May 19, 1992, providing a copy of the P&hyph;DP proposed rate adjustments brochure and announcing the informal customer meeting. The informal customer meeting was held on June 3, 1992, in Phoenix, Arizona. At this informal meeting, Western representatives explained the need for the increase and answered questions from those attending. 3. At the public information forum held on June 19, 1992, Western explained the need for the proposed rate adjustments and answered questions from those attending. Western also announced a second public comment forum and the extension of the consultation and comment period for the P&hyph;DP. 4. At the public information forum and public comment forum held on June 30, 1992, Western explained the need for the proposed P&hyph;DP rate adjustments in greater detail and answered questions. 5. On August 6, 1992, a Federal Register notice was published (57 FR 34776) formally announcing the extension of the consultation and comment period through September 28, 1992, for the proposed rate adjustments for the P&hyph;DP. 6. An additional public comment forum was held on September 11, 1992, to give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed P&hyph;DP rates for the record. Nine people, who represent customers and customer groups, made oral comments. 7. Thirty-one written comment letters were received during the 143-day consultation and comment period. The consultation and comment period ended September 28, 1992. 8. A letter was mailed to all P&hyph;DP customers and other interested parties on June 29, 1993, announcing the reopening of the consultation and comment period and providing a copy of an addendum to the P&hyph;DP proposed rate adjustments brochure. This letter also announced the public information/public comment forum to be held on July 14, 1993, in Phoenix, Arizona. 9. On July 13, 1993, a Federal Register notice was published (58 FR 37731) formally announcing the reopening of the consultation and comment period on the proposed P&hyph;DP firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service rate adjustments. 10. At the public information forum held on July 14, 1993, Western representatives explained the need to reopen the consultation and comment period and answered questions. The consultation and comment period was reopened due to an unexpected increase in purchased power in FY 1993. 11. The public comment forum was held on July 14, 1993, to give the public another opportunity to comment on the proposed P&hyph;DP rates for the record. Seven people, who represent customers and customer groups, made oral comments. 12. Nineteen written comment letters were received during the second consultation and comment period of 70 days. The second consultation and comment period ended on September 7, 1993.
