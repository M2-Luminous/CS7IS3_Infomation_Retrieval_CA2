The spokesman said: All of the Hong Kong affairs advisers jointly recruited by the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and XINHUA Hong Kong Branch are appointed in a personal capacity, but party representatives will never be invited to take up such posts. This point was repeatedly stated when the Hong Kong Affairs advisers were appointed. However, after accepting his appointment as a Hong Kong affairs adviser, Mr. Cheung claimed that if the "Democratic Party" Central Committee decided that there was no need for someone to act as a Hong Kong affairs adviser and that person must resign, he would follow the decision. This violates our above-mentioned principle of recruiting Hong Kong affairs advisers and is thus unacceptable. The spokesman also said: In the future, Mr. Cheung is still welcome to give us, in a personal capacity, useful and constructive advice about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and a smooth transition.
