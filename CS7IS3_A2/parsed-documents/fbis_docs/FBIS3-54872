The Russian-American summit is known to be scheduled for January 12-15. "Now it is difficult to say whether the Moscow summit will become a tripartite one," a top-ranking official said during his conversation with Interfax. He explained that much would depend upon Kravchuk's position. "The reason for his presence in Moscow is to reconfirm all commitments taken by Ukraine without any exception," he underlined. As the diplomat said, it means that Ukraine must confirm its adherence to the START-1 Treaty and guarantee its joining the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] as a non-nuclear state. "Any reservations or provisions set forth by the Ukrainian parliament during the ratification of the START-1 treaty cannot be recognized as acceptable. Neither Russia, nor the United States would agree to this," said the diplomat. He reiterated that President Kravchuk himself declared his intention to submit the START-1 Treaty to the country's new Supreme Soviet, to be elected March 27, for another ratification. "Nevertheless, there are many unclear aspects in Kiev's position. That is why one cannot say for sure that Kravchuk's visit to Moscow will take place," he indicated.
