When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the association on its 60th founding anniversary and welcomed the association's friends to visit Beijing. He said: The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong is a business group with extensive influence. Over the years you have accomplished a great deal of work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development, as well as in supporting China's reform, opening up, and modernization. I hope you will continue to work hard to make new contributions to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity before and after 1997. Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the interests of all the Chinese people, including our countrymen in Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance. We will unswervingly implement this principle. He pointed out: Much work remains to be done in implementing the "one country, two systems" principle and in maintaining Hong Kong's smooth transition and its stability and prosperity after 1997. Just like accomplishing all other projects, we must strategically despise them but tactically take them seriously. So not only must we have the determination and confidence, but we must also have the capabilities and methods for accomplishing them. He urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely as possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens themselves."
