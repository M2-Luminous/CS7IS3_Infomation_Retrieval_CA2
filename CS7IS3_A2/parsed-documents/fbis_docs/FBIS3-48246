FBIS3-48246 "dreas016__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Ozawa Criticized for Inadequate Leadership 942B0052A Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Jan 94 p 4--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0052A Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Yoshihisa Inoue, political reporter: "Writer Critiques Ozawa's Five-Month Performance"] [Text] Immediately following establishment of the Hosokawa government, I pointed out in this newspaper that, "Although there is criticism of the dual power structure, party leader Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] played the foremost role in establishing the coalition government and should assume responsibility for the future of the government." However, in reviewing Mr. Ozawa's record for the past five months, I must conclude that my expectations were betrayed. I cannot help but feel that he emphasized "destruction of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and assumption of leadership in the ruling coalition" rather than "efforts to create a new government for the people." I would like to address Mr. Ozawa now with the words, "Do not take actions that will minimize the importance of politicians, but follow the cardinal path for politicians." The Hosokawa government unmistakably portrays the qualities of a dual power structure. The "official" leader is Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and, although he has dropped somewhat in public opinion polls, he enjoys very high support ratings for his cabinet in comparison to those of previous LDP prime ministers. The "unofficial" leader, needless to say, is Mr. Ozawa. Ever since the establishment of the new government, it has been faced with three major policy options. They were the revision of and balloting on the draft legislation for the political reform laws when they passed the House of Representatives without the participation of LDP members, opening of the rice markets and compilation of the new fiscal year budget after the end of the last calendar year. The standard viewpoint now is that the handling of each of the three issues was based on concepts advocated by Mr. Ozawa. I see some logic in the handling of the rice issue, but question the handling of the other two issues. In order to arrange for a compromise with the LDP, there was talk of fixing the ceiling for small electoral districts to 280 and a block system for the proportional representation districts. However, the ruling coalition acceded only to an increase in ceiling for small electoral districts from 250 to 270. It appears that the hard-line position taken against the LDP involved the sidetracking of efforts by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to seek a coordinated position with the LDP and inducing a further disintegration of the LDP. I had the same impression even when they pushed through a major 45-day extension of the Diet session. Even under 38 years of LDP rule, it was rare for the Diet session to be extended for the "number of days proposed" by the ruling party. I sensed an attempt to worsen the predicament of the LDP. And that was not the sole effect of the extension. Realization of the major extension of the Diet session, in effect, blocked any potential for retreat on the part of the Hosokawa government. If the prime minister who publicly committed himself to passage of the political reform laws by the end of the last calendar year fails to attain passage during the extended Diet session, his only remaining options will be the dissolution of the House of Representatives or mass resignation of the cabinet. That being the case, the prime minister is being treated "no better than a 100-yen disposable cigarette lighter." If the ruling coalition were to seek smooth sailing of Diet deliberations concerning political reform, it should have sought a compromise with the LDP about extension of the Diet session. They should have also given the prime minister an escape route from the pending situation. I also have difficulty in seeing any logic behind the compilation of the budget after the calendar year end. Mr. Ozawa, who served as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the Takeshita cabinet and in the important post of LDP secretary general in the Kaifu government should have realized the ill effects of not compiling the budget by the end of the last calendar year in these recessionary times. Mr. Ozawa might refute these statements in this manner, "I am fully aware of those facts. This is a case where both the ruling coalition and the Hosokawa government are taking a stand with their backs against the wall. Moreover, political reform represents the `plan of the century' for Japanese politics." However, I do not agree with such a position. The ruling party has the obligation to constantly determine the majority desire of the general public and to strive for realization of those desires. If one were to weigh the significance of political reform and relief from the current serious recessionary situation, it should be obvious as to which should be given priority. Any conclusion to the above comparison should be self-evident if one would only weigh the ill effects on the welfare of the general public between a one-month delay in implementing procedures for economic recovery versus a similar delay in the passage of the political reform laws. Any failure with respect to action on the economic front will only serve to worsen the prime minister's position. I have other reasons for being unhappy with Mr. Ozawa. The issue pertains to the general contractor situation. Why is it that he hesitates to take the initiative in testifying before the Diet? Although Mr. Ozawa emphasized in comments before a press conference on 8 November 1993 about a 5 million yen contribution from Kajima that "the contribution has been properly accounted for under the Political Funds Control Law," he did not clarify which political funding organization received the contribution. He has thus failed to give enough clarification to dispel any suspicion about the donation. His position on the issue is clearly inconsistent with a book authored by him which reads, "We must publicly divulge every yen of receipts and disbursements concerning political funds and provide complete transparency concerning the flow of such funds." Initially, the Social Democratic Party of Japan launched a move to summon Mr. Ozawa to testify as a witness in the matter, but withdrew the demand based on opposition from within the ruling coalition. This situation disqualifies the ruling coalition from speaking of political reform and reflects a failure to recognize the gravity of the problem. I will express one more grievance. The incident arising from the barring of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and SANGYO KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters from press conferences reflected a high degree of immaturity by Mr. Ozawa. I couldn't believe my ears when he said, "Press conferences are conducted as a matter of service and are not obligatory." I would like to see Mr. Ozawa conduct himself so that he does not "belittle himself." In observing Mr. Ozawa in the past several years, I get the "impression that he constantly seeks the shortest possible route to achieve his goals." I do not insist that his approach is wrong, but the resistance posed is occasionally so overwhelming that he is forced to take a "circuitous route." Attempting to force his way around probably finds him short of resources to attain his ultimate goal. It is definitely a case where the prime minister demonstrates performance that is no more than that of an amateur and it is probably no easy task to manage an eight-party wooden-mosaic-like ruling coalition. But, Mr. Ozawa must have formed the Hosokawa government well aware of such limitations. At the Shinseito general meeting of members of both houses on 4 January, Mr. Ozawa announced, "I hope to serve the coalition in the new year without being as self-centered as I was during the last year." I would like to see him use the new year as an occasion to deal with Japanese politics in a transitory stage with renewed resolve from the vantage point of a national leader.
