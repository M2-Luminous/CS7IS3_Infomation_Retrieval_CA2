The talks are to concentrate on "reaching cohesion between the legislations of the Crimea and Ukraine." After the first round of these negotiations the Crimean Supreme Soviet severely criticized its own delegation for making too many unilateral concessions. "They demanded that the composition of the working group should be reviewed, and so today the new composition was approved. The criterion for inclusion was Crimean patriotism. Only those deputies who had voted for the restoration of the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 were included in the group." The working group has been instructed to be guided by the 1992 Constitution, and to "proceed from the idea that in the process of delimitation of rights and duties between Ukraine and the autonomous republic, the Crimea is of it own accord delegating some powers to Ukraine." These are very tough instructions, Plotnikov said, especially since Ukraine insists on the revocation of the 1992 Crimean Constitution.
