Speaking at ceremonies and events for Navy Day, he said the UN had so far not approached Italy on the timing or modalities of an Italian contribution. "The only request we have received so far is for a C-130 transport plane, which we sent at once," he reported. According to Previti, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino is pursuing policies whereby there will be a greater Italian involvement in peace operations. "Naturally," he added, "they could never be unilateral or fail to take account of the international context in which they are being promoted." Previti also recalled that, at the Group of Seven summit in Naples, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will be proposing a UN task force for humanitarian missions such as those needed in situations such as Rwanda's. "The idea is to rationalise the possible forms of humanitarian intervention the world can make in the most tortured situations of war and calamity," he asserted. In other points, in his official speech and a later press conference, Previti said he would be trying to reverse the past trend towards defence cuts, saying the objective remains to modernise and re-shape the armed forces on the principle of "more quality, less quantity." "The Cold War is over," he said, adding that the use of the Italian armed forces must now be only a "function of the country's international presence." Previti also said military service would be reduced in favour of an increase in the number of volunteer servicemen.
