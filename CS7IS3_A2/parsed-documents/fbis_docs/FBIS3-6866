However, that support is strictly for humanitarian purposes only, he said. Thailand will repatriate them at the appropriate time," Gen Wichit told reporters gathered at Government House. The defense chief said the government is depending on soldiers to do their jobs responsibly in order to maintain security along the Thai-Cambodia border under the current round of heavy fighting. "The news reports describing the current situation are still confusing," he said. "It is not certain whether the government has captured the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin as reported. I think the Khmer Rouge will have to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics or face being overrun by the Cambodian government troops." The fighting between Khmer Rouge troops and the Cambodian forces intensified Saturday, resulting in the apparent government capture of Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold and a major source of gems and timber which the rebel forces sold to underwrite their operations. Situated in the northwestern part of Cambodia, Pailin borders Thailand at Chanthaburi province. When there is heavy fighting, Khmer Rouge families -- mostly women, children and elderly people -- flood Thailand's eastern soils at Ban Phakkat of Pong Nam Ron district in Chanthaburi. Both groups are still engaged in heavy battle. The government dispatched soldiers to try and wipe out the Khmer Rouge forces, and the rebels have returned to the guerrilla warfare tactics which have served them well in the past. The sound of gunfire can be heard at the border from time to time, and many Thai businessmen who run gem operations in Pailin have returned home. Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani said in a press conference that he received reliable information that the Cambodian government has indeed captured Pailin. Approximately 25,000 Khmer Rouge family members have poured across the border into Thailand. "We sent Thai soldiers to help these refugees for humanitarian reasons," he said. "We treat refugees the same as we have always treated them. If the situation quiets down and returns to normal, we will send them all back home.
