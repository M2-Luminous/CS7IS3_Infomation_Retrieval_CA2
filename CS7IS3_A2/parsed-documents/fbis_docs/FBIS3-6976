The action is the first taken under the force improvement plan codenamed Yulgok, and it will set a precedent for other weapons system development programs under the scheme, Ministry officials said. At a Yulgok Committee meeting last June, the Ministry tentatively decided to use the Cosys-200k1 system developed by Germany's Atlas Electronik Co. for the KDX. The decision was opposed by some, however, who maintained that a British system was better than the German one in terms of reliability and performance. The German and British suppliers then offered to cut their prices, causing the Ministry to put off a final decision. In view of the system's features, the KDX building process and to ensure the success of the KDX program, the Ministry recently decided to leave the decision up to the Navy, which will operate the system to meet its tactical requirements, an official said. The Navy will select a system next month so that the KDX program can be completed by 1998 as scheduled, he added. Under the KDX program, a state-of-the-art tactical command and fire control system will be developed at a cost of 151 billion won (188 million U.S. dollars) for use in the KDX, the Navy's main warship in the 21st century.
