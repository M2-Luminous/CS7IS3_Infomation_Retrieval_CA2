The fact that the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is virtually only the spokesman of those who concentrated the real political power in their hands, is less important than the fact that Zoran Lilic recently officially proclaimed the things that had started several months ago. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president -- who forced himself on the so-called international community as the only relevant representatives of the Serbs and who is aware of the dark economic future of Serbia should the sanctions last for "1,000 years" as he said himself -- was allegedly promised by the West that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would quickly return to the world if peace and a political solution were reached in Bosnia. According to this version, it is Milosevic's turn to make a move now. He should, as quickly as possible, force the Bosnian Serb leaders to agree to the 51 to 49 percent division of Bosnia. In return, Serbia and Montenegro would gain the same status in the international community as the other former Yugoslav republics. Through the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the state of the Bosnian Serbs would be entitled to reconstruction aid, just like the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia would profit from the reconstruction aid, too, since it is probable that there would be confederal connections between the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the end of the peace agreement implementation process, the Bosnian Serbs would be allowed to secede from the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- if they want to, naturally. Since the initial idea about the political elimination of Radovan Karadzic, as one of the impediments to this aim, has not proved to be quite efficient, other options are being considered now. One of them is that the president of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina cedes his unpleasant role of signing agreements about the Serbian withdrawal from certain territories to somebody else in order to retain the image he has in the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The other possibility is to apply the model of Milan Babic's elimination from the leading position and find a new leader. The options include Nenad Kecmanovic, Nikola Koljevic, and some less-well-known people. "Well-informed" sources even claim that the commander of the army of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina [Ratko Mladic] has been offered a high-ranking position in the Yugoslav Army if he is ready to make compromises. Naturally, all these ideas will not be activated if Karadzic's negotiating team approves of the general model for the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Official Belgrade would compensate them for their approval by insisting that the Serbs "get good territories," first of all the corridor along the Sava River and a part of Sarajevo. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is now working on the creation of the so-called big "coalition for peace," which consists of the following parties, as we have learned so far: the Socialist Party of Serbia, the Democratic Party of Serbia [Depos], the Socialists of Montenegro, and the New Democracy. In order to gain the favor of the West, the regime would especially like the verbally most powerful opponent of the Socialists, Mr. Vuk Draskovic, to enter the coalition. Dusan Mihajlovic -- the new New Democracy leader, who is trying to establish contacts between his coalition partners from the republican government and his election partners from DEPOS -- has been assigned this task. That this is not a joke has been confirmed by the event that took place at a recent SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] Main Committee session, in which Draskovic told his only remaining vice chairman, Mr. Dragoslav Milacic, that he [Milacic] would become federal minister. The SPO chairman is allegedly interested in becoming ambassador to the United States, which is the position also desired by Dragoljub Micunovic, the most famous Democratic Party "dissident." According to reliable sources, Vuk Draskovic was also very keen on entering the government of national unity, so the present events can be considered a continuation of the things that had already been begun. The SPS has the newly established party of Slobodan Rakitic in reserve, since the questionable DEPOS seats in the Chamber of Citizens depend on the ruling coalition. Apart from the use of force according to the principle "if you do not want, Rakitic will take it," the SPS is also applying other tried-and-tested measures, such as the activation of SPS extended arms in the SPO. If the SPO agrees with this proposal, the regime will finally isolate the Serbian Radical Party. The second candidate that would remain outside the "national front" would be Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, and Djindjic could choose between watching how his party opponents are favored and trying to reach power himself. The general pressure on the complete opposition, "which should make the opposite become normal again," comes from clear statements issued by the SPS that it will not organize early elections, which would push the opposition "to the margin," as Mirko Marjanovic would say. Four leading opposition leaders claim that the opposition now only agrees about the name of Radoman Bozovic, the radio-television, and the election system. This is too little to be able to speak about an efficient resistance to the intentions of the leading parties. It is clear that the results of the latest differentiation on the Serbian political scene will depend primarily on the course of the peace negotiations in Bosnia.
