FR940816-1-00039 FR940816-1-00007 VII. Contingency Measures Section 172(c)(9) requires that SIP's provide for the implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the Administrator finds that the nonattainment area has failed to make RFP toward attainment or to attain the primary NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. Following the Administrator's finding, the measures are to ``take effect without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' The EPA interprets this requirement to be that no further rulemaking actions by the State or EPA would be needed to implement the contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13512 and 13543&hyph;544). The EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as the notification of sources, modification of permits, etc., would probably be needed before a measure could be implemented effectively. However, States must show that their contingency measures can be implemented with minimal further action on their part and with no additional rulemaking actions such as public hearings or legislative review. After EPA determines that a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area has failed to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, EPA generally expects all actions needed to effect full implementation of the measures to occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the State of the area's failure. The State should ensure that the measures are fully implemented as expeditiously as practicable after they take effect. The purpose of contingency measures is to ensure that additional measures beyond or in addition to the required ``core'' control measures (i.e. RACM for moderate areas and BACM for serious areas) immediately take effect when the area fails to make RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in order to provide interim public health and welfare protection. The protection is considered ``interim'' because the statute often provides for a more formal SIP revision in order to correct, for example, the failure of an area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (e.g., section 189(b)_serious area plan required upon finding of failure of moderate area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS under 188(b)(2)_and 189(d) (plan revisions required upon failure of serious area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS)). Thus, EPA has noted previously that contingency measures should consist of other available control measures not contained in the applicable core control strategy (57 FR 13543). In designing its contingency measures, the State should also take into consideration the potential nature and extent of any attainment shortfall for the area. The magnitude of the effectiveness of the measures should be calculated to achieve the appropriate percentage of the actual emission reductions required by the SIP control strategy to bring about attainment. The EPA has recommended that contingency measures provide the emission reductions equivalent to 1 year's average increment of RFP (see discussion below).
