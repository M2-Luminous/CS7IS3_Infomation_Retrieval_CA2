Moscow was not the only city to suffer from inadequate nutrition, which has become a problem throughout the vast Russian republic. High prices and low wages have made nutritional deficiency commonplace throughout Russia. In September 1993, families spent 60 percent of their income on food, and retirees, 85 percent (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1994). But today because of inflation, 77 percent of workers earn less than is required for basic subsistence (Moscow TRUD 3 Feb 1994, Moscow IZVESTIYA 5 Feb 1994). Unemployment, strikes and delayed wage payments have further compromised the population's ability to purchase food (Moscow INTERFAX 22 Feb 94, TRUD 19 Feb 94). Russians coped by changing the composition of their diets. Consumption of meat, butter, vegetables and fruit dropped 75 percent, while that of potatoes and bread products increased (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1994). The fat content of Moscow waste water declined sharply to wartime levels, a finding said to indicate poor nutrition (Moscow TRUD 3 Feb 1994). Widespread nutritional deficiencies resulted (Moscow TRUD 3 Feb 1994). The Russian diet is now 25 percent deficient in protein, 50 percent deficient in vitamin C and 20-30 percent deficient in A and B vitamins (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1993). It also lacks sufficient carbohydrates. Sixty percent of children responding to a republic-wide poll said they usually do not get enough to eat (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). Thirteen percent of low-income Russians suffer from true malnutrition (Moscow IZVESTIYA 5 Feb 1994), while borderline malnutrition affects a third of the total population (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 94). Women, children and the elderly seem to be particularly vulnerable. Nutritional deficiencies are reputed to have caused a sharp rise in maternal deaths in 1991-1993 (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 93). Only one child in four enjoys normal health, and half of young children are thinner than normal. Kurgan Oblast children have reportedly fainted from hunger (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). TRUD cites several starvation deaths and suicides apparently motivated by malnutrition. The Krasnodar emergency service recently found the corpse of a starvation victim on the street. The Moscow Main Medical Administration recorded two starvation deaths in Moscow in 1993, a tramp and an elderly woman. Tragically, a Moscow mother unable to feed her son suffocated him and attempted suicide. Autopsies of four elderly suicides in St. Petersburg detected no trace of food in their stomachs (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). Unaffordability of food, rather than lack of it, may be the key to thepresent crisis. Although food production declined in 1993 (Moscow T0RGOVAYA GAZETA 18 Jan 94), agricultural products went unsold (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha acknowledged that his country's 6-8 million ton grain surplus resulted from reduced consumer demand (Moscow INTERFAX 16 Mar 94). According to Deputy Agriculture Minister Vladimir Shcherback, declining consumption was the reason farms reduced herds of livestock and left much of the potato crop unharvested (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). Next year promises to bring smaller crops and higher food prices. Newtariffs on food imports may inflate food prices (Moscow INTERFAX 16 Mar94). Shcherbak predicted that credit costs will reduce the acreage sown and raise the price of agricultural products (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). These factors suggest that both food prices and malnutrition will continue to rise in 1994.
