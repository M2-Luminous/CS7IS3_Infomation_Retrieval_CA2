FBIS4-52891 "dreas094_l_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Philippines ROK Proposes `Special Partnership' With Philippines ROK Proposes `Special Partnership' With Philippines SK1605012494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0038 GMT 16 May 94 SK1605012494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea proposed Monday to form a "special partnership" with the Philippines accenting economic cooperation. The Philippines pledged to support South Korea's bid for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council in 1996-97 and said it will not seek diplomatic normalization with North Korea before resolution of the nuclear problem. Seoul, meanwhile, promised to expand its Economic Cooperation and Development Fund (EDCF) to the Philippines and to improve the status of the 8,000 Filipino workers employed illegally in South Korea. Starting the first working day of his Asian tour here, visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu made the offers in talks with his Filipino counterpart Roberto Romulo, Han's aides said. The "special partnership" would be similar to that South Korea established with Canada this year, but with Manila the goal would be combining Seoul's capital and technology with the resources and labor force available here, they said. "The Philippines is the closest country to South Korea in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Han told reporters Sunday. "We share similar experiences in recent political development, specifically in the democratization process, and there is much we can offer to the Philippines in terms of economic growth experience." "We are thinking of forming a civilian forum between the two countries to highlight other areas of exchange, such as culture and business," said Han. Bilateral trade is rising steadily and registered 1.25 billion U.S. dollars last year, with Seoul posting 934 million dollars in exports. Filipino soldiers, including President Fidel Ramos, fought for the Seoul side during the fratricidal 1950-53 Korean war. Romulo, recalling his country's past cooperation in trying to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis, pledged continued support, the aides said. He sought better conditions for the estimated 8,000 "undocumented" Filipino workers in Korea, requesting that they be allowed to stay longer or the quota of 3,000 who are officially accepted as foreign trainees be increased. Han said he will give the issue positive consideration, the aides said. On the economic front, Han asked Manila to allow active participation by South Korean companies in developing Subic Bay, the former U.S. Naval base now being turned mainly into a tourist resort. On EDCF, Han gave a favorable reply to the 35 million dollars worth of projects under review. The South Korean foreign minister arrived in Manila Sunday morning, his first stop on an 11-day Asian tour taking him later to Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Han called on President Ramos after his talks with Romulo and met with opinion leaders to promote private-level exchanges between the two countries.
