Buwayz began contacts with several world circles and Lebanon's permanent delegation at the United Nations a few hours after the abduction to secure al-Dirani's early release. Buwayz said: I strongly condemn this act, which is an aggression against Lebanon's security and compromises the Middle East peace process at a time when the ongoing negotiations and contacts seek a solution to the crisis. A diplomatic source at the Foreign Ministry said Lebanese diplomatic contacts are under way to discuss lodging a complaint with the Security Council against Israel.
