FR941130-0-00087 FR941130-0-00015 Comments: A few commenters suggested that the Secretary not include a provision in the default reduction plan that would require first-time borrowers to endorse their check and to ``pick up'' any remaining proceeds at the institution. Instead, because many institutions have Federal Perkins loan disbursement systems that do not involve the issuance of a check, they recommended that the borrower's loan amount be credited directly to his or her student account and that any remaining proceeds also be credited to his or her student account, with one commenter recommending that the borrower be notified as to how he or she will receive his or her funds and that the loan funds will be disbursed 30 days after enrollment. One commenter objected to the requirement that the disbursement to a first-time borrower be delayed until 30 days after enrollment. Discussion: The Secretary is sympathetic to the concerns of these commenters but does not agree with the comments to remove the delayed disbursement provision from the default reduction plan. The Secretary reminds the commenters that the purpose of the default reduction plan is to help institutions that have large numbers of their Federal Perkins loan borrowers in default to set up procedures and mechanisms to help keep their borrowers out of default. One aspect of keeping a borrower out of default is to require a face-to-face contact in order to finalize the processing of loan proceeds. This will help ensure that the borrower understands that he or she is receiving a loan and ensures to the institution that the borrower is really enrolling. In addition, delayed disbursement of loan proceeds ensures that the borrower is actually enrolled and continuing his or her studies before disbursing a loan, thus avoiding the situation in which a borrower drops out with a large debt that the borrower cannot repay. Changes: None. Comments: One commenter was particularly concerned about the intrusive nature of some of the requirements of the default reduction plan. This commenter felt that the ability to benefit provisions in the general provisions regulations should be sufficient to ensure that students ``have a reasonable expectation of succeeding in their programs of study.'' This commenter wonders whether institutions with ``open door'' admissions policies would be required to revise these policies, and what an institution is to do if admissions policies are set by a Board of Trustees. This commenter also asserts that there is no evidence that monthly reviews of in-school status will improve an institution's default rate. Discussion: In general, the Secretary does not agree with this commenter. The ability-to-benefit provisions in the Student Assistance General Provisions affords some protection but not all the needed protection. When an institution has a high cohort default rate, one of the first places to look for the cause is to look at who is being admitted to the institution and into what program of study. Students should not be admitted if there is not a reasonable expectation of success. Moreover, it seems only logical that another procedure to follow for eliminating a potential cause of a high cohort default rate is to follow up on enrollment status to ensure that a student is still enrolled and, if not enrolled, to provide exit counselling to the student as soon as possible. The Secretary reminds the commenter that these provisions have been in effect in the FFEL Program for several years and have not had the intrusive effect on admissions policies or the burden of the increased reviews of enrollment status that the commenter fears. Changes: None. Section 674.7␣Expanded Lending Option Comments: One commenter stated that the phrase ``in any academic year'' as it relates to aggregate loan limits is confusing and should be deleted if it suggests that a student who does not borrow in his or her first year can borrow $8,000 in his or her second year. Discussion: The Secretary agrees. Changes: This provision is revised to clarify the distinction between annual and aggregate loan limits. Section 674.9␣Student Eligibility Comments: While several commenters supported the requirement to ``reaffirm'' a Federal Perkins loan debt previously canceled due to total and permanent disability, discharge in bankruptcy, or write-off, some of these commenters believed the term ``reaffirmation'' was a legal term requiring the reopening of the bankruptcy case, and the borrower should ``agree'' rather than ``reaffirm'' to repay any loan discharged in bankruptcy. Discussion: ``Reaffirmation,'' as it relates to this provision, would be the borrower's signature on a new repayment agreement. However, the Secretary has removed the provision in proposed section 674.9(g) that would have required the reaffirmation of Federal Perkins, Direct, or Defense loan amounts that had been discharged in bankruptcy as a prerequisite to further eligibility for additional Federal Perkins Loans. This phrase has been omitted from the final rules because it is no longer permissible by operation of law pursuant to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, P.L. 103&hyph;394. Section 313 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 added a new subsection (c) to 11 U.S.C. Section 525, to provide that the Department and other governmental units may no longer deny a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to a person solely because that person has filed for or received a discharge in bankruptcy, has had a student loan discharged in bankruptcy, or has not paid a student loan that has been judicially determined to be dischargeable in bankruptcy. The Secretary interprets this provision to mean that once a debtor has filed for bankruptcy relief, or had a Federal Perkins Loan, or other student loan, discharged or determined to be dischargeable by a Bankruptcy Court, the bankruptcy may be considered as evidence of an adverse credit history but cannot be the basis for denial of future participation in the Federal Perkins Loan, or other student loan programs. Conforming changes will be made to 34 CFR 668.7(e). Section 674.9(e) of the current regulations states that a student's failure to meet payment obligations on a previous loan, including a loan discharged in bankruptcy, is evidence that the student is unwilling to repay the loan. Because the Secretary is concerned that section 674.9(e) might be used to deny a student's eligibility for a Federal Perkins Loan based solely on the student's having had a prior loan discharged in bankruptcy, the Secretary is removing the phrase regarding a bankruptcy discharge from the regulations. However, schools may continue to consider the student's post-bankruptcy credit history in determining willingness to repay the loan.
