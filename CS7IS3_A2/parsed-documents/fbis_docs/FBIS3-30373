[passage omitted] [Petan] It has been said that you did not make the cause of the Hungarians living beyond the border part of your program. What is the reason for this? [Kuncze] This has not been said. However, we did say that we do not wish to make the cause of the Hungarians beyond the border part of our campaign. As a matter of fact, other parties have also agreed with us on this. At our talks with Prime Minister Peter Boross, he also approved that this issue should not be made part of the campaign, rather, the settlement of their problems should be in all programs as a goal to be resolved. [Petan] At the meeting of delegates, you were radiant with determination. It was stated many times that you cannot imagine the next government being formed without the free democrats, in fact, that you cannot imagine that it would not be the SZDSZ that forms the government. You called for unity and cooperation, advocated conciliation, and recommended the competition of the programs to everyone instead of flinging abuse at each other. Do you not think that this change of the image is a little late? How much formality and how much real content is in this determination? [Kuncze] On one hand, the fact that the SZDSZ is able to appear as a party like this is not a change of image, rather, it is the result of much work and a long process. We have been working on this since Ivan Peto was elected chairman. On the other hand, there is no external appearance and inner content, these cannot be separated. The SZDSZ looks 100 percent like a party that is preparing for a governmental role. It has an accepted election program that can be turned into a government program when the situation arises, it has suitable candidates who can gain people's confidence, and we have adequate political experience and practice. In my view, the SZDSZ is indeed a party that can be elected. [passage omitted] [Petan] The biggest emphasis was placed on economic issues. In your view, how many years will it take for the economy to become restored and what are the most important tasks? [kuncze] The economy will be in order when the conditions for growth are established; after that, growth will automatically start in the economy. Therefore, the real big issue is the establishment of the conditions for growth. The necessary measures will have to be made this year, and the system of regulations will have to be adjusted from 1 January 1995. Through these, it will be possible to establish the conditions in one or two years, and following this, it will be up to the economy whether growth starts, which, as a matter of fact, is the precondition for increasing living standards. [Petan] Do you really think that the next government will be forced to do its work under much more difficult circumstances than the Antall-government was? [Kuncze] The situation is worse than it was four years ago in several areas of the macro-economy. This is a fact whether we think about the foreign trade deficit, the foreign balance of payments deficit, or the domestic balance of payments. We are saying that the situation has to be honestly examined because solutions will have to be found to the real conditions. Today, the scope for maneuver in politics is much smaller than it was four years ago, there is little point in arguing about this because it is obvious. The unemployment of 700,000 is a terrible problem, and the budget deficit is a problem that obstructs the economy. Answers have to be found to these questions. [passage omitted] [Petan] You clearly declared that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is an elections and political opponent of the SZDSZ. This was an answer to those who predicted the coalition cooperation of the two parties. At the same time, you also stated that, in the interest of solving the country's problems, you are willing to cooperate with anyone who can and wants to act. Do you not feel that you have opened another door by saying this? [Kuncze] Why do you not ask if I feel that this is a door opened in the other direction? The SZDSZ has always emphasized that, as a party in the center, it is open to all democratic parties if the country's governability demands this and the principles and programs can be harmonized.
