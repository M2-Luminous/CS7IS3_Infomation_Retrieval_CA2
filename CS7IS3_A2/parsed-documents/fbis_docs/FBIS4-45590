The survey found that 46 percent of drug users are under 18 years of age, while 43 percent are in the 19-25 years' age group. It also found that 70 of 1,000 students questioned said they had used illegal drugs at least once. Education Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros said the government would launch a massive awareness campaign in schools to teach junior and high-school students about the dangers of drug use and addiction. "More than 50,000 teachers will participate in the programme," he said. But some local authorities seem unwilling to wait for the government to take the initiative. In the northwestern Athens suburb of Iraklio, the first professionally staffed counselling centre opened its doors this week.
