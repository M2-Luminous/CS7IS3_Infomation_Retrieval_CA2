Speaking at the forum, the Russian official stressed the council's role in organization of regional cooperation. He called for the consolidation of the council and specification of its activities. The session is expected to elect the council's commissioner for human rights and ethnic minorities. Russia is ready to help him and his staffers in fulfilment of their duties on Russian territory. Andrey Kozyrev hopes that the commissioner will help settle some Russian-Estonian problems. The Russian delegation is expected to circulate two memoranda during the session -- one on human rights and the other on economic partnership -- in order to give a fresh impetus to cooperation in these spheres. Russia supports the consolidation of the council's organizational mechanisms and favors close coordination of efforts taken by the council chairman, his successor and predecessor. The current session is attended by foreign ministers from Germany, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation, Finland, Sweden and Estonia, as well as representatives of the Commission of the European Union. The agenda includes regional cooperation, ecological and nuclear safety in the Baltic Sea area, interaction with states-members of the European Union and other regional problems. A joint communique will be adopted on the session results.
