FR941004-2-00060 FR941004-2-00034 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;332&hyph;002] Florida Gas Transmission Company; Compliance Filing September 28, 1994. Take notice that on September 22, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet: Substitute Original Sheet No. 8D On July 29, 1994, FGT filed tariff sheets proposing to clarify that the Fuel Reimbursement Charge (FRC) retained by FGT does not apply to volumes transported through non-contiguous laterals without compression nor through laterals without compression behind processing plants where volumes transported are consumed within the plant. On August 31, 1994, the Commission issued an order (August 31 Order) accepting, subject to revision, the provisions in FGT's filing concerning the application of the Fuel Reimbursement Charge. Specifically, the August 31 Order accepted FGT's filing to be effective September 1, 1994, subject to FGT refiling revised tariff sheets within 15 days of the August 31 Order to specify which laterals on FGT's system will not be subject to the Fuel Reimbursement. FGT states that on September 14, 1994, FGT made a filing in compliance with the August 31 Order. FGT further states that included in that filing was a new tariff sheet, Original Sheet No. 8D, which identifies specific laterals on FGT's system where the FRC would not apply. FGT states that it has discovered that it inadvertently omitted one lateral behind a processing plant in Louisiana from the tariff sheet. FGT states that it is filing herein to include this lateral. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before October 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
