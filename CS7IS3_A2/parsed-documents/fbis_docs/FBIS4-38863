Born in 1923. Served during the Great Patriotic War, wrote his name on the Reichstag, and was badly wounded. Has devoted his working life to nuclear-powered ships. Has been at the Kurchatov Institute since 1949, starting as a laboratory assistant with diploma and now director of a department. He is a professor, an academician, Hero of Socialist Labor, and winner of Lenin and State Prizes. His colleagues say: "From day one through today in nuclear-powered ships -- surface and submarine, civilian and military." He himself says: "It is interesting work, a long and difficult quest whose purpose is to arrive at reliable simplicity having mastered the incomparably complex." [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, the first nuclear-powered submarine went on alert status three and a half decades ago, and a year later the first nuclear-powered icebreaker was put into service. Nowadays the attitude to these events is contradictory and sometimes even negative.... [Khlopkin] Our time is full of contradictions generally. Anything and everything is criticized without sufficient argumentation. It would be naive to claim that nuclear energy does not have its dark aspects. But how can the tasks facing the Navy be resolved without it? Only nuclear-powered submarines are able resolve the tasks facing them without surfacing during an entire autonomous patrol. Without nuclear-powered ships, how can the northern sea route be turned into a permanently operating highway? The logical development of naval nuclear power engineering depends to a considerable extent on the country's financial resources, which must be used intelligently. [Rebrov] Sadly we have still not learned how to count money. Or more precisely how to weigh up the options in order to see a realistic prospect. But to go back to submarines: What was done during those years? [Khlopkin] Many things. Although even for the first craft it was possible to develop a totally unorthodox construction -- I mean the scaled-down large unit. This was done under the guidance of Academician A.P. Aleksandrov. Many solutions found here proved extremely successful and were utilized in subsequent projects.... Thanks to the powerful compact units, as a rule our craft now have higher speeds than foreign equivalents, although inferior to them in terms of undetectability. As early as 1970 we had nuclear-powered ships with an underwater speed of over 40 knots. A further reduction in the noise generated by warships is expected, which will ensure that their actions are undetected. Comprehensive acoustic design will become an essential integral part during the development of new submarines, whereby design decisions are aimed at reducing acoustic emissions as much as possible. In other words, a submarine must be a kind of acoustic "black hole" in the sea which cannot be detected by any means. I am giving only my personal opinion. Quiet craft with powerful fourth-generation units have been developed. Concepts for fifth-generation units are being developed.... This is no easy task. There are prospects of replacing the propeller with a water jet and switching to full electric propulsion, similar to that used in diesel submarines. It is worth mentioning another type of electric propulsion -- without a propeller or water jet. The ship's motile thrust is created by passing a current through sea water in strong magnetic fields. Such an engine needs superconductor cables, ultrahigh magnetic fields.... [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, what main directions can now be seen for science here? [Khlopkin] There are several such directions. Safety in naval power engineering is out in front. Increasing the reliability of units and auto-protection of their reactors by creating negative feedback in the core, eliminating coolant losses, creating additional barriers to prevent the emission of radioactivity.... This are only some of the measures aimed at eliminating both accidents themselves and their effects. Safety at sea has its own specific characteristics. Because a reactor on a ship is not only a source of danger but also a means of saving the ship in an emergency. After that comes the search for new fields in which to use and improve nuclear power. There is a multitude of interesting prospects here. To some people they might seem unrealistic. But in the late forties a nuclear-powered submarine was considered a fantastic idea. We should make special mention of the controls. Anatoliy Petrovich Aleksandrov demanded that it be as simple as a car's -- you step on the gas, take your foot off the gas.... And such a reactor was constructed. If the flow of feed water is increased the reactor's capacity increases, if it is reduced the capacity falls. This is without any adjustment to the absorbers which govern reactivity. [Rebrov] You have mentioned technical measures. But there is also the human factor.... [Khlopkin] Yes, and it is of very great importance. Here I am referring not only to errors by the operator at the control panel in a stressful situation. The question is broader. The entire system of controlling safety is being examined in order to eliminate the possibility of making incorrect decisions at the planning stage and to prevent a low quality of equipment production and unsatisfactory operation. This is a very complex problem, but it is soluble. Questions which need to be solved by the scientists include ecological questions. Not only in the operating process but also when reactors are taken out of operation.... The strictest control is important here. We have developed highly sensitive equipment to research sea water radioactivity. It was used to inspect the sunken Komsomolets submarine. This is the result: The discharge is less than 0.1 curie per year. A few meters away from the boat's hull the level is so low that it is undetectable. [Rebrov] The nuclear-powered ships are sending out an SOS, equipment is getting old, appropriations are being reduced, shipyards are idle. The same thing is heard all over: conversion, conversion.... But words and deeds do not always coincide. How do matters stand as far as you are concerned? [Khlopkin] There is much that is contradictory here. Not in the idea itself -- it is indisputable. Conversion is not only a consequence of disarmament but also something that stimulates it. There is a multitude of questions here: scales, deadlines, state support, the consistency and considered nature of programs.... Conversion.... Back then we did not even know such a word, but we started to get involved in it around 40 years ago. Nine civilian nuclear-powered ships have been built, a tenth has been launched. Incidentally, if we are talking about sensible approaches, it makes sense to replace today's diesel icebreakers with nuclear-powered ships as they exhaust their service life,. This will be cheaper for Russia. For a number of reasons shipyards are empty, but apparently if they are filled with orders we give these orders for icebreakers to foreign firms. I can illustrate the correlation of prices with this example: The Taymyr, with a single-reactor unit, was constructed jointly with Finland at a cost of 140 million dollars. The Sibir, with a more powerful two-reactor unit, was constructed here at a cost of 120 million -- rubles! Another example is floating AES's [nuclear electric power stations] to supply heat and electricity to northern coastal cities and mineral mines. In this case the extent to which the construction site has to be developed is far less, and the area of confiscated land is less. These AES's can be relocated at any time.... We have developed unique small power units which are without equal in the world. They have no moving parts, and the current is generated without turbines -- by a thermoelectric generator which works off the nuclear reactor. Self-regulating thermoelectric stations with minimal maintenance have been designed to supply electricity to small settlements and military compounds. A heat capacity of up to 5 megawatts and an electric capacity of up to 150 kilowatts can be delivered, and the service life is up to 25 years. Another example. The "Rosshelf" joint-stock company has been set up. It proposes to use defense sectors' potential to carry out oil and gas extraction on the continental shelf. The initial development of workings in areas with icy conditions, where vast reserves of hydrocarbons have already been discovered, could be carried out with the aid of nuclear-powered icebreakers. They will provide the workings with electricity and protect them from ice. Surveying deposits, mapping the bottom, and choosing pipe-laying routes can be done by submarines. Nuclear units are successfully solving the problem of desalinating water, their use in space is extremely promising, and they are being eagerly bought abroad. In short, the peaceful atom is not just a phrase but a fact. [Rebrov] Currently the following question is being heard increasingly frequently: Is it necessary, when disarmament is in progress, to improve warships and their power units? Because the country is becoming poor.... [Khlopkin] Yes, a considerable reduction in the Navy is now under way. Orders for new nuclear-powered ships are being sharply reduced. Some of them, unfinished, are being turned into scrap metal. This is happening not only in Russia but in other countries too. But let us once again proceed from realities: War, as the last means of resolving conflict situations, has not been excluded from consideration by a single state. Russia is a maritime power, and its Navy is 300 hundred years old this year. It was Russia's glory, guaranteeing its security, and it must remain so now. It is another matter that a sea power's naval might is determined not so much by the number of ships as by their combat qualities. Admiral Makarov's motto "Remember the War" still holds well. [Rebrov] A last question, Nikolay Sidorovich. You were at the front. What was the most memorable thing in those years? [Khlopkin] The war itself. With its horrors, its losses, and blighted fates, but also the joy of victory.... The war ruthlessly displaced customary concepts, turning people's lives into another dimension, sometimes inconceivable in its tragedy. The last terrible battle was 1 May 1945, when our division was holding back the avalanche of German divisions going into Berlin from the east. We hung on.... Then there was the meeting with the Americans, but that was over the Elbe.... I took off my greatcoat with a captain's shoulder boards in 1945; since when I have been a civilian and have been greatly involved in civil matters. But Russia's military interests are dear to me, which is why I say: There will continue to be a nuclear-powered fleet! At the moment there is simply no alternative to nuclear power for the ocean submarine fleet.
