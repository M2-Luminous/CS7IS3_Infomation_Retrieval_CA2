According to the editorial, in 1993 Ecuadoran exports to Colombia increased over 100 percent and there was a 46-percent increase in imports from that country. The editorial added that Ecuador has become the third largest exporter of nontraditional products to the Colombian market after Venezuela and the United States. Colombian investment is also on the rise, the editorial continued, with about 350 Colombian companies establishing factories or forming joint ventures in Ecuador. Furthermore, the 25 March HOY reported that the Ecuadoran-Colombian Chamber of Commerce revealed that Colombian capital constitutes 18 percent of the capital of 327 Ecuadoran companies. Heran Leon, executive director of the Ecuadoran Federation of Exporters (FEDEXPOR), told the 10 March HOY that evidence of the new trade openness was manifested at the first Andean Fair held in Pasto, Colombia from 26 February to 6 March. On 6 March, the Quito business daily EL COMERCIO reported that between 1991 and 1993, Ecuadoran exports to Colombia increased from $40 million to $195 million, breaking the 1983 record of $160 million, according to estimates by the Colombian Embassy in Quito. The daily reported that Colombia fared even better in 1993 with $224 million worth of sales, a 191-percent increase from $77 million in 1980. As for Ecuador's principal exports to Colombia, the 10 March HOY reported that, in 1993, exports of automobiles totaled $40 million; seafood products, $12 million; fish meal, $9.5 million; palm oil, $5 million; plywood, $3.1 million; followed by 10 other products. Colombian products most in demand in Ecuador include raw sugar, books and printed material, textiles, medicines, sweets, and tires. By January 1994, according to 6 March EL COMERCIO, Colombian exports to Ecuador through the border town Ipiales were 53.4 percent higher than during the same period in 1993. Negotiations are under way to construct a Pacific coast highway connecting the province of Esmeraldas in Ecuador with the port of Tumaco in Colombia's Narino Department. The project will include the construction of a bridge over the Mataje River which would link the Colombian department of Putumayo with the Ecuadoran province of Sucumbios. WOOD EXPORTS--The Quito daily HOY of 17 March reported that, in 1993, wood exports surged to $15.8 million following the 1992 slump where wood exports only amounted to $5.8 million. Between 1988 and 1992, wood exports, mainly to the Andean Group, had been steady at approximately $12 million. Following the 1992 slump, Ecuador started reentering foreign markets, especially "nonprotected" ones such as Korea, Europe, and the United States, ecuador's principal client. The inefficiency of the country's forestry sector was pointed out by Alberto Robalino, president of Ecuador's Forestry and Lumber Development Corporation (CORMADERA), who said that around 10 million cubic meters of wood are cut annually, but 70 percent is wasted and remains in the forest after it is cut. GUAYAS PROVINCE GENERATES MOST INCOME--A study by the Guayaquil civic council and the Chamber of Commerce found that Guayas Province, where Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, is located, generates 49.36 percent of the country's sales, 63.51 percent of its customs receipts, and 45.40 percent of its nonpetroleum revenue. Over 55 percent of the nation's companies and 54 percent of its banks are located in Guayas. However, the study indicates, this province only receives 11.7 percent of provincial council allocations. The state's centralized system was blamed for "hampering Guayas development," according to Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO of 30 March. SPANISH CREDIT FOR DAM--Spain has granted Ecuador $123 million to complete the construction of the La Esperanza dam, due in 1995. The dam is part of the project to provide Manabi Province with water for agricultural and home use, reports Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO 2 March. CREDIT FOR INDIANS--Quito EL COMERCIO on 18 February reports that the European Commission has approved a credit line of $2.1 million to finance a development program for the Indians of Pastaza Province. The 5-year program will aim at preserving natural resources, rehabilitating lands, diversifying diets, and improving livestock raising. The program will also encourage ecotourism, health and education workshops, and the construction of communal meeting places.
