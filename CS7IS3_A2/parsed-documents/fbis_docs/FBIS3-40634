And as President Clinton succinctly remarked: America has succeeded in opening up the world market for its products. At least, the American President is being honest. True, as GATT Chief Peter Sutherland said, "I am convinced that today will be seen as a defining moment in modern economic and political history which would mean more trade, more investment, more jobs and larger income growth for all." Economists believe all this trade liberalisation holds out the promise of expanding global output by $6 trillion over the next decade, $1 trillion of that in the United States. It certainly is a defining moment in modern economic and political history. It is not difficult to see why. In developing countries, food security has become a central element of food and agricultural policy. But in none of these 132 countries agriculture is a commercial activity. Traditional agriculture, in which small and medium-sized farms still predominate would be washed away as if by a catastrophic flood. Consequently, large populations would be uprooted and swept into urban slums. Nowhere will this be more clearly evident than in an over populous country like India. Despite the advances made in food production, it is estimated that over 200 million people living in poverty in India now suffer from chronic hunger. Whether an increase in export products would improve the pathetic living standards of poorer sections of the population is a question that has been conveniently avoided. The Commerce Ministry has taken pains to explain that India's trade is expected to go up by nearly $2 million per annum due to the general expansion of the world trade. Some of the gains will certainly "trickle down" to the poor. While the "trickle down" theory no longer holds any credibility, what has not been explained, and for obvious reasons, is what will happen to the remarkable famine-avoidance strategy that has been developed over the years. In the event of cheap food being dumped into India, the very first casualty will be the food security system. The GATT agenda, which when embodied into an international agreement, will subvert India's laws that protect national interests and promotes self-reliance. A little known fact is that the Draft Final Text of the GATT contains a proposal to establish a new international institution--the Multilateral Trade Organisation--which will have powers to require national parliaments to alter legislation that is `GATT inconsistent'. Future laws must also pass this litmus test, thus requiring parliaments to seek approval of GATT headquarters before initiating legislations. And it is here that the people of India can exercise their franchise. They have done so in the past and will certainly not fail the nation again. Ever since the Paddock brothers predicted in the '60s that at least half of India would be led to a slaughter house by the end of the '70s, India has successfully managed to prove the "prophets of doom" wrong. Take a look at history and you find that it was replete with drought, famine and hunger. Between 1770 and 1880, as many as 27 famines and food scarcities were recorded. More than 20 million people had perished from hunger and malnutrition--in the 20 famines that struck India between 1850 and 1943. It is not as if the weather gods have been particularly benevolent after the colonial masters left the country's shores. Perhaps the widespread drought that struck the northern and central parts of the country in mid-80s was the severest in the 20th century. And yet the country was able to tide over the crisis without seeking any foreign aid. For a nation, which only a few years ago was written off by Paddock brothers, this was no mean achievement. Didn't Peter Sutherland say that the consensus on Uruguay Round is a defining moment in modern economic and political history. Battleground Trade in food has been a battleground for competing interests. It never distinguished between protection of corporate and northern interests and protection of long-term interests. This is nothing new. Nor are the powerful nations of the North likely to desist from the pursuit of their interests. Governments of the developing countries have rarely risen to thwart the covert designs of the rich nations. They have failed us in the past and have betrayed us once again. Only popular pressure has a hope of putting world trade discussions onto a different track, where global sustainability takes priority. GATT poses vital challenges to all who are dedicated to improving food quality and security, to defining the environment and to promoting public health and fair trade. The additional 40 million hungry in India an aftermath of GATT trade liberalisation, is not merely a statistical data. It involves people who have no other means of existence. Unlike in the West, the poor in India will not be paid for keeping their marginal lands fallow. In the United Kingdom, for instance, some farmers are getting as much as pound 100,000 a year for not cultivating their lands. Over pound one billion is being paid to farmers in the European Community for what is popularly called as "Set-Aside." As if this is not enough exports estimate that the amount of "Set-Aside" in the UK could almost double under the GATT agreement. The hope for survival rests with the people.
