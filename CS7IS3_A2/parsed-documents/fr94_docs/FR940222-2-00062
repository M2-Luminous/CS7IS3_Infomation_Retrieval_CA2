FR940222-2-00062 FR940222-2-00053 [Docket No. AB&hyph;213 (Sub-No. 4)] Canadian Pacific Limited_Abandonment_Line Between Skinner and Vanceboro, ME The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties that SEA will prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and conduct scoping meetings in this proceeding. The Canadian Pacific Limited (CP) filed an application for authority to abandon and discontinue all freight and passenger operations over 201.2 miles of rail line between Skinner and Vanceboro, in Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Aroostook, and Washington Counties, Maine. Because of the proposed abandonment's potential for significant environmental impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary. The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed abandonment and will be served on all the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period from the date the DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the DEIS and any other comments filed during the environmental review process, SEA will issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that will include SEA's final recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental record in making its decision. The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts, energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic resources, coastal zone management consistency review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment. Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted directly to the Commission no later than April 15, 1994. Public scoping meetings will be held on the following dates. •March 15, 1994, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at The American Legion Hall, Maine Street, Woodland, ME, and •March 16, 1994, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at City Hall, City Council Chambers, 73 Harlow Street, Bangor, ME.
