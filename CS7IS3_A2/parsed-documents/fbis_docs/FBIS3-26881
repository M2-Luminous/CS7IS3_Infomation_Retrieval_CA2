Visiting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias told Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today that the proposal includes two points: To demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under U.N. mandate for two years; and to press the Muslim side to accept the European Union peace plan which divides Bosnia into three ethnic states. Milosevic and Papoulias agreed that any air strike on Serbian positions will undermine the Bosnian peace talks and will only encourage what they called "militants" to continue to refuse peace and prolong the war. Papoulias also handed over a letter from Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to Milosevic. Greece was the only NATO member country to oppose issuing an ultimatum to the warring Bosnian sides to remove their weapons from around Sarajevo at the NATO meeting last Wednesday [9 February] in Brussels. Papoulias promised to do his best, while serving as the chairman of the European Union's ministerial meeting, to avoid the worst -- air strikes. He said air strikes will not help bring about peace in Bosnia, and a political settlement will benefit not only the Balkans, but also the whole of Europe. It is not fair to only ask the Serbian side to withdraw weapons from around Sarajevo, he said, adding that the Muslim side should also be pressed to withdraw their weapons.
