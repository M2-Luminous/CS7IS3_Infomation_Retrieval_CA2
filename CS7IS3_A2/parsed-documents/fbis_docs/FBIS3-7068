A regular two-day meeting on semiconductor trade in Hawaii ended with Japan partially agreeing with U.S. calls to help boost sales of its chips to the automobile, telecommunications and game equipment industries. Both sides agreed to promote cooperation on developing chips from the design stage. The United States did not make any request for a new numerical target to measure the share of foreign chips in the Japanese market. Foreign semiconductor makers won more than the targeted 20 percent of the market, stipulated in an earlier agreement, in the final quarter of last year. After the talks, however, U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Donald Phillips said that although he will not be asking for new numerical targets, a steady rise in U.S. market share is desirable. The U.S. said large Japanese firms with a big need for semiconductors are not making an effort to buy U.S. chips. They called for Japanese automobile and telecoms firms such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) to be represented at the next round of talks. Japan insisted that major users are fully cooperating in buying U.S. chips, and said U.S. makers are neglecting the Japanese market and instead concentrating on the growing U.S. domestic market.
