Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, leader of the Patriotic Forces Union and chairman of the National Dialogue subcommittee making arrangements for the signing of the "Pledge Document," has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the alleged controversy over the subcommittee was unfounded and that it did not receive instructions from any party. He said that work was proceeding toward completion of the arrangements, but opposition sources warned that the situation was moving toward confirmation of the existing undeclared secession or toward some kind of foreign trusteeship for the country. Denying the opposition's claims, Shaykh Abu-Luhum said the arrangements committee is considering all possible options and is eager to reach agreement on a venue and date for the signing "on the basis of comprehensive national grounds, for it is structured to include the coalition parties, the opposition parties, and the independent patriotic forces." He said that the document "belongs not to any particular parties or political forces but to the Yemeni people who have blessed and supported it because it covers public issues." Meanwhile, sources close to Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Naji al-Ghadir, chairman of the Higher Council of the Yemeni tribes "Saba'" and chieftain of the Khawlan tribes, have confirmed that he was able to bring about the release of the helicopter belonging to the American company Hunt Oil, which operates in the governorate of Ma'rib, its pilot, and the Indian expert who was with him, after giving the Bani-Jabr tribe (of Khawlan) two Toyota vehicles.
