Nagy, chairman of the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], yesterday made public MOS's conditions for entering into a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition with the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and Coexistence. They include, first and foremost, a general screening of candidates in accordance with the screening law, the candidates' sworn statement that they will not have any other income besides their deputies' salaries, a joint electoral manifesto, the Hungarian deputies' unanimous voting on all important issues pertaining to the minorities, the publication of concluded agreements, and the banning of campaigning against the other coalition members. According to Nagy, during the negotiations, MOS will demand, as a starting point, a 25-percent share on the common slate of candidates, which would correspond to the outcome of the last parliamentary elections. As MOS spokesman K. Petocz went on to say, MOS tried to initiate talks on a three-member coalition as early as February so as not to be pressed for time. This has now happened, according to Nagy, despite the fact that MOS's ideas about a coalition are not too different from the ideas of the MKDH and Coexistence. Nagy has detected a certain shift in the Coexistence movement because the latest statement by its Executive Committee no longer contains the toughest conditions originally laid down by Coexistence for talks with MOS.
