That country's insistence on getting us to sit on the defendant's bench leads to the same vicious circle every year," Jose Antonio Perez Novoa, the head of the Cuban delegation at this commission and the Cuban ambassador to the UN European office, stated. The Cuban diplomat considers that the apparent concern of the United States and the countries which, almost always due to pressure, echo such "an immoral manipulation of human rights with political objectives, do not worry us in the least. Those concerns are not legitimate because they come from a country that is incapable of satisfying the most basic rights of its people and attempts to make another country yield through hunger," Perez Novoa asserted. He also questioned "the United States' concern for democracy" because "that country has financed, supported, and helped the most repressive regimes and the most brutal dictatorships." According to the Cuban ambassador, the resolution "does not worry us because Cuba's only concern is the complete and absolute development of the Cuban people, as it will allow us to guarantee the rights we won a long time ago and above all to maintain the independence and sovereignty we achieved in 1959." In Perez Novoa's opinion, "it would be absurd to purport that the United States end this farce because it has ended the criminal blockade it imposed on Cuba, alleging that this small Caribbean island represented a Communist threat." Cuba -- added the diplomat -- will never refuse dialogue and cooperation on a truly impartial and objective basis with due respect to sovereign equality. It will not accept impositions that only seek to satisfy the whims of the hegemonic power of the latter part of the 20th century. "We are a free, sovereign country with the right to choose our own road and find our own solutions to the problems we confront. This right, this sovereignty, and this independence will never be negotiable," for a country that "after being a colony of slaves is today an honorable and independent country that will never surrender," Cuban Ambassador Perez Novoa asserted.
