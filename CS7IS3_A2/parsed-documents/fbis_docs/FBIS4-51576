Francisco] [Text] Environment officials and ministers of the six-member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) recently approved the implementation of a strategic plan of action on the environment (ASPEN) over a four-year period. The approval of the plan was a major achievement of the 6th ministerial meeting on the environment since it harmonized environmental quality standards in the region, said Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Undersecretary Benjamin Bagadion, Jr. who headed the ASEAN Senior Officials on the Environment (ASOEN), the technical group which drafted the action plan. Also, the ASEAN-member countries gave their go-signal to the proposal allowing the Philippines to house the ASEAN biodiversity center. This facilitates the release of the U.S. $19 million funding for the center which will be provided by the European Union, since the funding was hedged on whether the ASEAN will approve the proposal. The approval of the action plan took less than year. The plan, which has 10 strategies and 27 specific actions spelled out the countries' commitments with regard to sustainable development. Mr. Bagadion said the environment officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam which hosted the 6th ministerial meeting on the environment, all lent their full support to the action plan, thus, the speedy approval. The ASPEN's objectives are the following: -- respond to the specific recommendations of Agenda 21, the action plan adapted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which required priority action in the region; -- introduce policy measures and promote institutional development that encourage the integration of environmental factors in all developmental processes both at the national and regional levels; -- establish long-term goals on environmental quality and work towards harmonized environmental quality standards for the ASEAN region; -- harmonize policy directions and enhance operational and technical cooperation on environmental matters, and undertake joint actions to address common environmental problems; and -- study the implications of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) on the environment and take steps to integrate sound trade policies with sound environmental policies. During the meeting, the ASOEN formed six working committees on six environmental issues such as transboundary pollution, nature conservation, environment conservation, marine environment, environment management, and information and public awareness in order to fully discuss the region's specific concerns. The action plan calls for the implementation of the following 10 strategies: -- support the development of a regional framework for integrating environment and development concerns in the decision- making processes; -- promote government-private sector interactions that lead towards the development of policies that mutually support the thrust of each sector; -- strengthen the knowledge and information data base on environmental matters; -- strengthen institutional and legal capacities to implement international agreements on the environment; -- establish a regional framework on biological diversity conservation and sustainable utilization of its components; -- promote the protection and management of coastal zones and marine resources; -- promote environmentally sound management of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes and control of transboundary movement of hazardous waste and their dispersal; -- develop a system for the promotion of environmentally-sound technologies; -- promote regional activities that strengthen the role of major groups in sustainable development; and -- strengthen the coordinative mechanism for the implementation and management of regional environment programs.
