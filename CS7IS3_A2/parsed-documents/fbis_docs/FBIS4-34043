The brother of Lieutenant Colonel Michel Francois addressed a letter to that effect to the Army chief. Let us listen to Evans Francois: [Begin Francois recording] At this watershed where my country's sovereignty is threatened by the most powerful nation in the world, General, the threats of military intervention are serious. This is not the time to be shilly-shallying. The courageous Evans, one of the authors of the 30 September coup d'etat, could have continued to give you his support. He was convinced you would have changed in a positive direction one day. If tomorrow, I were sure to find even a minimum of seriousness in your behavior... [pauses] What I am sure of, Mr. General, is that the 34 months of crisis have never been managed in the interest of the nation. There was not one government that came from the 30 September coup which, once installed, was not handicapped by your shrewd behavior, which always made you appear in the eyes of the world as a moderate, until appointment of the Jonassaint government, the disguised triumvirate.
