In his address, he commented on the Security Council's last resolution on the situation in Abkhazia, in which, the head of state stressed, "the stance of the Republic of Georgia" is confirmed. The head of state said that the resolution of the Security Council was a balanced document in which the legal status of Abkhazia was defined clearly within the framework of single, indivisible Georgia. It allows the hope that the question will be resolved by exclusively political means. The head of the Georgian state especially singled out the formulation of the Security Council's resolution concerning the refugees who, according to Paragraph 3 of the resolution, must, without any limits, return to their homes in all rayons of Abkhazia. Shevardnadze once again confirmed the readiness of the Georgian side to negotiate with the representatives of Abkhazia, despite the resumption of war by the separatists in the Kodori gorge. The chairman of the republic's parliament announced with responsibility, before parliament and the state, that Georgia had not initiated the current escalation of tension in the Abkhazian Svaneti and the rayons adjacent to the Inguri River and that Georgia would not betray its course of "peaceful and political settlement of the conflict, about which the United Nations, the Security Council, and Russia must be informed".
