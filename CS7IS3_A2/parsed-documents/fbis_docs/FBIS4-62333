Representing the DPRK was Deputy Foreign Minster Yi In-Kui. For the first time, Aleksandr Panov said, North Korea has stated quite firmly that it welcomes Russia's initiative on holding an international conference on security in, and a non- nuclear status for the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang is interested in the Russian initiative and is studying it. The issue of the DPRK's special status in the Treaty on Non- Proliferation of nuclear weapons could give rise, and is giving rise, to some concern, since this path could in the end damage the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons regime. The Russian side took account of this during the political consultations, Russia's deputy foreign minister said. North Korea said it did not want to drag out its term under this status, but wanted to settle the problem. Moscow expressed its concern at the situation that has developed with the armistice -- in existence since 1953 -- now that the DPRK has decided to give up this whole system and start direct talks with the USA. Pyongyang explained the situation by saying this system is not operating anyway and is even being used to hide a build-up of American military presence in South Korea.
