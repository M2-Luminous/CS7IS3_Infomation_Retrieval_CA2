What do the leaders of this movement intend to do in the long term? These and many other questions were put by journalists yesterday to Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Mityukov, Boris Saltykov, and Grigoriy Tomchenko. It had been intended that Ella Pamfilova would attend the news conference. But she had fallen ill and was not present. Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that the parliamentary faction supports the departure of Gaydar, Pamfilova, and Fedorov. In his opinion, a real process is now being observed, whereby the center of power is shifting from the presidential structures toward the head of government. The government has firmly embarked on the path of curtailing the reforms which had been begun. At the same time "Russia's Choice" is not losing optimism. Again, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the deputies' faction has sufficient means and opportunities "to prevent the matter from being completely spoiled." "Russia's Choice" holds sufficiently strong positions on key parliamentary committees and, in addition, relies on the support and solidarity of other factions (including Communists and farmers) in the struggle against any extreme views and positions. "Russia's Choice" also does not rule out raising the question of no confidence in the government. This is possible in the very near future, when the new budget, for example, is discussed. The Duma faction's spokesmen also pin considerable hopes on the president of Russia. Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that Yeltsin will, in the final analysis, realize the perniciousness of curtailing the reforms and will find the strength to make the necessary decision.
