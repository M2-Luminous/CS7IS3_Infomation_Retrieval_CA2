Is It Becoming Quieter on the Screens?"] [Text] It is entirely likely that millions of television viewers of the Russian channel may soon be left without their favorite serial "Santa Barbara," the "A" program, and live relays of sports matches. The volume of television and radio broadcasts has been halved -- the Ministry of Finance has cut the budget of Russian television by one-half. Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, has painted a very gloomy picture. [Lysenko] This year we will need almost 1 trillion rubles [R] to be able to work normally. Of this, 77 percent goes automatically to the Ministry of Communications to pay for broadcasting. The meager funding is liable to cause the loss of the broadcasting network on the large territory of Russia. Relay transmitters will be closed down. The sum is a large one, and yet this is a political issue rather than an economic one. Today television and radio are the only links between individual regions in Russia and the center. If we come off the air in these regions, then the air space will definitely be pulled apart by local television companies. The disintegration of the single television air space may mark the beginning of territorial disintegration. What about the Russian-speaking population in "nearby foreign countries"? For example, the Baltic states only relay our channel. There the price of communications services is even higher. No one in the government is particularly looking into the heart of the matter today. They believe that having "Ostankino" will be enough but, after all, even "Ostankino" has had its budget cut by 50 percent. With the disappearance of the Russian television station, Russian national television as such will cease to exist. "Ostankino" is an interstate channel. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Maybe it is worth thinking about national commercial television? Independent television! [Lysenko] The idea is a good one, but economically impossible today. What commercial structure would pump billions into something just like that, with practically zero profit? In our country everyone has gotten used to the idea that television is free. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What lies in store for the employees of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company? [Lysenko] Approximately a 40-percent reduction -- primarily among the journalists. Televized shows, the most attractive programs, will have to be given up -- they are the most expensive. We will keep children's broadcasts to the end, and, naturally, "Vesti." [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the solution? [Lysenko] The only thing that can save us is state support. But somehow I do not believe we will get any. In the three years of our existence there have already been five edicts of the Russian Federation president on support to the Russian television company, but when it comes down to it, it turns out that there is no money. This is frequently stated by people who have ratified the latest edict. We have nothing and no one to pin our hopes on. Boris Nikolayevich has the last word.
