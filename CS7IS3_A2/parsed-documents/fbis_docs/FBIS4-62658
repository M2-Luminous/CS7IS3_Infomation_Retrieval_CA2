Let me remind readers that, unlike Russia, Kazakhstan has done without tanks and rallying crowds, but immediately after the October events in Moscow an "epidemic" of self-disbandment suddenly broke out in Kazakhstan, affecting soviets at all levels -- from village soviets right up to the Supreme Soviet -- and witnessed the sudden demise of the latter. The president and government categorically rejected suspicions that they were somehow involved in this process, even though its organized character left no room for any such doubt. So then, to use the well-known aphorism of Red Army man Sukhov, "the East is a subtle thing...." In mid-December the Supreme Soviet ceased to exist, having transferred its legislative powers to the president and scheduled elections for a new supreme legislative organ of power for the beginning of March; this new body was conceived as a compact parliament (177 deputies, two fewer than in the former Supreme Soviet) working on a professional basis. President N. Nazarbayev himself described the significance and purpose of what had happened in the clearest terms: The Supreme Soviet, which had basically been elected during a different historical period and which contained all the old party nomenklatura, from the head shepherd to the rayon committee secretary, had outlived its usefulness, just like Soviet power itself with its arcane system of soviets at all levels. What was needed was a united and integrated legislative organ capable of single-mindedly and competently providing a legal base for the reforms policy in Kazakhstan. It is hardly worth describing in detail all the ups and downs of the elections which have just taken place. Alternative political forces contested seats in parliament on a legal basis for the first time, but realistically the opposition's opportunities during the elections were extremely limited. Consequently the parliamentary majority was made up of deputies from the so-called "state list," i.e. deputies nominated by the president and the government in conjunction with representatives of the National Unity Alliance, the political organization supporting the president. Generally speaking, practically the entire new parliament is yet again made up of people from the nomenklatura. Some 90 percent of the deputies are leaders of various kinds of government, state, and quasi-state structures: Ministries and departments, local administrations, state enterprises, kolkhozes and sovkhozes, law-enforcement organs, and so forth. The president has gotten what he knows to be a loyal parliament, whose objective qualities, however, mean that it is able to act as a kind of hidden opposition, if not to the president himself then at least to the reforms policy he is pursuing. Meanwhile, the "open" political opposition which finds itself in a definite minority is making its presence felt in vocal fashion. Some 15 parties and social organizations of various stripes -- communists and socialists, social democrats, national patriots and the Slav movement "Harmony," which opposes them -- have joined forces and established the "Republic" coordinating council headed by S. Abdildin, former speaker of the self-disbanded Supreme Soviet. "Republic" has proclaimed a course of establishing a "constructive opposition" in parliament and has declared its objective to be the formulation and protection of a program to ensure Kazakhstan's survival -- in the opinion of coordinating council members, the state is going to rack and ruin: Its economy is collapsing, the population has been brought to the brink of penury, and the political reforms are leading to the establishment of a dictatorship. [Text] Although familiar communist terminology predominates in the opposition's statements and their panicky tone clearly betrays the desire of political failures to have their revenge, as is so often the case there is no smoke without fire -- the socioeconomic and domestic political situation in Kazakhstan is indeed becoming more and more worrying. Since the second half of last year, when illusions about the possibility of preserving the ruble area came crashing down and Kazakhstan set about introducing its own national currency, its economy has gone into a steep dive. The decline in production has accelerated and the number of enterprises that have either stopped working or are working on minimum capacity is nearing the critical mark -- according to official statistical data, by the start of this year alone 732 enterprises and organizations with a total workforce of over 350,000 people had stopped work either partially or completely. And the situation is steadily worsening. The payments deficit is growing, and this year there are plans to cover it exclusively by means of loans from international organizations. The commodity production crisis is in turn whipping up inflation in the young Kazakhstani currency. The speed of inflationary processes is growing -- during the six months it has been in existence, the tenge has seen its value fall six times, i.e. average monthly inflation has reached the 100-percent mark. In this respect the new currency has already outdone the old. Even the old-style ruble, which was withdrawn from circulation in Russia last August and which Kazakhstan continued to use until mid-November, did not plunge so rapidly at first. The government has not only failed to take any measures to achieve monetary stabilization, it has even taken extremely some illogical steps which have actually exacerbated the inflationary situation. It has no choice in the matter, however: Its budgetary resources for keeping prices in check are exhausted. At the same time the increase in prices has not only become evidence but also a cause of the devaluation of the national currency, and the process has acquired an avalanche-like and uncontrollable character. It is a vicious circle: Each new fall in the tenge's exchange rate provokes a price hike, including an increase in the price of energy sources, which in turn jacks up the price of goods and services even more, which in turn fuels the next inflationary spiral.... The president's staff and the government are not shouldering the budget expenditure cuts themselves. A decision made recently by N. Nazarbayev to separate the presidential and the Cabinet of Ministers staffs demonstrates on the one hand that the head of state is as it were dissociating himself from the activity of the government he heads, which is likely to result in the rapid replacement of its leadership -- this was also confirmed by N. Nazarbayev's speech at the first session of parliament in which he was sharply critical of the Cabinet of Ministers, saddling it with the blame for exacerbating the crisis processes. On the other hand, however, the separation of the two staffs means their duplication, and consequently the duplication of expenditure on officials' pay, which is already fairly substantial. Attempts are being made to cut expenditure, but squarely at the population's expense. The decision of the president and the government at the start of the year to abolish all previously established social benefits and replace them with monetary compensation caused a furor -- within the space of a month in inflationary conditions these compensatory amounts had turned into something like alms. When thousands of elderly people organized a noisy rally outside the parliament building on the opening day of the first session of parliament, N. Nazarbayev issued an edict reinstating the benefits -- but only for the disabled ex-servicemen and war veterans. Invalid children and workers and similarity disabled people continued to be deprived of their benefits. For example, a blind person is currently obliged to buy a streetcar ticket, and someone without the use of his legs must pay his phone bill in full and fill up his car with gasoline at the standard, very expensive price. Another example: Under the president's edict, the new arrangements, which have only just been adopted regarding taxation of individuals' income even envisage levying income tax on...unemployment benefit. As far as income itself is concerned, by the time the session started its work the president's edict had stipulated that the minimum wage and old-age pension in the Republic should be increased by 150 percent to 100 tenge a month -- even according to official exchange rates when the edict was published this does not even amount to $5 or 9,000 Russian rubles. This is the minimum. Accordance to the government codes, the maximum cannot exceed 10 minimums.... Despite price levels that are no lower than in Russia. Basically, ever since the Republic's Executive Branch has subsumed the Legislative Branch, the situation has significantly worsened. A whole tangle of problems does in fact require competent and major intervention. Of course, it is laughable to hope that the advent of a new parliament -- however strong it might be -- would in itself be able to change anything right away, but at any rate there is a chance that skilled collegial revision by the deputies of the situation that has developed and the activity of the government and president, and their corrections to that activity, could inspire hope of finding a way out of the crisis. On one condition, of course -- provided parliament turns out as it was intended: A competent and professional legislative organ. The start of the first session's work exceeded all expectations. First of all, the parliamentary leadership is mainly composed of representatives of the president's "team." The 55-year-old journalist, writer, and experienced ideological worker Abish Kekilbayev was elected speaker; in the Kazakhstan Communist Party Central Committee he was head of the Interethnic Relations Department, and recently he has worked as a state counselor in charge of the same issues in the government. Second, as is normally the case, parliament began with organizational questions. The work was thorough -- 10 days of work were required to elect leaders, to form commissions and committees, and also to examine issues regarding backup for the deputies' activities. Following heated debates, the deputies awarded themselves ministers' salaries with a 50-percent additional amount to cover expenses connected with performing their deputies' duties, despite having ensured that many communal services such as transportation and communications are provided for them free of charge. In addition, they enjoy official apartments, personal cars, free removal expenses enabling 120 deputies to relocate to accommodations in the capital, health benefit in the form of a lump sum equivalent to two months' salary, and individual offices.... And when the initial stage of the first session of the new parliament had finished, the deputies dispersed for six weeks' vacation. The second round of the session opens 13 May. It is hard to make any precise predictions as to what it will be like, but judging by the results of the first round, the president and government's hopes of forming a loyal parliament in Kazakhstan composed of state functionaries who are experienced in their work have been completely realized: They have gotten what they wanted, so to speak. If everything subsequently follows the same scenario, it is not hard to predict how events will develop. In conditions of virtual one-man rule by the president (and hence one-man responsibility), when the domestic political and socioeconomic situation deteriorates further it will not be an effective solution simply to replace the government cabinet. Taking new and unpopular measures at a time when living standards are steadily worsening and problems of an irreversible nature are cropping up (stoppages by more and more enterprises and increased unemployment owing to the fact that practically no new jobs are being created) could provoke a negative reaction among more and more sections of the population. And this could fuel an increase in the prestige of opposition structures -- as has already happened in Russia, where V. Zhirinovskiy's fascist party "unexpectedly" achieved a majority at the polls. Another danger faces Kazakhstan in this respect: Either political forces of a pro-communist stripe will come to power, or, more likely, the present executive branch will strengthen its position little by little until it establishes a real dictatorship. Both alternatives are equally unpalatable.
