A federal grand jury in Miami found that Brown had committed no wrongdoing, a government official, who declined to be named, announced today. In a letter to Brown's attorney the country's Justice Department said that no further investigation was warranted and that accordingly it was closing the case. Early last year the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began looking into the allegations and the Justice Department's public integrity section was instructed to oversee the probe. Brown had previously denied the allegations brought by Binh T. Ly, a Vietnamese American businessman, and had predicted he would be exonerated by the grand jury. Last September, Brown acknowledged meeting three times with the former Vietnamese government official, Nguyen Van Hao, whom Ly accused of arranging the 700,000 dollars payment. But he firmly denied receiving any money or having any kind of business relationship with Hao. The Vietnamese Government also denied Ly's allegations. President Clinton publicly defended Brown last fall after two conservative Republican lawmakers asked for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations. Ly has acknowledged that he has no direct evidence to support his allegations, which are based on conversations with Hao. Responding to reporters today, Brown said "I'm pleased and I'm cleared of any wrongdoing."
