FR941130-2-00127 FR941130-2-00073 TVC also requests authority through December 31, 1997 to invest directly or indirectly in exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') on the same basis as Columbia with regard to permissible activities under Sections 32 and 33. TVC proposes to use all or a portion of its Self Generated Funds for such investments. TVC plans to form, acquire, finance and own the securities or interest in the business of EWGs and/or FUCOs directly or indirectly through subsidiary companies (``Project Parents''). The Project Parents would be special purpose domestic corporations, foreign corporations, partnerships, or limited liability companies (or the equivalent thereof) and could include joint ventures engaged in EWG/FUCO activities. With regard to FUCO activities, the organization, formation, or acquisition of one or more Project Parents may be necessary or desirable to facilitate such projects. A holding structure of one or more Project Parents also may be necessary or desirable to minimize tax liabilities, to bid on projects through joint ventures, to facilitate a participant's consolidated tax and accounting activities in joint ventures, to insulate TVC from certain risks, and to facilitate adjustments to or sales of interests of joint ventures or partnerships. A single Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct and indirect interest in both EWGs and FUCOs. Investments by TVC directly or indirectly in any Project Parent may take the form of any combination of acquisitions of capital shares, partnership interest, trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing. Any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than par value. To the extent that a Project Parent is itself determined to be an EWG or FUCO, it would be exempt from project financing filing under the Act except as may otherwise be provided in Sections 32 and 33. As to Project Parents that are not EWGs or FUCOs, TVC and the Project Parent would make a filing, if required, for project financing authority at the appropriate time. TVC does not contemplate utilizing the services of employees of the Columbia system's domestic public utility companies for its EWB and FUCO activities. However, were it to do so, no more than two percent of the employees of the system's domestic public utility companies would render services at any one time, directly or indirectly, to EWGs or FUCOs in which TVC may directly or indirectly hold an interest unless previous Commission approval were sought.
