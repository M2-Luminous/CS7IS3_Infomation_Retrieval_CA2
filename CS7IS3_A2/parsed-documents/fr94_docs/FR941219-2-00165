An IMO working group addressed topics such as guidelines for the use and application of dispersants and the redraft of the contingency planning portion of the IMO Oil Pollution Manual. c. Follow-up action to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). An MEPC working group examined IMO's role in implementation of UNCED and discussed the results of a correspondence group on use of the precautionary principle. d.
