European cooperation has not always been something that can be taken for granted, and in some places it still cannot be. If we look back on the history of our continent it is easy to see how it has been dominated by conflicts and wars, and how periods of cooperation and security have often been torn apart by confrontations that have sometimes also led to war. Today's economic cooperation has a firm foundation in the concept of peace that was born out of the horrors of the two world wars. This simple statement of fact contains the explanation of why cooperation has such a strong foothold in countries like Germany and France, and why countries that have stood or believed they could stand outside the continent's conflicts have come to join this cooperation at a later date and often with much greater hesitation. The gulf that arose in West European cooperation in the fifties -- between the EEC with its close economic and political cooperation and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which was only a free trade organization -- is now finally being bridged. This gulf is now being overcome because everyone has finally been convinced of the value and necessity of cooperation that is strong both politically and economically. The cooperation within the framework of the EEC, the EC, and the EU since the end of the fifties has certainly not been without its problems. But the advantages have been much greater than the difficulties. Cooperation has gradually been strengthened over the years in order to exploit the strength that integration has shown that it produces not only in the EEC/EC/EU but also in individual member countries. Taking the step into this cooperation has sometimes been controversial, but it is a fact worth pondering -- in the Swedish debate too -- that there is not a single member country where the idea of withdrawing from this cooperation enjoys popular support. With the exception of some odd and notorious extremists there is no political party in any member country that supports the call for withdrawal from this cooperation. Its value and strength can hardly be demonstrated any more clearly. Those who know what cooperation is do not want to do without it. When the partnership agreement between the EU and Russia and the four accession agreements are signed on Corfu today this will be a clear indication that it is a new Europe we are entering. West Europe is being united as a result of the fact that the Nordic area and Austria are now taking their places at the very heart of European cooperation at the same time that the work on the reunification of Europe as a whole can now begin in earnest. The summit in Corfu is a link in the chain of European integration. The meeting marks the end of the major task of enlargement that has dominated so much of the debate and the work inside the Union in recent years. But the meeting on Corfu is also the start of a new phase in which questions of growth and the question of extending cooperation to Central European and the Baltic states will become increasingly important. Sweden is now taking its place as an active observer in the EU in order to exert an influence on future cooperation through our perspectives and values, but also to derive benefit from the possibilities that cooperation offers. And it is a great strength that we are doing this together with Norway and Finland. In the last few years the Nordic dimension has acquired an ever stronger position in our overall European policy. EU membership offers a possibility of Nordic reunification that will give new drive to Nordic cooperation. Three concepts are important in the policy we now have to pursue as active observers and, after a yes in the referendum on 13 November, as full members of Europe cooperation: growth, openness, and enlargement. The economic questions -- how Europe can again create strong growth and real new jobs that can push down unemployment -- has become an increasingly important issue since the summit in Edinburgh at the end of 1992. The work since then -- not least the so-called white book from December 1993 -- has gradually led to an ever greater convergence of view on the nature of the problems that the European economies are wrestling with and on the policy thrust that is needed to solve them. If there still are political differences, there is a remarkably strong conviction that it is only a policy aiming at definite structural reforms in the direction of more open and more dynamic markets that can break long-term unemployment. And this also applies to politically difficult questions such as reform of the labor market and its regulations. In this context Sweden is viewed in the European debate as something of a pioneer. After being seriously affected by major structural problems we too have demonstrated in many fields and under difficult circumstance the policies needed to solve them. The two important reports that will be discussed on Corfu -- on investment in infrastructure and on investment in information technologies -- are in line with the policies of the Swedish Government. In actual fact our policies in both these fields lie in the forefront of European developments. One of the 11 major future investments in infrastructure that are now being given prominence is the Oresund link. This links the Scandinavian peninsula's investments in modern railroads -- around 50 billion kronor -- in the period up to the year 2000 with the investments of around 1,000 billion kronor that will be made in continental railroad communications in the same period. Through the Oresund link in connection with the link over the Fehmarn Belt we will experience a turbo effect for the railroad investments which are currently being made in Sweden. Europe is finally waking up to the revolutionary changes that the new information technologies represent. And exploiting these opportunities will only be possible if you are to abandon the old monopoly thinking in the way we in Sweden have already done. Together with Finland and Britain, Sweden is now in the vanguard of opening up the enormous possibilities of developments in the field of information technology. Past EU decisions that deregulation must be completed by 1998 at the latest already appear out of date. The quicker deregulation takes place, the greater Europe's chances of asserting itself in the new global transformation. In all these fields -- structural changes in the economy, investment in new infrastructure, and liberalization to liberate information technology -- Sweden is in the vanguard. And this front position gives us more scope than others to exploit membership of the European Union as a tool to create new and real jobs in the typical companies of the future and consequently better conditions for growth and prosperity in the longer term. Even if economic issues appear to be particularly important in a period of rapid development, the development of European cooperation will ultimately be decided by the political questions surrounding peace and security. I myself am convinced that the crucial task in the years to come will be to find the right way to gradually extend cooperation to the countries of central Europe and the Baltic states. We welcomed the decision at the Copenhagen summit a year ago to open the door to membership for these states, and we have warmly welcomed Hungary's and Poland's applications for membership during the course of the spring. It would, however, be a mistake to underestimate the challenges with which this continued process of enlargement will confront cooperation. The calls for changes to agricultural and regional policy will be considerable, as will the need to change decisionmaking procedures and other institutions. Starting now to openly and directly discuss these questions is the best way to prepare the way for the decisions to admit new members that must be made in the next few years. By its nature European cooperation is an ever continuing dialogue and ever continuing negotiations on problems and issues that everyone can see are best resolved in cooperation with others because they are too big for each individual nation to be able to solve alone. At the Corfu meeting Sweden is now finally winning a place in this dialogue and these negotiations. We are winning an influence that those on the outside can never give and therefore, at a time of greater internationalism and internationalization, a chance to achieve those goals and ambitions that only cooperation can offer. Between today's historic meeting on Corfu and the next summit in Essen in early December there lies a Riksdag election, in which the different parties will outline their different visions of European cooperation, and the referendum that will decide the membership issue. For me it goes without saying that Sweden too should take part in the European cooperation in which all other nations are striving to take part. The important question really ought not to be whether or not we should be involved in cooperation, but in what way we should exploit all the possibilities membership offers and what vision of the future development of cooperation should be ours.
