The Libyan foreign minister did visit the capital last weekend. His presence has surprised and saddened the families of the casualties of the terrible bomb attack against the UTA DC-10. Philippe Boisserie reports: [Boisserie] [passage omitted] For [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, there is nothing abnormal about this visit: [Begin recording] [Juppe] [Words indistinct] not at all sudden, it has been his 10th or 15th visit over the last three or four years. I would like things to be clear. What is all this about? France has an extremely firm position -- perhaps the most firm position among all Western countries -- concerning the sanctions against Libya. [Boisserie] What did he come for then? Do you know? [Juppe] You will have to ask him, I did not see him. [end recording] [Boisserie] The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] added that it was merely a private stopover on his way back from South Africa, that there were no official contacts. However, among those taking part in the trip was someone who is not insignificant and who is of interest to Judge Bruguieres: The lawyer of the four Libyans whose extradition to France he has been demanding in vain. For the families of the casualties, this is too much. [passage omitted]
