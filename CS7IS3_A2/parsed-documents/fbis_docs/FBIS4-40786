The Crimeans, he said, follow their President Yuriy Meshkov's stay in Switzerland as he attends the Crano-Montana forum dealing with trade between West and East. The Crimeans' interest in this forum is quite understandable as one of its plenary sessions will discuss the theme "the security of the Black Sea and the future of the Crimea". In the words of the adviser, Ukrainian Speaker Aleksandr Moroz is arriving today in the Crimea. Meshkov's adviser says he is expected to participate in the plenary session of the Crimean Supreme Soviet.
