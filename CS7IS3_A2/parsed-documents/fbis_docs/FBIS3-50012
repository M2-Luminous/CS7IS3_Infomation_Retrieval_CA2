Opinions that the Defence Ministry is ceding its prerogatives to the general staff are untrue, Milewski declared. He described the planned changes as "corrections in the organizational structure" designed to precisely define the tasks and improve the work of the Defence Ministry and the general staff. According to Milewski the changes are also meant to reduce the excessively large administration. Milewski also stressed that it was "indispensable" for the civilian Defence Ministry's departments at present to employ the military. "There are not so many military experts among civilians now," he said.
