National Environmental Policy Act Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4371 et seq., and the implementing regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508, FEMA has prepared an environmental assessment of the issuance by FEMA of this final rule. The assessment concludes that there will be no significant impact on the human environment as a result of the issuance of the final rule. It is, therefore, found that the action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. On this basis, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Copies of the environmental assessment are available for inspection at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, room 840, 500 C St., SW., Washington, DC 20472.
