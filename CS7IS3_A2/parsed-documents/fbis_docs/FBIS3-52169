Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, with whom I recorded a brief interview, is himself visibly confident. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr. Peres, do you think that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] will be able to prevent the agreement? [Peres] They might try to prevent the agreement coming into being but I do not think they will succeed. The majority of Palestinians, just as the majority of Israelis, too, want peace. Consequently, the decision is not in Hamas' hands. They murder people and they would like to annihilate the peace process itself by murdering people, but I do not think they will get far with this. [Correspondent] How do you see the future of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement after the postponement of the first deadline for the Israeli military withdrawal? [Peres] It was not a postponement. You know, the parties concerned agreed in Oslo that they would allow one month after the signing for informal meetings; they allowed another two months for the agreement to be translated, so that every tiny detail could be clarified. But it turned out that the time at our disposal was extremely short. We are unable to settle all necessary matters in two months. Now we have to clarify just how much time we still need. [Correspondent] Finally, how do you see the possibility of Syria's involvement? [Peres] Well, we would like the Syrians to be involved in the settlement efforts, since we would like to put a full-stop to the old conflicts in the region and we would like to build a new Middle East for the future. Naturally, we need new partners for this, partners with whom we can work together. At present, Syria is not showing too much flexibility [hajlekonysag]. But it is also a fact that at the time of the latest visit by U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad indicated with certain gestures that Syria does not wish to be left out of the negotiations.
