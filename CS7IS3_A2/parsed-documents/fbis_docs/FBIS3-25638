This is because the Finance Ministry has not yet received the lists of soldiers from both sides to be demobilized. The Finance Ministry has the money to begin to pay the six-month subsidy provided by the government and the 18-month subsidy provided by the international community. Finance Minister Eneas Comiche told Radio Mozambique that the Technical Demobilization Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] has already obtained the list of government soldiers to be demobilized but has not yet obtained Renamo's list. He said the government will only begin to pay the subsidy after his ministry has obtained full lists from both sides. The Reintegration Commission [Core] met in Maputo today to discuss various issues connected with the strategy to be adopted for the reintegration of demobilized troops. Core also examined a two-year training program for demobilized troops.
