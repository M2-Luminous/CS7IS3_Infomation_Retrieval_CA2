During the meetings, he said the United States will make a decision on the resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic trade talks which were broken off at the recent Japan-U.S. summit after examining a package of measures to open the Japanese market which Japan plans to map out during this month. At his meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Secretary of State Christopher said: While the United States has been working on the reduction of its federal budget deficit, Japan has yet to fulfill its responsibility for cutting its trade surplus with the United States and expanding imports. What is important is the visible trade result. I hope that Japan will take measures in wide areas. The U.S. secretary of state also indicated that the United States will make a decision on whether to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain suspended, after examining the package of measures to open the Japanese market which Japan plans to map out during this month. In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa said: We are fully aware that Japanese and U.S. economies are in a difficult situation. The government is doing all in its power to map out a package of measures to open the Japanese market to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States. At the meeting prior to the Hosokawa-Christopher meeting, Foreign Minister Hata expressed a sense of crisis in the Japan-U.S. relations. Foreign Minister Hata and Secretary of State Christopher agreed on the following point: The Japan-U.S. relationship is an allied relationship based on the security arrangements, and both Japan and the United States have common responsibility for the world prosperity. The two countries should seek to resolve issues pending between them through dialogue in order not to heighten tension between them in the economic area. During the meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and Secretary of State Christopher, the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development was raised. Foreign Minister Hata said Japan highly appraises tenacious effort by the United States to hold talks with North Korea. Japan would fulfill its responsibility as a UN member if talks on nuclear inspections end in failure. In this way, the foreign minister indicated that Japan would cooperate with economic sanctions to be imposed by the UN Security Council.
