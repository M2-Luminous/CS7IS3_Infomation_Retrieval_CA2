FR940503-2-00101 FR940503-2-00068 [Docket No. AB&hyph;290 (Sub-No. 133X)] Virginia & Southwestern Railway Company; Abandonment Exemption; in Bristol, VA and Bristol, TN Virginia & Southwestern Railway Company (V&S) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon 0.18 mile of track between milepost 68.24&hyph;T and milepost 68.42&hyph;T at Bristol, VA, and 0.8 mile of track between milepost 70.6&hyph;T and milepost 71.4&hyph;T at Bristol, TN, a total distance of 0.98 mile. V&S has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on June 2, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by May 13, 1994. 3 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by May 23, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of the exemption. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: James R. Paschall, Norfolk Southern Corporation, Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. V&S has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by May 6, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: April 22, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10558 Filed 5&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
