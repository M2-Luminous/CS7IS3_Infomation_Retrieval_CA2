After being briefed by leading officials of the provincial party committee and people's committee on socioeconomic development projects for the years ahead, President Le Duc Anh pointed out the great potential and important role of Quang Ninh in the renovation process and construction aimed at turning the province into a prosperous and beautiful part of the country. The tasks and objectives of the Quang Ninh Province party organization and people are well-defined and aimed at promoting key economic sectors, namely production of coal, cement, and construction materials; processing of agro-forestry-sea products; and development of a sea-based economy, tourism, and service industries. Concentrated efforts are needed to help local coal producers and industrialists overcome difficulties in capital, technology, and marketing. First of all, it is necessary to invest in infrastructure building projects involving communications and transport, water conservancy, power transmission, and information and communications. It is necessary to accelerate the movement for wasteland reclamation and aquaculture as well as to create sources of raw materials for processing industries and exports. It is important to step up external economic relations, attract investment capital from local and foreign investors, increase export indexes of traditional and local products, and work out adequate plans to exploit tourist attractions. At the same time, it is necessary to step up the campaign against corruption and smuggling, restore order and discipline, and maintain political stability.
