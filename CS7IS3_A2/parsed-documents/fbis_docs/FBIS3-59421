Padori and Z.P. Mokrova: "`Wild' Gasoline Pumps on the Macedonian-Serbian Border: A Black Market With the Blessings of the State"] [Text] In conjunction with the incident last Sunday at the Macedonian-Yugoslav border near the village of Dojane, in which two MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officials and one ARM [Army of the Republic of Macedonia] soldier who were guarding the state border were kidnapped, it turned out that what was involved was the smuggling of fuel--the topic of much gossip and an activity well-known to government authorities, although they do not lift a finger to stop it. And, after an evening's tour around the Kumanovo-Tabanovce region, it became obvious that the incident was a coincidence; nothing was meant by it. Both the "wild" and the "tame" gasoline pumps (not including those of Makpetrol) are largely pouring derivatives for the enterprises of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. It is understood that the price for one liter of diesel is 1.8 German marks, and that fuel is available in unlimited amounts. Greek and Bulgarian gasoline, and perhaps even some from the "Skopje" refinery (?) [as published], is sold exclusively for vehicles with registrations from Gnjilane, Vranje, and Kraljevo. But, as is pointed out both at the customs section at Tabanovci and among the inhabitants of Kumanovo, who have noticed especially increased traffic toward the north, there is obviously one purpose--the smuggling of fuel. Gasoline in Little Kegs and Plastic Bottles Througout the day yesterday, the dozen or so illicit pumps, as well as the legal private pumps that we observed, were operating mainly for FRY citizens. As we traveled from Kumanovo to Tabanovci, the first pump, working nonstop, was at the "Koka" enterprise in the village of Pukovsko. There, the automatic dispensers worked without interruption, and the fuel was flowing into little kegs, canisters, and the reservoirs in tractors, trucks, animal-drawn vehicles, and motorized cultivators. The price was known: one German mark per liter. A kilometer away, the pump at Rajkovo house did not operate yesterday; the tanks were full and right next to the pump were three underground cisterns, awaiting "sales." There were also some pumps near Recica village, but the most often used one was at the Banjka enterprise, next to which, waiting to be unloaded, were seven or so tanks. At a farm near Recica village, the pump, which was located in the middle of a field, was operating beautifully; the fuel was pumped from four automatic dispensers for gasoline and one for diesel. And let us not even mention the roads connecting these locations, because they are not in conformity with any "planning or town ordinances." What is important is that the marks roll in as if on a conveyer belt. At each vehicle we stopped, the drivers with whom we talked said the transportation was being carried out successfully. But, of course, along the auxiliary roadways. This means that the border is being crossed illegally through the fields and that only a minority, those with explosive cargoes, go directly to the ramps [legal border crossing] at Tabanovci. Yet another place where fuel was sold yesterday is the "Keramika 2" pump in Agino village, where, in one truck with Kumanovo registration, there were as many as 15 little kegs, each containing 10 liters of fuel! Around both the temporary and the permanent locations for the sale of fuel, we found hundreds of vehicles whose owners diligently "organized" this dangerous cargo. They poured it into plastic Coca-Cola bottles, stowed it in the bodies of their cars, and some people skillfully lined the area under the chassis with metal containers. As an inhabitant of Gnjilane told us, the really artistic smugglers are from the other side of the border. There, the fuel is sold like hotcakes for three to four marks per liter, and the "smugglers" earn vast amounts of hard currency in cash for only three- to four-kilometer trips. What is being done by the customs officials, police, and border stations in our country, as well as the inspectorate and those state insitutions that are charged with granting licenses to erect gasoline stations? Every Other Person -- A Smuggler The chief of the customs post at the Tabanovce highway crossing, Traje Pesevski, explained to us that it was not possible to get rid of the fuel smugglers. Every second vehicle tries to carry fuel illegally, but the methods used to conceal the fuel border on science fiction. The containers, the big and small cans and the plastic bottles, are conventional, but it has reached the point that entire tanks are being built into car seats, which are then reupholstered; in place of spare tires, there are complete "tankers"; and other "clandestine" places are also found in spaces at the bottom of the doors and even in the engines. As a result, there have been three cases of cars catching on fire. According to Customs Official Toni Nikolovski, up to two metric tons of fuel a day, which were given to Sileks, have been confiscated thanks to the efforts of customs. There was a case in which 460 liters of fuel were confiscated from a single "101" [as published], and up to a ton has been confiscated from buses. The real problem is posed by the surrounding natural approaches to the fields and the country roads. As Mome Jovanovski says, such "black" communications lines are sought in order to provide complete security at the borders. As a result of expedient measures, sometimes up to 200 people a day end up in the opstina [township] court in Kumanovo, which is authorized to deal with illegal trade and the illegal transportation of dangerous materials. According to the authorities from the border crossing, a resolution should be promulgated to give the responsible inspection bodies, which already have obligations in this area, the duty to track the sale of fuel, and even to check those who grant permission for the locations for the sale of gasoline. Authorized "Incompetence" When rumors about illicit gasoline pumps developed, their removal fell within the purview of the Ministry of Urbanization, Construction, Communications, and Ecology. According to Ljupco Todorovski, a chief inspector at the ministry, this business in fuel is located in Tetovo and Kumanovo and on the border with the FRY. In Tetovo, there were 32 "wild" gasoline pumps, of which 15 were outside settled areas. All of these are now in the process of being removed. In fact, 18 such pumps were disassembled by their owners, and 14 were subjected to more forceful measures. In the Kumanovo region, 10 such "wild" pumps have been discovered; there are orders for six to be demolished, and measures are in progress with respect to the other four. Meanwhile, the inspecting bodies are facing a number of problems, which are in large measure the result of the instability of the local administration and which mean that all these difficulties wind up in one place--at the ministry. Particularly surprising is the fact that inspectors' equipment is completely substandard. They did not have a car nor the special skill required for this work, because the fuel should be handled by trained people. Another aspect of this is that, along with last year's relaxation of regulations on gasoline pumps, little attention was paid to who was opening gas stations or where. The approvals were usually given without problems; in addition, the inspectors are not authorized to deal with these pumps. The permission for the location, administrative consent, and approval for the sites are issued only in the ministry with the signature of the minister. Furthermore, this process is not mindful of the safety of the citizens (in densely populated areas) with regard to transportation (without special access roads). Consider, for example, the construction of the gasoline pumps on the expressway and the highways (the western highway); there are specially designed plans for the location and for all the components of such a site. Thus, on the road to Tetovo, two pumps (belonging to Fersped) were to be erected, facing each other, and near the village of Zelino, another two private ones, side by side! Issuing the permits to the enterprises and individuals resulted in a situation in which instead of the flowing of fuel being a function of the traffic, the opposite effect was achieved; the pumps were exclusively for the interest of the individuals. At the same time, plans to widen the road linking Skopje - Tetovo - Gostivar and Ohrid were not considered, so one day these gasoline pumps will be exactly in the middle of the road! They will have to be torn down, and with that, the 600,000-800,000 German marks invested (if they were built in accordance with regulations) will be gone for good.... The apathy of the responsible market inspection service bears a good share of the guilt for the regular smuggling of fuel from Macedonia to the FRY. Evidently, they scarcely move from "the central office" and cannot take credit for any particular achievements. The previously mentioned road is a good example.... But whether they are worried or indifferent--that is a good question! In any case, in view of the open smuggling and the incident on the border, which was obviously not authorized, the state should "pull" the reins that it is holding a little more forcefully. In the past, if nothing else, more concerted action should have been taken, and there is no doubt that even a slight effort would have prevented the situation from becoming as bad as it is now. Is it necessary for another incident like the one last year to occur, or even a more serious one to compel action -- this is, at the moment, uncertain. However, one thing is certain: fuel from Macedonia travels northward, earning millions for the "smugglers," who probably have their "fingers" everywhere, even in the government... and this is no exaggeration....
