The conference stated that the international political situation underwent cardinal changes during the last years and the cold war was over. Consequently, COCOM states decided to alter their strategies to sooner master the markets of ex-communist countries. But they also intend to retain the control over the distribution of weapons, strategic substances and technologies to the former Warsaw Pact foes. The old COCOM restrictions will remain in place until September when the foundation of the new organization is scheduled. Russia was mentioned among the main founders of the new structure, Sers said. The Latvian government has to decide on the participation in this new organization yet, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday [5 April]. Latvia would be interested to join if the system promoted its foreign trade and foreign capital investment in high-tech spheres like computer technologies and electronics. Latvia should create its own system of exports control until June in a bid to monitor exports of chemical, biological and other strategic materials to prevent their abuse in military purposes. The implementation of the anticipated plan may be commissioned to the Latvian Development Agency.
