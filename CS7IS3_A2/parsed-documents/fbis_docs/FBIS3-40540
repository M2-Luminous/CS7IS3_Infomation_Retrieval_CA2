The tool was made for the special purpose of machining micromachines. Prototypes were made for a drawing-to-itself-tool for forming micro-substances and for a cutting tool. Next, the research group will develop a machining system that will permit interchanging tools for micro machining as needed while viewing the machined material under an electron microscope. The newly developed ``hikitsuke'' tool succeeded in attracting to itself copper wire 80 microns (one micron is one-thousandth of one millimeter) in diameter and millimeters long and also a silicon block with dimensions of 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.6 millimeters. Three methods of attracting objects are used: air sucking force, liquid surface tension, and static electric force. The air sucking force method combines a glass tube with an inside diameter of 0.1 millimeter and a vacuum pump. It attaches the object at the end of the glass tube using air sucking force. The liquid surface tension method uses surface tension created by sending a liquid (water was used in experiments) to the end of the same glass pipe. The static electricity method attracts by using static electricity created by supplying voltage in between the tool and the platform on which the object rests. Experiments succeeded in opening indentations the same as that on dice on 300 micron angle salt crystals using a chisel-type cutting tool. The chisel is used on super-hard metal alloys with a blade tip 10 microns wide applied to the processed object and with added sonic vibration.
