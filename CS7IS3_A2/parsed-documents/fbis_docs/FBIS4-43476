Known as "Central Enterprise," this maneuver involves German, Belgian, Danish, Italian, Netherlands, Spanish, and U.S. aircraft and pilots, the allied air forces' Ramstein headquarters in Center-Europe has announced. France, which is not included in NATO's integrated military structure, is taking part in the exercise "in the framework of the normal training relations" it maintains with its allies, the same source stated in a communique. This is thus the first time that nine countries are taking part in a "Central Enterprise," including Denmark (which has been part of the so-called Center-Europe region since 1 January) and Spain. For the occasion, U.S. F-15 fighters have been dispatched to France, the first time this has happened since it withdrew from NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. These aircraft are based in Cambrai (north), a French Air Force spokesman indicated. The NATO communique states that the exercise zone will extend over the Benelux countries, Denmark, certain areas of Germany, northern and central France, the Baltic, and eastern Great Britain. Due to political and military change in Europe in recent years, "Central Enterprise" will involve significantly fewer daily flights than on previous occasions, the communique states. The communique ends by stating that planes will fly during the day only and the exercise should not mean any more activity in the air than during a normal training day. Some 300 U.S. reserves and nine C-130 "Hercules" transport planes were dispatched to Chievres (between Mons and Ath) last Sunday for a period of almost two weeks ending on Friday. These pilots belong to the National Guard (reserve).
