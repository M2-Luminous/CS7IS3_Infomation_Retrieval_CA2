In the interview, Hayashi touched on a package of external economic measures to be compiled by the government by the end of this month, and said: "It is difficult to come up with macro economic measures because there are various limitations in this field. I do not think surprising measures will be included in the package." Thus he indicated that, this time, the government would not spell out drastic measures such as a plan to continue tax cuts from 1995 onward. Regarding the resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Hayashi said: "It seems to be difficult."
