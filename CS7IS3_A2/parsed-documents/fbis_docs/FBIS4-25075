A [Answer]: You know the background. The problems started to arise when the British side could not manage the financial arrangements. The cost started to rise. The amount of loans was also far past the amount contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The result was that the negotiation has carried on over how to resolve the issue of the financial arrangement. Not long ago, the British side put forward the fourth proposal on the financial arrangement. But it's still quite different from the provisions of the MOU. At the meeting held with the Airport Committee last month, we had already put forward our proposals regarding their fourth proposal. Now we are waiting for the answer from the British side towards our proposal. I cannot be sure whether an agreement will be reached soon, but one thing I can say is that the positions on both sides are getting closer. Personally, I think the prospects are promising. Q: Am I right to assume that your policy is to sit Governor Chris Patten out until 1997 and that no dialogue with him is possible? A: We have many channels of communication between China and Britain. We can contact each other through London or in Beijing. The British Embassy can also contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. In Hong Kong, the political department of Xinhua and the Political Adviser's Office of the Hong Kong Government are also channels. The Joint Liaison Group can also maintain contact even if it's not during formal meetings. (Hong Kong and Macao Affairs director) Lu Ping did not see Mr Patten because, even if they did meet, they would have nothing to talk about. Q: I would think there is a lot to talk about. A: No talk on substantial issues is possible with Mr Patten. Q: Do you still have a grudge against the British because of their long colonial history? A: We Chinese feel quite bitter that the British forced China to give up Hong Kong -- you must understand that. I am glad to see that finally we are going to take Hong Kong back and end the history of being humiliated. However, history is history. We should bury the past. But there are still a few people in Britain now whose minds are in the 19th century. It is not good for some politicians or principal officers to think that they are still living in the last century. Q: Would you deny that the British have done a good job here in Hong Kong in the last 100 years or do you view them as an imperialist power which used Hong Kong to enrich themselves and their companies? A: It took all people to achieve this. So I don't have any comment right now if the British have done a good or bad job or if they have been successful or failed. We now have the historic mission to ensure the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Q: There are fears that the efficiency and honesty of the administration will not be as good as now after 1997. A: This issue has been raised for more than 10 years. I want to quote part of a speech by Mr Deng Xiaoping to reply to your question. Deng said one must trust that Hong Kong Chinese can manage Hong Kong. Those people who don't trust us have the minds of old colonialists. We have the fullest confidence in Hong Kong Chinese who are able to run Hong Kong well. The prosperity achieved in Hong Kong is mainly due to the Chinese people of Hong Kong. Chinese people's capability is not lower than foreigners. We are not handicapped. Do not always think that only foreigners can do the job, Chinese can do them well too. Q: The statistics show that 32 per cent of all directorate positions in the civil service are still occupied by foreigners, even though they account for less than two per cent of all civil servants. A: According to the Basic Law, foreign officers will continue to keep their jobs after 1997. But the key positions, actually less than 30 (of them), are going to be localised. Q: Do you intend to keep the Independent Commission Against Corruption [ICAC] and establish your own Special Branch now that the British are closing theirs and taking the files to London? A: According to the Basic Law, the ICAC will stay. As for organisations like Special Branch, that will be decided by the government in future. In my own opinion, as long as the current organisations are effective they will be maintained. But organisations like Special Branch will have to be maintained well. Q: We all know that Xinhua is more than a news agency. What will be the role of Xinhua after 1997? A: We haven't studied this question yet. According to the Basic Law after 1997, the central Government will establish a foreign affairs office in Hong Kong. Q: Will diplomats based in Hong Kong have to report and be accredited to this office or the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government? A: I believe that, until 1996 or 1997, we will (not) have a clear answer for you regarding this issue. One thing for sure is that, in future, the Special Administrative Region will be administrated under its own government. But institutions established by the Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for the foreign affairs managed by central government. All issues of foreign affairs in Hong Kong will be unified and dealt with under the management of the central Government in Beijing. Q: Hong Kong-based diplomats I talked to this week seem unclear about the exact status of their offices after 1997 and if ambassadors in Beijing will be ultimately responsible for their offices here. A: Not necessarily. According to the agreements, the Foreign Office to be established in Hong Kong will be in charge of the major affairs in Hong Kong, but they still can empower the Hong Kong Government to manage certain aspects. Q: What kind of loyalty are you expecting from the expatriates in the civil service? A: All government servants should be dedicated to their duties and are responsible to the Government. For expatriate civil servants, regulations are in place already for post-1997. They say that the Hong Kong Government can employ Hong Kong officers, British or any other foreign nationals. However, at a certain level these officer positions must be held by permanent residents and Chinese citizens of HKSAR who do not have other countries' residency. They are: the secretaries and deputy secretaries, directors of bureaus, directors of organisations such as ICAC, director of audit, chief of police, etc. The Hong Kong Government can also employ British citizens or other foreign citizens as advisers. Q: The provisions are clear. But less clear seems to be who actually holds what passport. You must be aware that many Hong Kong people have two passports, even those who are on the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). What is your position on these dual passport holders? Are you going to demand that they give up their foreign passport? A: For the members of the PWC, we don't have requirements on nationality. Hong Kong is a special place, and the Chinese Government will work out some special conditions. For example, the Regulation Committee will allow 20 per cent of Legco [Legislative Council] members to have a non-Hong Kong passport. You must admit that is quite unique in the world. So it shows we are aware of the realities in Hong Kong. But the executive officers or committee chiefs or the remaining 80 per cent of officers must be Chinese citizens. Q: What is your policy towards the huge Filipino maid community in Hong Kong, since you could be tempted to slow down immigration from Manila and follow a policy of using cheap female labour from across the border in China? A: It is up to the Hong Kong Government to decide what to do with the huge Philippine and Thai maid community. One thing I am sure of is that the labour problems in China will not be solved through exporting them into the Hong Kong market. Hong Kong is such a small place with only 1,100 square kilometres, but it has a six million population. It cannot reduce the huge labour problems of China. Q: There are a lot of Chinese corporations in Hong Kong. Are you keeping a critical eye on the activities of the Chinese companies which, after all, are state-owned and partly responsible for the speculation in the property market, which is alarming. A: Chinese companies only occupy a small percentage of the huge Hong Kong market. We estimate it to be only seven per cent to eight per cent. But they have quite an influence on the Hong Kong market. They have contributed a lot to Hong Kong's prosperity. Some of the big companies provide less expensive products to the Hong Kong market. The Chinese banking groups are now No 2 in the industry. We have investigated the activities of the companies and found that, as far as property speculation is concerned, their part is not so great. Q: Will Xinhua's Hong Kong director Zhou Nan outstay Mr Patten? A: The local press has had a lot of speculation about Mr Zhou and even me being transferred or recalled. As you see, we are still here and have outstayed all the rumours.
