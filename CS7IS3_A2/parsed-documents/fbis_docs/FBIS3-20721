Thus, from the military point of view, the desired objective would not be achieved. Commenting on the bombing threats yesterday on the Radio Kragujevac program "The Sign of the Times," Chief of Staff Perisic said: ``Since the makers of the so-called new world order have decided to finish everything on these Balkans territories without direct engagement of their troops, and since the scenario has somehow been developing slowly, while they are in a hurry, they now want to resolve the situation as soon as possible by using major forces from the air. ``There are different opinions about this in the world, but I personally think that this is another threat designed to create pressure. However, if this were to happen, it would achieve meager results, and from the military standpoint it would not achieve the proposed objective. ``The Western specialists are aware of this, and that is why there are opposing views in the world. Therefore I think that air attacks will not happen, but if they did, I believe the Serbs in the republic of Srpska, and particularly their military leadership, would be wise enough to avoid being hit. In other words, they would be wise enough to take up positions that would offer them maximum protection.'' When he was asked to comment on the special FRY military units that allegedly are fighting in the republic of Srpska on the side of its army, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army said: ``There is no organized transfer of Yugoslav military to the republic of Srpska, and it will not happen in the foreseeable future. I assert that not a single unit of the Yugoslav Army has gone there, nor is any unit fighting in the republic of Srpska or the republic of Serbian Krajina.''
