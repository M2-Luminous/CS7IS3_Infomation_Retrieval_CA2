Japanese and Dutch sources in Belgrade also said Wednesday that the two countries were considering evacuations. The move follows similar steps already taken by the British, U.S. and Dutch embassies there ahead of the Sunday midnight GMT deadline for possible air strikes against Bosnian Serbs surrounding Sarajevo. In Paris, foreign ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said: "The decision was taken to evacuate families of state employees in Belgrade.... The French embassy in Belgrade has also urged the whole French community in the city to take care in current circumstances." Officials here said the evacuation is to take place over the next two or three days, and will affect about 40 people of the 107-strong French contingent of diplomats, embassy staff and families. Meanwhile Western diplomats in Belgrade said Brussels had "strongly recommended" that families of diplomats and staff leave before Friday -- two days ahead of the NATO deadline. "We are not particularly worried, but the Belgian government is of the view that our security in Belgrade cannot be guaranteed in the coming days," said a Belgian diplomat, asking not to be named. A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also requested anonymity, said: "We are examining a number of solutions concerning the families, although evacuating diplomats at the moment is out of the question." He gave no figure for the number of people who could be involved, or a date. "Perhaps even next week, after the ultimatum expires if there have been NATO strikes in Bosnia," he added. So far a total of 40 family members have been evacuated from the other three diplomatic missions -- U.S., Dutch and British -- already sending their families out of the country. Other Western diplomats here are still playing down the consequences of air strikes on the lives of expatriates. "There is no reason to leave at the moment," one senior Western diplomat told AFP. "Evacuating now would seem more like putting psychological pressure on the Serbs than taking security measures," he said.
