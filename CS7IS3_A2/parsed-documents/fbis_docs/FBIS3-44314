According to the commentary, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council stated on December 27 that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the administrative power of the British Government over Hong Kong will expire on June 30, 1997, while Hong Kong's British political structure will end. The three-tier political structure in Hong Kong -- the Legislative Council, district boards and municipal councils -- will be disbanded on June 30, 1997, and will be restructured in line with the Basic Law and the decision of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, the commentary noted. In the final analysis, the commentary said, the essence of the Sino-British confrontation over the Hong Kong question is that "China is determined to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong, whereas Britain does everything in its power to extend its colonial rule over Hong Kong." For that purpose, the British authorities attempted to create, under the cover of "democracy," a status quo that they thought the Chinese Government would have to accept after 1997, so that they would be able to continue their rule over Hong Kong, the commentary added. Having made careful organizational arrangements for Hong Kong's Legislative Council and other institutions, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten asserted more than once that he did not believe that the Chinese Government would "overthrow" these institutions after 1997. The commentary said that the errors made by Patten and other British politicians lie in that they underestimate China's determination to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and uphold the Basic Law of Hong Kong. That China recovers its sovereignty over Hong Kong is to realize a long-term wish of the Chinese nation and to put an end to the most ugly phenomenon of colonial rule in the modern history of the world, it stressed. "Is there any country in the world that dares to accuse China for its just action, and dares to serve as an apologist for colonialism?" the commentary asked. For resuming its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it went on, the Chinese Government has taken a rational approach, namely, establishing a special administrative region in Hong Kong and pursuing a policy of "one country, two systems" with regard to Hong Kong. That policy has been provided for in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The Basic Law is due to come into force on July 1, 1997. "The Chinese Government hopes to cooperate with the British Government in order to effect Hong Kong's smooth transition and successful transfer of political power in 1997," the commentary said. "However, by no means shall we beg the British Government for such cooperation," it stressed. It also warned that whatever contradicts the Basic Law will be overthrown. The commentary called the attention of the British Government and Chris Patten to the fact that it is out of the question for them to impose the three-tier political structure on the Hong Kong special administrative regional government.
