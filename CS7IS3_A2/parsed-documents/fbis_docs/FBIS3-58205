Koller said he was "disappointed and angry" about the French decision to deport to Iran two men sought in connection with the 1990 murder near Geneva of the brother of an Iranian opposition leader. In an interview with the Lausanne newspaper NOUVEAU QUOTIDIEN, Koller contradicted a statement by the French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure that Switzerland was informed ahead of the expulsion of the two men on December 29. Describing Lamassoure's remarks as "completely incomprehensible," Koller reiterated that the decision came as a surprise to the Swiss "who received no warning at all." Koller said at the time of the expulsion of the suspects, Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi, Swiss police were ready to take them into custody for their alleged involvement of the murder of Kazem Radjavi, brother of Massud Radjavi, leader of the People's Mujahidin, an armed group opposed to the Iranian Government. "The European system of justice is good," he said, "But it is necessary for it to be applied." France's attitude to the case was "regrettable," he added. "It is a question of solidarity between countries in the fight against terrorism," he said, adding the fight should not be abandoned even if this posed a increased risk to officials and the public. Koller said he hoped this case would be an exception and urged other countries not to follow the French example, saying it would "compromise the fight against terrorism." He pointed out that despite "Iranian threats," Switzerland had extradited to France two Iranians suspected of involvement in the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar. Evoking national security as a reason not to prosecute terrorists could be justified in cases where there was a considerable threat to public safety, Koller said, but he insisted that it was better to confront terrorists. The office of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has said that France had opted "for reasons of national interest" to expel rather than extradite the men. The Swiss Government is to discuss the issue at a meeting next week but Koller said "it would not help anyone" for Switzerland to take action against the French decision.
