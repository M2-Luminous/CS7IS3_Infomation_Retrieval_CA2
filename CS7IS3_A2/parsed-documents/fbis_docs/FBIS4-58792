FBIS4-58792 "drnes089dd_94014" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th on Police Arrivals, Appointment `Rumors' Sha'th on Police Arrivals, Appointment `Rumors' JN0805112794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0945 GMT 8 May 94 JN0805112794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Telephone interview With Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian negotiating team to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports say you apologized to Yasir 'Arafat regarding your appointment in the Palestinian national authority. How true are these reports? [Sha'th] I was not nominated for this authority and I have not apologized. I do not know the source of these two reports. Thus far, no appointments have been announced and no one has been asked to do anything. I have not apologized to anyone for anything. These are only rumors. [Mu'addi] The PLO leadership is discussing the formation of the Palestinian National Authority. How far have these discussions gone? [Sha'th] I believe that in the next few days, maybe in the next three days, these names will be announced and given to the Israeli Government. [Mu'addi] Let us move to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement signed last week in Cairo. What are the future steps, particularly regarding the deployment of Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho? [Sha'th] These forces are now massing in Rafah, on the Egyptian side of the border, and in Jordan, to prepare to cross into Gaza and Jericho. Naturally, there is some delay resulting from the civil war in Yemen and the fact that planes cannot fly in Libyan airspace. Our troops in Yemen will have to move by land to Saudi Arabia first, and our troops in Libya will have to move by land from Libya to Rafah. This will naturally cause some delay. But, troops are now in Rafah waiting for permission to cross. Troops are also in Amman preparing to move to the Jordan Valley and cross the Allenby Bridge. I think that in the next week or 10 days, these troops will enter to form the bulk of the Palestinian police force. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the talks on refugees, this issue has drawn some reaction in Israel. What did the Oslo Agreement stipulate in this regard? [Sha'th] The Oslo Agreement is very clear. However, there are some people on the Israeli right who do not wish to read, or if they do read, do not wish to understand the agreement. The agreement says the four-sided committee--comprising Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian authority--will discuss the return of refugees who left after 1967 from only two aspects: Establishing the measures for their return and the measures to protect security and public order. There are no restrictions on the numbers or the principle of the return of these individuals. The issue concerns only measures. [Mu'addi] When will the proceedings of the four-sided committee start? [Sha'th] The decision was made in the letters exchanged between Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin that Israel and the PLO should invite Jordan and Egypt to the first meeting within a month after signing the agreement. That will be before 4 June. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you. [Sha'th] Thank you.
