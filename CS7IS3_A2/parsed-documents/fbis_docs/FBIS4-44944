FBIS4-44944 "jpnea029___94024" JPRS-NEA-94-029 JPRS Near East & South Asia 29 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Moves, Status of Election Commissioner Reported Moves, Status of Election Commissioner Reported Announcement on Poll Process 94AS0283D Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 29 Apr 94 p 1 94AS0283D Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] Pune, April 28--The chief election commissioner, Mr T.N. Seshan, said today he will strictly enforce the Rs 1.5-lakh ceiling on election expenses of a candidate and threatened political parties and their candidates with invoking Indian Penal Code [IPC] if they attempted to circumvent the ceiling, reports PTI. Mr Seshan told representatives of political parties here that the IPC section 171(H) prohibited expenses of more than Rs 10 by "anybody," a term, he said, which included political parties too, on behalf of the candidate without the candidate's consent. "And if the candidate gives his consent for such expenses, those expenses would be included in his election expenses for which the ceiling under the Representation of People's Act (RPA) section 77 is Rs 1.5 lakh," he said, warning that exceeding the ceiling would mean villation of the RPA. Mr Seshan described the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling as a "joke, which needs either to be increased or abolished," but nevertheless he asserted its strict implementation since the provision was enacted by Parliament. He is on a three-day visit to supervise poll preparations in the Ahmednagar and Baramati Lok Sabha constituencies. Mr Seshan, in response to a suggestion by a political leader, said a decision on the proposal to provide polling slips to voters either by the government or by the election commission itself would be taken by May 2. He said there was no ban on candidates going to religious places but "direct or indirect political propaganda" inside such places of worship was liable for penal action. Mr Seshan welcomed a suggestion to appoint an observer during elections to monitor use of religion for political gain. The entire election process will be video-taped which would make it easy to detect violation of model code of conduct for elections by political parties and candidates. He directed the district election machinery to widely advertise through newspapers for knowledge of voters that all ballots would be mixed together before counting as a step to protect the identity of voters and prevent post-election intimidation. The election commission would send 600 central police personnel to assist the local administration during the polling. Among those who attended the meeting were the Congress leaders, Bapusaheb Thite, who would be the party's candidate for the Baramati by-election, a Congress MP [member of Parliament], Mr Vidura Navale, the district Congress president, Mr Krishnarao Bhegade, the Janata Dal leader, Mr Shambhajirao Kakade, among others. Mr Seshan also denied reports that he allegedly "snubbed" the Congress MP from Kopargaon, Mr Shankarrao Kale, at the meeting with representatives of political parties at Ahmednagar yesterday. "I did not know that he is a MP," Mr Seshan told political leaders who met him here while denying that he humiliated Mr Kale whom he described as a senior parliamentarian. "Join a political party and I will talk to you," is how Mr Seshan dismissed a journalist who wanted to elicit more information on the election process. "I have lost confidence in the press," he told journalists. Mr Seshan went on to cite his personal medical reports saying he would speak to journalists on any topic other than those under his official purview. "Press of India is a good means (to achieve ends). But today I do not use it as a means and want no benefit from it," he added.
