Hailing from Chongju, North Phyongan Province, he volunteered to join in the People's Army at the age of 18 when the U.S. imperialists unleashed the war of aggression against Korea in 1950. He was wounded on the front and taken prisoner. He should have been repatriated to the northern half of Korea according to the Geneva Convention. But, he has not been sent back to the North due to the unlawful acts of the South Korean puppet clique and had to serve a prison term of 33 years in South Korea for his refusal to be converted. A committee for the promotion of the repatriation of old Kim Yong-tae centering on a Christian organisation was formed early in December last year. According to the magazine, Kim Yong-tae in a recent letter to the president of the International Red Cross said that although he was released from prison, he was making his living by toilsome work for many hours at a rough-work place as a lonely and old disabled man without his relatives, chained by the "law on supervision for public peace." He asked for help, saying that it was his cherished desire to meet his relatives once before he died.
