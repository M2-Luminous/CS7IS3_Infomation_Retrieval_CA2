Michael Wiehen is heading a World Bank delegation to this country. According to him, the government is close to signing a deal with Bulgaria's London Club creditors and the World Bank is ready to support this deal. Support will be rendered parallel with the International Monetary Fund and will find expression in a special loan which the World Bank will extend to Bulgaria this summer. Michael Wiehen declined to specify the exact size of the loan but said it would be a considerable sum. It will depend on the final balance of the separate instruments chosen by the creditor banks and on their final deal with Bulgaria. The loan will be granted for a period of 17 years with a four-year grace period. The assistance rendered by the World Bank to Bulgaria is aimed above all at stepping up economic growth, Michael Wiehen said. He projected that this year the Bulgarian economy will probably mark zero growth but, according to World Bank experts, next year's growth will be positive. The only exception may be agriculture, which under favourable meteorological conditions may register positive growth already this year. The World Bank is closely following privatization in Bulgaria as decisive for this country's transition to market economy. Special attention should be paid to bank privatization and strengthening the supervision of the commercial banks by the central bank, Michael Wiehen said. According to John Wilton, World Bank resident representative in Bulgaria, at present the central bank has small potentials for exercising such control. Some legislative changes are necessary in order to strengthen it. John Wilton described the state of the banking system as a whole as not very good, which is due to the interdependence between the banks and state-owned enterprises and their "bad debts." According to John Wilton, some of the banks in this country may be privatized in the following 12 months.
