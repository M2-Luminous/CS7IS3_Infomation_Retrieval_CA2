During a special meeting of the IAEA's 35-member board, 25 members voted for the resolution. Some members, including China, abstained while the other members did not participate in the balloting. The resolution calls on the DPRK "immediately to allow the IAEA to complete all requested inspection activities and to comply fully with its safeguards agreement." IAEA Director-General Hans Blix briefed board members during the meeting on details of the IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's seven declared nuclear power sites earlier this month. He said that because the inspection team was barred from carrying out necessary inspection activities at a radioactive chemical laboratory, the IAEA could not draw any conclusion on whether nuclear materials had been diverted or reprocessed in the laboratory since February 1993. Thus, the IAEA is ready to renew inspection of nuclear power sites in the DPRK, the director-general said. But he stressed that there was no proof that the DPRK had done anything suspicious since February 1993 when the last full inspections were carried out. The DPRK insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. According to reports from the United Nations, the DPRK issued a statement today saying it had "accepted the IAEA inspection necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15." The IAEA inspection team was able to carry out satisfactorily all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear facilities as specified in the Vienna agreement, it said. The statement said the DPRK side showed "flexibility as an expression of its good-will by agreeing to the impertinent demands from the IAEA Secretariat" during the inspection. "If the IAEA Secretariat tries to provoke us in an attempt to launch another pressure kickup against DPRK," the statement warned, "we will have no other alternative but to respond with our resolute countermeasures." In a speech to the board's meeting, Chinese delegate Chen Shiqiu said that as a board member seriously concerned with the developments, China always hopes that the efforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will continue and be in the right direction until a satisfactory settlement is achieved. China has all along been opposed to the exertion of pressures, because any pressure will be futile, Chen said.
