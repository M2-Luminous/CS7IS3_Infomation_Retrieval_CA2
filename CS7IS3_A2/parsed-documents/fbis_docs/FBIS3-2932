Jia Qinglin stated: The greatest impression after hearing the government report is the necessity to correctly understand and firmly seize opportunities, maintain reform, obtain a foothold in development, and solidly quicken the pace of establishing a socialist market economic system to ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development. The year 1993 has been a proud year for the people of Fujian. Based on the flourishing economic development experienced over the previous 14 years, particularly 1992, Fujian's national economy continued its rapid and sound development in 1993. With province-wide gross domestic product [GDP] totalling 95.3 billion yuan, a 25.4 percent increase over the previous year, Fujian has realized its goal of quadrupling the 1980 GNP seven years ahead of schedule. During this time, primary industry registered a 7.5 percent growth, secondary industry 41.8 percent, and tertiary industry 19.7 percent. New headway was also made in reform, opening up, and all other social development undertakings. "As Fujian's development over the past few years has shown, achieving a relatively greater and more rapid development is completely possible." This is Jia Qinglin's pragmatic attitude--full confidence and non-avoidance of questions. He said: Objectively speaking, we faced certain restraining factors in the course of development, such as shortages of funds, lagging transportation, insufficient energy, and the pressure of high inflation. However, on the whole and with favorable factors outnumbering unfavorable ones, Fujian is experiencing rare development. Jia Qinglin maintained that currently Fujian has at least the following favorable development conditions: First, reform has been accelerated at all levels throughout the province, with the deepening of reform taking root in the hearts of the people. Second, over the past dozen years and more of reform and opening up, the pattern of diversifying major economic sectors has taken shape, while new economic growing points keep on emerging. A greater play of market regulations has injected vigorous vitality into the national economy. Third, opening up wider to the outside world has incessantly strengthened our capacity in international competition and cooperation, thus providing more room for provincial-wide economic development. Fourth, continued heavy investment in fixed assets in recent years; further enhancement of production capacities in energy, transportation, and raw and processed materials; increased incomes for both urban and rural residents; and greater demands for both investment and consumption will certainly further promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Turning to the future, Jia Qinglin said ambitiously: In terms of speed, it took Fujian seven years to double its GDP, and another six to quadruple it; judging from the current growth rate and relatively relaxed economic environment, it may take an even shorter period to secure an eight-fold increase. In terms of efficiency, Fujian has been maintaining its national lead in the composite industrial efficiency index in recent years. In light of the development of "high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency" agriculture--which has brought better efficiency as well as gradual and greater reliance on scientific and technological progress for economic development--the province's overall economic efficiency will be further enhanced. As long as we correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability, and as long as we further tap the potential of speed and efficiency, Fujian will certainly find itself a more rapid and sounder way of economic development.
