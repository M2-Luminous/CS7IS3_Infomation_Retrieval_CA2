In the survey items reflecting the current conditions of social life, the decline in people's satisfaction mainly concentrated in the fields representing the costs of economic development and in the fields covered by the reform measures to be adopted. This was regarded as a warning about rising discontent in society. Over 70 percent of the respondents supported greater the political structural reform. The results of the survey, which was conducted by the public opinion research institute of the Chinese People's University, were made public yesterday. The opinion survey was mainly carried out among 1,200 residents of Qingdao at and above 14 years of age. It was said that the degree of accuracy for the survey was 95 percent, and the margin of error was under 3 percent. The survey showed that as reforms were more intensively carried out and the inflation pressure remained high, the living conditions of the general public continued to improve in 1993. Of all respondents, 71.9 percent expressed satisfaction at the current social and political situation; 70.9 percent and 67.8 percent expressed satisfaction at the economic situation and the conditions of cultural life. However, people were deeply dissatisfied with public conduct, interpersonal relationships, and the relationship between cadres and ordinary people. Respondents showing discontent in these areas accounted for 44 percent, 45.1 percent, and 45.8 percent respectively. The rates marked a new high in the relevant opinion polls in recent years. Many people were also discontented with price levels and product quality. The survey showed that, because some policies being adopted recently were not well-coordinated, people's concern became deeper and people showed stronger reliance on the state and their work units. People generally hoped that they would get help in the aspects of retirement insurance, medical insurance, and housing. Although people still generally agreed that the policies that had been adopted and would soon be adopted were "basically feasible" as a whole, the degree of support obviously declined. In particular, the degree of support for the price policy declined by the biggest margin: People regarding it as feasible accounted for only 13.8 percent; those regarding it as basically feasible accounted for 43 percent; those regarding it as not quite feasible accounted for 16.9 percent; those regarding it as infeasible accounted for 10.7 percent; and those saying unknown to this question accounted for 15.7 percent. The support index declined by 0.45. The support indices of the housing reform policy and the public-funded medical service policy decreased separately by 0.23 and 0.21. The labor and employment policy and the retirement welfare system that have not been reformed fully recorded the smallest margins of decline of the support indices. Most people hoped that vulgar competition and corruption arising in the process of developing the market economy would be brought under control. Sixty-five percent of respondents said that they were not happy although their living standards were enhanced these years. Eighty percent of respondents expressed concern over the mainland society's future development. People expressing concern over continuing price hikes accounted for 78.6 percent; those expressing worry about an out-of-control economic situation accounted for 64.6 percent; people expressing worry about worsening corruption accounted for 63 percent; and people expressing certain concern and deep concern over aggravated polarization between the rich and the poor accounted for 62.5 percent. On the other hand, 73.5 percent of the respondents expressed support for pushing the political structural reform forward at an opportune moment. Among the indices of people's satisfaction in various aspects of social life, those related to entertainment and market supply slightly increased as compared with the same period of last year, but those related to local transportation, environmental protection, working conditions, public sanitation and health care, and housing conditions all declined somewhat. Statistics also showed that older people and poorly educated people were comparatively more satisfied with the current conditions. The index of satisfaction in the group of illiterate or semi-illiterate people was 0.49, but that in the group of people having received tertiary education was -0.3. The assessment made by soldiers, retired personnel, workers, and self- employed laborers was higher the overall assessment level, but that by college students, government functionaries, and professionals engaged in scientific research, education, and medical services was lower than the overall level.
