FR940830-1-00084 FR940830-1-00014 The proposed rules draw on experience from the State of New York (6 NYCRR Part 360, Solid Waste Management Facilities Document for Solid Waste and Semi-solid Waste Handling Practices), and from the State of Louisiana (Regulation 29&hyph;B, section pertaining to permitting of vessels that haul municipal and commercial waste). The USCG has issued interim final regulations which prescribe permit application requirements for SPA permits (33 CFR part 151). The regulations proposed today are designed to work in concert with the USCG permit regulations to implement SPA. These regulations apply in addition to, and not in lieu of, all applicable requirements under any other statutes. II. Detailed Discussion of the Proposed Rule Purpose Section 237.1, as proposed, essentially restates the regulatory authority given to EPA under section 4103(b) of SPA. It requires EPA to prescribe regulations that provide methods to minimize waste deposits into coastal waters during loading, offloading, and transport. It provides for the development and submission, as appropriate, of an Operation and Maintenance manual that will identify procedures to prevent, report and clean up deposits of waste and keep records. Moreover, it allows the Administrator to require owners or operators of waste sources, vessels, and receiving facilities to operate a tracking system if the Administrator determines them necessary to assure adequate compliance with SPA. Applicability Except for those exemptions described below, these proposed regulations apply to all owners and operators of vessels transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters; waste sources from which municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel in coastal waters; and receiving facilities to which municipal or commercial waste is offloaded from a vessel in coastal waters. Coastal waters is defined in the statute (SPA section 4101(2)) and in proposed ยง237.3(b). Where there is ambiguity on the applicability of SPA, we are providing clarification below. Vessels Included Proposed ยง237.2 states that the rule would apply to vessels which transport municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters. Owners or operators of these vessels are required, among other things, to obtain permits from the USCG, and to assure that any deposit of waste into coastal waters from the vessel during transport is minimized. The preamble to the USCG's interim permitting regulations states that a vessel which regularly transports miscellaneous cargo in coastal waters but is hired to transport municipal or commercial waste for a specific voyage is required to have a permit to transport the municipal or commercial waste for that voyage. A SPA permit and compliance with waste handling requirements of this rule (when finalized) are required of the vessel where the predominant business or purpose of the vessel for that voyage is transportation of municipal or commercial waste (54 FR 22546, 22547, May 24, 1989). In developing this regulation, EPA has worked with the USCG to identify vessels that have applied for SPA permits. In doing so, it became clear that there are vessels currently transporting municipal and commercial waste that have not applied for a permit under the USCG permitting requirements. For example, EPA is aware of a number of vessels that support the offshore oil and gas industry by transporting packaged garbage, drilling fluids, and drill cuttings from oil and gas platforms and developed and undeveloped lease blocks in coastal waters to shore for disposal. EPA believes that these vessels fall within the scope of SPA because they are transporting commercial waste in coastal waters. Therefore, EPA believes that vessels which are used, contracted, or hired to transport oil field municipal and commercial waste from offshore development and production facilities to shore reception facilities, commonly referred to as ``supply vessels,'' are required to comply with these regulations, when promulgated in final form. After consulting with the USCG, the agency has been informed that the USCG believes that these ``supply vessels'' are also subject to the permitting requirements under 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. Vessels used, contracted or hired for the purpose of pumping sewage from other vessels are also covered by these regulations. The Agency considered excluding these pump-out vessels from the universe of regulated entities to encourage their use, but concluded that the requirements imposed by these regulations are minimal, and should not discourage the use of pump-out vessels. Vessels Excluded Section 4102(a) of SPA clearly exempts public vessels from this regulation. Section 237.2(b)(1), as proposed, supports this exemption by restating that these regulations do not apply to such vessels (as defined in 33 CFR 151.1006). ``Public vessels'' are defined as vessels that are owned or demise chartered and operated by the United States government or a government of a foreign country and are not engaged in commercial service. SPA states that vessels as defined in section 2101 of title 46 of the United States Code are not required to apply for a SPA permit to transport municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters or comply with this rule. Note that a public vessel would not include a vessel owned by a municipality.
