Viswam: "PM: It's for Pak to Respond"] [Text] London, March 14: The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, on Monday assured his British counterpart, Mr. John Major, that the groundwork for the resumption of the political process in Jammu and Kashmir had already been taken in hand. In the context of the need for restoration of normality in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Rao also conveyed to Mr. Major India's readiness to enter into a dialogue with Pakistan, emphasising at the same time that the responsibility for responding to Indian initiatives in this respect lay solely with Pakistan. The Prime Minister's assurances came in response to a specific enquiry from Mr. Major as to the current steps towards resumption of the political process in Kashmir as well as of an Indo-Pakistan dialogue. During an exchange of views at a summit meeting between the two Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, both Punjab and Kashmir figured in the discussions which were described as frank and cordial. After the meeting, while Mr. Major said that the two of them had a "good meeting," Mr. Rao smiled and nodded acknowledgement as if to say that he concurred with Mr. Major's assessment of the outcome. Mr. Rao told the British Prime Minister that while the Indian interest in holding elections in Kashmir was both keen and earnest, he was sceptical about the success of Indian efforts so long as the "fear of the gun," namely instigation from across the borders persisted. However, he reminded Mr. Major that the Indian efforts in Punjab had succeeded and that the State was now peaceful and democracy functioned there effectively. The Prime Minister also secured a positive response from Mr. Major to his suggestion that Britain consider enhancing significantly its size of investments in India. Mr. Rao stressed that there was need for the international community to resolve issues like Bosnia where forces of extremism were being invoked, with consequential repercussions around the world. The exchange of views at the delegation-level lasted about half-an-hour after which the two Prime Ministers went into a one-to-one session without aides. According to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, the outcome of the talks was on the positive and constructive side. Specifically in respect of India's initiatives to bring Pakistan to the negotiating table, Mr. Rao pointed out that India had recently offered to Pakistan six proposals for initiating a dialogue. He emphasised that India was persistently trying for a constructive dialogue with Pakistan. This argument was cited by Mr. Rao while responding to Mr. Major's query as to whether it was possible to set in place some confidence building measures with Pakistan. The implication of Mr. Rao's response was that such confidence building measures had already been thought upon by India, and the ball was now in Islamabad's court. The two Prime Ministers expressed appreciation of the success of Indo-British partnership initiatives which had been agreed upon by the private sector of the two countries. The continuation of the partnership was endorsed by the two Prime Ministers both of whom were appreciative of the fact that the "wicket is full of runs." Responding with a similar cricket allusion, his British counterpart said that IBPI [Indo-British Partnership Initiative] had had a good innings and that they were still at the crease. [sentence as published] Britain is opposed to the "internationalisation" of the Kashmir issue and strongly supports India's stand that the problem should be resolved through bilateral talks between New Delhi and Islamabad under the Shimla agreement. Referring to the controversial resolution on Kashmir moved and later withdrawn by Pakistan at the recent United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) meeting in Geneva, the sources said the spokesman of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had clearly stated that Britain did not believe that such resolutions were helpful in finding a solution. On human rights in Kashmir, the sources said there had been a willingness on the part of the British government to recognise that there had been "much exaggeration" in reports criticising India on the issue. The British leadership agreed with India's view that "many abuses in Kashmir are committed by militants" and that New Delhi had a democratic tradition, independent judiciary, free press and a number of local and national human rights organisations, which zealously worked for the protection of human rights.
