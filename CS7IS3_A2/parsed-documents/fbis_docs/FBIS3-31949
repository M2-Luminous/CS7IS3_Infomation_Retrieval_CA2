[Tay] Good morning. I am here to say, regarding the civic event taking place this morning, this has been a somewhat chilly morning and that I think this has had some impact on the people. I was in the west side, in the Santa Teresita area, where I voted, and I was told not many people had gone to vote. There were lines of approximately 40 voters per voting booth. When I was leaving I noticed that more people were going to vote. [passage omitted] This is a very important moment for all the people of Guatemala, because our democracy is beginning to consolidate. A very important point has been made: In spite of the conflicts and crises we have endured, we have overcome them rationally, via dialogues. I believe this civic event, this voting, is very important. We must take advantage of this opportunity to speak out about in which direction we think the government should go. This is why I am inviting Guatemalans to fulfill their civic duties. [Dubon] What do you think about the Congress president saying that regardless of the referendum result there should be a rapprochement between the executive and legislative branches, which have had confrontations that have produced the political crisis the country is enduring? [Tay] Regarding the yes or no vote, I think it is important that Guatemalans speak out on this, because they have the right to do this to develop democracy. I think we all want to overcome the errors of the past, and this must be the framework of our civic behavior at this moment. Regarding the Congress president's statement that there has been a growing apart between the two branches, what happens is that the origin of the executive branch is different from that of the legislative branch. [passage omitted] [Dubon] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the attacks? What influence will they have on the referendum? What about the leaflets that have circulated after the deadline for written propaganda? [Tay] I have no information about the leaflets. I was in the interior yesterday, dedicating a school, in San Antonio, speaking with the teachers and the community. They were highly motivated. You know, the towns of San Antonio and Santa Catalina are places [words indistinct] enjoying the beauty of [words indistinct]. The people there are growingly in favor of pacification. I heard that [words indistinct]. There is an environment of fear in the capital, however. I think the media have also contributed to the creation of this atmosphere in the capital. This morning, when I left home, certain people recommended that I not go too far away from the capital. I think this is a contradiction, because it is here where there is this atmosphere due to the attacks, due to those who think the people would not participate in the referendum. I think this is, definitely, very negative, and the Guatemalan people should realize this and not approve of that kind of behavior; otherwise, how are we going to develop? I think we Guatemalans must improve ourselves. Those who have carried out the attacks have committed a crime against the fatherland, because they harm the country. What they are doing is very grave. We have to draw energy from our inner strength, because we are Guatemalans who are uprighteous, who are working for the people who want honesty and calm. I think honesty and calm must permeate through all Guatemalans so that we all, together, in an environment of reason, justice, and equity can march forward, because the country must progress. This country must get out of the crisis and reach the development levels we all want. This is what everybody says; for this reason, I think it is very important that this morning we Guatemalans speak out, aware of the fact that we are part of this democracy.
