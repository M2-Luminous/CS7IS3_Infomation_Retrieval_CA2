During last Wednesday's [29 December] exchanges in European markets, the price of all varieties of crude oil fell to its lowest level in the last five years. [passage omitted] The West's double standard with regard to international trade is quite clear. On the one hand, the West has invariably called for lifting tariffs and restrictions and has promoted the notion of free trade; on the other hand, by imposing heavy tariffs on fossil fuels, it has violated the most fundamental principle of free trade. Some economic analysts believe that at present, the countries of the Middle East region can bring their economies out of the present vulnerability only by ending their reliance on income generated by a single product and expanding their sources of foreign exchange earnings. The members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], together with Iran and Iraq, can form a powerful alliance in connection with the oil issue. Due to their common cultural and historical traits and their good understanding of production capacities, and also in view of the fact that they hold control over the most vital source of energy for the industrial countries of the world, these states are able to deal with the harmful policies of Europe and America with regards to gasoline. They can, perhaps, impose heavy tariffs on European and American products, thereby making amends for part of of the losses incurred by the fall in oil prices. In the same way that the Western world waged a devious confrontation against the oil-producing countries in 1973, now is the time for the OPEC member states to pave the way for real growth without reliance on oil income. The OPEC member states can achieve this growth by transforming their production structures, lessening their reliance on income generated by oil, and finally, by enhancing the rich culture of work and contentment -- which are, after all, characteristics present in Islamic countries.
