The Baltic News Service reported that Minister of Power Engineering Algimantas Stasiukynas denied reports published by the press that the price for oil in the republic is artificially inflated. The figures which he presented to the journalists today show that the petrol price is approximately the same as in Estonia, however, it is significantly cheaper than in Latvia or Belarus. Heating, fuel oil, and electric power are cheaper than in neighboring countries. According to Algimantas Stasiukynas, there are no problems at the moment in getting fuel supplies. The problems appeared in November when Russia and other CIS countries were feverishly accumulating supplies for the winter, however, even then Lithuania did not buy fuel [as heard]. At the moment the reserve of fuel oil is 260,000 tons. If the present weather remains unchanged then this amount of fuel oil would be enough for approximately 50 days. The minister said that since the Russian oil companies became commercial, purchasing oil products has been no problem. Last year, because of the difficult financial situation, only 50,000 tons of its own oil were refined by the Mazeikiai oil refinery Nafta; meanwhile 500,000 tons per month are needed by the enterprise to work at full capacity. Although it would cost $40 million, according to the minister we should look for possibilities for the enterprise to process its own oil. The products from its own oil would cost approximately 10 to 15 percent more, therefore, it is necessary to discuss how these products could become competitive with imported products. The minister maintained that Lithuania has already received a proposal from the Russian oil companies to refine 20 million tons of oil, however, the oil from the Lukoil company has been delayed because export papers were not prepared in time. Getting supplies of gas is a serious problem indeed. The minister said if an extreme situation emerges Lithuania could be left without gas supplies, because so far there is no alternative means of supplying gas. The minister of power engineering stressed that in order to ease the problem of fuel supply Lithuania needs an oil terminal. This would allow the country to import cheaper oil, cause Russian oil companies to reduce the oil price, facilitate the export of fuel oil produced in Mazeikiai, and import cheaper oil products into Lithuania. He denied allegations that preparations for the construction of the oil terminal are being dragged out. On 15 January the results of the competition will be known and the foreign firms which took part in the competition will present their conclusions concerning the construction of the oil terminal in Liepaja. According to the minister of power engineering there are many technical problems in Liepaja; however, international organizations would support Lithuania's decision to build the terminal there because the tendencies of Baltic integration are especially welcomed. In any case the construction of the oil terminal will start this spring, the minister of power engineering maintained.
