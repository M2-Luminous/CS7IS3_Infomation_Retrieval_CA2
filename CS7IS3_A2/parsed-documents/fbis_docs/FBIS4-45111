He expressed concern about the so-called "quiet diplomacy," saying that in the context of Pakistan's nuclear program, the whole nation should be worried about this kind of diplomacy, because our national security could be jeopardized by such quiet diplomacy. According to him, there is nationwide consensus about our nuclear program, and the PPP will not get permission from the people to negate this national agreement. The basis of this consensus among the people is that our nuclear program is actually a "holy keepsake" and a very powerful tool to stop external aggression. He said that Pakistan has repeatedly insisted that the nuclear program should be seen within the framework of the whole region, and that a consistent attitude should be developed about it. Now these inspections, verifications, and quiet diplomacy all mean that our nuclear program is being curtailed, and our present national consensus is being ignored. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demanded that the PPP government issue a clear statement about the nuclear program and remove the impression that this government is trying to extend its political control and is bent upon jeopardizing our national interest and security (THE NEWS daily, 16 April 1994). In our opinion, Mr. Nawaz Sharif's demand that the PPP government clarify its policy is meaningless. The PPP government's clear expression of Pakistan's nuclear program is in the joint statement that was issued at the end of U. S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit to Pakistan. Its text was published in the newspaper. In the fourth paragraph of the joint communique it is stated: "Both governments support efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles used for launching these. In this context, we agree to take the initiative in stopping all production of destructive weapons and ballistic missiles in South Asia, limiting them, and finally stopping their production totally." This statement makes clear in unambiguous words that the PPP government has agreed in principle with the US government to stop Pakistan's nuclear program in three phases. This was a fear which now has become true. It is equivalent to selling our national interests based on the whole nation's agreement in the hands of the United States. The whole nation should express opposition to it in one voice. We should ask Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: In south Asia, India has not supported the idea of stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons and production of missiles. Thus, why did the government of Pakistan support it, and who gave it permission? Did Parliament give her [Bhutto] this right? Did she get a mandate from the people by holding a referendum? How did she get such a right to personally make this decision? How could she unilaterally agree, without getting India's support, that the production and proliferation of nuclear missiles will first be capped, later limited, and then fully stopped? How did this emerge as a national position? If this decision was not made in an authoritative national body, then how did the prime minister get the right to announce such an agreement in a joint communique? As the leader of the Parliament of a democratic country and as its prime minister, she must get permission and approval from Parliament for her decision. She is not the queen of a kingdom who can decide the fate of her nation by herself. The joint communique issued at the end of Mr. Talbott's visit to Pakistan has no legal position, and it was announced without any constitutional right. We would tell the opposition leaders to understand the importance of this crisis properly and to demand that a Parliament session be called, and that the Parliament force the prime minister to take back this joint communique and disassociate herself from this agreement. Otherwise, all of the opposition should walk out of Parliament to protest against this insult to Parliament, so that the government will be forced to retract this wrong statement and will not make any plans to sign any agreements as part of its quiet diplomacy. If the opposition ignores the seriousness of this situation, then Pakistan's nuclear program will be sacrificed on the U. S. altar. All political parties outside the government should unite to form a joint position on it.
