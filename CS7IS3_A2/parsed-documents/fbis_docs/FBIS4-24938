Today, five years later, Beijing's students are equally anxious that their voice be heard -- but it is a different message they want to get across. "I think the Government was right to suppress the rebellion, it was a good thing. Our country would not be in the position it is today if action had not been taken then," said a young undergraduate at the prestigious Chinese People's University. "A lot of students and ordinary people think like that. They see that China is now quite strong and prosperous, so why should you want to disrupt that," he said as he devoured a bowl of noodles at one of the numerous privately-run restaurants which have sprung up around the campus. "We are now engaged in economic construction, that is what people should devote their efforts to, not protesting and demonstrating," he added. When told that many people in the West still had an image of Chinese students as brave fighters for democracy, the student and his friends from the university were flabbergasted. "That's ridiculous," one of them said. "You really must report what we are really like now." The students said the anniversary of the June 4 massacre had no significance for them. They were all in high school at the time and did not take part in any of the protests and had no sentimental attachment to the movement. "It's ancient history now," one of them said. "The only reason we know it's the anniversary is because of all these police outside and increased security on the gate. Otherwise we wouldn't pay any attention to it at all." Nearly all the undergraduates from the People's University interviewed on Friday [3 June] and yesterday had a low opinion of the 1989 democracy movement. "We can say now the movement was badly organised. They did not have clear objectives and did not understand the reality of the situation," one said. "People like Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi were actually very poor students, they got very bad marks in their exams." They accused Wang Dan of cheating his fellow hunger-strikers by sneaking off to restaurants at night and having a good feed while the others suffered in the square. Wuerkaixi, they claimed, had embezzled funds. "Look at where they are now. How can you say these people have achieved anything of note?" another student said. While the students insisted that their views were their own and were not simply repeating a government line, many graduates said their younger colleagues had been brainwashed. "When I was at university (in the mid-1980s) all our teachers were open and encouraged us to develop new ideas but since 1989 the teachers have been much more controlled and have reverted to the old style of education," one graduate said. "The Government has put a lot of work into so-called patriotic education. And it must be said they have been successful," he said. "As you can see there really is a big generation gap between my generation and the students today."
