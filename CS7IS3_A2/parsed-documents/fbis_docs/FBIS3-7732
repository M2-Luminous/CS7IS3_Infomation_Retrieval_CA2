This is very important, Ibrahim Rugova said, because it means that Kosova is not being forgotten and will not be left to one side in the context of the overall settlements that will be achieved. He then returned to everyday life in Kosova, which is extremely difficult and fraught with severe repressions, as we see in the draconian sentences meted out to dozens of Albanians, totalling hundreds of years, as in the trial the day before yesterday in Prishtina. The Academy Exists for Us and the World Unfortunately, the now familiar process of political show trials, that has left behind such scars and trauma, is still continuing in Kosova. Everything is being done in order to discredit our peaceful movement of nonviolent resistance and to erode the sympathy we enjoy in the world, a sympathy that will contribute to a peaceful solution of the problem of Kosova. We repeat these things in order to make clear the true aim of this smear campaign, which will not have any success. Ibrahim Rugova went on to mention the closure of the premises of the Kosova Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Serbian police's confiscation of its assets. We have nevertheless decided that the academy will continue its work. For us and for the world, the Kosova Academy still exists, and is linked with many world academic institutions and universities. Raids on Kosova villages are continuing as ever, such as in the communes of Istog, Kline, Ferizaj [Urosevac], Shtime, Lipjan, Fuse Kosove [Kosovo Polje], Malisheve, Peje [Pec], Skenderaj [Srvica], Vushtrri [Vucitrn], and Kacanik. This repression has been continuing particularly in the communes of Kline, Podujeve, and Mitrovice, and its purpose is both to shake the Albanians' out of their convictions and to harm them economically. Repression is continuing against political activists and especially against schools and teachers. All this is raising political tensions in Kosova, and we appeal, President Rugova said, for preventive measures against repression in Kosova. Talking about the recent initiatives for a settlement to the problems of the former Yugoslavia, Ibrahim Rugova said that Yeltsin's initiative should not supplant a comprehensive settlement, or replace a conference for the overall solution of these problems which all sides would attend. We do not want the logic of Yalta to repeat itself and prevail again in the Balkans, especially in the former Yugoslavia. We do not want the reappearance of various spheres of interest, which would hamper tendencies both toward fragmentation and integration, or, we would rather say, the process of reorganizing the Balkans. I think that the Russian role in the Balkans should not be biased, but should be on the basis of the international standards and principles of the United Nations and European institutions. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome Sali Berisha's visit to Brussels and his signature of the Partnership for Peace agreement, which is a very important step for Albania's integration in Europe and the protection of her security. I also appreciate highly and welcome the report of UN special envoy Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who devoted an entire chapter to the general situation and the discrimination in Kosova. The Political Parties Are Not Closed to Any Class Ibrahim Rugova went on to reply to various questions from journalists. Asked what he thought of Albania's participation in NATO's peacekeeping work, Ibrahim Rugova replied that this would be a positive development, because Albania is a geopolitically interesting country, not only for the Balkans and the Mediterranean, but for Europe. Besides having a positive effect on the Albanians, this would also help to balance forces in the Balkans. Asked what he thought of the proposal to create a Muslim-Croatian confederation in Bosnia and how this would affect Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova said that Christopher had proposed this, although it was present as a suggestion even before, when unavailing efforts were being made to create a Croatian-Muslim coalition. If Bosnia is divided on ethnic lines, then confederations of various kinds will be possible. Meanwhile, drawing parallels with Kosova, he said that the Albanian political parties possess documents about the three well-known options on the status of Kosova. Of course, confederations of various kinds would be open to the Albanians too. Asked about the role of the Coordinating Council of Albanian Political Parties and his own personal role in surmounting various kinds of polarization in Kosova, President Rugova said that the Coordinating Council agreed about overall issues in Kosova and the Albanian territories. There also exists a council of the parties from all the Albanian territories of the former Yugoslavia. Important decisions have been made about the status of Kosova and the Albanians in other areas. I myself have been involved in this council. Of course, it should be more active. We have done a great deal of work on issues in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Both the council and I myself wanted a common congress to be held in order to overcome divisions, but the congress took place with various fractions. We must not overdramatize this, because such things are possible in political life. Political parties must be in the swim of political events, rather than being self-involved. There must be greater understanding. A common language must be found over the most essential issues, on the basis of democratic principles. I say democratic principles, even though this has become a little stale, but I want to say on the basis of human decency. Work should be done on the basis of agreement, because there can be no political life without agreement. Meanwhile, talking about some of the Albanians' political organizations, he said that the Albanians are in favor of political organization. I have repeated several times that we have set out to be a political nation in the positive sense of the word, not a politicized people, but a political people, which means that we have an organized and guided political life. Of course, there will be minor upheavals, but we must work on all issues on a basis of understanding. Asked what he thought of the return of former Kosova politicians to the Kosova political scene, President Rugova said that the former Kosova politicians had been present, and they can make their contribution if they wish. They can involve themselves in politics, because the political parties of Kosova are not closed to any section of Kosova society. Meanwhile, in reply to a question about what he thought of the recent trial, at which the personalities of the Kosova leadership were mentioned, Rugova said that it is not true that a defense ministry exists, as was claimed, or any other ministry. Anton Kola and even myself were mentioned at these political show trials, but facts demonstrate that these are shams whose purpose is to discredit the personalities of the Kosova Democratic Alliance and the other Albanian political parties. Kosova Will Be Open Asked whether talks with the Serbian side are expected soon, Rugova said that there are no signs of talks. We have attempted, he said, within the framework of the Geneva Conference, to talk about various specific issues concerning people's lives in Kosova, such as education and health, but we achieved no success. Meanwhile, our standpoints are well known, and of course Serbia too has its own views. Our stand is for an independent and neutral Kosova. This [passage illegible] I often mentioned, Ibrahim Rugova went on to emphasize, that Kosova will be open to both Serbia and Albania, and we must inevitably reconcile ourselves to this fact. This would be the compromise of the Albanian side. We are all burdened with the past, with Berlin Walls here in the Balkans. I often say that Kosova will remain here and will not go to the moon. It will be close to Serbia, to the Serbs, to Albania, FYROM, ETC. Meanwhile, concerning the question of a parallel according to ethnic lines in Bosnia and Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova said that ethnic lines are valid for other people too in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans; asked whether these lines would stretch to certain communes in southern Serbia, Rugova made no comment.
