ACTION: Notice. In the Matter of: Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casing and Resulting Product SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to deny two petitions for modification of the limited exclusion order issued November 26, 1984, in the above-captioned investigation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith M. Czako, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3093. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 18, 1994, counsel for Viskase Corporation, successor in interest to complainant in the above-captioned investigation, filed a petition requesting, inter alia, modification of the limited exclusion order issued at the conclusion of the investigation. Specifically, the petition requested that the Commission extend the term of the limited exclusion order in order to remedy alleged violations of that order by Viscofan, S.A., respondent in the original investigation. On February 24, 1994, counsel for Teepak, Inc., also filed a petition requesting, inter alia, modification of that exclusion order to extend its term. The Commission determined to apply a revised procedure, similar to the procedure set forth in proposed final rule 210.76, published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52830, 52883), to its consideration of the two petitions. The revised procedure provided that any person might file a response to the two petitions. Numerous requests for leave to file submissions beyond those provided for in the revised procedure were received by the Commission. The Commission denied those requests. In addition, an allegation concerning disclosure of confidential business information was made by counsel on behalf of Teepak. The Commission, having investigated the allegation, determined that no confidential business information was disclosed in the filings in this proceeding. Having considered the petitions for modification, and the responses thereto, the Commission has determined to deny the petitions. The Commission will shortly issue its views regarding this matter. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337, 19 U.S.C. 1335), and section 211.57 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 211.57). Copies of the Commission's Order and opinion, the petitions and responses thereto, and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone (202) 205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on (202) 205&hyph;1810. By order of the Commission. Issued: July 22, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18897 Filed 8&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
