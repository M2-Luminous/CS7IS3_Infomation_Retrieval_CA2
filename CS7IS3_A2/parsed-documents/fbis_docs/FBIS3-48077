The puppet defence minister there blared that "a perfect combat posture of the Army will be taken to deal with armed provocation" of the North. The South Korean puppets revealed their scheme to hurt fellow countrymen with arms, shouting themselves hoarse for "the completion of military posture" and "an immediate retaliation" from the beginning of the year. This shows that they will not hesitate to light the fuse of war to slay fellow countrymen. It must not be overlooked here that the traitor, maliciously charging the North with its fictitious "nuclear issue" again, spun out the malicious trash that the North "refuses to give up nuclear development" because it "has not abandoned its lingering desire for unification through communization and unification with arms." This is a despicable ruse of the traitor to justify armed provocations of his group on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue". Making consistent efforts for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification, the North put forward the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and a proposal for the exchange of special envoys to discuss and resolve outstanding questions between the North and the South. The South Korean puppets, however, are following a road of dependence on foreign forces and North-South confrontation, shunning them. The Kim Yong-sam group must stop running wild, mindful of the irrevocable consequences of its reckless war racket and increase of tensions.
