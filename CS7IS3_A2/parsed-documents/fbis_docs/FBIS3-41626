Against the background of Russia's dumping radioactive wastes with an activity of 55.2 Curies just last year, the sensation raised by about 900 cubic liters of radioactive water with a strength of ``a total'' of one Curie looks at the very least greatly exaggerated. There are 394 reactors on 228 nuclear vessels of the country's Navy, and contamination of seas and oceans by radioactive wastes is inevitable at least for several more years, until such time as technical and financial problems of their utilization are resolved. Meanwhile, if the international aspect is dismissed, the latest incident is a good reason to examine more attentively an entire complex of questions associated with the effect of the activity of the Armed Forces on the ecological situation in the country. Especially because this is already not the first case when the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], and before this the Soviet MFA, had to take the rap for the actions of its military, whose attitude toward nature was traditionally based on the well-known principle ``after us the deluge.'' It is enough to mention at least the multibillion sums of damage caused by the Soviet Army in the countries of Eastern Europe, as compensation for which the USSR and Russia had to abandon the right to real estate of hundreds of military facilities in this region. Even if a correction is made to the vested interest of the governments of East European countries in increasing the sums of ecological damage, it is still measured in astronomical figures, and one can only guess the scale of similar damage to the environment on the territory of the ex-USSR itself, where the Army operated in an incomparably more free and easy manner. Today in Russia alone 12.8 million hectares of land are used by the Ministry of Defense, of which 1.3 million is assigned to test ranges. According to expert assessments, the level of the aggregate anthropogenic load on the environment as a result of the activity of the VPK [military-industrial complex] is comparable to the negative effects on it of all of the other branches. The existing curtain of secrecy around the Army and defense enterprises for decades guaranteed them practically uncontrolled exploitation of the natural complex and, when the curtain was finally raised, the time came to harvest the bitter fruit. Standing in the same rank as the already mentioned contamination of seacoasts with radioactive wastes is the problem of the negative consequences of the tests of space and rocket technology. According to data of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Russia, the production of the rocket-space branches emits 75,000 tonnes of toxic compounds annually, and another 55,000 tonnes are poured into various reservoirs. The general field area for dropping spent rockets/booster stages (OChR) allocated to the Ministry of Defense totals 9 million square kilometers, and 250 areas were taken out of economic use specifically for these purposes. Some of them, especially in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Yakutia, are contaminated with the unburnt residue of the highly toxic rocket fuel heptyl, whose period of decay under permafrost conditions and low temperatures extends several thousand years. Accidents, against which the rocket-space industry is also not guaranteed, represent a significant threat to the environment. For example, in 1985 the Tsyklon space-launch vehicle with a weather satellite on board fell into the Northern Dvina as a result of a catastrophe and, breaking through the ice, sank to the bottom--heptyl was also a part of its two-component fuel. All this in the end was supposed to cause a negative reaction, and today the administrations of the Republic of Altay and Omsk, Tomsk, and Arkhangelsk Oblasts have prohibited the launch of rockets and space vehicles until there is an expert ecological analysis of areas for dropping OChR. The accelerating rates of the processes of disarmament are also creating their own ecological problems. Just with implementation of the START 1 and START 2 treaties it will be necessary for Russia by the year 2000 to withdraw from Strategic Missile Troops units about 100,000 tonnes of highly toxic substances, to which another 30,000 tonnes should be added that have been accumulated by the Air Defense Troops. The enormous reserves of chemical weapons of the former USSR, whose destruction is envisioned in international treaties, constitutes a separate problem. Besides ecological damage, by contaminating the environment the Armed Forces also cause purely economic losses. Thus, because of the poor technical condition and improper operation of fuel storage on military airfields, a majority of which were constructed as far back as the 1950's and 1960's, tens of thousands of tonnes of petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) are lost annually. This problem is especially acute in Mozdok, Engels, and Yeysk, although it is urgent not only for Russia. Not long ago the program ``Vesti'' showed a report from Ukraine, where local ecologists demonstrated samples of subsoil water from one of the air bases that flared up when a match was brought to it. In Germany, zealous Germans announced plans to begin the industrial extraction of kerosene from an underground cavity under a former Soviet troop airfield where a man-made lake formed over several decades. The ground in many garrisons is saturated with this same kind of kerosene that was discarded by aircraft in the form of unexpended fuel during a landing approach. All told, 5,000 hectares of land in Russia alone are contaminated with the Army's oil products and wastes. However, there are indications today that the attitude, if not of the Army toward nature, then, in any case, of society toward the Army's disgraceful ecological practices, is beginning to change more and more. The economic factors of wildlife management that are being introduced are making themselves felt. In 1992 the total fines imposed on military units for contaminating the environment totalled 43.5 million rubles [R], and it is already clear that this year it will be several orders of magnitude more. For example, local authorities submitted a bill of R24 billion to the aviation garrison of the city of Engels alone. Nonetheless, if you take into account that the Army is on budget financing, similar economic sanctions resemble taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another. Therefore, in the opinion of specialists, a different way is more productive. The recently established Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Safety of the Security Council examined the ecological aspects of the activity of the Armed Forces at a meeting in October. The result of its work was a draft edict of the president ``On the Establishment of Ecological Subunits of the Ministry of Defense of Russia.'' It should be noted here that the administration of ecology and special means of protection, numbering 240 employees, began to operate in the structure of the Russian defense department last year; however, as it became clear, it evidently does not have enough forces to influence the situation at least in some way. In comparison, the ecological subunits in a majority of the NATO countries have already existed for many years, and number 1,700 persons even in little Norway. In the United States, $5 billion has been allocated for 1994 for environmental protection work, which is 2 percent of the entire military budget. The prepared draft of the edict of the president of Russia proposes that Army environmental protection services also be formed in our country. The concept of ecological support of the Armed Forces that was approved by the chief of the General Staff envisions the formation of ecological subunits in groups and arms of service in 1993-1994, and each military district will have them in the following two years. If these plans are fated to take place, there is a hope that the Army not only will be able to indemnify the damage to the environment that its own activity causes, but also solve ecological problems that confront the whole state.
