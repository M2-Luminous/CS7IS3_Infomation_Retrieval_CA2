At the meeting presided over by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), the ministers agreed to strive for an agreement on exchanging special envoys at the seventh contact. They also decided to keep pushing for the exchange by March 21 after analyzing the results of the six inter-Korean working-level contacts held so far. The ministers, however, reaffirmed that if North Korea delays the envoy exchange to the last minute, the third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington should be put off too, informed sources said. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu reported on the results of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of North Korean nuclear sites, officials said. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk also attended the meeting.
