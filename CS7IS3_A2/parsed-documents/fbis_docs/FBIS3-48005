He came to Seoul on 12 January after winding up his visit to Japan. The reporter met him at the office of the ROK-German Chamber of Commerce in Seoul on 13 January. [Ho Mun-myong] What is the purpose of your visit to the ROK? [Steel] The German economy is export-oriented. But the settlement of the Uruguay Round made the German Government take even greater interest in international trade. The Asian region has a great growth potential and its investment environment is improving with each passing day. I have come to Seoul on behalf of the German industrialists to explore prospective business areas for investment and ways to promote economic cooperation. [Ho] You said there has been a change in the investment environment in the ROK, did you not? [Steel] Yes. Comparing it with that of one year ago when I visited Seoul, I find a considerable change not only in the external appearance of Seoul but in its economic environment, as well. Many of the restrictions have been lifted and the investment environment is changing positively. [end Steel] President Steel said, "The ROK is trying hard to export its goods, but is blocking its domestic market from foreign exporters. A typical example is that the ROK is discouraging people from buying foreign-made cars while allowing them to be imported." [Ho] Is there any problem in Germany's internationalization? [Steel] Germany's exports and imports account for two-thirds of its gross national product. This explains how much we depend on trade with other countries. We have an urgent need to secure not only the European market but the East Asian and South American markets. Many German businesses are moving their plants to Southeast Asia and East Europe avoiding high production cost in Germany, therefore, this will activate our advance into these areas. [Ho] Do you think this is a good time for the ROK to internationalize its economy? [Steel] Yes, it is the right time for the ROK to do so because the ROK economy is now capable of sustaining itself to a certain degree. The ROK has liberalized much of its markets, but it has yet to open up more of them. President Steel is the director of the Steel Company, the electric saw manufacturer that has 30 percent share of the entire world market, and was elected president of the German Federal Chamber of Commerce in 1988.
