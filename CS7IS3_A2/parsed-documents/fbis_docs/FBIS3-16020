A spokesman for the Army Headquarters of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has reported to Interfax that Friday night the Azerbaijanis tried to advance toward Agdam, but their attempt was dashed. After intensive artillery shelling Saturday morning, the Azerbaijani forces resumed their offensive toward the Novruzlu community. According to reports from Stepanakert, the enemy was forced to retreat to where it had come from with casualties.
