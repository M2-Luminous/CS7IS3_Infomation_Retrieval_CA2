The initiators of "political amnesty made a fool" not only of themselves but also of those they supported; "Both the August 1991 putsch plotters and participants in the bloody October developments should plead guilty in order to become free," said Poltoranin. In the opinion of Poltoranin, the opposition worked most for the liberation of Aleksandr Rutskoy as a "national leader". But the situation will also be used by people who fired at unarmed people. The amnesty resolution is an act of humiliation and discrediting of the authorities, not only those executive, said Poltoranin. "It is a blow on the law-enforcement bodies and the legal system of the state," he noted. Intruding into competence of the court bodies, the State Duma did not think about consequences. The latter may not only occur in political life but also affect the interior bodies, which fight against crime risking the lives of their staffers. Poltoranin said he is against "global amnesties". In his opinion, some 20,000 people will be freed from prisons and penitentiaries to make the life of law-abiding citizens even more dangerous.
