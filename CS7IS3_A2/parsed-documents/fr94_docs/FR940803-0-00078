FR940803-0-00078 FR940803-0-00023 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard has reviewed this interim rule for potential impact on small entities. Because this rule does not place any new requirements on the public, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no economic impact on small entities. If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see ``ADDRESSES'') explaining why you think it qualifies and to what degree this rule will economically affect it. Collection of Information This interim rule contains no new collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ]. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that the rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and concluded that, under §2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub-§2.B.2.1. of that Instruction that clearly has no environmental impact. A Determination of Categorical Exclusion is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.''
