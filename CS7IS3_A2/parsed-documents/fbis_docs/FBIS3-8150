FBIS3-8150 "dreeu044_a_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 ALBANIA Ministry Condemns `Irresponsible Acts' AU0603192294 Tirana TVSH Television Network in Albanian 1735 GMT 6 Mar 94 AU0603192294 Tirana TVSH Television Network Language: Albanian Article Type:BFN [Statement issued by the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry on 6 March; place not given -- read by announcer] [Text] As reported, on 5 March 1994 in Pogaj village in Has District, near border marker D-7, 100 meters into Albanian territory, 20-year-old soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite District was wounded by fire from the Yugoslav border post of Goruzhup. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania strongly protests this act by Yugoslav border forces, which is another flagrant and revolting act with open anti-Albanian aims. This act refutes the demagogy of statements and memorandums of the Yugoslav side, which blame Albania for the incidents on the border between both countries as well as for the so-called lack of alertness of the Albanian side to resolve problems between them. The wounding of the Albanian soldier yesterday increased the number of the Albanians killed or wounded on the northern border to 22 people, when no Serb has been wounded or killed by Albanian border forces. Such criminal acts, both in the past and now, are premeditated and are committed at a time when the international community is engaged in resolving, peacefully and through dialogue, the conflicts that have broken out in the former Yugoslavia and preventing them from expanding to other areas. These acts are committed to increase tension on the border between both countries, to consequently increase the level of insecurity and tension in the Balkans by instigating situations with unprecedented consequences, and to accompany the intensified movements of the Serbian Army on the border with Albania and within Kosova. Such acts, along with the murder of an Albanian by Serbian soldiers on the Kosovar-Macedonian border, the trial fabrications against Albanians, and the closure of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republic of Kosova, complete the tableau of the Serbian policy of genocide and oppression against the Albanian population in Kosova and the methods of pressure and political and military blackmail by Milosevic against the Albanian state. Albania protests such irresponsible acts and, before the world public, again denounces the provokers of such dangerous situations, who are the same authors of the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic cleansing, and the massacres against the simple people.
