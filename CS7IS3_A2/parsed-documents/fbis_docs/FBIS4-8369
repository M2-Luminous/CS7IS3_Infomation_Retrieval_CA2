I am convinced that, at this very moment, we find ourselves precisely at such a place. And it is precisely at this moment that it is important to speak the truth and give things their correct names. Otherwise, we might lose our direction at this crossroads. That is why it is important to think over what we are being told so that we do not succumb to passions that could lead us to disastrous conflicts. What we need is healthy judgment, so that we are not turned into a tool of demagoguery. We must say this to ourselves to explain why it is we, this government, who are here, why we thought it necessary to change the government in the middle of an election term. It is not something extraordinary in the history of European parliamentarism. However, it is not something that happens very often. I believe very strongly that it needs to be explained before we start assessing this government's policy statement. To start with, I would like to talk about something personal. When I think about public affairs, I often think about what happened in November 1989. At that time, I was with my students at the Comenius University in Bratislava. I can still feel their resolve to change the current state of affairs, their hope and faith in the future. I identified with their feelings. I promised myself then that I must not let them down. This moral obligation is for me the highest criterion in my political activity, as well. It is more important than belonging to a political party or to a movement. I am trying to say that there are and must be in politics values that are above political parties and that political parties must respect. Otherwise, our Constitution will yet again become a formal document. These are values that an overwhelming majority of the Slovak population agreed on at the end of 1989. The stability and prosperity of advanced Europe is built on these values. We have identified these values as protection of a citizen's rights and freedoms, protection of his right to own property, and the democratic management of public affairs. There is no need to think of other methods. Other methods lead to stagnation. We are in the center of Europe. If we invent other rules and other principles of arranging the state and society, we will only harm ourselves. I would like to discuss one problem whose explanation is very important for our future. It is the problem of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which won in the election two years ago but was not able to maintain power. The question emerges: Is this only an internal tragedy of this movement, or is it a fact that can be generalized and from which lessons can be drawn for all? I am convinced that the demise of the HZDS is not only a question for this movement but also touches upon many aspects of the main issues of our young state and concerns the reason for the existence of this government. Every political party is composed of people who give it its form, direction, and aims. It is from this point of view that the HZDS at the time of the election and the HZDS today are two different entities. The key personalities that formed it in the beginning either left the party or were expelled from it. It lost a significiant part of its electoral base. These pronounced changes could not but be reflected in the composition of our parliament. Eighteen deputies left the HZDS club, and others are considering this. The original club of the Slovak National Party [SNS] has also fallen apart, which is also connected with the development of the HZDS. We often ask the justified question of why they did so. Some reply that it was treason, personal interest, changing sides for reward, as is the case with football clubs. All this is a fabrication. It is used, above all, by those who want to hide in this way their share of guilt. The reality is more unpleasant than that. Let me point to my personal experience. In the last election campaign, together with Michal Kovac, Roman Kovac, Milan Knazko, Rudolf Filkus, and Lubomir Dolgos, I did not tell our voters, the voters of the then HZDS, that we were trying to win them over to be able to carry out the privatization for our benefit and for the benefit of our party followers, that, with their help, we wanted to build a state party. We promised them something completely different. We told them we wanted democracy, cooperative, nonconfrontational politics--that is, cooperation with the other political parties, better social security, a better sense of security, high-quality performance in office, and so on. From the point of view and experience of today, we have, in fact, introduced them to these things because reality has developed differently for two years after the elections. For instance, what explanation can Deputies Meciar, Keltosova, and Tothova offer to their electorate about the fact that, as Cabinet members, they voted in favor of a decision by which, within the framework of privatization, they have literally donated 1 billion korunas to private individuals--I am speaking about the transfer of shares of the VSZ [East Slovak Ironworks] to a private company. Is this what they promised the citizens? There are more questions we can and must ask. Is it in harmony with the democratic principles of executive power to finance a party's newspaper with state money--that is, using money from taxes paid by all of the citizens? I am speaking about the REPUBLIKA daily. We would not find something like this in any democratic state. Is it right to use taxpayers' money to organize a referendum, the aim of which is to be one party gaining seats they have lost in parliament? Did those who voted for the HZDS expect the prime minister to strictly demand from his ministers that they appoint HZDS members to head personnel departments and control bodies at all ministries? I am mentioning all this so as to ask a more fundamental question: Is the preservation of democracy guaranteed by a political party or by the deputies' conscience? No party can be or is the supreme authority. If we go along with the HZDS's proposal to subordinate a deputy's conscience to the party will, we will sow a seed in our parliament that might grow very fast into a one-party system. We are quite often told by the HZDS that it is the only one capable of forming a functioning government, that its chairman is the only one capable of managing public affairs at this time. We must be very alert when hearing such voices and not underestimate them in any way. We have previous experience in the period when one party declared itself exceptional. Both Stalin and Brezhnev were, for instance, convinced that no one could replace them. To achieve stability in our state, we need stable political parties that will secure the permanence and continuity of the democratic process. Much, therefore, depends on the future development of political parties in Slovakia. It is necessary to pay proper attention and take note in which parties and movements malice is spreading against certain groups of citizens, which parties and movement have built their profile on excessive worshipping of one person, from where confrontational attitudes and demagoguery are ensuing, being perceived as fundamental methods of the political struggle. It is not possible to cooperate with such political parties. They do exist, but they belong to the margins of the political spectrum. It is exactly in this connection that I would like to stress the importance of the current government coalition. This coalition proves that effective cooperation between political entities of different political orientations is possible also in Slovakia. These parties have come to understand that they must place the state interest above their differences of opinion. At this stage, the future of Slovakia is being decided for a long time ahead. It is therefore necessary to bring together Slovakia's whole creative potential right now. To achieve that, we will have to create favorable conditions, an atmosphere of peace, understanding, and willingness to cooperate. This means that we need the national and civic reconciliation for which the president of the Slovak Republic appealed in his speech to this parliament--which has been recalled in this parliament by a prominent Slovak personality, Cardinal Tomko--and the need for which is, as a memento of Svatopluk twigs [fable in which Moravian ruler Svatopluk told his sons to stay together because a group of twigs bundled together is stronger than the total of the individual strengths of each twig], ever present in our history. This government coalition is offering such an atmosphere and the concentration of creative potential. Ladies and gentlemen, another very important and repeatedly debated issue is the relation between the emergence of our independent state and the development of our statehood. I do not want to lead a discussion on who deserves credit and to what extent for the fact that Slovakia is an independent republic or to belittle or exaggerate the merits of individuals or political parties, even though legends always surround such historic events. In a way, these issues already belong to the domain of historians. It is beyond doubt that Slovakia's independence is a great challenge for us, an opportunity to gauge our own ability and strength and to prove our viability. At the same time, it brings great responsibility toward this generation as well as future generations, whose life-styles we are predetermining today. Most of all, it is important what foundations we lay for statehood, what we leave to the coming generations. The resposibility for this is equally shared by all who live and have decided to live in this country, regardless of how they have assessed the emergence of an independent state, whether they were in favor or against. This has to be understood especially by those who would like to differentiate between greater and lesser patriots, who claim that words published in one Slovak paper are more Slovak than those published in another Slovak paper. If we go on differentiating like this, we will lose our republic. Slovakia is our homeland. It is home to Slovaks and members of many other ethnic groups who have been living in Slovakia for centuries. We have proved our maturity also by being able to create a peaceful atmosphere for the coexistence of citizens of different ethnic backgrounds. This is of great value, and we must not lose it by nurturing national intolerance, which is alien to our character. Slovakia's borders have been determined by international documents. Anyone who questions the borders in order to whip up nationalist passions is harming Slovakia. Confirmation of the borders, including the borders with the Republic of Hungary, should be the basis for establishing mutual trust. We would thus make a major and important step on the path to historical reconciliation. The principle of searching for enemies both at home and abroad cannot be used to consolidate Slovak statehood. This is a path leading to conflicts that need never occur and that impoverish us. Ladies and gentlemen, the demise of the HZDS and the SNS as ruling parties, their inability to maintain policy unity, and their inability to cooperate with other political parties were the direct cause of the recent political crisis. These parties bear the political responsibility for the fact that there have to be early parliamentary elections. The HZDS, especially, or what remains of this movement was unable to cope with the responsibility with which it had been vested by those who cast their votes for it in the election. The movement has exercised power in a way that has put off some of its members and discredited the movement itself in the eyes of the majority of this state's citizens. Its activity resulted in doubt being cast on our credibility in international relations and led the country to economic collapse. Under these circumstances, the only possible solution to the long-lasting political crisis in Slovakia was the setting up of a broad coalition government. However, after the collapse of the political power that emerged from the election, only a new election can bring a more permanent solution. The proposed policy statement presented by this government is an alternative that can secure such a solution for Slovakia. With this statement, I am presenting to you the draft of the government policy statement for your consideration, and I am asking you to support it.
