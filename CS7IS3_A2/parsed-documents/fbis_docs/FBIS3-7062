I wish to offer my hearty welcome to your excellency the president of the Republic of Korea, now paying a visit to this country as a state guest with Mrs. Kim Yong-sam. It gives me utmost pleasure to be able to have the company of your excellency, Mrs. Kim Yong-sam and the members of their suite at this banquet. Your country is the nearest neighbor to us. Exchanges between our people date back to ancient times preceding the descriptions in history books. A variety of arts and sciences were introduced to Japan by your people and our ancestors learned many things from your people. In the course of long and close exchanges between our two countries, there was a period during which my country inflicted great many sufferings on the people of the Korean peninsula. As I expressed my deep sorrow over this some years ago, I always have the same feeling. Since the end of the war, our people, on the basis of the lesson of the past history, have endeavored to build up unshaken trust and friendship with your people. I am gratified that friendship and cooperative relations between our two countries have recently been advanced in many different fields thanks to the continuous enthusiasm and efforts of their people and that the ties binding the nations have been strengthened, as seen in the "Korean cultural envoy" events including the Kaya cultural exhibition two years ago, and the international exhibition held in Taejon city last year. I earnestly hope that their mutual understanding will deepen on all possible occasions. Today, the world is encountering waves of dramatic changes. In this situation, our two countries, as your excellency the president has repeatedly stated, should further solidify their friendly and cooperative ties and blaze hand-in-hand the path to the future. Your excellency has been promoting "the creation of a new Republic of Korea" and making serious efforts to strengthen the relationship between Japan and the Republic of Korea. I am confident that your excellency's present visit to this country will prove to be an extremely significant occasion for the future relations of our two countries. Although your excellency's stay is short, it is my ardent hope that you will enjoy the spring of our country, meet a broad range of people in various circles, personally observe our country's actual condition, and find your visit fruitful. With best wishes for the further development of friendship between our two countries, may I now propose a toast to the good health and happiness of your excellency the President and Mrs. Kim Yong-sam, and the prosperity of the people of the Republic of Korea.
