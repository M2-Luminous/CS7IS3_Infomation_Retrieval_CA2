The new tax system which became effective early this year has seen its results with the financial revenue in the country increasing by 86 percent last month. The balance between revenue and expenditure in the month was RMB 5.1 billion [renminbi]. Such sharp growth in financial revenue is mainly attributed to a lower base figure for January last year on which the calculation was based and the early submission to the state coffers of proceeds from national bonds in addition to continuous rapid economic growth. The national economy for last January showed some points worth nothing. Industrial production maintained its quick growth with a sound balance between production and marketing. The industrial output value rose by 33.2 percent last January, a daily gain of 19.9 [as received] percent on average when taking into consideration holidays. The sales rate increased by 1.3 percentage points over the same month last year. The domestic market was relatively stable last month when the retail value of consumer goods rose by 22 percent over the same month last year, showing a 5 percent growth after taking into consideration the price factor. Consumers tended to buy products of high grade with various kinds of famous brand and high-quality products seeing the best sales. The rural market took a turn for the better with the retail value there last January keeping pace with that in the urban market. Imports showed a rapid gain and exports registered a rebound with a rise in foreign exchange earnings. Imports increased by 78 percent in January and exports by 43.1 percent with imports surpassing exports by U.S.$900 million. The State Statistical Bureau said that the economy was proceeding at a steady pace at present while at the same time some problems concerning the economic life remained. Market prices, already at a high level, continued to climb last January. Consumption prices in 35 main cities rose by 23.3 percent in January over the same month last year. Various kinds of items saw their prices rise to various extents with food, clothing, medical health care and leisure-time activities as well as education showing a higher gain of price ranging between 4 and 6.4 percent over January last year. The current economy is generally regarded as an extension of that in the fourth quarter last year. It showed quick growth on the one hand while on the other some problems were still prominent and macro-economic regulation needed to be kept in place. Authoritative sources were convinced that a rather tight policy on the macro-economy should be maintained. Fixed assets investment underway should be kept under control in terms of size and direction while the gross loan volume and financial order should be maintained with a timely adjustment necessary in order to keep a balance between supply and demand.
