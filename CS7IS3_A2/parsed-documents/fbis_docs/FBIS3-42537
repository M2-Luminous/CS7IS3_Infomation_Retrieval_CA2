Ye. Zhukovskiy, under the rubric "Documents": "Theft in Orbit, Or How Our `Space Achievements' Are Being Put Onto the World Market"; figure of possible configuration of international station not reproduced here] [Text] The crisis situation in our aerospace industry, which has been cast to the whims of fate by the Russian government, is approaching a point beyond which its resurrection will, in the near future, be impossible. We're reassured by the fact that the Russian Space Agency, in attempting to avert an impending catastrophe, has managed some big successes in the commercialization of that most important sector of the military-industrial complex. According to the American-Russian agreement that has been adopted, Russia, until the end of the century, can conclude no more than one contract a year for the launch of geostationary satellites, whereas contracts for the launch of low-orbit satellites must be examined on a case-by-case basis. U.S. businessmen are taking care of Russia's revenues: the payout for each commercial launch of the Proton vehicle cannot be lower than 92.5 percent of the price asked for similar launches by U.S. or Western European companies. U.S. congressmen and representatives are playing the role of "good patrons," supposedly defending Russian interests against the encroachments of the "bad Western European merchants." The latter guys, of course, are not ecstatic about the attempts of the "Russian agency" to enter the "trade ranks" on the world space market. But the Americans, in turn, are concerned about the considerable share held by Western Europe in the revenues from commercial launches of satellites, while, in their view, their own share is small (at 35 percent). That is why the United States is striving to dictate its own strict requirements for the conclusion of trade deals to its new competitors, as well as to its old competitors. Assistant U.S. Commissioner for Trade Peter Olzier [Olzhiyer] declared this: "Representatives of Western Europe are trying to coordinate an agreement that determines such rules (essentially, fettering for Russia and other potential competitors -- L. Kaminin), with simplification of the procedure for producing with them sanctions of the American government against launches." What kinds of revenues are stipulated for us in that agreement? Russian Space Agency director Yuriy Koptev says that participation in commercial launches of launch vehicles and the sale of aerospace hardware will being Russia no less than $200-220 million a year. Is that a lot? We know that in 1992, the worldwide total for revenues from the commercial use of space hardware reached $13.2 billion. With that, the revenues from the use of launchers did not exceed $1.2 billion, that is, 10 percent of the total revenues. That means that the country that was the first to open the path to space will be allowed to receive for offering its launchers no more than one-sixtieth of the worldwide total of "space revenues." And that until the end of the century. Against the backdrop of that "space theft" announced beforehand, the ultimatum presented by the United States to Russia in connection with the contract concluded in 1991 for the delivery to India of cryogenic motors for a measly $2 million simply pales. And yet it is in force. True, that was only after, in exchange for refusing the little blue bird in the hand -- the agreement to "freeze" the contract with India -- they promised us the crane in the sky: they promised to better the chances of Russia to participate in the building of the Freedom orbital station. President Clinton approved a limit of $10.5 billion for the spending associated with the creation of the Freedom station up to the end of the 20th century. Russian Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, as he was departing recently for talks in the United States, announced that the participation of Russia in the realization of the Freedom project will enable the Americans to "earn" more than $2 billion. The prime minister was modestly quiet about how much we would earn. Either he was hiding that intentionally, or he didn't know what we would earn. But in the words of Yu. Koptev, we will be paid $600-700 million for the help Russia will give the United States in building the station. We should note that if a joint three-way project is adopted, a good half of the station modules will be units being developed for our future Mir-2 station, whereas the American laboratory will take up no more than one-fourth of the total space of the structure. Why, we ask, do we place such a low price on our labor and our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the minimum cost of the American "quarter" of the future station is estimated by U.S. specialists to be $10.5 billion, whereas the Russian "half," if we are to believe our prime minister, is only $2 billion, which is saved by the Americans as a result of the use of Mir-2 units. And why, if we are to believe Mr. Koptev, will we be able to get only a third of that clearly understated amount? You arrive at some uncomfortable conclusions. Neither the Western European wholesale space merchants, nor our transoceanic patrons are really burning with the desire to have another competitor on the "free and uncontrolled" market for space technologies and services. And that's why, in the discussion of joint plans and programs of cooperation in space, they're addressing us not as equal partners, but as poor relatives patiently awaiting the next pittance from a bar stool.
