He said: "I have great admiration for the prefect. I believe he enjoys great sympathy not only among the coca growers but also among the people of Cochabamba, and his own party. This is why I would like to ask him to implore to his son (director of the Agricultural Reconversion Directorate) to prevent the suffering of coca growers by ordering the suspension of the mandatory coca reduction." Less than three weeks ago the son of the prefect, whose name is also German Lema like his father, took over the Agricultural Reconversion Directorate which has the responsibility of implementing the coca eradication policy throughout the country. Morales said he made the appeal with the understanding that the first political authority of Cochabamba, due to his great humanitarian feelings, could intercede and "even order the suspension of the coca eradication plan because this would be an instruction not only from a father but from the prefect." The coca growers believe the government pretext for reducing coca plantations is exaggerated and responds to pressure from U.S. organizations interested in eliminating coca. He said: "The government knows that the Chapare region is a zone highly influenced by drug trafficking. The government knows this well, therefore the justifications for reducing coca are not solid and awaken greater susceptibility on the credibility of the government operations." [sentence as published] The peasants of the Chapare region are afraid and they do not want to leave their land to preserve their coca plantations which, according to several governments, represent the basis of the national economy. Morales, who is going to Lima to attend an international meeting of peasants, said he will meet with Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu to report the government plans, and to ask her to send a letter to the president asking him to stop the coca reduction project.
