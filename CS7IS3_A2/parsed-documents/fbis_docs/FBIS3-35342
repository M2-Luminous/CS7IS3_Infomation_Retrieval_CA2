The second group would carry out operations against prominent figures of the Iraqi opposition. The statement added that the third group had been given responsibility for sabotage operations and planting mines in important and densely populated areas in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran, and Syria, where the Iraqi opposition is active. The statement pointed out that the fourth group would spread rumors and leak fabricated information through various media channels to mislead public opinion and create a state of frustration among the sons of the Iraqi people in and out of Iraq.
