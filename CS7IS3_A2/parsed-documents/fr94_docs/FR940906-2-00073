FR940906-2-00073 FR940906-2-00062 Although the undercover detective was not seeking treatment, Respondent asked him if he had any problems. When the detective answered that he liked methamphetamine but that his drug problem was not as bad as his girlfriend's addiction, Respondent wrote the detective a prescription for 60 dosage units of Restoril. The detective returned to Respondent's office less than a month later and again stated that he was abusing methamphetamine. Respondent issued him another prescription for 60 dosage units of Restoril and then asked the detective if he shared the drugs with his girlfriend. When the detective responded in the affirmative Respondent increased the Restoril prescription to 80 dosage units. In addition, Respondent dispensed 30 dosage units of Fastin, a Schedule IV controlled substance used for diet control, to the detective. Respondent explained that he wanted the detective to stop taking methamphetamine and instead use ``legal'' drugs. Several of Respondent's patients were arrested in 1989. One was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs. The day before her arrest, Respondent had issued her a prescription for 100 dosage units of Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance, a prescription for 100 dosage units of Darvocet, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and a prescription for 60 dosage units of Restoril. At the time of the arrest only 50 dosage units of Valium and 73 dosage units of Darvocet remained in the vials. Following the arrest, it was determined that the individual was a drug addict whom Respondent was treating. One of Respondent's employees stated that many of Respondent's patients were drug addicts. This statement was confirmed when many of Respondent's patient files were seized during a state criminal search warrant executed at Respondent's office on October 17, 1989. The files revealed that 150 patients who were addicts were being treated with controlled substances; another 16 patients who were addicts were no longer being treated by Respondent. Many of these patients continually received controlled substances for a number of years. For example, one patient received 4,005 dosage units of Tylenol with codeine # 4, 2,330 dosage units of Valium 10 mg., and 900 dosage units of phenobarbital, a Schedule IV controlled substance, between January 22, 1987, and October 12, 1989. Respondent was interviewed about his treatment of drug addicts during the execution of the October 1989 search warrant. Respondent stated that patients were required to pay cash and that he determined that certain individuals were drug addicts based upon physical indications and discussions with his nurse, a former drug addict. He admitted, however, that he did not perform blood or urine tests because they were too expensive and did not keep any recovery logs for these patients, to memorialize the quantity and length of time that drugs are prescribed and what recovery programs the addict attends. Respondent also disclosed that after he learned that some of his drug addict patients were selling the drugs he prescribed, he raised his treatment prices, so that his patients would have less financial incentive to sell their drugs. Two physician expert reports found that Respondent was not acting in the course of professional medical practice by prescribing the dosages of controlled substances that he did, especially when he was aware that the patients were drug addicts. The BNE investigation also focused on Respondent's prescribing and dispensing of anabolic steroids. In June 1987, an investigator from the then-California Board of Medical Quality Assurance (now MBC) had a discussion with Respondent about allegations that Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids to high school students. Respondent denied such allegations and maintained that he lectured high school students on the health hazards of using such substances. On April 3, 1989, a BNE investigator also discussed the use of anabolic steroids with Respondent. When Respondent opined that such substances could be dispensed to enhance a person's physical appearance under close medical supervision, the investigator informed him of the California statute that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances which became effective in 1986. Respondent also stated that he was discontinuing the dispensing and prescribing of anabolic steroids because he had heard rumors that the police were planning to make an undercover purchase of these substances from him.
