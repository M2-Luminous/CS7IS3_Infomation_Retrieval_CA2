In today's interview with TASS after a meeting with Miles dick, first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Vorobyev said "the Ministry for Emergencies is ready to send its representatives to the Balkans and to get down to work already tomorrow". A group of Russian representatives is expected to consist of about 50 emergency and customs officials, TASS learned from well- informed sources. However, before humanitarian supplies can be delivered to Tuzla, it is necessary to make necessary arrangements at the airport, including repair of the runway. At the moment, the airport is not ready for accepting planes. With this in view, two ministry officials have left for Belgrade and Zagreb to do firsthand assessment of the situation and to agree with the U.N. mission a date when the proposed operation could be launched, as well as the scope of resources required for it. It is quite possible that a Russian plane loaded with international humanitarian supplies will be one of the first to land at the Tuzla Airport. Some 23 tons of babyfood have been already prepared for shipping to the Balkans. The U.S. diplomat described the opening of the Tuzla Airport as one of the most pressing tasks, since this is to provide those affected by the armed conflict with humanitarian aid. The embassy secretary highly praised the activities of the Russian Emergencies Ministry's units in former Yugoslavia. "They really know their job", he noted. At present, two transport units numbering 90 officials of the Russian Ministry for Emergencies are operating in former Yugoslavia, who ensure the delivery of U.N. humanitarian supplies from Belgrade to regions of bosnia-Herzegovina.
