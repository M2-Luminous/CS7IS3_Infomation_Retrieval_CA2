The questions "Status of the Provision of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan With Equipment and Arms and Their Supply With Material and Technical Resources" and "Concepts of the Formation and Execution of Long-Term Defense Programs and the Development of the Defense Complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan" were considered. Reports were presented by General of the Army Sagadat Nurmagambetov, minister of defense, and Mars Urkumbayev, minister of economics. Considering the difficult economic situation that has taken shape in the country, it was observed at the session, the Ministry of Defense and the corresponding departments are doing much to provide the troops with everything necessary and are using the allocated funds in extremely economical fashion. The arms and the pool of combat equipment of the units and combined units are being replenished mainly from the Russian Federation and Ukraine, in accordance with a number of agreements signed at chief of state level. But in practice the solution of these questions is attended by great difficulties. And it is necessary for overcoming them, a number of speakers believe, to exclude the services of middlemen, who are concerned primarily for their own profits, and to create an interstate conciliation commission for reciprocal military supplies within the framework of the CIS. There was a detailed analysis also of the degree of provision of all branches and arms of the service with equipment and arms, fuel and lubricants, clothing and related gear, and food. Together with the positive aspects, there are many problems here also. Specifically, a particular quantity of the equipment of the radiotechnical troops, whose service life will expire in the very near future, of certain units of the air defense of major cities and industrial facilities is in need of replacement. There needs to be an improvement in the provision of the aviation units with fuel for the pilots to be afforded an opportunity to complete the prescribed minimum number of flight hours logged to maintain and [word illegible] their professional expertise. Of the armies of the Commonwealth countries, the men of Kazakhstan are the best supplied with food. But this is far from being the case when it comes to clothing and related gear. This applies particularly to the officer corps. In order to rectify matters, it is necessary, it was said at the session, to change the production structure or create in the republic our own enterprises for sewing military uniforms and making load-carrying harnesses and field gear. And when it comes to providing the troops with everything necessary, it is important to exercise stricter supervision of the fulfillment of the government defense order. As the minister of defense reported, despite the objective difficulties, the Armed Forces are capable as of this time of tackling the assignments pertaining to assurance of the security of our state. Mars Urkumayev considers it necessary to cooperate more actively in the solution of defense questions with countries of the CIS and the far abroad, to alter the production structure of our own industry for military needs, and to assure the precise work of the operating defense enterprises manufacturing the product necessary for the normal activity of the republic's army. The exchange of opinions was summed up by Nursultan Nazarbayev. We must clearly make up our minds as to what kind of army and in what numbers we need, he said. We need to solve immediately all questions connected with supplies to the Armed Forces and to reduce as much as possible imports of military products from outside and, as far as possible, make them ourselves. The head of state set the task of the creation within a week of a military industry commission. Its chairman will be directly responsible for the state of affairs in this important sector providing for the sure defense capability of our sovereign state. In its decision the Security Council approved the concept of the formation and execution of long-term defense programs and the development of the defense complex. It also confirmed certain changes in its composition. Specifically, Bulat Bayekenov was appointed secretary of the council. Abish Kekilbayev, chairman of the Supreme Council, First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, deputy prime ministers Galym Abilsiitov and Asygat Zhabagin, leaders of a number of ministries and departments, and senior officials of the staff of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers took part in the session.
