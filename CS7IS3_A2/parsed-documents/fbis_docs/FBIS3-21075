The university has already invested $60 million in plant and equipment. This month it begins the second semester since its founding, and it is hiring 22 Russian researchers to staff five high-tech laboratories in the fields of biotechnology, new materials, and molecular biology -- facilities at which projects will be carried out that are directly related to the socioeconomic realities of the northern Fluminense region, where agriculture and oil prospecting predominate. "In 1992, right after we announced the intention to bring in Russian scientists, we received more than 300 resumes from Russia. We had to send four academic delegations to that country last year to make the selections," said Wanderley de Souza, the molecular biologist who is rector of UENF. He recalled that, with budget appropriations continuing to shrink, "working conditions for Russian scientists in most technological fields are very bad, maybe worse than in Brazil." Boris and Irina, like other married foreign scientists who decided to move to Campos, will be given airline tickets for the entire family, in addition to a subsidy equivalent to two salaries so that they can settle in the city. This benefit is also extended to the unmarried. The contracts are for a minimum of two years. "Institutions in the United States have offered the Russians salaries averaging $5,000, but many opted for Rio de Janeiro, not just out of concern that they might experience discrimination by the Americans, but because of good medium and long-term market prospects for their technologies in Brazil," de Souza said. Along with scientist Alexander Kineo, also contracted by the university, the couple will bring to Brazil advanced techniques for production of reagents to be used in faster and more efficient diagnosis of illnesses like toxoplasmosis, a disease transmitted by a protozoan that attacks the central nervous system and the eyes. The new diagnostic method (at present, this country imports the tests) will be developed by fusing cells that produce antibodies (the body's defense agents) with cells from tumors that have the ability to reproduce themselves on a large scale. This will produce a hybridoma, i.e., a cell that combines the capacity to defend an organism with the ability to multiply itself in large numbers, thereby making commercial production feasible. Transgenics A group of eight Russian scientists, all with doctor's degrees and headed by Oleg Serov and Alexander Kerkis of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, will work on development of transgenic animals, such as goats that have been genetically altered to produce milk containing insulin. Other animals with transplanted genes might be used to obtain blood clotting factors that are vital to hemophiliacs. The chief product of the new materials laboratory will be the technology for producing artificial diamonds by compression of carbon molecules. These diamonds are essential to equipment such as dentists' drills, marble-cutting tools, and oil-drilling bits--the latter being one of the region's main economic activities. The technology of the synthetic materials known as "superhards," developed by a group of five Russian scientists that will work at UENF for two years, reflects the technological strategy being pursued by this institution: absorb the know-how at an advanced point in its development without spending many years on research, so that the technology can be transferred to industry in the midterm future. "The technologies will be intimately related to the vocations of this region," said Gilca Alves Wianstein, president of the State Foundation of Northern Rio de Janeiro, the institution responsible for administration of UENF, which has the flexibility and independence needed to set up commercial and technological partnerships with the production sector. In the vicinity of its 25,000 square meter campus--which during the first semester of this academic year will house 278 undergraduate and graduate students and 50 researchers--the UENF plans to encourage the formation of a high-tech complex sustained mainly by biofactories that produce cuttings for use in growing fruit and sugarcane, and in reforestation.
