Much was known about the imminent arrival; however, much also remained to be explained...The main thing was that the city was ready for this menacing danger. All of the flight crew and stewardesses of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration had been warned. At the slightest suspicion (and they had the symptoms listed in a special administration directive), each was obliged to quickly report to ``the authorities.'' On this Karachi-Almata flight, several stewardesses immediately noticed that something was wrong. More than 50 passengers ``besieged'' the restroom... Almata's best communicable disease specialists gathered at the airport. All the necessary analyses were performed there. The passengers (mainly ``shuttle'' passengers dragging trunks with imported pieces around the entire world) were agitated by the delay but agreed to be examined. They rejected the suggestion of a dangerous disease with dignity. In one voice they stated that they had eaten tainted chicken. This ``unfortunate bird of yesterday'' turned out to be fatal for 15 persons. Analyses revealed that cholera was indeed in the city. Addresses and phone numbers were taken from all of them. But their thirst for profit turned out to be stronger than their fear for their relatives and close friends and, ultimately, for their own lives. Many addresses turned out to be made up. The flight's passengers were sought through the Department of Visas and Registration of Foreign Citizens [OVIR], the passport desk, and their relatives and acquaintances. And only after 3 days were the ``ones who had broken away'' quarantined. All of the passengers were hospitalized except for one. The Pavlodarsk militia is on his trail. The rest are accepting treatment. Just like their ``contacts'' -- their acquaintances and relatives -- they have been placed in a special isolation unit. And a hospital with the necessary subdepartments has been set up for the patients in Almata. An emergency government commission meets twice daily to clarify the scale of the problem and take measures to keep the infection from spreading. The problem is that among the passengers were many residents of neighboring oblasts. One was detained in Ufa and another in Omsk. At first, the physicians tried to act independently. But when the ``businessmen'' began refusing hospitalization, they were forced to seek the militia's assistance. And one patient was ``caught'' three times. The hospital is now carefully guarded. At the time, Kazakhstan's government declared a state of emergency in the republic's capital. It lasted another 10 days after the last patient was discovered. The city was surrounded by militia posts, cordons, and barricades. It did not end without deaths. There were cases where tomatoes that summer residents had brought from their own garden plots were shaken out of trunks. The Central Market was closed for 2 days. Street trade was banned, and questionable soft drinks were dumped. To a certain degree, the cholera did not develop by accident. It developed primarily because Kazakhstan, having declared its sovereignty, slammed its doors and windows to the world at large and did not care about what was beyond its threshold -- not just electronics and pantyhose but also an ``easily accessible'' infection. When setting up economic and cultural ties, the authorities simply forgot about their main obligation -- to protect their people's health. There are heaps of rubbish two steps from the presidential palace. What is most, if you please, deplorable is that the legal aspects of the problem have been left absolutely not worked out. I asked A. Kurmangaliyeva, deputy chief public health physician of the Republic of Kazakhstan, whether the government intends to lodge a claim against Pakistan. It turns out that this question was not even considered.
