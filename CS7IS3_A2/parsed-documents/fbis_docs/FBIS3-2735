The introduction of the new tax system applying to foreign enterprises has caused various repercussions at home and abroad. What does this tax reform actually mean to foreign enterprises? This we need to analyze, meticulously and thoroughly. Since 1979, China has applied different tax systems to foreign enterprises and Chinese enterprises. The reason for this practice was that preferential treatment was offered to foreign business firms purely to stabilize their tax system, given the higher tax rate in China after the reform and opening up and the fact that a tax reform was in progress. In this connection, the combined industrial and commercial tax which was first introduced in 1958 on a trial basis has been applied to foreign enterprises. As for Chinese enterprises, the value-added tax, product tax, and business tax have been applied to them since 1984. As a result, Chinese enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises in China have been bearing different tax burdens for many years past and increasing amounts of tax have been duplicated through different channels. This was unfavorable to export trade for foreign enterprises and had an adverse effect on economic development, therefore, a tax reform became a must. The new tax system, molded in accordance with international common practice, is to introduce a regulated circulating tax system with value-added tax as the core and the consumption tax and business tax as auxiliaries. This new system has embodied the principle of fairness in terms of the tax burden, and that of competition on an equal footing, and has maintained the continuity, rationality, and stability with regard to the tax system concerning foreign interests. Specifically speaking, after the tax reform, taxes concerning foreign interests will be divided into 12 categories, namely: Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, resource tax, tax on value added to land, stamp duty, slaughter tax, urban landed properties tax, levy on vehicle and ship licenses, enterprise income tax, personal income tax, and contract tax. Of these taxes, only the tax on value added to land is new. The circulating taxes, consisting of the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax which can be traced to the field of production and commodity circulation, are a major tax category accounting for a large proportion of tax revenue. A special feature of the value-added tax under the new tax system is to prevent duplicated tax and to make sure that the sum total of tax income from all channels equals the total amount of all taxes levied on commodities. The basic rate of the value-added tax is 17 percent and a unified 13-percent low rate has been set for all the taxes on daily necessities, products for agricultural use, and cultural goods, in contrast to the 14.5 percent rate for the former combined industrial and commercial tax. The main purpose of the consumption tax is to adjust the consumption structure and to guide the public's consumption pattern, with high tax rates applying only to tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, and jewelry. The business tax rate generally ranges from 3 to 5 percent, except for certain show business items, let alone the fact that the former combined industrial and commercial tax actually contained a part which represented business tax. Findings from a survey conducted among thousands of foreign enterprises in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, and Wuhan indicate that, after the new tax system was introduced, the tax burden decreased or remained the same in most foreign enterprises, with a small number of foreign enterprises' tax burden increasing slightly and the general level of tax contribution by foreign enterprises throughout the country remained unchanged. Thus, the state's financial revenue is ensured without increasing the burden on enterprises. Some people have queried whether the tax reform will give rise to a new imbalance since the new regulations only apply to foreign enterprises founded after 1 January 1994, while the old regulations will continue to apply to those which had already been founded on or before 31 December 1993. To be honest, we must say that this is an objective fact. However, we should approach this issue from a comprehensive viewpoint. Any tax reform must have a definite effective date and must not be made indefinitely retroactive. Otherwise such a reform can hardly be carried out. Also, we apply the old regulations to old enterprises just because they were established in light of the results of past feasibility studies and investment return estimations based on the old tax system. If the new tax system was applied indiscriminately to both old and new enterprises, it would unfavorably affect old enterprises. Therefore it is necessary to give some preferential treatment to the latter within a certain grace period. In order to retain continuity of tax related to foreign interests, the spirit of a unified tax system but no less preferential treatment has been pursued in the tax reform. The regulations governing exports remain unchanged in principle. No circulating tax will be levied on exports by foreign enterprises except for a few products where state regulations provide for it. Goods imported by foreign enterprises within the quota corresponding to the scale of their investment projects will be subject to tax exemption, including machinery, equipment, and component parts which enterprises need for daily operation, as well as raw and processed materials which are needed for manufacturing products to be exported. Goods which are imported with special permission are subject to tax reduction or exemption. No circulating tax is to be levied on goods imported by foreign-funded enterprises operating in special economic zones [SEZ] and on products manufactured and marketed in SEZ's, except for such items as mineral oils, tobacco, and alcohol, on which the circulating tax is levied at a 50-percent discount. The preferential policy regarding the circulating tax remains unchanged for bonded zones. Financial institutions operated with foreign capital, or jointly run with Chinese and foreign capital, set up in SEZ's and the Pudong new zone with approval, will be exempt from circulating tax for five years from their day of inauguration. As for those foreign enterprises which have yet to be established for which approval was already obtained before 31 December 1993, since they will have to pay all the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax under the new tax system--which implies that they will have to pay more--the extra tax amount thereby incurred by them will be returned, within a period of not more than 5 years, with the approval of the tax authorities. Therefore, the new tax system will not affect foreign enterprises significantly. By and large, the current tax reform is an integrated structural reform of overall significance. Domestically speaking, the reform is for the purpose of unifying the tax system, making the tax distribution fairer, improving the investment environment in the country, and suiting the needs of the establishment and development of the socialist market economy. Internationally speaking, it will enable China to meet the requirements of international common practice. Nowadays, almost none of the countries in the world are simultaneously applying two different tax systems to domestic tax payers and to foreign ones respectively. Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the GATT has specially provided for domestic taxes and equal treatment to citizens and aliens alike under domestic regulations. This article not only demands that the tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises be equal to that on domestic enterprises but also that restrictions on the operation of foreign-funded enterprises be relaxed so that they enjoy rights equal to domestic enterprises. Thus, whether viewed from internal or external concerns, unification of the tax system is necessary for the development of foreign-funded enterprises.
