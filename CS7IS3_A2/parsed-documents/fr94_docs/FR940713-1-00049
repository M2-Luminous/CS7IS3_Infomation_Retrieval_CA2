FR940713-1-00049 FR940713-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 94&hyph;57; Notice 01] RIN 2127&hyph;AF33 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to amend Standard No. 210 to require the installation of anchorages for either a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly at any seating position for which Standard No. 208 requires the installation of a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt. Anchorages required by Standard No. 210 must meet the strength, location and other performance requirements of that standard. Currently, S4.1.2 of Standard No. 210 requires the installation of an anchorage for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly for all designated seating positions, except positions already required by section 4.1.1 of Standard No. 210 to have an anchorage for a Type 2 seat belt assembly and except passenger seats in buses. The practical effect of Standard No. 210's not requiring anchorages for the bus passenger seats is that the anchorages for the Type 1 seat belt assemblies required at passenger seats in small buses are not currently required to comply with the performance requirements of that Standard. This notice will correct this oversight. DATES: Comment date: Comments must be received by September 12, 1994. Proposed effective date: If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. (Docket Room hours are 9:30 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m., Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Clarke Harper, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NRM&hyph;12, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4916. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 2, 1989, NHTSA published a final rule amending Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection, to require the installation of Type 2 (lap/shoulder) seat belts at all forward-facing rear outboard seating positions in all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less, other than school buses (54 FR 46257). The final rule also required Type 2 seat belts at all front outboard seating positions in small buses and Type 1 (lap) seat belts at all other seating positions in small buses. In the preamble to the final rule, effective September 1, 1991, the agency stated that it did not need to amend Standard No. 210, Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages, to require the installation of anchorages for Type 2 seat belt assemblies at the affected seating positions because S4.1.1 already required the installation of anchorages for a Type 2 seat belt assembly whenever Standard No. 208 required the installation of a Type 2 seat belt. In making this statement, the agency overlooked the exceptions in S4.1.2 of Standard No. 210. That section requires the installation of anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly for all designated seating positions, except positions required to have an anchorage for a Type 2 seat belt assembly and except for passenger seats in buses. Thus, the anchorages for the Type 1 seat belt assemblies required at passenger seats in small buses by the November 2, 1989 final rule are not currently required to comply with Standard No. 210. To correct this oversight, this notice proposes to amend Standard No. 210 to require the installation of anchorages for either a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly at any seating position for which Standard No. 208 requires the installation of a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt. Since NHTSA believes that the anchorages currently being installed by the manufacturers comply with the requirements of Standard No. 210, NHTSA is proposing that if this proposal is adopted as a final rule, it would become effective 30 days after publication.
