SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Part I_General Information A. Program Purpose Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmental services primarily to low-income preschool children and their families. To help enrolled children achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide comprehensive health, nutritional, educational, social, and other services. In addition Head Start programs are required to provide for the direct participation of the parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct, and direction of local programs. Head Start currently serves approximately 713,000 children through a network of approximately 1,395 grantees. While Head Start is targeted primarily toward children whose families have incomes at or below the poverty line or who are eligible for public assistance, regulations permit up to 10 percent of the Head Start children in local programs to be from families which do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start regulations also require that a minimum of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each program be made available to children with disabilities. Such children are expected to be enrolled in the full range of Head Start services and activities in a mainstream setting with their non-disabled peers, and to receive needed special education and related services. B. Background on Demonstration Project ``A Head Start on Science'' The report from the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion emphasizes that quality services to Head Start families must be given priority attention by all Head Start programs. The report underscored the need for staff development and training and supports initiatives designed to increase staff understanding of concepts and principles which will help them become more effective in early childhood settings. This project is designed to link colleges and universities to Head Start programs for the purpose of teaching science to Head Start staff. Highly intensive, hands-on instruction will provide teachers, assistants, and home visitors with exposure to the principles of science and increase their insights and skills regarding how to take their college campus experience and create classroom environments which invite child exploration and discovery. The staff will also increase their understanding of the natural learning environment presented by the out-of-doors, and the child's own home. We expect that ``A Head Start on Science'' model will be developed and documented in suitable printed and visual materials to be used to transmit the concept and approaches to other institutions of higher learning and Head Start communities. Project funds may also be used to present and distribute information at appropriate regional and national Head Start events, and to members of the Head Start training and technical assistance network. Also, it would be appropriate for the grantee to develop strategies and products which will assist other local Head Start programs to negotiate with their local college or university for similar staff training. We believe that as a result of participating in ``A Head Start on Science'' demonstration project, Head Start teachers, teacher assistants, and home visitors will be instrumental in creating a lifelong interest in science both for themselves and for the children and families with whom they work. We believe that staff will be impacted by the knowledge that science is found not only in a laboratory under a microscope, but in the everyday world in which they live. As a result of this experience, teachers, assistants and home visitors' concepts of science and their own scientific abilities will increase and in turn have a powerful effect on their ability to engage in discovery and establish environments in which children and families may explore, discover and interpret scientific activities. This announcement is soliciting applications from four-year colleges or universities, i.e., institutions of higher learning that grant degrees. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although projects periods may be for two years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period but within the two year project period will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government. The Department of Health and Human Services will award one grant under this announcement. Up to $550,000 will be available for a 24 month project period. In the first year of the grant, the grantee institution will use these funds to create, demonstrate and evaluate a summer institute prototype on their campus during the summer of 1995 with follow-up assistance to Head Start staff graduates as they implement their new skills at their local programs. Also in year one the grantee will recruit another college or university in which to replicate the model in year two.
