The satellite monitoring system can forecast the possibility of disastrous snowstorms and estimate the damage that can result, through remote sensing techniques, over a vast pastoral area from western China's Tibet-Qinghai Plateau to the Greater Hinggan Mountains in northeast China. Snow disasters cause heavy losses to livestock in northern China every year, sometimes as much as five percent of the total. Scientists from the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology in northwest China's Gansu Province prepared the data for the satellite monitoring covering an area of about 590,000 sq [square] km.
