This was announced by Zhang Xiaoqiang, deputy director of the foreign funds department under the State Planning Commission (SPC), in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today. Zhang said that so far contracts have been worked out or signed to import technology, equipment and key materials for 47 projects. And 20 more projects are in the process of bidding or business negotiations. China announced the huge import package for the last seven years of the 1990s in June 1993, with a total fund expected to reach 30 billion U.S. dollars. The package covers 23 sectors and trades including agriculture, energy, transport, telecommunications, machinery, electronics, chemicals, metallurgy, light industry and textiles. A majority of the 210 major technology projects are in infrastructures and basic industries, areas that the Chinese Government has decided to give priority in their development. According to Zhang, on the import bills will be complete sets of equipment, key facilities, accessory meters and instruments, as well as state-of-the art technologies. Financial sources for the purchases include state foreign exchange reserves, fund-raising by departments and local governments concerned, international commercial loans and loans provided by foreign governments or international lending institutions. The SPC official said all these projects have been approved by the government and have been listed in the state plan. The 47 contracts that have been concluded include a 120-million-U.S. dollar order of manufacturing equipment from the Japanese Sanyo Company for the "Nylon 66 Salt Project" in Henan Province, central China, and a 17-million-dollar order to import key equipment from the United States for a forestry project in north China's Hebei province. Also included is an agreement between China and the Siemens Company of Germany on importing locomotives and equipment worth 400 million U.S. dollars for the Guangzhou Subway Project. The publicity of major technology importing projects has aroused wide interest among foreign businessmen, who said that the move helped them know better about China's foreign trade policy and offered authoritative and practical information on trading with China, especially on major technology purchases. The move will also facilitate China's technical renovation and infrastructural building, said Zhang. According to a 10-year development blueprint for the period from 1991 to 2000, China's gross domestic product (GDP) will maintain an eight to nine percent annual growth rate in the years. To this end, Chinese leaders said the country should more effectively cash in on the international market, capital, technology and resources to keep the growth rate of foreign trade higher than that of GDP. The government has decided to rationally readjust the import structure so that more will be spent on introducing advanced technology and key equipment for basic industries and infrastructures. Zhang said that China's domestic market is huge. Imports have kept expanding and legal guarantee is being improved. The Chinese Government is ready to create a more favorable environment for foreign businessmen and continue to give details about technology import projects, he said.
