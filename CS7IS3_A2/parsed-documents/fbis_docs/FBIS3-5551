"It feels like winter's final spite," the North's chief negotiator Pak Yong-su said in lieu of welcoming his South Korean counterpart Song Yong-tae. "It was warm until yesterday, but the mercury plunged to below zero Celsius this morning," Pak noted. "We have had rain in Seoul and the central region since Monday. I believe spring flowers will start blooming sooner or later," Song retorted in an equally breezy greeting. "Willow buds are the first to announce spring...wild garlic and Shepherd's Purse (spring plants Koreans commonly eat as a vegetable dish or in soup) are already out and I had them for breakfast," was Pak's next addition to the small talk. "I hope to see the special envoys come and go during this beautiful spring," said Song, finally getting down to the nitty- gritty. -- The two representatives were able to agree in principle on at least one thing -- stepping up inter-Korean economic cooperation. Processing-on-commision trade between South and North Korea in the past two months reached 2.8 million U.S. dollars, already 60 percent of last year's performance, Song said, implicitly proposing direct exchanges so as to boost two-way trade. "Well, 2.8 million dollars in two months is less than expected," Pak said, suggesting that the communist regime has been busy putting its trade-first policy into action. "If South and North Korea run together toward the world, it won't be just one plus one becoming two, but our forces multiplying 10- and 20-fold," Song predicted. -- Pak was, as always, witty, asking Song if he had cooked for his wife the previous day. "March 8 is international married women's day and I make it a habit of cooking for my wife that day," Pak said. "How nice, and I thought you were a hen-pecked husband...," Song jested. As for himself, he said that he entertains his wife by taking her on trips or for a drive every now and then. -- North Korea made a keynote statement first as the meeting took place on the Northern side of Panmunjom. Before getting to the closed-door session, Song commented on news reports after their previous contact last Friday. He said he was personally embarrassed by press reports calling the last meeting "much ado about nothing," adding that he had hoped to see articles picturing this contact as having blossomed like a flower. "Let's be patient. Good results will come out in the end," Pak responded. -- The two negotiators again tossed back and forth thorny and playful barbs. Pak started by saying he read in a South Korean newsweekly that Song practices a mock meeting before inter-Korean dialogue. "I wonder who played my role. I hope to be friends with `him'," he said. "I also read in one newspaper where you said you knew what I'm thinking just by looking at my eyes. Well, tell me what my eyes say today," he ventured. The two then picked up on their joke about the envelope and briefcase that Pak first mentioned at last week's meeting. "I see you haven't brought your big briefcase this time. I guess you don't have too much to offer this time," the chief North Korean negotiator observed. "Well, instead of a briefcase, I brought with me a big bundle," Song countered, pointing to a white envelope brought by Pak and bantering, "You won't feel very comfortable carrying an empty envelope around." "Since you came here (Northern side of the truce village), we will have to give you something big this time... Let's do well," Pak said expansively.
