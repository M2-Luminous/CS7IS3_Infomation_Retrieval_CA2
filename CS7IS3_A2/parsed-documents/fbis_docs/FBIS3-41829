Thirty Albanian patients infected by typhus were sent to the infective clinic of Pristina. The physicians warned there are other patients infected by typhus, but this number is not yet made evident. As a result of this serious epidemiological situation in Kosova, there are several patients infected by hepatitis and rubella who are being treated at home because of there is no room in the Pristina clinics. Physicians think that the virus of salmonella must have been in the water. Before the boom of the epidemic in Shtimje, in which typhus cases have been in a greater number than in other zones of Kosova, the violent Serbian organs forced the only Albanian epidemiologist to live his job under the pretext that "there was no need for him". The violent Serbian organs in Kosova have expelled some 2000 Albanian physicians and other medical workers from the medical institutions of the region. Five hundred Albanian medical workers have been warned to leave their jobs recently in Mitrovica and in the communes near the president of Kosova Republic, Mr. Ibrahim Rugova, appealed in his recent press conference to international medical institutions to give aid to Kosova in order to face the grave situation there.
