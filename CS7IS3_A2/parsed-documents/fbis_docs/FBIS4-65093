In a statement to the SER radio network, Serra said the report published by EL MUNDO is completely false, adding that the only knowledge he had about the alleged investigation is what he read today in that newspaper. Serra, however, did not rule out the possibility that such an inquiry could have existed as implied in the newspaper, but he denied ordering the investigation, reiterating: "I did not order that or any other inquiry." According to EL MUNDO, Serra asked Roldan to investigate Mario Conde's financial and personal activities in view of the banker's alleged intentions of participating in politics, citing Roldan himself, who is currently at large. With regard to his possible appearance before the parliamentary commission probing Roldan's actions -- which four parliamentary groups viewed as unnecessary last week -- Serra said he is willing to appear if summoned. Today, representatives from the Popular Party (PP, conservative), United Left (IU, pro-Communist), and the Mixed Group reiterated their request for Deputy Prime Minister Serra to appear before the commission to explain his relation with Conde's actions. They added that this is more necessary now in view of the report published by EL MUNDO. In his statement to the radio, Serra stressed he is "the most interested in showing" that reports that he requested an investigation on Mario Conde "are false." Serra noted that he would like Roldan to "make an appearance to say what he has to say. In this way, others would have the opportunity to completely refute all charges." Roldan, who is under investigation for serious corruption charges, escaped early this month and, in an interview published by EL MUNDO, threatened to reveal political maneuvers and secrets about corruption in Spain if he does not receive favorable treatment from the government. Conde was Banesto president until December 1993, when the Bank of Spain intervened in the institution because of its grave financial situation. He was removed from his post. Subsequently, Banesto's financial situation improved, and the Bank of Santander purchased most of its capital.
