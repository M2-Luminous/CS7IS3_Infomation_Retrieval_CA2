[video shows medium close-ups of Deng Xiaoping, escorted by his two daughters, Deng Nan and Deng Rong, stepping into a room and being introduced to Shanghai CPC Secretary Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, and other Shanghai officials. Deng Xiaoping looks frail and motionless. There is very little head movement (either laterally or horizontally) or upper body movement. When people talk to him, Deng continues to look straight ahead, and people have to either lean in close to him or one of his daughters apparently repeats what is said while leaning close to his ear; sometimes a daughter speaks to the other person immediately after Deng speaks, apparently repeating Deng's response.] This is the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping joined the Shanghai people in marking the Spring Festival since 1988. The hall was decorated with flowers and imbued with the air of spring. In high spirit and in firm strides, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with a smile, walked toward to the comrades in Shanghai and shook their hands cordially one by one. [video continues to show medium close-ups of Deng Xiaoping shaking hands with well-wishers] Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped forward to express their sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping. Comrade Wu Bangguo said: On behalf of the 13 million people in Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival. I wish you health and long life; and I wish your whole family happiness. [video shows Wu Bangguo talking to Deng, Deng speaking and his daughter, her head very close to Deng's left ear, apparently repeating Wu's words] Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I wish leading comrades of the central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a happy Spring Festival and good health. I wish people in the country a happy Spring Festival, happy family life, unity, and greater victories in the new year. [video shows scenes of Deng walking into a room and being greeted by Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju; Deng takes very small steps, his daughters have a hand on his back and at each elbow, and he looks straight ahead with little or no head or upper body movement] Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I come to Shanghai once a year to wish people in Shanghai happy Spring Festival. Comrade Wu Bangguo said: This is your encouragement for people in Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the work in Shanghai. Comrade Deng Xiaoping happily said: You people in Shanghai have done a really good job in accomplishing your work. [video shows Deng Xiaoping and his wife, Zhuo Lin, having a group picture with 18 officials in Shanghai; Deng looks ahead with little or no body movement] In Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great concern for Shanghai's material and spiritual construction. He fully endorsed the successes the people in Shanghai have accomplished over the past year. He said: Shanghai has accomplished its work very well. Shanghai has special qualities and characters. Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster.

Deng is framed by his two daughters, walking with very small steps, with little or no head and upper body movement] On 13 December, Shanghai was engulfed by grade six chilly winds and drizzle. The mercury dropped to about zero degree Celcius. On the afternoon of that day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in the company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, inspected Pudong. Despite the winds and the rain, he ascended Yangpu Bridge to take a view of the teeming construction projects in Pudong. After inspecting the two overpasses -- the Pudong Section and the Loshan Road Longyang Road sections of the inner-ring lines -- which were completed last year, Comrade Xiaoping [words indistinct] and said with a smile: Watching these overpasses today is better than reading books for 100 years. He told Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: These words are from the bottom of my heart.

Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping, holding the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the Yangpu bridge construction, and praised him, saying: This is a victory of the working class in Shanghai. My salute to them. On the eve of New Year's Day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in the company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, ascended to the top floor of the New Jinjiang Hotel to look at the brightly illuminated Shanghai. He said emotionally: Shanghai has changed. [video shows a large van driving in crowded and brightly illuminated streets, cutting to show close-ups of Deng shaking hands with hotel officials and waving momentarily with small hand motions to people in the foyer] When the Chinese and foreign tourists marking the New Year Day saw Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, they could not help giving him a long applause and expressing their respects and regards to him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to the tourists in acknowledgement. Tonight, he also visited the congested Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the Spring Festival with them. Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very happy when he realized that the Dayawan Nuclear Station No. 1 generating unit was successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade Li Peng to convey his congratulations and his thanks to the builders, scientists, and technicians of the nuclear station.
