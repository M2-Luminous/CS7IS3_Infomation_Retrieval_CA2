Unnamed officials of the state-owned Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) were quoted in Sunday's [20 March] edition of the independent SUNDAY GAZETTE as saying about 200 government telephone lines had been disconnected in the last two months. Last week alone 80 lines were cut, including Mugabe's hot lines. The latter were quickly reconnected "after a directive from government", the newspaper added. Other victims last week were 23 lines from the Immigration Department which owes R45,000 [rand], 36 from the Zimbabwe Institute of Public Administration and Management for non-payment of its R35,000 bill while the Ministry of Mines' was completely cut off for an outstanding bill of R68,000. The switchboard at Jongwe Printers, the printing company owned by the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party, went dead after a cheque meant to pay for its bill of R5,500 was bounced by the bank. In January the Foreign Ministry lost its 70 lines, including direct lines, fax and telex services used by Mugabe's office when its bill went unpaid. Sources said that the PTC was one client among hundreds of creditors that is owed money by the government. Under World Bank economic austerity programmes, the Ministry of Finance has issued ironclad instructions that it will not bail out government departments that overspend their budgets, with the result that millions of dollars of bills go unpaid.
