He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax on Thursday that "Kozyrev had no right to sign this program since the Duma spoke unequivocally against it." Kozyrev signed the paper at NATO's Headquarters in Brussels, thereby making Russia a party to the NATO initiative. Zhirinovskiy threatened to abrogate the treaty since it was not legally binding. The signature of one person "when parliament spoke against is meaningless", he maintained. He also argued that "no state will take the document seriously since the legislature objects to it." Without agreement with it, any signing is absurd, Zhirinovskiy declared. He also announced that the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] faction has a nominee to the foreign minister's office.
