Top officials of the State Council gave it their vigorous support. In eight years, the organization has succeeded and has snowballed into China's Huaneng Group, whose central activities include the basic industries of electric power production and coal. After eight years, Minister of Electric Power Shi Dazhen says that the entire electric power industry should follow the Huaneng Group's lead. The Huaneng Phenomenon: A High Starting Point, High Speed, High Standards, and High Benefits, Exemplifying the Best, the Most Successful, and the Most Valuable The first stage of Huaneng's Shidongkou No. 2 power plant in Shanghai, with two 600,000-kW supercritical fossil-fired generating units, was imported from the United States and Sweden. Eighteen large Chinese enterprises from various sectors participated in its design, construction, installation and adjustment, and the high degree of automation of generating set operation and control and the overall high technological standards not only make the plant a pace-setter in this country, but put it on a par with the world state of the art. Its high-efficiency operation and low coal consumption continue to be astonishing. This exemplifies the high starting point of Huaneng projects. At Huaneng's Dezhou power plant, two domestically produced 300,000-kW generator sets were connected into the grid and started producing power within a year; its Fuzhou and Dalian power plants, with imported 350,000 kW generator sets, were built and put into operation in only 24 months. In the past, the domestic construction cycle for a power plant of this size was usually about three years. This exemplifies the high speed of Huaneng's construction projects. According to previous state staffing standards, Huaneng's Dalian power plant should have required a staff of about 1,200; but Huaneng followed foreign management models and specified a staff of 488. After the plant was commissioned, this staff was decreased to 443 in 1991, and to 308 in 1992, and is now 280, but safe, high-efficiency operation is maintained throughout the plant, and it is a leader in many performance indicators. This exemplifies Huaneng's high management standards. At Huaneng's Shang'an power plant, the more than 150 persons who engaged in a concurrent construction and modernization effort brought the plant rapidly to full output and posted a high labor productivity figure of 240,000 yuan for all personnel. This exemplifies the high benefits obtained from Huaneng's operations. Every one of Huaneng's power plants has some unusual features. This is the attractiveness of the Huaneng Group. It has posted record after record for power plant construction and management in China. In addition, it has written a brilliant page in its own history. The organization of the group is as follows: it has 11 component corporations and nearly 200 component enterprises. Its total capital has increased from less than 2 billion yuan at registration to a current value of 39.9 billion yuan. The group's installed generating equipment includes a completed or under-construction capacity of more than 17 million kW, with 1.5 to 2 million kW of capacity commissioned each year; this year it will contribute about a fifth of the country's newly commissioned capacity. Over the course of three years, its generating capacity has increased by a factor of 1.9. Its profits were 270 million yuan in 1989, 480 million yuan in 1990, 660 million yuan in 1991, and 1 billion yuan in 1992. With the large and medium-size state-owned power companies limping along, how is it that Huaneng is able to stand head and shoulders above the rest? Huaneng's Advantage: Two Strong Legs from Birth, Use of Investments and Financing Strength To Increase Its Vigor, Rational Electricity Pricing that Moves It Rapidly Toward the Market Economy When head of the North China Power Industry Management Office Jiao Yi'an [3542 0310 1344] discussed the key factor responsible for the difficulties that the large and medium-size state-owned electric power enterprises are experiencing in stimulating their vitality, he frowned: "They lack investment strength, financing strength, and rational prices." This is the common problem of all state-owned electric power enterprises. They all express interest in the Huaneng mechanism. This is because Huaneng has taken a step forward. An official of the group stated: "We benefited from the policy of reform and opening to the outside." There is no question that this policy gave Huaneng vitality and provided it with two strong legs, so that from the beginning it has been able to stride powerfully ahead and advance toward the market-economy path. To start, Huaneng created an operating mechanism which was basically suited to the socialist market economy, and in the course of its development, it has made use of special state loan funds, relevant state policies, and its "four autonomies" (independent operation, independent profit-and-loss operation, self-development, and self-restraint) to strengthen itself continuously, making itself a leader in China's reform of the basic-industry investment system. Huaneng has investment and financing strengths. It combines the motivated character of local power generation, domestic raising of funds, the accumulation of funding from a variety of sources, and collective power generation, and it promotes safe and effective project implementation and enterprise operation. It can attract extensive foreign capital and can be selective on international financial markets. It carries on combined commercial, technical, credit and trade negotiations, thus transacting a great deal of business at a small cost. We recall that in the group's early days, a certain domestic power plant paid US$199 million to import two 350,000-kW generator sets, but Huaneng paid only $183 million, and in addition it bought $30 million worth of spare parts and obtained rather low loan rates. The group charges electricity prices that are basically consistent with the law of value: the state permits it to adjust prices as necessary. Huaneng's main funding sources are state special-project loans, foreign capital, and domestically raised funds, in approximately equal proportions, all obtained on a compensation basis: Huaneng is both the borrower and the repayer, and it is the entity that enjoys the profits or bears the losses. In its domestic construction loans, the interest rate is in line with construction industry standards; its foreign capital is borrowed at international financing interest rates. In addition, the materials used on its construction projects and the materials and fuels that it uses for power production are mostly procured on the market at a negotiated price. Were it not for Huaneng's relatively rational electricity pricing, its enterprises would not be able to survive, to say nothing of carrying on expanded reproduction. The formula is: a loan and interest repayment component, a high-priced materials component, and a fixed, rational profit. Ultimately, the group must maintain a certain expanded reproduction capability to provide it with staying power. If these two strong legs could be grown by all state-owned electric power enterprises, the power industry's growth rate probably would be more than a mere 8%. The Huaneng Mechanism: A Strong Loan Repayment Orientation and Close Ties of Each Individual to His Job as Prerequisites to Overall Vitality Huaneng's overall size is huge: its total worth is 39.9 billion yuan. But only about 10 percent, or slightly over 4 billion yuan, is the amount that actually belongs to the group: more than 35 billion yuan represents debts, both foreign and domestic. Thus Huaneng is operating under debt. It is carrying an immense burden. Although Huaneng's debt repayment capacity is already 3 billion yuan a year, its newly undertaken debt is also equal to 3 billion yuan. Since it needs both to lighten its debt burden and to take on new burdens, Huaneng is developing dialectically and this way is producing both benefits and electric power. Its characteristic feature is that pressure and dynamism stimulate each other and that interests and risks constrain each other. Huaneng established a management model in which investment and operations are integrated. Thus a situation in which "others borrow the money and we have to pay off the debt" can never occur under this model. Huaneng gives the onerous term "repayment" a new interpretation: operation under debt and the market risk mechanism prompt it to give top priority to investment benefits, with forward and backward continuity of borrowing, investment, construction and operations during each step. Fortunately, Huaneng has an independent operations policy: the state approves the projects and puts together the financing package, but Huaneng calls the tune in all other respects; the only requirement is that it produce benefits. Here are two examples. When a coil failed at the Fuzhou power plant, the company immediately contacted the civil aviation department and rented an airplane to bring a replacement coil from Japan. Was it worth the cost? Yes, because one day's stoppage of the power plant meant a loss of 700,000 yuan, and the stoppage of a week that is common practice would have been entirely intolerable. Again, every day's delay in the commissioning of two 350,000-kW generating sets means a loss of US $50,000 together with the payment of 50,000 yuan in interest; thus, in order to shorten the construction time and increase benefits, Huaneng has instituted bonuses for completion of construction ahead of schedule. For some plants, the construction organizations can obtain a bonus of 100,000 yuan for each day that the construction is completed ahead of schedule. Huaneng has an effective and vigorous internal operating mechanism whose unique property is that the group is bound together by property relationships; the central company and the component enterprises have a mother-daughter relationship or a controlling-interest or partner relationship. Other than the Huaneng International Electric Power Corporation, which is a Chinese-foreign joint capital operation, the Huaneng group guarantees a graduated rate of remitted profits to the higher levels, in which the percentages of excess earnings that are allocated to the total contract amount and to total wage are linked to the amount of profits tax paid, the amount of electricity generated, and the amount of coal transported, with an effort to move into line with international practice. Each year, the corporation pays a graduated rate of 10 percent of profits to the government, higher than the 7.2 percent rate paid by the Shougang Iron and Steel Works; the enterprise and the state divide the remainder in 30:70 proportions. If the company's profits increase by 1 percent, wages are increased by 0.7 percent. Close profit-and-loss relationships between the company and the state, the enterprise and the group, and the employee and the enterprise have been set up. The human factor has been assigned a highly rational part in the development of production. Production relations have been streamlined, thus guaranteeing the group's strong market competitiveness. Huaneng's Path: Still Expanding, Standing the Test of the Steadily Improving Socialist Market Economy, Continually Improving Itself Basic-industry projects involve large investments, long construction times, low profit rates, and a slow return on investment, and they must have a relatively stable source of funding if smooth progress on the projects is to be assured. In the eight years of Huaneng's operation, in addition to using foreign capital and locally raised funds, it has relied for its construction funds primarily on loans for the replacement of oil by coal. Starting this year, because the state has decided to "bring oil prices into line once and for all," these loans have been greatly decreased, and many projects currently under construction face the danger of suspension or stretching out of the investments. This year, the size of the scheduled state loan to Huaneng for replacement of oil by coal was 2 billion yuan. Ultimately it will be able to disburse only 900 million yuan, but the amount actually disbursed in the first half-year will be only slightly more than 200 million yuan. Thus Huaneng too is facing a funds shortage. Huaneng therefore laid its emphasis on opening up direct and indirect financing channels. It is now making arrangements for the establishment of experimental joint-stock enterprises and is arranging for the existing Huaneng Finance Corporation to have expanded functions. It has vigorously sought cooperation with international investment groups and has opened up more funding avenues. In May of this year, the Russell 20/20 Group, which is the largest retirement fund in the United States, visited China and reached an agreement in principle to enter a power-generation partnership with Huaneng. The Huaneng International Electric Power Development Corporation has also discussed joint-capital power generation with investment groups in the United States and Hong Kong; it is currently organizing some of its plants in Shandong into a joint-stock corporation for entry into overseas markets; and it has opened new channels that will allow it to utilize foreign capital. Huaneng's new objective in power generation is to install 15 million kW of new generating capacity by the year 2000 and to help the country free itself from its severe stagnation in electric power, so that this vanguard sector can truly break out of its bottleneck and move ahead.
