ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the methodology that may be used by Medicare supplemental insurance policy (``Medigap'') issuers to calculate the interest to be paid on premium credits and refunds due to Medicare beneficiaries. The Social Security Act requires the insurers annually to issue refunds or credits when their loss ratios do not meet statutory minimums and to pay interest from the end of the calendar year involved until the refund is made or the credit is applied. EFFECTIVE DATE: This notice is effective on May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie Walton, (410) 966&hyph;4622 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Under the Medicare program, Medicare pays for certain services furnished to beneficiaries entitled to Medicare. The beneficiary is, however, responsible for certain deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and charges, subject to certain limits, that exceed the amount allowed by Medicare. The beneficiary is also responsible for charges for items and services not covered by Medicare. He or she may purchase additional private insurance to help pay the costs. One type of private insurance beneficiaries may purchase is a Medicare supplemental policy, known as a Medigap policy. These policies typically offer coverage of some or all of Medicare's deductible and coinsurance amounts and sometimes include coverage of services not covered under Medicare. Section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth Federal standards applicable to Medigap policies. Under section 1882, no Medigap policy (as defined in section 1882(g)(1) of the Act) may be issued in a State unless it complies with State laws that have been established in accordance with section 1882(b)(1) and have been approved by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). (While Federal certification under section 1882(c) would be necessary in the absence of an approved State program, all States currently have approved programs.) Among other requirements, section 1882(b)(1)(B) of the Act incorporates by reference the loss ratio provisions of section 1882(r). Under section 1882(r)(1), a Medigap policy may not be issued or sold in any State unless it can be expected to return a minimum level of benefits, calculated as a percentage of premiums. Under section 1882(r)(1)(B), the issuer of the policy must provide for a proportional refund, or a credit against future premiums, if necessary to assure to that loss ratio targets are met. Section 1882(r)(2)(C) requires that the refund or credit include interest from the end of the policy year involved, at a rate specified by the Secretary that is not less than the average rate of interest for 13-week Treasury notes. Section 13.B of the Model Regulation to Implement the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Medicare Supplement Insurance Minimum Standards Model Act, adopted by the NAIC on July 30, 1991, specifies how and when the refund or credit calculation is to be done. The Model interprets ``policy year'' to mean ``calendar year.'' Appendix A of the Model contains the reporting form that is to be used by issuers in reporting their loss ratio experience to the State. This form must be submitted by May 31 of each year. The form requires that a description of the refund and/or credit against premiums to be used be attached to the form. In order to describe the refund or credit, the insurer must know how to calculate the interest rate. II. Provisions of the Notice There are several possible methods for calculating the interest rate. We expect to specify a single methodology that will be applicable for future years in the context of formal rulemaking relating to section 1882 generally. However, it is not possible to conclude that process in time for insurers to meet the May 31, 1994 deadline. The purpose of this notice is to meet the needs of States that are requiring refunds and premium credits this year. Until we specify otherwise, States may choose any reasonable methodology, subject to our approval. However, we have determined that the methodology described below is an acceptable way to calculate the interest rate required by section 1882(r)(2)(C). If the State chooses this approach, no further approval is necessary. We have determined that it is reasonable to apply the same methodology that is used by HCFA when States have been overpaid under the Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act). Under 42 CFR 433.38(d)(2), State repayments are subject to interest charges at the rate HCFA determines to be the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day Treasury bill auction rates during the period for which interest will be charged. (See 47 FR 29275; July 6, 1982). We will find it acceptable if States apply the same methodology we use to implement this section. Specifically, we use the unweighted average of the weekly auction average (investment) rates as published by the Federal Reserve. The rates are applied as simple interest for the entire application period measured in days, assuming a 365-day calendar year. The following table shows the rates for 1994 through the week ending April 22; however, any insurer can obtain the rates independently from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, which is made available each Monday. Information on the availability of the release is available by telephoning (202) 452&hyph;3206.
