This is demanded mainly by men and by the younger and better educated members of society. Direct subsidies to agriculture are far less important than other issues, such as crime prevention and the simplification of administrative procedures. This emerges from the opinion poll conducted for DER STANDARD by the "Market" research institute. In the view of Market's chief, Werner Beutelmeyer, the findings indicate that the Austrians -- and particularly those in favor of joining the EU -- "basically want to have a different EU than the one on offer." At the same time, expectations are high: One in three Austrians demands that Austria send competent representatives to Brussels; one in five wants Austria to participate in the security alliance. The concept of a security alliance is particularly attractive to the better educated and supporters of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe]. The demand for maintaining neutrality, which contradicts this view, continues to have a relative majority of 35 percent. Neutrality finds particularly few supporters within the Austrian People's Party (25 percent) and the FPOe (28 percent). The idea of further (eastern) states joining the EU is not very popular -- FPOe voters are most likely to support it, while the Social Democratic Party of Austria voters like the idea the least.
