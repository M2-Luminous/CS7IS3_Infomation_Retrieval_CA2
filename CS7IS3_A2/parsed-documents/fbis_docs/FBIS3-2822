He said: Sichuan has many favorable conditions for accelerating development; it has great potential. I hope the cadres of Sichuan will make the best use of these favorable conditions, avoid the effects of unfavorable conditions, and make serious efforts to accelerate the province's economic development. The morning plenary session of the Sichuan delegation was presided over by Yang Xizong, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. At the session, deputies continued to enthusiastically deliberate the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng. Deputies Zhao Wenxin, Huang Yongguang, Wang Hongju, Ma Kaiming, Li Shenkuan, and Yan Shenggui delivered speeches, expressing their opinions on issues concerning rural reform and development; policies concerning the development of town and village enterprises in the central and western regions; the Three Gorges Project; support for minority areas and maintenance of stability in these areas; strengthening of construction in the old revolutionary base areas; and development of agriculture that stresses high yields, high quality, and high efficiency. After carefully listening to their speeches, Chairman Qiao Shi voiced his opinions concerning Sichuan's development, a question of interest to the deputies. He said: Sichuan is a large province with a huge population. It has made important contributions to national construction since the founding of New China. The province has witnessed significant development in the past few years. Compared with the past, Sichuan's growth rate is still relatively fast. In the days to come, Sichuan should make better use of its favorable conditions and bring the enthusiasm of the masses into full play in order to accelerate economic development. Qiao Shi said: It is a very difficult task for Sichuan, a large hinterland province with more than a 100 million people, to catch up with the open coastal areas in the east within a few years' time. However, Sichuan is very promising. It has a strong industrial base, especial heavy industrial base. In the past, when the state launched the Industrial Streamlining Program in Sichuan, many railways, iron and steel factories, and armament-producing enterprises were built here. Moreover, large cities like Chongqing and Chengdu have their own relatively sound foundation for development. It is quite promising to accelerate development on such a basis. Of course, Sichuan has many mountainous and hilly areas, but it has the Pingchuan Plain, similar to the plain around Chengdu, where there is great potential. With a rich labor force, Sichuan should make vigorous efforts to develop economic crops in its hilly areas in order to push forward its diversified undertakings and comprehensive agricultural development. Qiao Shi pointed out: Foreign investment is beginning to move into inland areas and this is very beneficial to Sichuan. Meanwhile, Sichuan has advantages in the areas of land and material prices, and labor force. All these have formed a basic investment environment attractive to foreign investors. Such an environment will certainly attract more foreign capital. Concerning the evacuation of residents in the Three Gorges area, Qiao Shi said: The task of evacuating residents in the Three Gorges area falls mainly on Sichuan. Resettling more than 700,000 people through explorative evacuation is a big job. This process itself will offer a good opportunity for accelerating development. It is necessary to be good at seizing opportunities and transforming pressures into motive forces; it is necessary to fulfill the task of evacuating the Three Gorges residents and speed up the construction of new settlements for the evacuated people, to thoroughly change the state of poverty and backwardness. State Councillor Chen Junsheng also participated in the Sichuan delegation's discussion meeting today and spoke about the issue of agricultural production.
