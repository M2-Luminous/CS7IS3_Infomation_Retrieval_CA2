Our observer Yuliy Semenov is now live on the air from the president's country residence at Novo-Ogarevo, where Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin are at present. [Semenov] [passage omitted] What is happening here now is an unofficial dinner, well, it is official for a small number of participants, the presidents of Russia and the United States and the officials accompanying them. The Russian president arrived here a bit earlier and we had an opportunity to ask him a few questions about today's results. He is satisfied with the course of the talks. He said they discussed a very broad circle of questions, fundamental and global questions. He expressed his attitude to the concept of the Partnership for Peace and supported it. But in the main, the work of the two delegations was devoted to economic questions, questions of economic relations between Russia and the United States. In response to a question from correspondent about what sort of help Russia hopes to receive from the United States, the Russian president answered briefly: no more than was promised. Tomorrow, he said, they will discuss mainly problems of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and international questions. Then President Clinton arrived. The Russian president, as the host, welcomed him, told him a little about local beauty spots and the features of the locality, and invited him to the table, noting that today Russia is marking the old-style New Year. On this pleasant detail I end my report.
