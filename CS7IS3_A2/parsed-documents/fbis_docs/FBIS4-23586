The detention came a day after his organization called for mass protests next week in an effort to bring down military ruler General Sani Abacha. The source said security agents showed up at Ransome-Kuti's residence in Lagos, took him to police headquarters for interrogation, brought him back to the house and ransacked it for about an hour. After the search, which lasted about an hour, they took him away and detained him, the source said. Ransome-Kuti was the 11th prominent opposition activist detained in a crackdown launched last week. The struggle between the Nigerian Government and the opposition has intensified in recent weeks, with the opposition accusing the regime of dragging its heels over a return to democracy after annulled elections and a military coup last year. The elections were held on June 12 last year as part of then- military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida's pledge to restore democratic rule. But he annulled the election, citing fraud, appointed a non-elected interim government then stepped down. Abacha overthrew that government in November and dissolved all democratic institutions. The Campaign for Democracy groups about 40 human rights and pro- democracy associations. In a statement Wednesday, it said that from next week, "market women and men should lock their shops, drivers and transport owners should remove their vehicle from the streets. Workers should stay off their offices. "Our brothers and sisters in the armed forces and the police are advised to take side with the civil society."
