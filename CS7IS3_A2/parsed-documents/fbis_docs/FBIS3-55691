[passage omitted] I asked him to describe our foreign policy [Begin Sakalas recording] Lithuania's foreign policy must be based on some main principles. There must be a foreign policy concept containing some main principles. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, I do not at present see such a concept in our foreign policy based on principles. These principles should be as follows: Relations with the closest neighbors, relations with other countries. In relations with the closest neighbors I would put in the first place relations with Russia. Russia, as is known, has taken over the rights of the former USSR, it has only taken over the rights of the former USSR. If only rights, then why not responsibilities, too? And if responsibilities, then such issues as compensation and others may be discussed. If it has taken over rights only, then on what basis? So much about relations with Russia. In addition, we must evaluate the Russian military doctrine that has been published and is well known. We must respond correspondingly to this doctrine. There has been no such response so far. [passage omitted] We must evaluate this doctrine. [passage omitted] We must support all democratic forces in Russia and evaluate statements by the Liberal Democratic Party. We have not done this so far. When we have all such criteria, our evaluations, we will be able to conduct our diplomacy in relations with Russia. As for other neighbors, for instance Poland, are concerned, we have no treaty with Poland, we have no treaty with Belarus. [passage omitted] We must evaluate on what basis we are prepared to sign a treaty with Belarus. [passage omitted] The trouble with Poland is the Zeligowski action and the Suwalki Treaty that was broken, and it seems to me that we must say whether we adhere or refuse [as heard], but there must be a decision, and not like it is now -- diplomats travel to Poland and back and there is no order. Either we firmly say that until this is evaluated we do not intend to sign the treaty, or give up some things and sign a treaty that does not mention history and deals with the present only. As far as Germany is concerned, there are many people who have suffered from the Nazis, were deported to Germany and were lost there. The Bundestag is examining the issues of compensation and we should say something and not wait for something to happen. And lastly, Latvia and Estonia. Either we integrate in a common economic zone with some common political obligations, or each country remains separately. We must think about this. [passage omitted] We must not find ourselves under the influence of a single foreign state. [passage omitted] It must not happen that 60 percent our economy is linked with some specific country that can later dictate its economic and political conditions. [passage omitted] I do not think our statement on joining NATO will result in a positive decision. I think that there has to be an additional incentive for the West to think, as soon as possible, about the possibility of admitting us to NATO, but not yet as the solution of such possibility.
