FR940613-2-00050 FR940613-2-00032 We suspect that the practices we describe developed over time as appraisers, and mutuals and their advisers, attempted to deal in good faith with the inherent contradictions of, on the one hand, a form of transaction perfectly suited to institutions on the brink of failure, or which the market feared, and, on the other, a thrift industry that has returned to health. As a footnote to the conversions of the 80's, it is worth observing that many institutions which emerged with very high capital ratios were so anxious to earn a good return for their new, demanding stockholders, that they grew their balance sheets more quickly than they should have and took risks they did not fully understand. A total of 77 New England savings banks converted in the years 1984 through 1989; these transactions increased their weighted average capital ratio to 15.2% from 6.6%; 16 of them (or 21%) subsequently failed. 1 In addition, the rush by converted institutions to increase assets quickly tended to reduce credit standards throughout the market, imperiling other institutions. 1 ''Understanding the Experience of Converted New England Savings Banks,'' Eccles and O'Keefe, FDIC (1994). Changing the Process What this history demonstrates is the need for fundamental change: •The ``appraisal'' process puts the government in the awkward position of substituting its judgement for that of the market... • .␣.␣. and forces most converting institutions to raise far more capital than they can prudently deploy... • .␣.␣. but still fails to eliminate windfalls. •This has put well-intended individuals involved in more than a few conversions in the ethically uncomfortable position of pretending the appraisal requirement is met when they know it isn't. •The required form of transaction transfers the existing value of the mutual to a small group of individuals with the cash, sophistication and risk appetite to buy the stock. •Because value is being ``given away,'' the process invites insider abuse. And because the value has to go somewhere, the ingenuity of market participants eventually frustrates attempts to eliminate the problem. We share with others a desire to address problems arising under the existing rules. We do not in any way want to prevent valid conversions from taking place_nor encourage conversions that fail to meet a valid business need. We also desire that our handling of conversions be generally consistent with that of the OTS. For these reasons we are publishing elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register a proposed rule which: (a) reaffirms our intention to review conversion applications submitted by state-chartered nonmember insured savings banks (and applications for insurance from newly established associations to be owned by mutual holding companies), and (b) explicitly establishes certain criteria which are comparable to those of the OTS. At the same time, we feel it is only fair to put the public on notice that we believe it may be difficult for a healthy mutual to develop a sound business plan while raising enough new capital to receive a valid appraisal.
