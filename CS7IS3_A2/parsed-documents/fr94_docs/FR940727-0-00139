ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule clarifies, updates and modifies existing regulations on the management of cabins on national wildlife refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These regulations are necessary in order to comply with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) concerning the administration of cabins on Alaska refuges. These regulations are being revised to ensure proper and uniform management of all cabins on national wildlife refuges in Alaska. In addition, a technical amendment is made to eliminate reference to sections regarding general provisions which have been removed earlier. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 East Tudor Road, Attention: Daryl Lons, Anchorage, Alaska 99503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daryl Lons at the address above; Telephone: (907) 786&hyph;3354. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Sections 1303 and 1315 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3193 and 3203) allow the Secretary of the Interior to permit cabins on refuges in Alaska under certain conditions. Section 304 of ANILCA reemphasizes the authority of the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as necessary to ensure the compatibility of uses with refuge purposes. The original cabin policy for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was developed in 1981 and revised in 1984. This policy was the basis for regulations printed in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 50. In September 1987, the Service, believing revisions of the existing cabin policy and regulations were needed, published a Draft Cabin Management Policy for Cabins on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. The purpose of the cabin policy is to provide uniform guidance to both the public and refuge managers on human use and occupancy of cabins located on refuges in Alaska. The policy further serves to define under what conditions use and occupancy of a cabin may be compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established. Comments and suggestions on the draft policy were solicited during a 60-day public review period. The Service made extensive revisions in response to the comments. Because of the number and nature of revisions made, the Service published a revised draft of the policy in December 1988 to give the public another opportunity to comment before the policy was made final. The revised draft was completely reorganized. It better described the objectives of the policy and set forth the guidelines needed to comply with ANILCA and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The comment period for the revised draft was also 60 days. The final cabin policy was issued in August, 1989. The next step in the process was to publish proposed rules to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process and solicit public comment. A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on April 25, 1991 (56 FR 19074). The proposed rule had a 60 day public comment period and public hearings were held in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.
