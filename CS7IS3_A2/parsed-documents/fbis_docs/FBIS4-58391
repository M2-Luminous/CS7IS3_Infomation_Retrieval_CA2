FBIS4-58391 "drnes086_d_94002" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi, Egyptian Correspondents Meet Al-Qadhdhafi, Egyptian Correspondents Meet PM0305151994 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 3 May 94 p 4 PM0305151994 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Al-Qadhdhafi: We Are Seeking to Close Lockerbie File Politically Without Abandoning Libya's Sovereignty and Laws"] [Text] Tripoli -- Libyan Leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has sent a message to Mrs. Baha' al-Kikhya, wife of former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, in which he stressed that those behind her husband's disappearance "will not get away with their crime." He pointed out that security cooperation between Egypt and Libya "will succeed in revealing details of this case." Al-Qadhdhafi accused the CIA and its agents among the "stray dogs" of kidnapping al-Kihkya "with a view to driving a wedge between Egypt and Libya." He expressed willingness to look after al-Kikhya's wife and children. Al-Qadhdhafi uses the phrase "stray dogs" to refer to those opposed to his regime. Al-Qadhdhafi met a delegation of Egyptian journalists the day before yesterday evening in a bedouin tent among olive and almond trees in al-Khadra' area, some 56 km southwest the capital, Tripoli. Al-Qadhdhafi criticized during the meeting the current peace process in the Middle East. He also stressed that the country does not intend to hand over the two Libyan nationals suspected of involvement in the blowing up of the PanAm plane over Lockerbie. He spoke about the reasons that prompted Libya to announce its wish to withdraw from the Arab League. On the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement in Cairo tomorrow, Wednesday, he said that "Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is chasing a mirage, and the Palestinian people are not just one individual." He said that "the Palestinians negotiating with Israel are not the custodians of the cause. The real custodians of the cause are Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the stone-throwing children, the Palestinian people scattered throughout the world, and the 10 Palestinian factions rejecting the so-called Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles agreement. He expressed his belief that 'Arafat's agreement to continue to negotiate with Israel is attributable to "Arab positions that have annoyed him." He said that recovering Jericho and Gaza "does not mean the Palestinian issue has been resolved or that the Palestinian people have accepted this agreement." Addressing 'Arafat, he wondered: "How can you agree to befriend and embrace the Jews, when Palestinian martyrs, including members from Fatah itself, are falling in the occupied territories?" He added that "the slogan being raised for the so-called peace talks means the Arabs' unconditional surrender to their enemy. It means their humiliation, abandonment of their future, and harming posterity." He said: "We are not warmongers; we are advocates of peace. But what is happening at present is a deception for both the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews are deceived in order to get rid of them from world states, namely by deporting them to the occupied Palestinian territories under the Promised Land slogan. As for the Arabs, they are deceived so that they waste time and squander their cause (...) The land of promise will become the land of death." He urged the Jews to "return to their homelands." He welcomed "the return of the Libyan Jews living in Israel to their country." He said: "If there is a real desire for peace, those in charge of the peace process in the Middle East must take South Africa as a model to grant the Palestinian people their rights and hold free elections in the occupied Palestinian territories under UN supervision. He stressed that such a measure would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. On Libya's continuation in the Arab League, al-Qadhdhafi said: "The decision to withdraw [from the Arab League] in February was taken to make room for Israel to join the league after Libya's withdrawal from it. The decision was taken in protest at the positions of some Arab states which have turned the league's task into a process of talking about ending the economic boycott of Israel and entering into projects with the Hebrew state, instead of talking about Arab unity." He added that he and Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League, had agreed over the telephone to delay a decision on Libya's decision to withdraw from the league. He stressed that Libya has for the time being abandoned the idea of withdrawing from the league. He said: "Libya is currently experiencing a period of truce with the Arab states." Al-Qadhdhafi supported the league's proposal concerning trying the two Lockerbie case suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague before Scottish judges and in accordance with the rules of Scottish law. Al-Qadhdhafi renewed his country's nonobjection to handing over suspects al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah and 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi if the United States and Britain agree to this proposal, which has "embarrassed the Western states concerned with the crisis with Libya." He pointed out that his country will continue its endeavors to close this file through political means. "But it does not mean abandoning Libya's sovereignty or laws." He stressed that "any western escalation of the crisis will be confronted by Libyan steadfastness, no matter how long it takes." He praised "Egyptian President Husni Mubarak's efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis." On his position on the Arab states' compliance with the international embargo imposed on Libya, al-Qadhdhafi said that "the Arab League has not spared any efforts to help Libya. But it has no powers to adopt a resolution to compel the Arab states to refuse to apply Security Council resolutions." He said that that "the Libyan people are saddened by the Arab planes' boycott of Libyan airports." Al-Qadhdhafi said that President Bill Clinton is "a good man seeking peace. But his Republican predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, set up traps for him in Somalia, Iraq, and Libya to topple him or force him to pursue their line." Al-Qadhdhafi warned Clinton of the same fate as that of former U.S. President John Kennedy, "who was the victim of a plot hatched by intelligence organs and major monopoly companies." He described Clinton as "an unaggressive man who opposed the Vietnam war. And he represents the Democrats, a grouping for the minorities." Al-Qadhdhafi, who, the day before yesterday, held a popular rally in Tarhunah, 70 km from the capital, which was attended by Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, urged Syria "not to negotiate with Israel over withdrawal from the Golan Heights." He also stressed that his country "will not recognize Israel, no matter for how long the blockade imposed on it continues." He called for "the removal of the Hebrew state from the Arab region."
