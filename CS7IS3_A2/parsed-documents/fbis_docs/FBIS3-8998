In the name of some half-understood values and principles that allegedly guide modern society, we Bulgarians have been consciously dismantling our state for five years now. Now, all kinds of "parties" and organizations are unfurling their banners that are not only unconstitutional (and for that reason unregistered) but even openly declare that it is part of their program to split Bulgaria into an unknown number of components. The Ilinden OMO [Ilinden United Macedonian Organization] is especially active in this respect. Despite not having any evident support in the Pirin region and being split into three mutually warring factions at the moment, the Ilinden members have the effrontery to give news conferences in the center of Sofia and to explain to the amazed fraternity of journalists what words like nation, minority, racism, and genocide really mean. However, Ilinden OMO Chairman Yordan Ivanov committed a grave mistake. He demanded that the Bulgarian authorities, the army included, should pull out of the Pirin region, and then proceeded to utter threats against the Bulgarian majority in this region. This proves that the gentleman in question really does not know his history, because when the official powers have withdrawn, this will leave only the structures of the VMRO-SMD (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies, a pro-Bulgarian organization] there. As they say in these parts, "I had a bad dream about you, Dancho."
