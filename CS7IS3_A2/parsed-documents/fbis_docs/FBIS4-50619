Zou Jiahua said: The development of transportation and communications directly promotes the circulation of commodities and the development of the socialist market economy of our country. At present, the international environment is conducive to China, and China itself also has the conditions to develop communications. In addition, the society's demands for communications facilities are becoming greater day by day. Thus, China's posts and telecommunications are precisely in a very good period of development. Last year, thanks to the concerted efforts of staff, workers, and cadres of postal and telecommunications departments, the completed investment in fixed assets amounted to 40 billion yuan, the newly added capacity of telephone exchanges for the use of telephone offices reached 12.86 million lines, and 8 optical fiber cables were made available. Such a situation is rare in the world communications history, and this is a very great achievement. In the light of the principles of making overall planning, combining departments with localities, letting each level assume responsibility for itself, and joining efforts to build communications facilities, Zou Jiahua explained: By overall planning, we mean that postal and communications departments should strengthen the macro-management of the national communications trades and strive to change from the past method of laying undue emphasis on the micro-management of postal and telecommunications departments to laying emphasis on the macro-management of the communications facilities throughout the country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should conscientiously formulate the strategic principle for China's communications development and draw up the long-term plan and the fiscal-year plan for the national telecommunications development. In the field of combining departments with localities, he pointed out: The idea of cooperation and coordination should be fostered, and the scientific research forces and production forces of various departments, provinces, and municipalities should be pooled together to build communications facilities. On no account should we engage in overlapping construction. Not only should we successfully build the public communications network throughout the country but also should we give full play to the role of special networks. At the same time, we should give full play to the initiative of all localities and departments. He also said: To accelerate the development of posts and telecommunications, we should depend on scientific and technological progress. Over the past few years, postal and telecommunications departments have taken a big step in applying new technologies. They have applied many communications technologies that are advanced in the world, such as program-controlled exchanges, optical fiber cable communications, satellite communications, and mobile communications. Postal and telecommunications departments should cooperate with other pertinent departments to form an overall advantage of research and development. He pointed out: In the course of developing posts and telecommunications, we should all the more attend to service work. The demands of consumers should become the motivation to improve our work. Posts and telecommunications should not be turned to a kind of power. The idea of serving the people and serving the national economy should be fostered.
