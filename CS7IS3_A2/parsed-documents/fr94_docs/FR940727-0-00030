FR940727-0-00030 FR940727-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 510 and 522 Animal Drugs, Feeds, and Related Products; Change of Sponsor AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect a change of sponsor for a new animal drug application (NADA) from SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, to Walco International, Inc. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Benjamin A. Puyot, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;130), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1646. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, has informed FDA that it has transferred ownership of, and all rights and interests in, approved NADA 065&hyph;488 to Walco International, Inc., 15 West Putnam, Porterville, CA 93257. In addition, Walco has not previously been listed in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) as a sponsor of an approved NADA. That section is amended to add entries for the firm. Furthermore, in the Federal Register of October 8, 1991, FDA published a document to reflect a change of sponsor from Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler code 000029) to SmithKline Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler code 053571). The current 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1) and (b)(2) does not reflect that change. This document removes the entry for Beecham in 21 CFR 522.1696a(b) and adds in its place the entry for Walco International, Inc., the new sponsor. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) and (c)(2) and 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1) and (b)(2) to reflect those changes.
