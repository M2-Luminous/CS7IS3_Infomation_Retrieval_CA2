He has a far from unsubstantial influence on the policies of the individual department ministers, though in most cases it is only the departmental ministers themselves who are judged on these policies. In the past five years international relations (not to be confused with foreign policy), the broad lines of financial policy through the Treasury Ministry, and media and culture were the direct responsibility of the head of government. Strengthening Luxembourg's position with regard to the new orientation of the European Union has understandably been a constant theme in recent years. With regard to the single internal market, as of 1 January 1992 the country was certainly able to take advantage of the EC presidency in the first half of 1991, Prime Minister Jacques Santer believes not without pride. In particular it was able to fashion the harmonization of tax and excises in such a way as not to damage Luxembourg's competitive position vis-a-vis its partners. Naturally, a mechanical effect on national price development could not be excluded, he admits, but the key thing is that it proved possible to maintain an advantage toward neighboring countries. When it comes to "monetary union," the prime minister points out, it has been possible to keep the Belgian-Luxembourg franc within the hard currency group. The Luxembourg Monetary Institute [IML] has been expanded with a view to the transition to phase three. He is "very pleased" that, despite many difficulties, our country has been able to stick to all the convergence criteria, and that right now it is the only country which still fulfills these. To carry out the governmental work more effectively, the government declaration included a draft bill on the reform of the Audit Office. For a long time, however, this topic was gradually forgotten, and it was not until a few weeks ago that a bill to this effect was submitted by CSV [Christian Social People's Party] representative Francois Colling as president of the Finance Committee. Santer nonetheless energetically refutes any government responsibility in the bill's delay. The Audit Office is a body which is at the disposal of the Parliament, which is responsible for its restructuring in cooperation, of course, with the government, given that this action also requires the reform of government accounting. Here the preparatory work has been largely concluded, so that both reforms can now to carried through in parallel. Luxembourg, which proudly sees its place confirmed as the world's seventh largest financial marketplace, has been very concerned in recent years to improve its supervisory activities, so as to prevent abuse, money laundering and insider offenses. The bursting of the BCCI [Bank of Credit and Commerce International] scandal into the midst of these efforts, should not, in Santer's view, be overvalued. This scandal clearly did not originate in Luxembourg. Nor should one be under any illusion that laws provide absolute protection against scandals. Overall supervision has been notably increased in recent years not only by the transposition of all the EU directives, but also through the expansion of the IML, the law against tax evasion and on legal aid. This has confirmed the seriousness of the banking market, which has also been reflected in international assessments. Not without pride Santer also points to the fact that it was the Luxembourg authorities which succeeded in bringing to justice one of the largest international drug dealers in the person of Franklin Jurado. The second field with which Jacques Santer identifies himself (also personally), is the media sector, in which in 1989 people were optimistically expecting a renewal of the licence with CLT [Luxembourg Line Broadcasting Company]. In the meantime the negotiations ran aground. "Over the last two months" the prime minister has "become optimistic again," though pointing out in the same breath that, given the deadline of 1 January 1996, there is no urgency. Reaching an accord will be "one of the new government's first jobs." One of the most controversial draft bills of the past legislative period was the liberalization of the national media. Santer does not consider the fact that the initial euphoria has givewn way to a large extent to a more sober approach as a failure of this project. Completely new paths have been taken. Difficulties will always be there. It is the same in every country. The standards which the government has set provide the starting conditions: it is now up to the individual radio stations to fight it out. For Santer, the same applies also to sociocultural radio. He does not want to exclude the possibility that many changes could still occur. For him, this is normal.
