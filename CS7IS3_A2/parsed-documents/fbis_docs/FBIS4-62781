Yakovlev expressed the hope that this meeting would "help establish truly democratic laws for the everyday life of our democratic society". The conference was organised by the Institute of Law and Comparative Jurisprudence under the Russian Government, jointly with the Supreme Court of Arbitation. It is being attended by members of the private law centre under the Russian president, jurists, economists, and businessmen from the CIS countries and other foreign states. The 1964 civil code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which is now in force, was drawn up to service the administrative-command system and, of course, does not guarantee contractual freedom in the new economic conditions, the speakers noted. Moreover, it legalises the inequality of the forms of ownership, giving preference to state-owned property. The adoption of the new Russian civil code must be accelerated to ensure legal backing to the market economy. The parliamentary hearings on its draft, to which the participants of the conference were invited, will be held at the State Duma building on May 19. The civil code must be "a fundamental law, laying down the overall legal principles of market relationships in the country". The private law, which is now being revived in Russia, must protect the people's ownership rights, including the right to the results of intellectual labour, must regulate relations among people, based on equality. Several such laws are already in force, including the laws on privatisation, business transactions, banks, investments, competition, restriction of monopolism, copyrights and attendant rights. Laws have also been adopted to protect the rights of consumers, to guarantee the free movement of citizens, and the freedom of the mass media. However, they do not regulate all the spheres of the market economy and all the relationships between the civilian society and the private life of citizens. The conference participants plan to address recommendations, linked with the elaboration of the Russian civil legislation, to the Federal Assembly (parliament) of Russia and to the parliaments of other CIS states.
