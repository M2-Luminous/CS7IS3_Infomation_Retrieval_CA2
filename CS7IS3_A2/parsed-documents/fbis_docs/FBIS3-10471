Bolstered by the military lobby, deputies and senators from the North will introduce amendments to change the way Indian reservations are demarcated and limit the creation of new Indian areas in the regions near Brazil's borders. The Native Missionary Council (CIMI) has calculated that 230 amendments have already been submitted on the Indian question alone. In CIMI's opinion, all but ten of them pose a threat to Indian constitutional rights. Among major changes is an amendment submitted by Senator Coutinho Jorge, (PMDB-PA) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Para State], that would insert into the Constitution an obligation for the federal government to consult the state governments before drawing the boundaries of Indian lands. Retreat The proposal, which has won the sympathy of Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the rapporteur for the revision, is being interpreted by Indian rights defenders as a retreat from gains made in the 1988 Constituent Assembly. Concerned about the proposed changes, Bishop Apparecido Jose Dias, the CIMI president, will travel to Brasilia to meet with party leaders. "The federal government must not bow to the states. If that amendment passes, it will be a disaster for the indigenous peoples," Dom Apparecido Dias warned. Senator Coutinho Jorge, a former environment minister, defends his position by arguing that his proposal seeks to correct existing distortions in the mechanism for demarcating Indian reservations. "This is only a technical amendment," he said. The senator's proposal was inspired by an episode that occurred last year in the Para municipality of Altamira, when FUNAI [National Indian Foundation] began ratifying the boundaries of the Cachoeira Seca reserve in an area where INCRA [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] had put 4,500 settlers. Faced with this impasse, the Ministry of Justice was forced to annul the ratification of the Indian zone. "The amendment aims to prevent this kind of problem from arising," Coutinho Jorge pointed out. Another proposal opposed by the NGO's is the plan to veto the demarcation of reserves in the 150-km strip along Brazil's borders. With military permission, PDT [Democratic Labor Party] leader Deputy Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), submitted an amendment that would insert the following sentence into Article 20 of the Constitution: "Areas intended for permanent possession by Indians shall be demarcated outside the border strip." This idea was criticized by Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ) [Green Party, Rio de Janeiro] who called it "completely unacceptable." The green congressman submitted seven suppressive amendments designed to prevent proposals such as the PDT measure from being approved during the revision. According to CIMI figures, approval of this amendment would directly affect 200 Indian areas and about 100,000 Indians who now live in the border strip. To mollify those who are upset about this, Luiz Salomao will probably meet with representatives of the NGO's and the military after Carnival. The PDT leader argues that his amendment does not prohibit Indians from living in the border strip but simply takes into consideration that it is a national security area.
