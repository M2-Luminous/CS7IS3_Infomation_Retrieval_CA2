Our political news staff reports that at least one former member of the ANC's [African National Congress] armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], is included in the list along with several new faces to politics. Unlike the ANC, the NP will not draw up a consolidated national list. Each province will have a list for the national assembly and for the provincial government.
