Observers said the roundtable in Pyongyang ended without producing any significant results. People held that it was all because the two-headed government refused to talk about national reconciliation as desired by the entire Cambodian nation and people. The goal of this unconditional roundtable was to discuss national reconciliation. However, the two-headed government under the command of the communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance clearly saw that the so-called unconditional roundtable would surely examine different aspects of the issue of national reconciliation. This stress on national reconciliation was a bitter pill for them to swallow; it was a blow to their heads at the roundtable. But the masses were well aware of the importance of national reconciliation at the roundtable. They saw who was good, who was bad, who wanted national reconciliation and peace, who continued to kindle the flames of war, who continued to attack others, and who were defending themselves. It was for this reason that the two-headed government refused to raise the subject of national reconciliation and instead brought up other aspects which opposed and buried national reconciliation. All this once again clearly shows that the two-headed government does not want national reconciliation, because the communist Vietnamese and the alliance of Western powers do not want national reconciliation; this is because they oppose it and want only to continue the war. They are fishing in troubled waters and are scrambling to promote their own interests. The Cambodian nation and people see clearly that it is necessary to join forces and carry on the struggle, pending national reconciliation, and fight to end the Vietnamese war of aggression as soon as possible. The two-headed government under the command of the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance continues to oppose the king's national reconciliation initiative and kindle the flames of war in Cambodia. When they were leaving for the roundtable in Pyongyang, which was purported to be held without any preconditions, Prince Ranariddh, representing the American puppets, and Hun Sen, representing the communist Vietnamese puppets, repeatedly set a precondition by calling for a cease-fire; whereas at home the puppet General Staff in Phnom Penh informed all their military units that there was no cease-fire whatsoever and that the cease-fire announced by the two-headed government was just a political ploy. During the roundtable on 27 May, the two categories of puppets under the command of the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance did not mention the issue of national reconciliation at all. On the contrary, they raised the same preconditions that they had regularly set before. On the cease-fire issue, the party of Democratic Kampuchea was of the opinion that in order for the cease-fire to proceed correctly and effectively it should be jointly controlled by observation groups made up of all Cambodian parties and five neutral countries, to be located in central, eastern, and western Cambodia. However, the two categories of puppets were opposed to the idea of allowing neutral countries to take part in supervising this cease-fire. That was an intentional obstacle created to sabotage the national reconciliation roundtable in Pyongyang. The majority of opinion both inside and outside the country clearly saw that the two-headed government under the command of the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance did not want national reconciliation and peace. They wanted only to continue igniting the war; so they urged their two puppets to attack the people and resistance forces while taking the opportunity to further their own strategic interests. The communist Vietnamese wanted to take the opportunity to bring more Vietnamese nationals into Cambodia and expand the size of the already over 4 million Vietnamese immigrant population to 6, 7, 8 or 10 million in order to demographically annex Cambodia and exterminate the Cambodian race. As for the two categories of puppets, they are too intoxicated by dollars and inebriated by power. They forget everything Cambodian. Instead, they are foolishly forcing the children of the people to go to the battlefields and die in their place. They will do anything so long as they can preserve their corrupt power and continue to embezzle and build up their own personal interests at the expense of the people and their children's lives. This is an act of treason to the nation and people, an act of selling out the nation to foreigners. As a matter of fact, the two-headed government is doing everything at the command of the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance. They do not want to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation and peace. If Cambodia achieved national reconciliation and became unified, it would affect the communist Vietnamese strategy of swallowing up Cambodian territory. So, the Cambodian nation and people have no other alternative but to continue joining hands and holding aloft the banner of the struggle for their own defense until genuine national reconciliation and peace are achieved and happiness brought back to the country and the national community, thus allowing the people to live their normal lives. Do the communist Vietnamese puppets and the communist Vietnamese, whose desire is only to annex Cambodian territory, have any desire to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation and peace? Before he went to Pyongyang for the roundtable, puppet Hun Sen vociferously announced that he did not want to hold talks with the Khmer Rouge and did not expect any results. He said he went to the roundtable just to placate other people. These remarks show that the communist Vietnamese, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance have not changed their stance. They continue to oppose the king's national reconciliation plan. The stance of the party of Democratic Kampuchea is well known to our nation and people. It is for peace and national reconciliation and it supports the king's national reconciliation plan. The Vietnamese puppets under the command of their bosses, the communist Vietnamese, have demanded that Democratic Kampuchea hand over the liberated zones to them and dissolve its army so that the communist Vietnamese and the alliance can control and run Cambodia as they please. More to the point, they have aimed at crushing the national liberation resistance movement to enable Vietnam to incorporate Cambodia into its Indochinese federation. This is part of the long-standing, threadbare strategy and stance of the communist Vietnamese; nothing has changed. For this reason, can one rely on the communist Vietnamese and their puppets for national reconciliation, national concord, and peace? No. The communist Vietnamese want to do away with all of us who are Cambodians in order to turn our Cambodian territory into a part of Vietnam. As for the Vietnamese puppets such as Chea Sim, Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and others, they are merely elements installed in power by Vietnam to serve Vietnam's war of aggression, which has been going on since 1979. They are Vietnam's out-and-out lackeys serving Vietnamese interests 100 percent. They never care about the interests of the Cambodian nation and people. Their nature is Vietnamese. They only want to kill Cambodians just as the Vietnamese, their bosses, do. Our nation and people know the true nature of the Vietnamese and their puppets. We never hoped that they would mercifully bestow peace and national reconciliation on Cambodia. Hearing the aforementioned rotten remarks of puppet Hun Sen is more than enough. Past, present, and future experiences in Cambodia and the world show that no one should expect aggressors to give away peace and independence. The peace, independence, and survival of any country facing aggression can be won only through the struggle of the people in that country. This is true for Cambodia. If we want to achieve peace and national reconciliation, our entire nation and people both in the cities and the countryside must join hands and wage the struggle by all possible means until our nation and people achieve genuine peace, national reconciliation, independence, and national unity.
