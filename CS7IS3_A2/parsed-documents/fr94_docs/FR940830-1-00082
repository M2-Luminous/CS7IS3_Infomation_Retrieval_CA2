SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Parish's alkali grass is an ephemeral, annual species that occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Its habitat is desert seeps and springs. The grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic flows due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat from farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers. On March 28, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Parish's alkali grass as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within 45 days of the proposal's publication in the Federal Register . A public hearing request was received within the allotted time period from Mr. Ron Wood, Kingman, Arizona. The Service has scheduled this hearing at 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time), September 15, 1994, at the Greyhills High School, Tuba City, Arizona. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. Legal notice announcing the dates, time, and location of the hearing are being published in newspapers concurrently with this Federal Register notice. The comment period on the proposal originally closed on May 12, 1994. In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may now be submitted until September 26, 1994, to the Service office in ADDRESSES section.
