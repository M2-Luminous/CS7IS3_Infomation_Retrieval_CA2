An Alliance With the League Is Permissible'"] [Text] [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] Martinazzoli says he has taken note of the centrists' farewell? Pier Ferdinando Casini confutes: "If he thinks we are leaving, he is mistaken. He must be the one to throw us out." [Lampugnani] But have you been thrown out or not? [Casini] We do not have the complex of being troublemakers. But we do not understand what we are being thrown out of since the DC no longer exists and the PPI [Italian People's Party] has not been founded yet. The truth is that we find ourselves entangled in an inextricable contradiction, which has been caused, among other things, by procedures that are not very clear and that are forcing us once again to call on the party's National Council to address all the problems. [Lampugnani] But do you still feel DC members or a part of something else? [Casini] We are currently experiencing a transitional phase in which everybody is equal. [Lampugnani] In reality Martinazzoli is saying that you are now another party, that you have, in effect, placed yourselves outside the DC. [Casini] And we have taken note of his statements. The real problem is a political one, because there can be no casus belli of this kind. In the DC there has always been a plethora of position without any need for disciplinary measures to be taken. In reality the left of the party has been given the freedom of action that has been denied to us. [Lampugnani] You are the only ones however, that have prepared an authentic political program. [Casini] Our program was presented to the DC. But when are we supposed to have discussed it since nobody has been meeting on this issue for the past six months? [Lampugnani] Meanwhile you have discussed it with everybody else. [Casini] Not with [Fininvest President] Berlusconi, but with Maroni [Northern League lower house floor leader], [Radical leader] Pannella, Republican member Castagnetti, and Ferri [Italian Social Democratic Party secretary]. Moreover, talking with parliamentary representatives is not forbidden as yet. Should [DC left-wing faction leader] Bindi not have been allowed to meet with the AD [Democratic Alliance] or the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]? Debate is a part of politics, not a disciplinary matter. [Lampugnani] What will happen now. What will you do? [Casini] Since Martinazzoli is calling for discussions on the succession to the DC, we are asking for the immediate summoning of the party's National Council. On that occasion we will verify if there any difficulties in our cohabiting with the others, or if a transfer is necessary. [Lampugnani] League member Maroni views the position adopted by Martinazzoli toward you to be his first act in taking the DC over to the left. Do you concur with this analysis? [Casini] I do not need Maroni to make this type of judgement. I say that, just as the PDS is organizing an alliance that goes from [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta to [Italian Liberal Party member] Battistuzzi, we have a duty to do the same with Formentini [Milan mayor and League member]. [Lampugnani] You have reached breaking point with the DC. Do you fear a split that will break the party in two? [Casini] Of course, but we have done nothing to encourage it. [Lampugnani] Will the process of aggregating the neo-centrists be speeded up? [Casini] I only stress that I did not invent what Segni said about the League. This process of acceleration is occurring openly. The construction of the People's Party is the only thing that is proceeding slowly. The truth is that Martinazzoli wants us to be the ones to say: We are leaving. Well, if he wants that gesture, let him make it. Let him be the one to throw us out. I repeat: we are asking the National Council to dissolve the DC and then give birth to twins or whatever.
