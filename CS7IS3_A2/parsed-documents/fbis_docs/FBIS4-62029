A system of radical proposals on the future of the fleet is now being prepared by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Economy, and others. The proposals will be examined at the highest level, Lieutenant General Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. According to him, it is also impossible to resolve the question of conducting the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises on a departmental level. We need to analyze the political, economic, military-technical, and financial aspects of the exercises, the general said. Conclusions and suggestions that should also give consideration to the general public opinion should form the basis of decisions on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and on holding the Russian-U.S. military exercises, Manilov stressed. He said that the Security Council has already made its position clear to the Russian president, but at the same time, did not reveal the essence of this position.
