According to information obtained, the government has instructed the National Coca Control Directorate (DINACO) and the Coca Eradication Directorate (DIRECO) to fulfill the plan to eradicate all surplus coca plantations by 31 March "with or without dialogue." Jorge Martinez, coordinator of the five federations, voiced his "deep concern" over the fact that government authorities "have given this order but they do not want to dialogue because since January they have repeatedly suspended scheduled meetings. They promised an answer in writing but have failed to give it." Martinez asserted: "We are certain that the government is seeking to justify the compulsory eradication of coca plantations." He said that in view of this, the latest emergency meeting held in Ivirgazama decided to declare coca growers in a state of alert and mobilization. He added: "We are organized," adding that the committees for the defense of coca leaf production in labor organizations and unions "are already alert." He said they have decided to suspend the voluntary eradication "in response to the government's lack of interest." The leader added that "although the government is making fun of us" they will wait until 16 February for the announced meeting to take place, even though DIRECO "constantly threatens and pressures us." Martinez charges that members of the Victor Ustariz Regiment and of the Special Forces Training Center (CITE) will enter the tropical zone to carry out maneuvers, but they believe "it is part of the plan to use force to eradicate the coca plantations." In the face of this, he warned that coca growers will begin a hunger strike because they do not have the means to face the military men. He added: "There is a very tense atmosphere, there is fear that clashes will take place. This is, seemingly, what the gringos want to justify the intervention." Martinez recalled that coca growers proposed amending Supreme Decree No. 23668 which eliminated the participation of the peasants as established by Supreme Decree No. 22270. "Now the government ministry is in charge of promoting development in Chapare and this is not right. We have made concrete proposals but have not received any answer." Martinez added that if the authorities in charge of handling coca producer affairs do not answer, they will request an audience with the president of the Republic to whom they will explain their problems "within the framework of the people's participation plan he always talks about."
