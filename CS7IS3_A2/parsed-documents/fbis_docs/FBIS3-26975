This call was made by Romanian President Ion Iliescu and his Croat counterpart Franjo Tudjman at a joint press conference here. The two leaders said they do not want to see the NATO plan for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs become a reality. Iliescu said resorting to force could not help solve any problem and, on the contrary, will befoul the political atmosphere and hinder efforts to solve the problem. Tudjman said air strikes will result in more casualties and escalate the conflict. He hoped Romania will play an important role in seeking a political solution. Tudjman ended his three-day visit here on Wednesday. During the visit, the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation and one on trucking and scientific research cooperations.
