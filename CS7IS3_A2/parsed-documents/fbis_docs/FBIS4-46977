Now we would like to discuss strictly specific topics. Would you be so kind as to tell us how the Ukrainian National Bank cooperates with commercial banks? Have there been disagreements or problems? In general, what is your vision of the banking system of Ukraine in the future? [Yushchenko] We might begin with the fact that a relevant law is the foundation for such cooperation in any state--a law on banks and banking. Two years ago, such a law was passed here (at the time, it was a democratic law). It set forth principles for relations in a majority of areas of banking. However--this is unambiguous--at present a legal foundation for the operation of the banking system needs to be laid in order to build a strong banking system. The difficulty lies in the fact that in the course of 1,000 years of its history, Ukraine has had no practice and experience in building a banking system, and the central bank in particular. It was the periphery, a financial province. We have now gained independence and our own monetary space. However, many contradictions have developed. The National Bank should be independent just as, for example, the Bundesbank operates in Germany. There is no force in that state that could cancel any decision of the Bundesbank. Only the chancellor has the right to suspend its main actions--that is, the Bundesbank's-- for 14 days. However, on the 15th day after a decision is made it goes into effect. Is it surprising that the independence of the Bundesbank has produced the strongest and healthiest currency in the world--the Deutsche mark? All Germans are grateful to the Bundesbank for upholding through its independent position the standard of standards--its monetary unit. That is, by now the following system has been created in Germany: If a person receives a Deutsche Mark, he receives not only tender, but also a means to save his wealth. Half a year from now, it will be the same as it is today. This is one of the functions of currency--to maintain the wealth of society in a stable manner. However, independence in the operation of the bank alone is not enough. We do remember that the relationship between quantity and quality is a dialectical contradiction. A single unit of emission already violates the ideology of stability. What is the case in our state? Let us recall this: Did discussions not flare up at each of the past sessions of the Supreme Council or meeting of the Presidium--do we, or do we not have enough money in circulation? These discussions were initiated by production managers--directors of enterprises, kolkhoz chairmen, and others. We have a collective form of undermining the force of the national currency because for me as a banker the question of whether we have enough currency in circulation does not exist even in theory. As it is, the formula of operation of money in circulation is extremely simple: The total amount of money corresponds to the quantity of goods times their prices. The quantity of goods multiplied by prices produces money. If there is less money today while the quantity of goods is the same, their prices will be consequently lower. This is a simple, classical tenet, the golden rule of monetary circulation. In no country of the world do discussions develop over whether enough currency is in circulation because everyone understands that currency is in circulation, second after second. At present, state structures account for 94 percent in our country. Many of them have their representatives in the parliament. They, these representatives, start the discussions about the currency shortage with just one objective: to improve the condition of their production units. As it is, they have no money because of the inefficient production of goods, which in addition sit forever in the warehouses because they are not in demand strictly due to their consumer features. Then state officials say: "Let us support this or that enterprise through emission because this is an important sector...." A decision concerning emission is made, and we obscure the picture of the market: We throw in a new portion of money, and the potentially bankrupt entity obtains new resources for its existence. This is how the impression is created that its operations are rational. One month passes, and the same problem arises.... I think that everybody understands what the conclusion is: The real cause cannot be eliminated by way of emission. We can merely postpone it. Emission is a very peculiar lever. Certainly, it should be used but the entire peculiarity of it is that the amount of emission brings about the devaluation of the national currency. There are things in a transitional economy that merit solving certain problems through emission. However, how can, say, 15 percent out of the 94 percent of state monopoly enterprises be switched to regular economic conditions? This would mean that 80 percent of the enterprises would be allowed to go into a free fall, and the latter means free bankruptcies; this is a social problem. In turn, an unsolved social problem brings about a political conflict. Strikes, hunger strikes, demonstrations, and so on begin. A new membership of the Ukrainian Supreme Council has begun its work. If this parliament does not create a safe atmosphere for the operation of the banking system, including the commercial system, we will experience many complications in the area of economic restructuring. With a view to streamlining the relations between the National Bank and commercial banks, we have appointed this year a special adviser to the National Bank board chairman who has worked for 15 years as a manager of one of the regional institutions of the Bundesbank. We are developing, putting it figuratively, a tree of laws for the banking system of Ukraine with his assistance. There will be two main laws: about the National Bank and about commercial banks. This is the pillar on which the entire banking system will rest. [Ovchar] Certainly, for now you mean draft laws? [Yushchenko] Of course, for now these are drafts. We have sent them to the central banks of many countries of the world in the hope of receiving consultations, remarks, and proposals. If the Supreme Council passes these laws, a law on national currency may also be adopted on the basis of them. If we keep the form of management that we had a year ago we will never build a healthy national monetary unit on such a basis. If we fail to build it we will never ensure the classical functions of currency. We say that the national currency is a standard. It is so. I will give the following example. Let us take, say, the meter as the standard of length. As is known, it consists of 100 centimeters. Three days go by, and we say: The meter is the standard of length, but there are only 98 centimeters in this meter. Half a year passes, it is the same meter that is the standard of length, but its value (in a figurative sense--the value of the coupon) is then 70 or 60 centimeters. Then the following question arises: Can anything be done under such conditions? A standard is being violated, the standard of standards! A currency can unite teachers, writers, steelworkers, miners, and bankers.... The fourth quarter was dreadful for Ukrainian economy. All of this was a consequence of unprecedented emission-related decisions to procure grain and sugar, and monumental problems with the financial budget. We survived superhyperinflation. The first quarter of this year produced an immediate reaction: Production fell greatly. We just do not have the right to operate in the chaos that occurred in the fourth quarter! Therefore, controlling hyperinflation is the main economic objective. If there is hyperinflation we will not have a state, we will not have anything at all. Everyone's effort should be enlisted in controlling hyperinflation--at the level of each minister and each enterprise manager. As it were, inflation is only advantageous for the rich who have access to currency from emission and pernicious for all others who hold currency and do not know that one day they may suddenly be robbed not by some kind of street muggers but by the state, which has actually already happened many times.... [Ovchar] Viktor Andriyovych, immediately after the proclamation of Ukraine as an independent state, a massive sale of apartments to foreign citizens began in Kiev, and not just in Kiev. A paradoxical situation has developed: Foreigners who two or three years ago bought apartments for $6,000-$8,000 are now selling them for five to six times more. That is, without incurring any outlays they profiteer at the expense of Ukraine, at your expense and mine. What is your view of this situation? Is there a way out of it? [Yushchenko] The National Bank is aware of a technique to overcome this situation. However, it is unfortunate that most measures that should be taken are not the functions of the National Bank. This question may be broadened and expanded to many phenomena in our lives. We very frequently compare the exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets to the rate of the American dollar and say: Isn't the U.S. currency strong! However, there are interesting things that we forget. Let us look at the dollar market while referring to the following comparison. Let us walk along a street in, say, Kiev and a similar street in any U.S. city. There, every square millimeter of the street and each structure contributes to the dollar because everything amounts to merchandise. Downtown is merchandise, the periphery of the city is merchandise. What is the case here? For example, there is a building opposite the National Bank. It has nothing to do with the karbovanets because it is the municipal sector. This sector is not a base for reinforcing the Ukrainian currency. Over the past year, we have changed the approach toward currency in certain areas. However, in the classical interpretation we are still very far from it being the symbol of the national monetary unit. If the stability of currency is not supported by an economic budget (a package of economic reforms), we will never have a stable currency. So far, we have not liberalized prices, not only for apartments, but also rents, electricity rates, and so on. A system of two price lists is in effect. The state assumes a proportion of such outlays through the budget. As a result of this, a contradiction is created in the market. In this case, an apartment in Kiev costs no less than in New York. However, in view of the fact that our market is regulated by the state, that is, the state assists us with financing, the apartment is cheap. On the free market, the same apartment is appraised four times higher. Since our state tampers with the market through subsidies, the market value is distorted. The people who understand market trends take advantage of this. [Ovchar] If I understood you correctly, these people are not to blame? [Yushchenko] Certainly, it is the policy of the state rather than these people that is to blame. For example, why does a rich person in our state receive state subsidies for the square meters of housing, for electricity, for subway fares, and so on, and so forth? We need to liberalize prices. However, some may object: If we liberalize prices for apartments, they would say, 5 million people will have no money to pay for them. So let the state pay these 5 million, but not the rest of those who have an opportunity to pay the real cost of apartments. How will our nation grow rich if everyone receives the same state compensation--those who make 30-40 million per month (there is no concealing it--there are such people) and those who make, say, 500,000 or less per month? [Ovchar] Therefore, do we have an unhealthy social policy? [Yushchenko] Precisely. For this reason, the National Bank champions the poor people. Our position is: Do not reduce social spending by a single karbovanets! However, the issue is how to channel such spending specifically toward the poor, rather than toward all. All states of the world always help the poor, whereas we help everyone without distinction. This is a great shortcoming of social policy that in two generations leads toward us never having a healthy national currency under such conditions. We are used to working with distorted prices. For this reason, there should be a special price policy of the state. I will be more precise. We perceived the management of price policy as the general suppression of real prices. This differential between the real price and the one that is actually in effect here is covered from the budget. At that point, those from the budget organs come to the bank and say: "Print us money because we have to pay for this and that." Printing money in this particular manner means deliberately robbing the people. For this reason, I attach great hopes to the new parliament which, with assistance from us (I mean bankers, financiers, and economists alike) should focus its attention on the social problems of our people.
