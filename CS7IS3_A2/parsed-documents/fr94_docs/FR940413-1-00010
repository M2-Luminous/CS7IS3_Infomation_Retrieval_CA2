FR940413-1-00010 FR940413-1-00004 4. The proposed rulemaking is philosophically consistent with the recommendations concerning audits of programs such as Fitness for Duty included in the NRC Regulatory Review Group Summary and Overview (Final) issued in August 1993. 5. Regulatory Guide 1.33, Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation), prescribes a two-year audit frequency for most operational phase activities commensurate with the activity's operational safety significance. As emergency preparedness programs serve to ensure the proper operation of each facility, so the audits of these programs serve to monitor program effectiveness. The proposed rule is consistent with this previously defined regulatory position and the present safety significance as evidenced by industry performance. 6. Granting the proposed rule to reduce the frequency of audits based on continued good performance is warranted based on the present good performance of industry plans and programs, the documented trend of identifying fewer significant issues associated with emergency preparedness audits, and by virtue of meeting the intent of the regulations in the balance of their requirements. 7. Consideration of relaxing this requirement is warranted in light of the completion and implementation of enhanced emergency equipment and systems, the continuing rise in the level of industry proficiency and performance, and the increased industry sensitivity to emergency preparedness. 8. The existing requirements to conduct annual audits are not of themselves necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of Appendix E to 10 CFR part 50. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an acceptable formal confirmation of program effectiveness. Supporting Information The petitioner states that emergency preparedness programs throughout the industry are designed to achieve and maintain an adequate level of emergency response capability and that required audits are conducted to ascertain the effective implementation of the basic elements existing within emergency preparedness plans and organizations. The petitioner states that the audit process is designed to ensure and confirm the ability to respond properly to an emergency condition. According to the petitioner, the intent of the petition for rulemaking would be to verify that an acceptable level of emergency preparedness is attained and maintained consistent with each approved program. The petitioner states that in addition to the audits, onsite and offsite graded exercises also serve as a direct assessment of program effectiveness. The petitioner notes that this petition for rulemaking complements the petition for rulemaking published on March 4, 1993 (58 FR 12339), concerning modification of the requirement to change the exercise emergency plans from annual to biennial. The petitioner indicates that the audit and exercise can alternate yearly as the formal means to verify program effectiveness and that neither action precludes additional audits if performance trends indicate additional overview is warranted. The petitioner states that because audits indicate to management where additional attention and resources might be needed based on performance trends, excellent performance could also indicate where less attention and resources are required. Therefore, the petitioner believes that based on industry's performance, annual audits of emergency preparedness programs are no longer commensurate with any safety benefit derived by the audit function.
