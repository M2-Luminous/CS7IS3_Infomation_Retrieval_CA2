"The Israeli conditions are to send them to Gaza to finish their sentences," authority member Jamil al-Tarifi told AFP. "During this time they would not be under police custody or in prison they would just have to stay in Gaza." PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat had spurned the offer, al-Tarifi said. "According to the Cairo agreement for autonomy, 5,000 were to be released as a first step with no such conditions" he pointed out. "The prisoners also refuse this option." Al-Tarifi said Israel was prepared to free 2,500 inmates on Thursday provided the PLO agreed to keep them all in Gaza. "As far as we know they will now not be released." 'Arafat had appointed 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who took part in the self-rule negotiations in Egypt, to head a coordinating committee for security which will review the prisoner problem with the Israeli authorities. Al-Yahya arrived in the autonomous enclave of Jericho on Tuesday. About 8,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli jails. Out of the 5,000 due to be released within five weeks of the signing of the May 4 self-rule deal, only 1,700 have so far been set free. Israel has given no reasons for the hold up nor confirmed that it had offered to free 2,500 with the above conditions.
