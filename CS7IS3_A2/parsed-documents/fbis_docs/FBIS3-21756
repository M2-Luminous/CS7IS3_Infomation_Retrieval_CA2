During last year, the bureau busted nine drug rings having international links and arrested 27 traffickers, most of them Sri Lankan Tamils. The syndicates involved local financiers, middlemen, couriers and their counterparts across the sea. The seizures included heroin worth Rs.14.85 crores and opium valued at Rs.2.5 crores (international prices), besides destruction of 26 tonnes of ganja on the Western Ghats. Consequent to the beefing up of security along the West Coast following the serial bomb blasts in Bombay in March last, the drug traffickers have moved towards the East coast, especially south India. Investigation showed that much of the drug trafficking originated in Delhi, Bombay and Madhya Pradesh from where couriers arrived by air in Madras and other cities and moved the contraband, with the help of local contactmen, by bus or other vehicles to selected coastal points for being smuggled into Sri Lanka by boat. A well-knit group of smugglers helped in the job. In the end of 1992 and early part of last year, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence effected some sensational seizures. In October 1992, as much as 252.440 kg of opium, was seized at Tuticorin and Madras and two persons were arrested. The drugs were meant to be shipped to Sri Lanka. In February last year, seven kg of brown sugar and 31 kg of opium were seized near Tuticorin and four persons nabbed. Again in May, 66.100 kg of heroin was seized near Salem and in follow-up searches, 361.00 kg of opium recovered in Pudukottai and Dindigul-Anna district, leading to the arrest of nine persons. The drugs in these cases originated from Madhya Pradesh and were to be sent by sea to Colombo from Tuticorin. The following table shows the seizures made in 1992-93, thanks to the implementation of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act by all enforcement agencies in the four southern States. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name of the drug |Number of cases |Number of persons |Quantity in kg | | | |arrested | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Heroin |83 |111 |40.596 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ganja |3,777 |3,849 |11581.054 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Opium |12 |13 |326.920 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite constraints in terms of manpower and machinery, the bureau has achieved remarkable success in controlling the drug trafficking, depending exclusively on its intelligence and surveillance. But unfortunately, in most of the cases, the Sri Lankan Tamils managed to secure bail, jump it and reach home stealthily with the cooperation of local fishermen, says Mr. P.V.K. Reddy, Deputy Director, NCB (South Zone), Madras. Since 1992, the bureau has neutralised six drug trafficking rings with the arrest of 20 persons, of whom four were detained under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1988. Extradition: During his recent two-day visit to Colombo to attend the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) technical committee meeting on ways to combat drug trafficking, Mr. Reddy held wide ranging discussions with Sri Lankan Police and Narcotic Bureau officials including on the need for extraditing Sri Lankan Tamils who escaped into the island after being let on bail in Tamil Nadu. He said the 1988 United Nations Convention on drugs empowered countries to extradite drug offenders. It appeared the Sri Lankan authorities were unaware of the fact that narcotic drugs were periodically smuggled to European countries from Colombo. According to one source, drugs are smuggled in crates transporting the island's traditional exports like tea, rubber and coconut husk. Another modus operandi was to transport narcotic drugs in fishing boats and then load them mid-sea in ships bound for European destinations. The origin of the drug trafficking could be traced to the massive influx of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees into Tamil Nadu following the ethnic turmoil that erupted in the early 80s. Some of them, having found their economic roots totally cut off, saw an easy means of sustaining themselves by drug trafficking with the help of many relatives who had found refuge in West European countries.
