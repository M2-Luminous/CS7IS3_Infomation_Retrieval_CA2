Representatives of Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) have been invited to attend the opening and closing ceremonies plus a banquet held during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting. The invitation has prompted international condemnation of Thailand's role as host country. Deputy Permanent Secretary for the Interior Chaloem Phromloet said yesterday he trusted Ratchaburi Governor Kamlunthep Thewakun would know what steps to take to prevent possible problems caused by Burmese students from the centre joining the protest. "He knows well how to deal with this type of incident since he was with the ministry's internal security section before becoming a provincial governor," said Mr Chaloem. He said any protesters who try to disrupt the meeting would be dealt with sternly by police. M.R. Kamlunthep said: "If I forbid the Burmese students from leaving Ban Maniloi, I will be accused of violating their human rights. Yet somehow I will have to come up with a solution." He said he would hold talks with Mr Chaloem on the possibility of the Burmese students staging a protest. "The students at the centre have lately had problems with villagers in the neighbourhood," he said referring to troubles in the last month. "Even if these students are refugees in our country, that cannot be used as an excuse not to abide by the law. "Any person who violates the law in this country will have to face the legal consequences." The Interior Ministry's Information and Foreign Affairs Division director, Praphakon Samiti, said any Ban Maniloi students joining a protest which disrupts the ASEAN meeting will be arrested and detained at a centre in Bang Khen. They will lose their refugee status and will simply be regarded as illegal immigrants and dealt with as such by the police, he said. "Present media reports indicate the students from the centre are not part of the group planning a protest," he said. But Mr Praphakon said there were efforts by certain Burmese dissidents to encourage the students to join them in the protest. "The students at the centre know they will go to jail and will not be allowed to return to Ban Maniloi if they join the protest." He said he did not understand why anyone wanted to protest SLORC's presence at the meeting since their participation was only ceremonial.
