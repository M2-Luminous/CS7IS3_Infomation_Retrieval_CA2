The influential Iranian politician Mohamad Javad [Larijani] today referred to the right of the religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i to grant a pardon. [passage omitted] Speaking to journalists this evening, Larijani said a pardon is part of Iranian law. The procedure prescribes a detailed examination of the case. Should Khamene'i use his right to grant a pardon in the Szimkus case, this would happen in three to four months at the earliest. The Iranian politician stressed that he did not bring up the so-called "Mykonos trial" in Berlin. [passage omitted] Larijani expressed his hope that, despite the difficulties, German-Iranian relations will continue to develop in a positive way and that a solution can be found for Iran's current problems in meeting its financial obligations. The German refusal to resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station on the Persian Gulf, which was suspended 14 years ago, is a "very negative point," he said. The politician also warned against further "politicizing" the death sentence (`Fatwa') Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, the deceased leader of the revolution, issued against the writer Salman Rushdie. Rushdie has offended millions of Muslims with his book The Satanic Verses. "The more the case of Rushdie is politicized, the more it will stir the emotions of the Muslims," he said. The politician also criticized the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, saying it is neither fair nor feasible. He said a large majority of Palestinians reject the Gaza-Jericho agreement.
