At a news conference Rugova described as "a provocation" the statement by the head of Kosovo district Milos Simovic that the authorities should ban the DSK for failing to register. He warned that this could be "a dangerous move" and that such a decision "would not be taken lightly by the international democratic public." Rugova claims that his party was registered in the former SFRY, that it was in possession of valid registration documents, and stressed that it would continue its work even if banned.
