A Market Is a Market"] [Text] According to the latest data from the weekly monitoring of prices by state statistics organs, the overall inflation index for the past week stood at 102.2 percent, and at 160 percent for the period since the beginning of the year. Prices of food products rose by 1.9 percent, and prices of other products by 2.3 percent; the price of paid public services rose by 3.8 percent. The largest price increases for basic consumer goods and paid services -- 5.7 percent -- were recorded in the Ural region, where the largest increases in Russia were recorded for nonfood goods -- 6 percent -- and paid services: 36 percent. At the beginning of May the prices of basic food products were 1.1 percent up on the end of April in organized trade and 5.4 percent up in nonorganized trade. The largest increases were for products sold in the city markets, where fruit prices increased by 10.8 percent in the week, prices of groats and pasta by 7.6 percent, vegetable prices by 5.6 percent, and prices of meat products by 5.1 percent. In all regions prices during the holidays and the days leading up to them rose most of all for meat products -- by 4-6 percent -- and also fruit and vegetables -- by 4-14 percent, mainly as a result of increases in the city and informal markets. Only prices of vegetable oil and vodka remained unchanged, in both the stores and the markets. The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important products on 4 May was 48,500 rubles [R], a 60-percent increase in the period since the beginning of the year. The cost of this basket at organized trade prices was R46,500, and at market prices R59,700. The lowest cost of the basket was again recorded in the Volga region -- R38,200. The "dearest" region for the cost of the basket remains the Far East region -- R83,000. Among the list of nonfood goods, fuel prices continued to increase at an accelerated rate -- more than 10 percent in the course of the week. Among other goods the most notable price increases were for nitroglycerine (4.5 percent), wallpaper once again (3.7 percent), and matches (3.2 percent). Prices of tobacco products were virtually unchanged. The largest price increases were in the Ural region -- 6 percent. This change in the average prices in the region over the week was the result of increases of more than 10 percent on fuel, and also children's clothing and footwear. There remains a significant gap between the minimum and the maximum prices of identical goods in different Russian cities. Thus during the whole of April and at the beginning of May the difference in prices of analgin [type of painkiller] was 1,200 percent and of cotton fabrics around 500 percent. Our Commentary Readers are anxious to know what products make up the basket of 19 goods. Obviously this is no idle question; it is prompted by a desire to know what average prices the analysis is based upon, and whether the basket corresponds to people's real needs. We publish the list of average prices for 4 May. The prices, as you can see, are very close to the real ones. In Moscow (which is the 34th most expensive city), at least, prices of some products -- particularly granulated sugar (R560-R580), eggs (R650-R1,000), and raw materials (from R4,800) -- were even a little lower. As for the nutritional norm, let us once again stipulate: This list, in the form in which it is published, can in no way be considered a biological norm recommended by medics. This indicator is taken by economists in order to trace the change in the inflation level in the country. And although it initially contains a sensible starting point for the nutrition of a healthy male, nevertheless, you won't be able to determine whether the state statisticians' approaches to assessing our economic situation are right just by the simple addition of the figures. This is demonstrated by the round figures for weight: It appears that in the course of a month an adult consumes a total of exactly one kilogram, and smokes one packet of filter cigarettes. This is nonsense. So here is the list -- but do not be hasty with your conclusions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.
