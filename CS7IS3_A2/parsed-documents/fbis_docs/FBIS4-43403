The meeting is considered decisive in light of the negotiations and decisions that will be made at UN headquarters on the future course of the Cyprus issue. Last night, the foreign minister met in Washington with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. In a statement, Mikhailidhis said the timing of his visit is most appropriate because it has been ascertained that the U.S. State Department is considering the next step in the Cyprus issue. He added that the United States would definitely want an agreement on the confidence-building measures; its firm position is to try to achieve something practical in the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis said the Cypriot Government fully agrees with the UN secretary general's evaluation that the Turkish side lacks political will and that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' moves are merely for show. U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said the issue that is being raised now regarding the confidence-building measures is whether the views of the two sides in Cyprus can be incorporated within the framework of UN efforts to reach a general settlement of the issue. He said that many sides have dealt with this issue as an urgent and decisive issue, and that the UN Security Council is now searching for ways to proceed. Replying to questions on visits to Washington by Mikhailidhis and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher, McCurry noted that the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the UN proposals on the confidence-building measures made in March, while the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted the June variation.
