Here is an excerpt from that interview, which caused consternation in Chisinau and not just there: [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in Russian with superimposed Romanian translation] Send us your request immediately to join the ruble zone and that is it! You will have Russian currency, all your payments will be made in rubles, and you will not have any more problems. That is the sole solution. You are a part of Russia, even if, for the time being, Moldova does not want to become a part of Russia. I promise I will do it! We will incorporate you within Russia on all planes, including the diplomatic, military, financial, and economic aspects. I wish you courage and manliness. I understand your situation. You are encircled by Moldova and Ukraine. Yours is the most difficult situation in the whole of Russia. Look, the Russians in Lithuania have Leningrad to support them. However, there is no one standing beside you. You represent the most heroic part of Russia! I will do everything I can. I will make all necessary efforts for you to return to Russia, and we will compensate all your losses. Of course, we cannot compensate your losses in human lives, but we will compensate them by severely punishing all those who are guilty for the crimes perpetrated on the soil of the Dniester Republic. We will not lie to you and we will not betray you! Never, ever! The Dniester Republic shall be a part of Russia! [end recording] In connection with the aforementioned allegations, which justify the requests of Zhirinovskiy's many compatriots to begin penal investigations against him or send him to a mental hospital, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Moldova has issued the following press communique: The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova today sent a note to the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Chisinau in connection with the interview granted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to Tiraspol television, which was broadcast on 18 January 1994, in which the deputy to the Russian Duma formulated territorial claims against the Republic of Moldova, saying, among other things, that the Dniester Republic should be included in Russia and that the [14th] Army will stay there. The Foreign Affairs Ministry considers such statements made by a representative of Russia's law-making body as irresponsible and consequently as an attempt made against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Such statements prejudice Moldovan-Russian relations, create tension among the public opinion, and might negatively influence the talks on the political settlement of the conflict in the eastern rayons [of Moldova] and the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova. The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova resolutely protests and requests that adequate steps be taken to express the clear distancing of the competent bodies of the Russian Federation from the stance and statements made by Zhirinovskiy, concludes the press communique released by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Moldova.
