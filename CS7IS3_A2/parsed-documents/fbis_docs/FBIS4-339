Well, there are approximately 20 days left before the election and the time is drawing near for people to understand more about the policies of the various political parties. Approximately a month ago, we began a series of debates between various political parties involved in the election. Tonight we have the National Party [NP] and the Freedom Front, and it is the first time they are facing each other because the Freedom Front was of course one of the last parties to register for the election. To represent these parties tonight, we have Mr. Andries Beyers of the NP, on my right, and on my left Dr. Corne Mulder of the Freedom Front. Before beginning tonight we tossed a coin to determine who would open tonight's debate and it was decided that Dr. Corne Mulder would receive one minute to state his views, thereafter Mr. Beyers, and at the end of the program we will follow the same order. Well, Dr. Mulder, you have one minute. [Mulder] Thank you, Mr. Robinson. On 27 April, in all probability, the election will take place. Now compared to other elections in the recent past in southern Africa and South-West Africa, Angola, and Rhodesia, we have here a different situation in this specific election. We have succeeded, through negotiations, to what I call, force open an ethnic door in the interim constitution -- to force open a door for ethnicity, for political parties to follow their ideals, and this is contained in Article 34 of the interim constitution which refers to the issue of self-determination. Now Article 34 makes specific provision for a community to demand any form of self-determination, for this to be made possible in the interim constitution. Provision can be made for this if there is proven support. For this reason the Freedom Front is taking part in the elections, to open this door of ethnicity, and to use the opportunity to prove maximum support, real support, for the Freedom Front's idea of self-determination for the Afrikaner nation. This is what we are doing at present. [Robinson] Thank you, Dr. Mulder. That was 1 minute and 15 seconds. We now give Mr. Beyers of the NP a chance. [Beyers] I think I want to immediately second Dr. Mulder's statements and say that the Freedom Front's decision to participate in the election is a step in the right direction for Gen. Viljoen and his people, as far as the National Party is concerned. They are taking part in a one man one vote election within an undivided South Africa. They are taking part in a constitution negotiated by the National Party, to which they have also contributed, and this is exactly what the National Party plans, namely, to bring about a constitution making it possible for parties to participate. I say that it is good for South Africa that they do participate in the election. Their decision to enter into the election lends legitimacy and credibility to the new constitution, and they are doing what I said last year in Parliament, that they and of course every other CP [Conservative Party] member will have to do and this is, in reality, to follow the leadership of State President F.W. de Klerk, right into the new South Africa. Tonight I want to tell Dr. Mulder and his people: Welcome. It is good that you are here. When South Africa is democratized then we can begin to seek solutions to our problems and we will find it. [Robinson] Well, we will have to look at some of those solutions and I would like to hear what the real policy differences are between the two parties. Dr. Mulder? [Mulder] There are far-reaching policy differences, Freek, and there are several important differences, but before I touch on these I want to react to statements made by Mr. Beyers, that he is so brave [as heard] and happy that we have accepted President de Klerk's leadership. That is not correct. We in the Freedom Front can think for ourselves. We evaluate political developments and we take the necessary steps to achieve our ideals. We do not accept the interim constitution. From the beginning we have said that the constitution is full of defects. The amendments we have succeeded in forcing through at the end of February, beginning of March, brought about certain improvements in the constitution, concerning self-determination, the establishment of a homeland council, etc., but in reality there are practical problems with the constitution. We reject it. The fact that one uses the opportunity to prove real support for the principle of self-determination can not be seen as lending legitimacy to this constitution. A constitution's legitimacy does not depend on whether people are voting or not voting. At the end of the day, it will depend on whether this thing can stand the test of time. We say it will not be able to do this, but we can use the process to achieve our ideals. [Robinson] So you accept the process and you are using the process to arrive at a point where you can effect more changes? [Mulder] Certainly, we say that the constitution is defective. As part of the Freedom Alliance we have always pressed for several changes and improvements to the constitution. We pressed for amendments which were later written into the constitution. We will come back to those later -- after the NP was totally satisfied with the constitution, even though it was full of defects at that stage. Now concerning basic differences, I want to say the following: The Freedom Front is demanding self-determination -- self-determination as an internationally recognized principle. [Robinson] Do you regard that as a difference, self- determination? [Mulder] Absolutely, a real difference. [Robinson] Now let us stop right there for a while. Mr. Beyers, does the NP accept the principle of self-determination of not? [Beyers] Well, the National Party went as far as writing it into the constitution, after negotiations, that there could be forms of self-determination. Indeed, there are meaningful forms of self- determination built into the present constitution. You see the problem thus far with the homeland -- and this is the self- determination proposed by the Freedom Front and it is their right to do so -- the problem with this is that the proponents of this did not have a plan on the table with which they could agree, even in their own ranks. The National Front of Gen. Viljoen, last year, and he was the co-leader of this, could not put a plan on the table with which the main members of the Front, that is the CP and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], could agree. Indeed, the CP could not produce a plan with which their own caucus members could agree. When negotiations took place they demanded a homeland before 27 April or they would wage war, according to Gen. Viljoen and Dr. Hartzenberg, and President de Klerk said: Let's negotiate. Eventually President de Klerk wrote into the constitution exactly what they asked for, namely, a people's council, and a clause according to which further negotiations would be possible, concerning self-determination. Can I just conclude by saying that State President de Klerk did his best to accommodate them even though they could not agree amongst themselves. Then he said: Since you yourselves can't find a solution let me make this possible by amending the constitution, to make it possible for you to also amend the constitution after the election to make provision for self-determination. With this step Gen. Viljoen took the gap, participated and this was the right thing to do, and this is the success President de Klerk achieved. [Freek] The specific question I wanted to ask you, Mr. Beyers, is whether the NP, and you as a person, accept the principle of self-determination regardless of what form it takes in the constitution? [Beyers] Yes, unconditionally, provided that it can be practically achieved. It must be so formulated that it does not disadvantage other people. When self-determination is formulated in such a manner that it is not discriminatory toward other peoples and toward other communities, then the NP is inclined to accommodate it and, indeed, to press for it being written into a future constitution and also the final constitution. [Robinson] What form would self-determination take in the state which the NP proposes? [Beyers] The NP says there are various forms of self- determination. The only practical manner in which to negotiate it is to give people the opportunity to organize themselves into political parties and power groups, people with the same values. They must then be able to negotiate within an open democracy. We do not think it is practically possible to divide the country into a confederation, a confederation of independent states. The different regions and communities have too much in common, and therefore we stand for a federal system, and we have tried to include in the constitution as many federal features as possible. [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Beyers. Let's take it a step further, Dr. Mulder. Self-determination. We accept that there are differences regarding self-determination. From what I see in your documents, you believe in a confederal system. That means that eventually you want to exercise your self-determination outside a unitary state -- an own homeland. [Mulder] We have from the beginning said that we want true self-determination and all that it implies. I believe we must dwell on this idea of self-determination for a few minutes, because to a certain degree it forms the basis of our goal. It is not correct to say, as Mr. Beyers did, that the state president wrote self-determination into the constitution. The South African Parliament wrote it in. The fact is that this came about after the negotiation process in which the Freedom Alliance together with other parties included in the Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] had negotiated it and insisted that such a principle must be included. With all due respect to my colleague, I should have expected that the NP would claim to be the great patron which provided for self-determination in the constitution. That is not correct. The whole issue was negotiated. The NP was quite satisfied with the constitution as it stood, without the principle of self-determination. In December they moved it through Parliament and voted for it as it was. [Robinson] The way I understand it, Dr. Mulder, according to what Mr. Beyers has said, the NP stands for self-determination within a unitary state, self-determination taking place through organizers of cultural groups, while your party stands for self- determination outside such a unitary state. So the way I understand it, they do not reject self-determination, they merely interpret it differently. [Mulder] The self-determination for which the NP stands is contained in Principle 12 of the constitution. That is what I call the Saturday night option, which says you can promote social values on Saturday nights in your barn, listening to music, and so on. That's not true self-determination. We talk about true self-determination, internationally recognized, and which makes it possible for a nation, a community, to make its own decisions and govern itself. It's got nothing.... [Robinson] But then it must be in an own state. [Mulder] It must be part of a geographical dispensation, based on an own state. [Robinson] An own state, an independent state? [Mulder] We say we want a system for southern Africa which will bring stability. We believe it is possible, if you can have a system which provides for the maximum political independence but taking into account the realities of economic interdependence. The problem is not that self-determination has failed up to now because there was no plan. Mr. Beyers, when he was in the Afrikaner Volksunie [National Union], had a plan for self-determination. They had maps, everything, but it was not acceptable. So the problem was not whether or not one had a plan, it was the position of the South African Government and the ANC who continually pressed for a unitary state, which we maintain is not a federation. [Robinson] Would you say that self-determination in your interpretation is only possible if it takes place in a geographical state, separate from the rest of South Africa? [Mulder] No. There are various forms of self-determination. We believe that part of the solution for South Africa must include self-determination for those communities which choose it, linked to a geographical basis which we call a homeland. But there are also other forms of self-determination, in which one can, for example, attend to the interests of certain communities through community councils. We are not opposed to that, we say it is part of the solution. But if you cannot accommodate self-determination on that basis you will not find a solution. [Beyers] Freek, I would just like to correct Dr. Mulder on the inclusion of the writing of the principles into the constitution -- the last of them were written in during March, including the principle of he homeland council. Of course, this came about through negotiation. But when the vote was taken in Parliament, Dr. Corne Mulder's party, the CP, voted against it. Only the NP voted for it. In other words, it was not forced through, While they were opposing it, the NP made it part of the constitution. The NP voted for it. But let's not get technical. Let's look at the forms of self-determination as proposed by the Freedom Front. I think we must determine the truth. The Freedom Front has announced a new policy. They say their policy is exactly the same as that of the CP; that the only difference is that they are participating in the election while the CP is not. What we would like to know from Dr. Mulder is: Where is this homeland, and whether other people living there will have rights -- voting rights. If these issues can be sorted out, one can begin to negotiate the implementation of the homeland. I know the CP's position. These people say they share the CP's position. Can Dr. Mulder then tell us whether it is the Freedom Front's policy that colored and black people will not have the vote in their future homeland? It is very important to resolve this issue so we can know what their policy is. [Robinson] Could I just add, meanwhile, before we have a break. Mr. Beyers, last week I asked General Constand Viljoen the same question during an interview. He responded to the first question by saying the Freedom Front will go along with what Mr. Hartzenberg announced as a starting point in negotiations. So it seems as though we are going to debate the entire evening about CP.... [Mulder, interrupting] But about the right to vote... [Robinson, interrupting] I would like to [pauses]. I have noted here in my diary. I would like to give content to policy trends within regions, albeit a volkstaat or a new South Africa. As I have been made to understand, Dr. Mulder's National Front will participate in the election so that it can be determined where the volkstaat is going to be, so you have the chance to talk about borders before we go any further. [Mulder] I want to just respond briefly to Mr. Beyers's question. If the National Party had cooperated in the negotiation process, we could have resolved the details of a volkstaat a long time ago. We wanted to have this done before 27 April -- and this fact is already well known. However, there were a few practical problems. The first one was that the ANC had always questioned whether the National Front had substantial support for the idea; and the second point -- one Mr. Beyers harps on -- where was the geographic region? Regarding the support, we had a problem with that. We said we wanted the matter settled before 27 April, so that that date would not only be the day of liberation for others only, but for our people as well. [Robinson] Good. Now you are going to participate, and you are going to prove that? [Mulder] We are going to take part, and we are using the opportunity to prove that, because the practical problem had been: Even though the ANC had agreed that such a referendum could take place before 27 April, it had been the National Party which had been the obstacle. And I say it was malicious; it had not been in South Africa's interest; not in the interest of the Afrikaner and that of the whites; only in the interest of the National Party. The NP deliberately blocked it. [Robinson] That political point has been made several times already, including by yourself. [Mulder] You are right, but the problem is so large that the people out there should know about it. The fact is, if we talk about the geographic region, then we negotiated by saying that we do not only want to use the opportunity to prove maximum support for the idea of a volkstaat and self-determination. We also want to utilize the opportunity to determine the region where our people physically find themselves -- the people striving for this ideal. And therefore provision has to be made so that votes come in for the Freedom Front for the sake of this ideal, so that votes can be counted from every polling booth, so that after the election our people will know where they stand. Now to get to the specific point.... [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Mulder, allow me to ask. Granted that homeland -- no matter where it is, how it is constituted, or whatever -- it is there, whether it is part of southern Africa, South Africa, federation or whatever, but that state is there. What will go on inside that state. What policies are you going to pursue? [Mulder] The perception has been created that such a state will be for semi-retarded people and therefore it is going to be in a backward place and so on. Not at all. It is going to be a modern state like any other state in the world, one that will implement modern guidelines, normal world tendencies. So if you talk about.... [Robinson interrupting] May I quickly ask you? I have with me here a booklet with all the constitutional policies of the various parties. And there is a whole series of different issues. I have also gone through your policies, and I must say with due respect, Dr. Mulder, within your policy principles, except the principle of self-determination and a homeland, you say very little -- if anything -- about what you want to do inside that state. What is, for example, your tax policy? What is your housing policy? What is your health policy? What is your education policy? What is your policy regarding voting rights? [Mulder] We would have liked all those details to have been finalized. It was not possible. Now we have brought about a constitutional structure -- the Volkstaat [homeland] Council. The Volkstaat Council will comprise -- after the election -- 20 members, with the exclusive purpose of analyzing all the relevant detail about a volkstaat, to negotiate and bring the matter to finality. Among others, legislative and executive structures, the relationship of the volkstaat at provincial and national levels, the boundaries, all those things. [Robinson] May I ask you, Dr. Mulder, do you accept democratic principles to be entrenched, the fact that there has to be voting rights -- freedom to the right to vote? And what about those who do not support the volkstaat? [Beyers] For blacks as well? [Mulder] Give me a chance to just complete my answer. Mr. Beyers is so.... [Beyers, interrupting] I just want to know, it is important.... [Mulder] Mr. Beyers, you have one little point which you consider a good point. If you just give me the chance to respond then you will have a peaceful sleep tonight. [Robinson] Please carry on. [Mulder] It concerns this matter about the right to vote. Of course, each person must have the right to vote, but we differ in principle from the National Party. We say it is not democracy to draw arbitrary boundaries like is currently being done in South Africa -- to dump all communities together under one voters' list and then to say vote now, this is democracy. That is in no way democracy. We differ on that. [Robinson] Within your state, will there be any blacks? [Mulder] There will be blacks, there will be all types of people. [Robinson] Are they going to vote? [Mulder] Let me answer. It is not about blacks or non-blacks. It will depend on who is a citizen of that state, and who is not a citizen. [Robinson] But will blacks be able to become citizens? [Mulder] That will depend on the rules that will apply in that state. I just don't want to create a state, I want to create a state for Afrikaners. And as soon as you bring me a snow white Zulu, then I will give you a black Afrikaner. It is not about being white.... [Robinson, laughing] But aren't you being racist? You are using the terminology.... [Mulder] No, no, no. You are asking me about black people -- that is a racist statement. All that I'm saying is that we are in a dilemma because the Afrikaner is incidentally -- regarding race -- white. That is not the only characteristic, there are others as well. All I'm saying is.... [Robinson, interrupting] Let's put it differently and say non-Afrikaners, or those who do not identify with the Afrikaner. Will they be able to become citizens, and will they be able to vote? [Mulder] No, it will depend on certain things. They will be treated on the same basis as any other noncitizen is being treated in South Africa or in any other state in the world. In other words, normal rights, human rights, all those things will apply.... [Robinson] In other words the right of access to any place, right to property? [Mulder] Of course, but a person who is not a citizen of a state cannot lay claims on the right to vote in that state. [Robinson] So that is the only disqualification? [Mulder] Of course, it is determined on the basis of citizenship, not otherwise. In other words, the illusion is created that it is purely about race. It is not about that. It is about citizenship. [Beyers] Could I just respond? You gave Mr. Mulder about 20 minutes to talk uninterrupted. [Robinson] Go ahead. [Beyers] You see, that is the problem -- namely that Dr. Mulder has formed a party. He is asking people to vote for them. But after his explanation here tonight, or attempt at doing so, nobody knows what they will be voting for if they vote for the Freedom Front. He cannot say, the simple question on [changes thought]. Nobody knows this evening after Dr. Mulder's talk whether there will be a right to vote for all in their volkstaat -- yes or no. Nobody knows where the volkstaat is going to be for which they are supposed to vote. [Robinson] That has already been mentioned. [Beyers] The point is this: If you vote for the Freedom Front in this election, then you are voting for a secret. You don't know what you are voting for; and this is the problem we had, that the right-wing people -- and I was part of it -- up to this evening, could not agree on a plan for a volkstaat. They could not agree; and therefore it is a big problem to convince other people who are against a volkstaat, to convince them to agree to a volkstaat. I am saying tonight if people are living in the illusion that somewhere in the world you will get a situation that is tolerated where people, on the basis of their race or on the basis of their language or whatever, will be excluded from the right to vote in the country, region, town, city where they live -- then such people are living in a total illusion. There is no such thing. But tonight Dr. Mulder has unequivocally said that regarding these important things for a volkstaat -- they are only still going to negotiate them. Whether blacks are going to have the right to vote in that volkstaat -- they are still going to negotiate about that in the Volkstaat Council. He does not even mention what their standpoint is going to be in those negotiations. The point is, if you vote for the Freedom Front in this election you don't know what you are voting for. You will be voting for a secret. [Robinson] Hang on, Mr. Beyers, you are giving a good summary, and I'm sure Mr. Mulder also appreciates the fact that his policy is being stated twice, even though under criticism. Now we get to your views -- those of the National Party. I would imagine -- and I've heard it before -- right or wrong -- that Afrikaners are saying that the National Party is not telling them what is going to happen to them. What guarantees are there for the Afrikaner -- if you say they must not vote for the Freedom Front -- inside the state which the National Party is going to offer them? [Beyers] The National Party and the state president realized in time -- before I even realized it -- that the policy of apartheid could not continue; that it did not bring protection for Afrikaners and my people. It does not bring protection for my children. An alternate plan had to be made. And this plan was that South Africa had to be democratized; that racism had to be part of the past. The state president had the leadership and the courage to carry through an unpopular decision in this regard, thereby leading his party and the Afrikaner on a new road to full democracy. Now we are saying that the best protection that there can be for Afrikaners -- and for all the people in South Africa -- is that all people with the same values, Christian values, values such as a free economy, private initiative; all those people who share the same values -- and there are thousands of them. Almost all the Afrikaners have those values, all the whites have those values, the great majority of coloreds, of Indians. A great number of blacks in South Africa have those same values which the National Party and Afrikaners have. And the state president has launched the initiative. He opened up his party to them. He put those people together in a power bloc. [Robinson] What is the guarantee? [Beyers] The guarantee is that -- and this is important to the Afrikaner -- those values that he shares with those people should triumph in a future dispensation. And if you gather those people in one powerful force, as the National Party is succeeding in doing, then that is the best protection which you can offer them. And in that case you are negotiating a constitutional dispensation in which those guarantees are protected through checks and balances, through a bill of fundamental rights, through constitutional measures such as a constitutional court and so on. And I say... [Mulder] And cultural values? [Beyers] The same applies to cultural values. It is the National Party which has entrenched this in the Bill of Human Rights; and the National Party is the agent of every minority group and the next government of national unity -- in which we will be presented strongly -- to see to it that the conditions of that Bill of Human Rights do support every minority group, of which the National Party is part. We say that is the only way. There is no other. [Robinson] And if the ANC gets more than 66 percent in the election? [Beyers] We will stop the ANC from getting more than 66 percent; but disregarding that, the National Party negotiated so that the 34 constitutional principles are never changed; that they should not be changed through any majority. And we in the National Party in no way believe that the ANC will get a two thirds majority, but people must not be divided. They have to stand together, and the only party to stop the ANC from getting a two thirds majority is in fact the National Party. That is why in the election people must not go and vote for small parties such as the Freedom Front, the Democratic Party, and the other insignificant parties. The only effective vote to stop the ANC, to curb the ANC, is a vote for the National Party. President de Klerk has the courage, the leadership, the vision. He is a strong man, he knows what he is doing, and he will protect our people's interests in the new South Africa with the aid of a strong National Party. [Mulder] That is commendable. Freek, I want to react to that if you don't mind. I am somewhat surprised. The National Party appears to be....[pauses] Mr. Beyers is saying the only way to stop the ANC is to vote for this big powerful National Party. I'm puzzled. Two years ago, Mr. Beyers stated in his manifesto when he won the Potchefstroom by-election that the National Party -- and it was not the old National Party but the new one with Mr. de Klerk at the head and the ANC unbanned. What did Mr. Beyers say in his manifesto? Tonight he is saying there is only one way -- we must vote for the NP. What did he say in his manifesto? He said there is only one way to stop the ANC from stealing our land -- get rid of the National Party government which is helping the ANC to establish a black majority government in South Africa. He said get rid of the National Party government, it's the biggest danger. Now he says this evening that the National Party is the party to stop the communists. Now I'm puzzled. The National Party, when communism was unbanned, Mr. de Klerk said -- and I think I must read it to you: The year 1989 will be known in history as the year in which communism died. The wave of violence came to en end when communism was unbanned. And now? Now he calls a press conference to warn South Africa about the enormous number of communists on the ANC's candidates' list. I'm puzzled. Has communism come to life again? Or was the National Party talking nonsense? [Robinson] There are two questions which you asked. The first one is a little below the belt -- hitting at your own conscience, Mr. Beyers. You will have to bear the pain, and the second is about communism. [Beyers] Alright, I'll bear the pain. I have changed my political views. I think Mr. Mulder has also changed his political views. [Mulder] Not at all, not at all. Same policy, same policy. [Beyers] Let me finish talking. When I left the Conservative Party, he and others said that when I started negotiating with the ANC I was a traitor, and three months thereafter he and Dr. Hartzenberg and others were negotiating with the ANC, and they were not traitors then. I don't think that's the point. I have altered my standpoint in politics for a better view. And that is true. I really believe that what the National Party is doing now is in the best interest of my people; because apartheid and a volkstaat and separate development we have tried, and they brought no protection to my people; and President de Klerk had the leadership to look people in the eye and say let's embark on another path, and he embarked on that path, and to me that seems to be the best path to tread. I therefore have no doubts that people will be wasting votes on other parties. [Robinson] The question of communism? [Beyers] Regarding the communists, up to now the CP and Dr. Mulder have been saying to ban the communists, put them back in jail. But they negotiate with Mr. Mandela and they negotiate with Mr. Joe Slovo. Did they, while negotiating with Mr. Mandela and Joe Slovo say, look, it is our policy -- you must go back to jail and your organization must be banned. The National Party maintained that to fight communism effectively you cannot lock it up in jails. You must level the playing fields, you must democratize the country, and then you tackle it on the political playing field. And that is what the National Party is doing. And the National Party has been right as far as that is concerned. Now it is effective, it can fight communism because it differs marginally with communism regarding economic policies and so on. [Robinson] Both of you, our time is nearly up. Now I give you each a minute's chance to tackle each other. [Mulder] You mean a minute to conclude? [Robinson] Yes. [Mulder] Thank you. I say that every voter out there who again trusts the National Party is doing it at his own risk. The voters out there should by now have learned that the National Party cannot be trusted -- we have seen the referendum promises, we have seen election promises -- there was nothing for our people in it. Secondly, the National Party has all along been in alliance with the ANC during the entire negotiation process. I asked the president to name one example where the National Party came out in favor of Inkatha during the negotiations and he could not name one because there is none. That is why it is easy to play down smaller parties. The result will show who the small parties are. If you want to vote against the ANC -- and you must vote against the ANC as it is dangerous -- if you want to vote against it, you don't have to vote for the National Party for that purpose. The National Party cannot be trusted any more; that is why you can trust the Freedom Front. It is the only party which has fought for self- determination, which will look after minorities. You can trust General Viljoen, and if you do that, there will be a secure future for you. [Robinson] Thank you very much, Mr. Beyers? [Beyers] Freek, one thing is very clear this evening, and that is if you vote for the Freedom Front you don't know what you are voting for. You are voting for a secret. I say vote for the National Party because the National Party is ready to be the advocate of all peace-loving, moderate South Africans in the next government of national unity. The National Party is ready to implement its expertise in administration for the benefit of all the country's citizens. The National Party is prepared to allow the validity of our policy of private initiative to triumph over communism and over policies such as nationalization. The National Party is braced for the pressure which will come come from the free world, and also from the private sector, demanding a free market economy. The National Party is in gear to accompany the new government of national unity to accept a security strategy through which South Africa will be protected. The National Party is ready and able to protect the rights of minority groups, to implement the Bill of Rights for the protection of our people. The National Party is the only party strong enough to curb the ANC. [Robinson] Thank you very much. All the best.
