In the field of agricultural production, the total grain output hit 2.03 million tonnes, breaching the 2 million-tonne line for the first time, up 11 percent on the previous year. The total output of oil-bearing crops was 63,000 tonnes, up 1.4 percent on the previous year. The total output of sugar-yielding crops was 480,000 tonnes, 30,000 tonnes more than the previous year. The total output of aquatic products was 15,000 tonnes, up 12.5 percent over the previous year. Both the cultivated area for and the output of vegetables and other cash crops increased by a wide margin. The numbers of butchered pigs, cows, and chickens climbed, and total meat production was greater than inthe previous year. The task of afforestation was overfulfilled, and there was a bumper fruit harvest. Gross agricultural output value stood at 3.187 billion yuan, up 6.7 percent over the previous year in terms of comparable items. Township enterprises gained a robust momentum of growth, with 1993 gross output value likely to reach 2.9 billion yuan, up 36 percent over the previous year. Individually owned and privately owned enterprises grew rapidly, with their workers accounting for 61.4 percent of the total number of workers employed by township enterprises, and their output value accounting for 50 percent of the total output value of township enterprises, so they have become the mainstay of this region's township enterprises. In 1993, the peasants' per capita net income was 667.04 yuan, an increase of 7.8 percent compared with the previous year. The year 1993 was a difficult one for the rural economy, and also a year in which party committees and governments at all levels strengthened agriculture and made earnest efforts. To boost agricultural production and increase the peasants' income, the autonomous regional government set up a leading group for rural work to coordinate and strengthen the comprehensive study of rural work. Departments concerned at all levels conscientiously served agricultural production and discontinued unreasonable charges, with the result that the peasants' burden decreased by 6.2 percent acorss the region as compared with the previous year. Large numbers of cadres at the basic level energetically helped peasants explore ways to prosperity and solve problems arising in the course of agricultural production in every possible way so as to promote rural economic development. The year 1993 was one in which the market mechanism was strengthened. Most agricultural products were open to market forces, control over the marketing of grain was entirely lifted, and market building was accelerated so that the economic vitality increased noticeably. The region made new progress in developing a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields. First, the structure of the growing industry was adjusted at a greater pace according to market needs, and the mix of crops, of varieties, and of growing techniques also was improved. The area sown to barley -- which is used for brewing beer -- and to beans increased 71 and 43 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The area sown to perilla seed, vegetables, asparagus, and artificially cultivated licorice root also was expanded. A total of 169,000 mu of one-tonne-yield-per-mu fields, as well as 22,000 mu of "twin-thousand [shuang qian 7175 0578] fields" were built across the region. The greenhouse area increased to 6,179 mu, with the maximum per-mu value coming to 20,000 yuan. Second, various stereoscopic compound growing models [li ti fu he zhong zhi mo shi 4539 7555 1788 0678 4429 2784 2875 1709] were spread and became important means of increasing production and income. The stereoscopic compound area sown to grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar-yielding crops, and vegetables -- including the area for interplanting wheat with corn -- was to the tune of 2.758 million mu across the region. In the irrigated area, the stereoscopic compound growing area constituted 48 percent of the total area sown to crops. In the mountain area, peas were interplanted with potatoes, so that summer crops could be supplemented with fall crops, and vice versa, with the result that the per-mu output value increased by 50 to 80 percent. Third, to meet the market needs, many production bases for superior and quality crops were built up, and an integrated system for production, processing, and marketing was formed. A more dynamic market mechanism greatly adjusted peasants' operational behavior and fluctuations in the prices of agricultural products told them they must choose efficient products and trades. This was an important reason for the increase in peasants' income last year. The year 1993 was one in which the rural economy and society developed hand in hand. Since the beginning of last year, another 13 central market towns have been built or reformed, and a total of 87 million yuan has been spent on the construction of market towns. The area of newly built housing in rural areas totaled 1.25 square meters, and the quality and functions of housing were greatly improved. In 1994, the rural areas will face new opportunities and challenges. The major reform measures taken by the state with regard to finance, taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, and state enterprises will give an enormous impetus to agricultural production and the rural economy, but they also will entail some undesirable effects, owing to the great adjustment in interest relationships. Therefore, we must effect a strategic change in our guiding principle for rural work in order to meet the needs of the new situation. We must make setting up a market economy system our goal, focus on increasing peasants' income, accelerate rural reforms, and adjust the setup of production in rural areas at a greater pace. Organizations at all levels must seize the opportunity, make concerted efforts, and continue to clear the way to forge ahead to add new luster to rural areas across the region.
