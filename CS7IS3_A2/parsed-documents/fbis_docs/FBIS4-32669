The latest news says: Three imams and some 10 hajjis have been arrested or taken to camps. Currently, altogether there are approximately 1,700 opponents to the forcefully proclaimed autonomy who are being held in Abdic's prisons and camps. There are even children as young as seven in the camps. We learned this in Zagreb today from a former prisoner who was detained in the (?Drnovi) camp. Abdic's supporters are also arresting the deputies of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly from the Bihac district and the members of their families. Deputy Hazim Muric and his father are imprisoned, and so is Ejup Alagic, president of the Velika Kladusa communal assembly, and his entire family -- a wife and two children. A father and a sister of Murija (?Mirkovic), deputy in the Chamber of Citizens of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, have also been detained. Deputy (?Ivkovic) has confirmed this himself. There is a reign of terror and mass arrests in Kladusa. The people are being imprisoned in one of the following four camps -- Drmeljevo, (?Bavionica), [word indistinct], and (?Vrnograd).
