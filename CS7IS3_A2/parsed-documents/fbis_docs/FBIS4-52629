In a speech delivered after receiving the credentials of New Zealander Ambassador to Indonesia Timothy Groser here at the Merdeka Palace Thursday, President Suharto expressed his appreciation to New Zealand, which has taken an active role in the region through the ASEAN-New Zealand cooperation forum and the APEC forum. The six member countries of ASEAN in cooperation with the Asia- Pacific countries have made an effort to maintain regional stability and improve the standard of living, he added. He also expressed his appreciation to the New Zealand Government for supporting Indonesia's move to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. President Suharto also welcomed the planned visit of New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger to Indonesia this month, saying he hoped the forthcoming visit would be beneficial for both countries in enhancing bilateral cooperation as well as giving them an opportunity to discuss a number of international issues. In his speech, Suharto said the end of the Cold War and the East- West dispute has given the world an opportunity to consolidate economically and politically. He also stated that relations and cooperation between nations could no longer be based on the old pattern of "donor and recipient." "Relations between nations should be based on mutual responsibility, coexistence, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty," he said. On the occasion, President Suharto also received credentials from the Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Richard Demel, and from the representative of the European Commission to Indonesia, Klaus Peter Schamallenbach.
