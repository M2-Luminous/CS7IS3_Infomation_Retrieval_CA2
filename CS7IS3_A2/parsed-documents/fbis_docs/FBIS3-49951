Good evening and welcome to our studio from Geneva. [Akmadzic] Good evening. Thank you. [Correspondent] We can say that you were the head of the Bosnian Croat delegation at the latest round of Geneva negotiations. In the shade of, let me say, the big signature between Zagreb and Belgrade yesterday, a slightly smaller, but no less important signature appeared between Pale [the power center of the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina], so to say, and Mostar, seeing that offices, that is, representatives' offices will be opened in those towns by 15 February 1994. Could you describe that agreement, and what does the phrase that there are no controversial issues that cannot be solved through negotiations means? What are these controversial issues? [Akmadzic] You see, first of all, we are taking into account the current state of negotiations on the future set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the need for a comprehensive peace in the region. We are aware of the fact that Europe wants peace, Europe insists on peace. The EU has sent us a memo, a demarche in which it demands and claims that after long negotiations the time has come to reach an agreement on peace. Both the Serb delegation and us are aware of that, and -- I am speaking about the Serbs and Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina -- we held talks and concluded that it would be good to establish that we favor a permanent peace and that we are aware of the fact that, at the moment, our disputes are of such a nature that they do not go beyond the level that could not be solved by peaceful means. Therefore, we are in favor of talks, of a solution to all problems by peaceful means between the two of us, and for a solution to all problems by peaceful means with the third side, that is the Bosniak Muslims or the Muslims as they are referred to in documents. [Correspondent] Let us still stay on the agreement between Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the disputed areas? Are they Kupres, Jajce, Posavina? Could you perhaps mention some other ones in addition to these? [Akmadzic] I would like to say that the basic thing that we have not agreed upon yet refers to Posavina [the basin of the river Sava in Bosnia]. Namely, in our earlier talks, in earlier conclusions, especially during the talks on the [aircraft carrier] Invincible and before that, the map that was offered was not satisfactory for the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We put forward new demands in that respect. The Serb side accepted to discuss our demands and make some concessions. We have not yet defined how many and what concessions, but we said that they would be about two percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina in northern Bosnia. [sentence as heard] Therefore, in that respect, we have reached an agreement in principle, but we have not yet agreed where exactly the line of separation would be. [Correspondent] Talking about Bosnian Posavina, what would be the fate of the Serb corridor [between Serbia proper and the Serb-held areas in western Bosnia and Croatia] in your solution? Will it be cut? How would Muslim demands for access to the river Sava fit into that solution? [Akmadzic] You see, the Muslims have demanded and have now particularly stressed -- among the disputed towns that they stress normally as disputed towns between them and Croats on the one hand and them and Serbs on the other -- Brcko. Therefore, in that respect, the Serb corridor would have to be cut in that area, unless the problem is solved in a way satisfactory for both sides -- the Serb and the Muslim sides, and the Croat side too; unless it is solved by some technical means -- the earlier mentioned overpasses and underpasses and such elements that would enable both sides to have free access. I must say that this issue has not yet been solved, but I think that, as far as the Serb side is concerned, they will definitely have free passage toward, let us say, east [Serbia proper]. [Correspondent] That means that this Croat demand for 2 percent would not threaten the corridor. [Akmadzic] It need not threaten the corridor. We are not talking about sovereignty here but about the freedom of passage. In any case, they will be able to pass through there unhindered. [Correspondent] Let us remain on the subject of Bosnian Posavina, an interesting subject because two members of the Bosnian Posavina assembly were present in Geneva -- Kovacevic and Stanic -- they took part in the talks as members of the Sarajevo authorities' delegation. How did this happen and why did they not attend as members of the Croat delegation? [Akmadzic] You see, the assembly of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna, or to be more precise, the house of deputies of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna declared this assembly held in Bosanska Posavina illegitimate, illegal. However, we are not bent on aggravating the situation in this case. Two people -- Ivko Stanic and Ante Kovacevic -- showed up in Geneva as the representatives of the Bosnian Posavina Croats. This is the second time they were there [in Geneva]. Only now they said they were also the representatives of the Croats from central Bosnia in line with a decision made by another assembly.... [Correspondent, interrupting] Which you had attended. [Akmadzic] Yes, but this assembly did not reach any decisions to send them there. [Correspondent] What was decided? [Akmadzic] It was verbally concluded at this assembly -- I am not familiar with the procedure governing written conclusions -- that two people should go with me to Geneva because it was already known at that time that I would be a member of the Bosnian Croat delegation. This was not a matter of dispute. We brought this up in our talks with the co-chairmen, especially after these two people -- Stanic and Kovacevic -- held a news conference in Geneva. The co-chairmen explained that they were members of the Muslim delegation -- I am using the terminology they used -- therefore, they were in Geneva as members of the Muslim, or Bosniak- Muslim, delegation. All I can say is that such conduct is very damaging to our negotiating position, that it has an adverse effect on the atmosphere of goodwill. This especially applies to some of their stands on our legitimacy. Our delegation in Geneva certainly was legitimate, it was appointed in a legitimate way, it was approved by the House of Deputies. Sadly, the fact remains that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina became divided over this whole negotiating process. [Akmadzic] Let us be precise. I would not call it a division. These assemblies were also not held in this way, especially the central-Bosnian one, which I attended. I attended it precisely because I wanted to see what was happening and to contact these people. It is, I would say, a meeting of Croats, not just from central Bosnia but also from other places. For instance, there were people from Livno, Jajce, from northern Bosnia who do not belong in central Bosnia. As for Sarajevo, according to our Bosnia- Herzegovina terminology, it is questionable whether it is in central Bosnia. We know that central Bosnia includes the municipalities of Kiseljak, Kresevo, Busovaca, Vitez, Kakanj, Vares, etc. I think that there is no rift among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are united, we have a unified stand. These people are living in Zagreb, they all met, in this sense it is not a bad idea. It is good that they met to examine the political situation and offer to help as much as they can. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In how many places in Bosnia-Herzegovina are the units of HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the B-H Army cooperating. [Akmadzic] It is difficult to say. In some places they are cooperating of their own free will and in many places not at all. For instance, one HVO brigade in Sarajevo -- Kralj Tvrtko -- was forced to join the B-H Army's 1st Corps without our permission and without any consultations with us. This brigade is now still acting under the same name -- Kralj Tvrtko -- but is under the direct command of the B-H Army's First Corps. This is contrary to our relations and our earlier agreements. [Correspondent] Let us now hear Muslim reactions to yesterday's two agreements. We have Ejup Ganic's statement for CNN -- which refers to the Zagreb-Belgrade agreement. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We heard Ejup Ganic's statement -- the first reaction from....[pauses] I would say it is much stronger than the one by Alija Izetbegovic who was in a way more reserved and who welcomed the agreement [word indistinct] not to the detriment of the third party. Have these two agreements really succeeded in pursuing the idea on the division of Bosnia and in forcing the Muslims to end the fighting? [Akmadzic] Let me just confirm what you said. Ganic has lately been making statements which, I think, may not be completely in line with what Izetbegovic or Haris Silajdzic have been saying. [Correspondent] Which can be part of the strategy? [Akmadzic] Which can, of course, be part of the strategy. In any case, I must say that -- as far as the Croat side is concerned -- there is no division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Until now, especially during the war, Croats were the ones who most strongly advocated [a single] Bosnia-Herzegovina, but we think that Bosnia- Herzegovina can only be what it can be at a given moment. A union of B-H republics is presently being considered. You know very well, and all viewers and the general public know, that we supported the Vance-Owen plan that was against the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At one point there was discussion of a federation, etc. At present it is a question of the union of B-H republics -- this is still Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are supporting this. Not to support this at the present time -- as Ganic thinks -- would mean a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Bosnia-Herzegovina remains to exist in whatever form it can. [Correspondent] Another interesting piece of information appeared in our press today: That Muslims have been buying weapons and ammunition from the Serbs for gas-dollars from Islamic countries. Do you have any information on this? [Akmadzic] Of course we do not have any concrete data, but there have been various reports about this. It is a fact that the Muslim side -- this is what we are called in the negotiations, the Muslim, Croat, and Serb side -- does not have any special financial difficulties. They openly say it themselves. They get aid from Islamic countries. We also know that the Islamic conference's contact group, that is its core, has frequent sessions, and that they provide very significant aid for the Bosniak-Muslim side. We do not know exactly which countries provide the aid, but it is certain.... [Correspondent, interrupting] A more interesting question is: Do they buy weapons from the Serbs? [Akmadzic] I believe that they buy weapons from the Serbs, not officially, but we know that various channels and various interests operate there and they certainly buy weapons from the Serbs. [Correspondent] Do such things happen between the Croats and Serbs? [Akmadzic] According to our official policy -- of course it does not, for our interests as regards this are not convergent. The Muslim and Serb interests are not convergent either. It is possible that unofficial channels exist. It is, however, certain that such things do not happen officially. [Correspondent] In the end -- an important issue: The international community has increasingly often indicated a possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units, primarily British and French, from Bosnia-Herzegovina this spring. What would this mean for Bosnia-Herzegovina and particularly for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Akmadzic] We have been openly told in Geneva by the cochairmen that, if the negotiations were to continue in this manner, with very poor results or with hardly any result at all, the war could then last for a long time, until the complete exhaustion of all the sides in the conflict, until peace is reached in such a way. It is possible that the international community is considering the withdrawal of its forces in order to reach that level of exhaustion as soon as possible. Nothing has been said or indicated to us as regards this. I believe, if the talks continue to yield no success, that this [the withdrawal] can happen and that they will let the war go on until total exhaustion. [Correspondent] In that case, what would the fighting be like, all against all, or some against some? Yesterday, we had a report by Sky TV that speculates that, in case of the withdrawal and even if they do not withdraw, the Serb and Croat units would openly militarily cooperate and fight the Muslims. [Akmadzic] I would not speak about that, but I would stress that the Croat side is ready to sign peace with both other sides, and that we want peace. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is completely contrary to the interests of the Croat people, except when it is being fought solely to defend it's rights, the right to equality, the right to Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course together with the other two peoples. In that case we will defend ourselves, but we are against resolving problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina by fighting. You know that at the beginning of the war we were the first to organize ourself for the defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All of the recent criticism of us is without any foundation. We will protect our interests, but we will fight for peace.
