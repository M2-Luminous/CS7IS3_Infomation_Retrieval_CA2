FBIS3-31513 "dreeu034__a94034" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Parliament Passes Amended Privatization Law AU1702211394 Prague CTK in English 1649 GMT 17 Feb 94 AU1702211394 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament has passed the government's bill amending the law on large privatization with certain alterations. The amendment allows cabinet members to retain posts in the Presidium and Inspectorate Council of the National Property Fund (FNM), whereby they can continue to intervene in the privatization process in Slovakia. Members of the FNM Presidium and Inspectorate Council will, however, be elected by parliament. The government coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and part of the Slovak National Party (SNS) has a minority in parliament. "Wild privatization in Slovakia will go on while Premier Vladimir Meciar signs the parliament-approved bill on an amendment to the Law on Large Privatization," Juraj Plesnik, member of the Parliamentary Commission on Administration and Privatization for the Democratic Left Party (SDL), told journalists today. If Meciar does sign, however, it will lead to the separation of political power from economic power in the state, Plesnik said. The passing of the amendment represents a victory for the opposition because the National Property Fund (FNM) will be liberated from cabinet influence. Meciar, who is also acting privatization minister, will lose his claim to the post of chairman of the FNM Presidium and Finance Minister Julius Toth will have to resign from the post of chairman of the FNM Supervisory Council. Opposition deputies believe, however, that Meciar will not sign it, but submit it to the president, who in turn will return it to parliamentary committees for discussion. This will allow Meciar to continue with privatization as he has done over the last few days, when the government for example approved 20 privatization projects on the direct sale of the property of strategic Slovak companies. Plesnik said the amendment precisely defined the extent and manner of the use of FNM property. High-ranking state officials will be able to work in the FNM once approved by parliament, but cabinet members cannot, he said. The amendment requires the FNM to present a fresh list of companies to be privatized and companies to be excluded from privatization. Parliament will decide when the new lists have to be submitted, Plesnik said.
