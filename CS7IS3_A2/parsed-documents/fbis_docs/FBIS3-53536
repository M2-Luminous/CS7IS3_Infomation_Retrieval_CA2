Prior to his departure al-Wuhayyib stated that the GCC looks forward for the meeting with the U.S. side to lead to a document which defines the aims of these talks and a program of action to be realized. He pointed out that the Saudi minister of trade will be leading the GCC side while the U.S. secretary of trade will lead the American side. Al-Wuhayyib added that the GCC secretariat general intends to submit the agreement on free trade exchange which was not accepted before by the U.S. side, but following the endorsement of the free trade agreement of North America, and reaching an agreement at the end of the Uruguay round within the GATT framework, "circumstances may be suitable for the submission of this proposal by the GCC." He also said that the unified Gulf delegation will discuss with the American side too the subject of investment and methods of encouraging it, industrial cooperation, science and technology and rights of individual ownership. He said that negotiating with a superpower such as the United States with a unified Gulf delegation reflects the cohesion of the GCC member states and reaffirms that progress is being made along the path of integration.
