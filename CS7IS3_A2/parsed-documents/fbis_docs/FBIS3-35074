[Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you. [Al-Miliji] Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres signed an agreement in Cairo, which was followed by talks in Taba. Do you feel the Palestinian issue is on its way to a final settlement? [Abu-'Ayyash] As brother President 'Arafat said, the name of Palestine has been placed firmly on the map. What our negotiating teams are doing in Taba, Washington, and elsewhere is to confirm this political right. In my opinion, the Palestinian issue is on its way to a solution. This is true, despite the numerous difficulties and the obstacles still facing the two sides and holding back a final settlement. [Al-Miliji] The entire world, East and West, has long provided the Middle East with weapons. Now the Middle East region is looking forward to peace. What do the Palestinians expect from the world in time of peace? [Abu-'Ayyash] I believe the road toward creating a Middle East region that enjoys prosperity, peace, and security will be full of challenges. One such challenge has to do with the weapons to which you have just referred. The world must provide the various countries in the region, particularly the Palestinian people, with expertise and massive economic support. This aid is needed if the Palestinians are to rebuild their infrastructure and cope with the fast-paced economic changes in the world. Peace is more than signing a paper or agreement. It is the translation of these agreements into tangible facts and into measures enabling the regions' nations to live in peace and security. Peace involves security, justice, and rights for everyone. [Al-Miliji] As the moment of Palestinian self-determination in the transitional phase draws near, how do you see future Jordanian-Palestinian relations? [Abu-'Ayyash] My dear friend, the relationship between the brothers in Jordan and the brother Palestinians is long and special. Due to the Palestinian tragedy, the Palestinians blended with the Jordanians to form one family. I think future Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be special. The Palestinians also have warm relations with other Arabs, particularly the Egyptians, and their relationship with Syria and Lebanon is one of cooperation. But specific and clear political programs must be formulated. I think the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples should be left free to determine the shape of their relations once the Palestinian people are free from the yoke of Israeli occupation and have restored their rights, which, I believe, is just a matter of time. [Al-Miliji] In the latest meetings of the Palestinian-Jordanian Committee, did the two sides discuss the future relationship between the Jordanians and Palestinians once the Palestinians get their right to self-determination? [Abu-'Ayyash] Yes they did. There are several committees that meet occasionally, such as the Jordanian-Palestinian Higher Coordination Committee, which will draft things like economic ties, the refugees issue, the crossing points, and other issues relating to the daily life of the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples. I believe that all these relations and drafts worked out by the PLO institutions and the Jordanian Government will necessarily put things in focus for the Palestinian people once the final status of their political future, in the form of an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, is determined. [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another topic, namely, relations with sisterly Egypt. Palestinian police cadres recently received training at the Egyptian Police Academy. As chairman of the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation, what are the avenues for prospective cooperation between you and the Egyptian Radio and Television Union [RTU]? [Abu-'Ayyash] It has been my honor to meet with the brothers in Egyptian radio and television and with some production circles. I was particularly pleased that Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif gave us all the necessary facilities to train the Palestinian cadres, such as the police cadres. Approximately 60 Palestinian media cadres from the occupied territories and from the diaspora are due in Egypt on 23 March to receive a six-week training course along with their Egyptian colleagues at the Egyptian RTU. Once this course is over, we may say we have cadres who are well versed in the established Egyptian school of media, which could benefit us. Our relations with the brothers in Egypt are very close, fraternal, and long, not just in the form of agreements, but also in practice, going back even before 1948. [Al-Miliji] Abu-'Ayyash: Thank you very much. [Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you.
