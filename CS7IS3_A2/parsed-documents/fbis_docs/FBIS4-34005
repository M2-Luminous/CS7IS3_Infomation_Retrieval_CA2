Speaking at the convention center in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, the Mexican president explained the reasons our country had for diversifying its relations and for promoting domestic efforts for reforms, similar to what is happening in other nations. However, Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned that diversification of relations should not be an excuse to distract commercial flow. Let us hear what he said: [Begin Salinas recording] Other Ibero-American nations have implemented plans in accordance to the needs of their people. This encourages shared purposes. Efforts for integration among our nations should not be an excuse to distract commercial flow nor to appear as blocs closed to exchange. Compatible with GATT, we can reach agreements that will be the motors of our economic activity, investment, creation of jobs, and distribution of income, which in the end is the important thing. [end recording] The Mexican president also stressed that there must be greater recognition of the unilateral efforts for opening and change which must be expanded to areas such as services, labor, and the environment, all of which are factors for progress, greater coordination of monetary policies, exchange of technology, and shared production to strengthen commercial openings and investment. President Salinas de Gortari said that Ibero-America must use its influence in the multilateral forums, especially in the new trade organization. The president said that our priority today is the well-being of those who have less because it is not possible to advance with inefficient and isolated economies, nor can progress be made with internationalized economies that are socially irresponsible. For this reason, Salinas de Gortari said that we must insist on an economic recovery that goes hand in hand with well-thought and balanced social reforms, with democratic progress in pluralism. Today's speeches by Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Argentine President Carlos Menem, were also very important. They suggested an opening for the Cuban people's democracy. This could be important in strengthening peace and stability in the region. Fidel Castro did not broach this issue; however, he was very clear in stating that the U.S. blockade on Cuba must end. This is what he said: [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, this is an excellent opportunity to demand that the U.S. Government abide by the UN resolution on the criminal and unjust blockade against Cuba. [end recording] I also wish to add that today's Colombian newspapers, especially the Cartagena de Indias newspapers, did not give much coverage to the summit. Instead they reported that the Colombian soccer team traveled to the United States today to participate in the World Cup.
