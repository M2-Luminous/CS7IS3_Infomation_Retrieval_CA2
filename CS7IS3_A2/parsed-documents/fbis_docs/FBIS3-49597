The SDS and BSP have considered some other parliamentary means as well, high-ranking officials of the two parties told a briefing today. The decree was publicized following press reports on Friday [7 January]. Dr. Zhelev dismissed the allegations that he was exceeding his powers and his spokesman accused the parties' headquarters of designing backstage schemes. SDS leader Filip Dimitrov stressed that the president's decree aroused "certain concerns that structures, identical to those existing under the totalitarian regime" were being set up. The anti-communist coalition would not react and intends to demand the decree, which blew up the scandal, via official channels. BSP leader Zhan Videnov described as "unusual" the fact that the decree has not so far been published and its text is unknown. The Socialists need time to get familiar with the issue and put it to discussion. "It is a tradition for the President's Office to aim at exceeding its powers, and I am only going to cite (the case with) foreign policy, national security and the army," Mr. Videnov said at the BSP's regular briefing today. The Socialists considered some 7 or 8 ways of reacting to this decree, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said. She mentioned only the one envisaging a hearing of the president either at a closed-door parliamentary sitting or at the Parliamentary National Security Committee. The Socialist MP's are thinking also of asking for the opinion of the defence minister, the chief of General Staff and other senior government officers of the defence sector. The BSP is expected to come up later with one of the 7 variants discussed. It is likely that the Constitutional Court also be approached, according to Vasil Gotsev, law graduate and MP of the SDS. He told journalists that the decree was anticonstitutional. "Indeed, the president is commander in chief of the Bulgarian Army, but the Constitution does not provide for a body to control it. The Constitution does not say that the President's Office should have structures exercising control over the army," Mr. Gotsev said.
