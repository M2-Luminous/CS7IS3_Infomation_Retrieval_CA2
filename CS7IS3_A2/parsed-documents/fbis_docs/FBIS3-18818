Speaking at the presentation of next July's summit here of the West's group of seven most industrialised countries (G-7), Ciampi also paid attention to last week's turbulence on international markets and observed that it had been "an excessive reaction" to the American decision to slightly increase short-term interest rates. The long-time Bank of Italy governor added how the same criteria for rates did not apply to both Europe and the United States. Turning his attention to Italy's trade balance, premier Ciampi forecast how it will improve this year even over the 13 trillion lire (7.7 billion dollars) assets posted for 1993. He also down-played the reduced tax revenue reported last week, stating how the difference between forecast and intake had been modest and determined by a dip in the gross domestic product.
