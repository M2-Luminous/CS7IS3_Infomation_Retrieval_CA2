This advanced achievement, important for research into astrophysics, has passed appraisal by a committee consisting of several academicians of the China Academy of Sciences. According to scientists at the laboratory, tandem accelerators are being used for research only in a few state laboratories in the United States and Japan. The beam line on CIAE's tandem accelerator is China's first. It has produced two radioactive beams -- known to experts as "C-11" and "F-17" beams -- for the first time in the country. This means that it is now possible to do research on unstable nuclei far from stability. Previously, nuclear physics was restricted to examining about 2,000 nuclides produced by ions of stable isotopes. This will eventually lead to a better understanding of the nature of nuclear reactions and the nuclear structure, according to scientists. Chinese scientists at the CIAE and elsewhere have conducted 205 experiments using the CIAE's tandem accelerator since 1988.
