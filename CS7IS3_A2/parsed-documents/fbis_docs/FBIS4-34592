Lopez Moreno, however, pointed out that he is not currently seeking a dialogue with the EZLN in the buffer zones. He added that he will meet today with Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, when the prelate returns from a trip. The state governor delivered a message to the people of Mexico and Chiapas: "We are not experiencing the worst of conditions, and we are making progress." I trust the EZLN's conditions will be appropriate for the holding of elections, and even the electoral campaign. He admitted he has good relations with all political organizations in the state. He also said he was in a position to resolve the agenda proposed by the State Council of the Indian and Peasant Organizations as well as to resolve the concerns expressed by the small landholders, particularly the cattle ranchers. He advised that there are problems in some municipalities in the state, such as land seizures, the blocking of highways, and unrest in the zones of conflict. Nevertheless, he said, the situation is under control.
