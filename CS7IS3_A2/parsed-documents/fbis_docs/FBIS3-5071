The British Government also did not act well to deny or give a true explanation on the claim by the irresponsible media in that country that the Malaysian leaders were corrupt. British newspapers frequently attack Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and other Malaysian leaders of having received pay-offs for approving privatized projects to British companies. The prime minister however said that the Malaysian Government had no quarrel with the British Government and British companies when it decided not to offer any new contracts to British companies. He made the remarks when breaking the fast with UMNO [United Malays National Organization] Youth leaders in Kuala Lumpur last night. In another development, the Health Ministry will no longer import medicine produced in Britain under the cabinet's directive to bar British firms from getting government-funded contracts. This was stated by its minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai. He said, however, existing contracts with British companies would be honored. He said this after presenting a check for 100,000 ringgit to the nongovernment council on AIDS at its office in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. [passage omitted]
