FR940810-0-00335 FR940810-0-00022 Comment: One commenter contended that these regulations are fundamentally flawed because the ``need'' for the exception is wholly without merit. Defending nationally normed tests, the commenter disputed that new State assessment systems would provide more meaningful data and asserted that new and traditional assessment systems are not mutually exclusive. Discussion: The commenter may have missed the point of these regulations. The regulations do not require any State to make changes in its Chapter 1 or MEP testing programs. Even a State that has developed an assessment system to support its education reform efforts will not be required to use that system to evaluate its Chapter 1 or MEP programs. At the same time, however, the Secretary does not want the current national evaluation standards to stand in the way of a State's efforts, in reforming its educational system, to define what all students should be expected to know, train instructional staff to teach those subjects, and assess whether students, in fact, have learned what they should know. In particular, the Secretary believes that States that are pursuing this kind of reform, and that have already developed their own measures for assessing what all children should know, should be free to use those assessments to evaluate their States' Chapter 1 and MEP programs if they are satisfied that these measures provide more meaningful information on the progress of participating children than does use of the current national standards. The current national evaluation standards preclude a State from making this choice. To the extent that a State's assessment system does not rely on a nationally normed test or fails to assess every participating child in grades 2 through 12, it is inconsistent with, and therefore cannot be used to satisfy, the current national evaluation standards. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter interpreted the Secretary's desire to eliminate dual testing as a determination that multiple measures are inconsistent with the current Chapter 1 evaluation requirements. The commenter asserted that a rationale for the proposed exception premised on a single assessment theory is inconsistent with current law. Discussion: The commenter may have misinterpreted the Secretary's rationale for proposing an exception to the national evaluation standards. The Secretary is not requiring use of a sole assessment criterion. Rather, like the commenter, the Secretary encourages multiple assessment measures and anticipates that most, if not all, State assessment systems qualifying for an exception would consist of multiple measures. On the other hand, the Secretary is trying to eliminate the need for a State to administer dual tests, i.e., administering a particular type of test merely to satisfy the Chapter 1 national evaluation standards while administering an acceptable alternative assessment system for the State's own purposes. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter suggested that, instead of granting exceptions, the Secretary revise the regulations to require the use of multiple measures, including norm-referenced tests. According to the commenter, although it is appropriate to use additional assessments that could provide critical evidence of whether children are performing at an appropriate level, norm-referenced tests should also be used because they meet the technical standards of reliability and validity. Discussion: As noted above, the Secretary encourages the use of multiple assessment measures. The Secretary does not agree that norm-referenced tests should be required as one measure. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter asked whether it would be possible for an SEA or LEA to have a mixed system_for example, norm-referenced tests to measure sustained effects; alternative measures for assessing math and reading. Discussion: The regulations permit States to use any assessment measures or combination of measures that are appropriate and that meet new, less prescriptive national standards. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter suggested that, if an exception is granted, the eligibility standards for entry into Chapter 1 programs would be relaxed to the point that subjective teacher recommendations would determine participation. Discussion: These regulations do not alter the criteria for identifying and selecting children for participation in Chapter 1 or MEP programs. Under Chapter 1, for example, children must still be identified as educationally deprived ``on the basis of educationally related objective criteria established by the [LEA] which include written or oral testing instruments.'' This requirement, however, does not mandate a specific type of assessment, particularly one that uses a nationally normed test. An LEA may use whatever educationally related objective criteria it deems appropriate. Thus, to the extent the State assessment system meets the LEA's needs, it may also serve to identify and select children for participation in Chapter 1. On the other hand, to the extent the State assessment system does not provide sufficient information on specific children, the LEA would need to use additional measures to select children for participation in Chapter 1 programs. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter felt that accountability could be skewed if test results are obtained only from a single grade level. Another commenter feared that information from only one grade level would not provide adequate evidence of school effectiveness. Discussion: There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that a State limit its assessment of its Chapter 1 or MEP programs to a single grade level per school. Indeed, if a State believes that one grade does not adequately represent the progress of children in Chapter 1 or MEP or the effectiveness of a school, it should assess children in other grades to achieve an adequate picture of their progress.
