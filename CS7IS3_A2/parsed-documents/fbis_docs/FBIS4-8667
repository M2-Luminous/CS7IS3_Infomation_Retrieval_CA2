No other details have been provided. The Romanian Embassy in Bern officially confirmed that the British passports were submitted on 8 April and mentioned that additional instructions from the Romanian Foreign Ministry in Bucharest have been requested. The Romanian foreign minister's office said that a diplomatic courier is expected to arrive; after that officials will be able to examine the precise nature of the passports in question. Likewise, the same office noted that additional detail might be requested regarding the nature of this visit; namely, whether this is a private visit or another type of visit, whether Mihai I of Hohenzollern recognizes the Constitution of Romania, and other such details. It is noteworthy that the church and local authorities in Timisoara reminded the central leadership that some time ago they sent an invitation to Mihai I and his wife Ana to visit this town because, among other things, Mihai I is also the founder of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Timisoara.
