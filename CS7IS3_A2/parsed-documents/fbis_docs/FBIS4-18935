These projects concern the new generation strategic submarine missile, M5 (and possibly a version of the M5 for the Albion platform), and the airborne ASLP air-to-surface missile to be carried by the Rafale. However, that does not mean that these projects have been frozen. Research credits have been earmarked for both deterrent weapons systems. However, any decision to start -- or, if necessary, abandon -- the development and above all the production of these missiles has been delayed until 1997 when the schedule will be revised to take account of the international situation and the state of French public finances. Designed to determine the level of credit for the purchase of equipment and the number of troops in force for the period 1995-2000, the military planning law has been drated up by a presidential Defense Committee. It will take the form of six-year legislation after being submitted to Parliament before the end of this spring session. Intended to be the continuation of the 1994 defense white paper, the planning project, which translates the white paper into budgetary terms, prioritizes a conventional armed force charged with foreign missions, and envisages the creation of so-called projectable units for long-distance deployment either under national command or operating by international mandate. On the other hand -- and this is the main turning point in France's conception of security compared with previous planning programs -- the new draft law more or less signals a pause in plans for future nuclear weapons systems. To be more exact, it does not make a definite decision between the various options available but leaves all avenues open. There are several reasons why things have reached this point but the logic is the same in each case: namely, it is too early to make a commitment to send plans for nuclear weapons in one direction rather than another and so risk making irreversible decisions, since the production cycle for this type of weapon is in the region of 15 to 20 years. First, financial restrictions weigh heavily, even if France, by agreeing to increase its military expenditure despite economic difficulties, has taken a direction which runs counter to the attitude of most of its allies, who have been obliged to make significant defense cuts. Given these financial restrictions, the emphasis placed on conventional forces means that nuclear investment has to be limited. In addition, the priority that was for a long time given to the whole range of deterrents was, to some extent, a carryover from the East-West Cold War which has since lost much of its meaning. The French nuclear arsenal has not suddenly become so obsolete that it has to be completely modernized from top to bottom and at any cost. Last, it is generally considered that -- without seriously jeopardizing its security -- France can wait, and extend the life of existing nuclear weapons until such time as they become obsolete. The current and foreseeable state of the world no longer justifies, as it once did, the deployment of the most up-to-date deterrents. All these considerations came into play to ensure that the military planning law is kept within reasonable limits. In 1997 a final decision will have to be taken concerning the different formulas that will lay the ground for the weapons systems that will replace -- or not replace -- the current M4 submarine-borne missiles, the S3D missiles in the Albion platform's silos, and the ASMP air-to-ground missiles carried by the Mirage IV, Mirage 2000-N, and other Super Etendards in service. The aim is still for these nuclear weapons to be replaced by their possible successors around the year 2010. By then, and between 1995 and 1997, research credits will continue to be allocated for the M5 (including for its ground version on the Albion platform) and for the ASLP, so that the industrial groups concerned can retain their know-how and their engineering teams. If necessary, it will be possible to allocate development credits in advance. This should be the case for the stato-reactor technology which forms the basis for the ASMP (and the new version of the ASLP which will be derived from it), an area in which France is still a long way ahead of its international rivals. Will Tests Restart? All this means that, while the core has been retained and there is apparently no hurry, it will be up to the next head of state to make the final decision, during the first two or three years of the planning law, to determine which nuclear weapons system will replace the existing submarine missiles and make up the rest of the deterrent. It is understood that, in addition to the missile-launching submarines, a second strategic "component," based on ground-based or airborne missiles, will have to be chosen. Whatever decision is made by the next president of the republic, it is assumed that by 1995 a solution will have been found to the particularly thorny problem of which explosive warhead should be used in the nuclear weapons system. The issue is not so much the nature of the new missile, but the nuclear charge it will carry. The suspension of nuclear testing decreed by Francois Mitterrand, due to run until the end of his presidency in May 1995, prevents experts -- or so it would appear -- from defining the characteristics and performance of the warhead which is to be adapted to suit the requirements of this second "component." All they can hope to do is "patch together" a new warhead using existing ones, hoping that laboratory simulations will prove sufficient, for the next 10 years, to build the weapon in question. However, even if this were the case, it would still be unwise to deploy a nuclear weapon whose safety and "scale" aspects had not first been subject to full-scale testing. The next head of state will be given two choices that in effect come down to the same thing. Either he can prolong the test ban and, as a result, he will not be assured of having a really new deterrent -- missile and warhead -- ready in time. In this case he runs the risk of being accused of having led France down the path toward definitively abandoning the very principle of deterrent. Or he can take the initiative and break the test ban, and then have to modernize the nuclear arsenal with the prospect of having to be content with a relatively limited number of tests before switching to laboratory simulations. In this case, he will need much more courage and tenacity to brave the antinuclear campaign in his own country and, at the same time, risk turning his back on much of the international community, which will be plunged into the torment of having to renegotiate the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). A cruel dilemma for a newly elected president to have to face just after taking up his new office! Those in favor of restarting nuclear tests -- unilaterally, if need be -- will not be held up by this point of detail. They consider that, on the contrary, 1995 will be the year when a new president can -- during what is termed the period of presidential grace -- obtain the backing for France to participate in the new NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] framework with the express condition that it can first complete its new deterrent by performing any remaining tests.
