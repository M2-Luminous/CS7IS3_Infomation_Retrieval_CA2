Jozo Curic reports: [Curic] There has been no change since the 1400 deadline, when the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] were expected to confirm that the Serbs had withdrawn from two more points around Gorazde. The Croat and Bosniak delegations, President Zubak, Minister Akmadzic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Vice President Ganic met in the Richmond Hotel in Geneva. New reports from Sarajevo say that nothing has changed on the ground. Negotiations on a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, initiated here in Geneva on 13 May by the foreign ministers of the great powers and the European Union, cannot begin. Federation President Zubak and Vice President Ganic held talks this morning with Yasushi Akashi and Generals Rose and de Lapresle, who are unsuccessfully trying to get the talks started. The position of the joint Croat-Bosniak delegation in the talks was that UNPROFOR should present a report confirming there were no Serb forces in the 3-km zone around Gorazde. Vice President Ganic said that Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi had not presented a new UNPROFOR report from the Gorazde area to the Croat-Bosniak delegation by 1400. Karadzic, Akashi, de Lapresle, and Rose held talks this morning, lasting for nearly an hour, but without any visible results. After the talks Radovan Karadzic said that the Muslims are sabotaging the talks on ending the hostilities. Intensive diplomatic efforts continue. UNPROFOR has confirmed the presence of Serb forces within 2,200 metres of the center of Gorazde.
