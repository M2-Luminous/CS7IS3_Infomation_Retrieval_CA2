CCIH and the Haitian employers' associations intended to compel the Haitian protagonists to quickly find a solution to the political crisis. Regarding the resumption of activities today, the spokesman for the Haitian private sector, Bernard Craan, stated to Radio Metropole that the Haitian employers' sector emerged stronger and felt satisfied with their initiative. Rothschild [Francois] filed a report: [Begin recording] Reactivating the commercial-industrial machine today does not mean that the Haitian employers intend to put aside their demands. The private sector asserts that it will maintain the pressure on the various protagonists. The crisis committee of the employers' sector will therefore remain mobilized, reinforced by the presence of the presidents of the associations. The private sector intends to talk with the other vital forces of the country, with the objective of finding elements for a solution to the structural crisis that Haiti has been facing for what seems like decades. Questioned on an assessment of their initiative, one of the spokesmen of the employers' sector states that their movement has not been without effect. Bernard Craan explains that the private sector demonstrated unity by rationally managing the movement, but he believes that it is still too early to speak of overall satisfaction.
