He returned to Cairo after holding talks with President Demirel and several other officials on the same day. The press release issued after his talks said the sides agreed on the need to improve their mutual cooperation in every field. It said that the sides agreed to make a joint effort to contribute toward the establishment of peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region and help Iraq maintain its territorial integrity. President Mubarak was visiting Turkey for the third time since 1985. His recent visit has unveiled the nature of relations and contacts between Ankara and Cairo. Obviously, the aim was to improve bilateral political, economic, cultural, and military relations. The cooperation between Turkey and Egypt is important because of their situation in the region and relations with the Zionist regime. President Ezer Weizman visited Turkey for four days last week. In a statement in Ankara, he said that cooperation among Israel, Turkey, and Egypt will determine the future of the Middle East. Several political experts are convinced that the intensive diplomatic contacts among the three countries may be a prelude to the signing of an agreement on developments in the region. Undoubtedly, the United States will support that agreement, which will enable the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist regime to establish a common policy to protect themselves against threats. Undoubtedly, the main threat against Turkey, Egypt, and the Zionist regime is the strengthening and spreading of Islam and Islamic activities. Another aspect of relations between Turkey and Egypt is aimed at creating the conditions required for the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab countries and the removal of the Arab embargo on the Zionist regime. In view of that, political experts are convinced that promoting and strengthening relations among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel are aimed at placing limits on independent policies and slowing down and reducing the progress of Islamic movements in the region.
