It is generally believed that Qian Qichen was referring to Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights, who openly met with Wei Jingsheng on an official visit to Beijing last month. In China, Wei Jingsheng is a criminal who has been released on parole. It was a transgression of protocol for a U.S. official -- in the country on an official visit -- to meet privately with a person who, for China, is a criminal. It was no coincidence that a U.S. official did something which did not respect the law of another country. More recently, when an American youth, Michael Fay, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and caning by a Singapore court for creating graffiti and accepting stolen property, U.S. President Clinton suggested that Singapore reconsider the sentence. One typical shortcoming of the U.S. Government is the idea that U.S. law is the law of laws and is universally applicable. If the law of a land differs from or contradicts U.S. law, it is automatically viewed as wrong in some way or not perfect enough, and the United States will even interfere with it. The same goes for human rights problems. Some people in the U.S. Government seems to think that the United States is a paragon where human rights are concerned and that only American standards of human rights can serve as a guide for the rest of the world. In fact, these people only look at other countries and ignore numerous domestic situations which flout international human rights norms. The situation of the Native American Indians is a case in point. The U.S. Government and American society have been treating the Indians unfairly, yet there have never been any "human rights warriors" in the United States taking any moral actions to address the history and present reality of the systematic annihilation of Indian culture. The U.S. Government doesn't care that prisons in California and Oregon use prisoners as cheap labor and then export these prison products. In the minds of the Americans, none of the Asian countries have "promoted human rights" in the past. During the era of the bipolar world order, many countries were lashed by the whip of U.S. "human rights" concepts and dared not raise any objections. Today, Asian countries can openly tell the United States that there are regional considerations in human rights, and, moreover, the right to regional development is one of them. This principle was expounded at last year's UN Conference on Human Rights. However, the U.S. Government is still violating this principle all the time and is continuing to interfere in other countries' internal affairs with its own human rights standards. The interference in China's human rights and Singapore's judiciary both originated from the same psychological background and show that the United States still has a hegemonic mentality. In fact, with the disappearance of the bipolar international system, a multipolar world order with a diverse political, social, economic, and cultural situation has appeared. This diversified world order values mutual respect and mutual noninterference. If the United States continues to act in a hegemonic style and intervenes in other countries at the slightest excuse, it will, in the near future, find that the regions will react strongly to counter such interventions.
