"Various official invitations from the Israeli Government should be reviewed or rejected because the aim of the visit is just to show good things," Aisyah Aminy, the House's Foreign Affairs Commission chairperson, said in response to the massacre of at least 43 Palestinians at a prayer at Ibrahim ar-Rahman mosque in Al Khalil (Hebron). After the signing of the Israeli-PLO peace accord in Washington DC. in September last year, Israel has been active in launching approaches to a number of states, including Indonesia, to persuade them to open diplomatic ties with Israel. The Jewish state has invited certain professional circles including journalists, to visit Israel. A number of Indonesian journalists visited Israel recently at the invitation of Israel. Aminy said that Israeli invitations was an effort to break isolation of the Jewish state with the rest of the world communities. She said that an invitation for journalists by Israel in the future has to be considered seriously before accepting it. The legislator said that recent massacre in Al Khalil is a result of the Israeli action which -- in violation of the United Nations resolutions 471 and 476 -- bans its citizens overseas to return to their countries of origin but to the occupied territories. Baruch Goldstein who did the massacre is a Jewish immigrant who belongs to an anti-Arab organization. Among Jews resettling in the Palestinian land are anti-Arab extremists, including Goldstein who poured bullets on Palestinian at prayers last Friday. "Indonesia must condemn the brutal act, and I believe the incident in the Ibrahim ar-Rahman Mosque will hamper the Middle East peace process," she said. The shooting at the mosque was possible due to the fact that the Israeli Government allows its citizens to possess fire arms of various calibres. "Israeli civilians must be disarmed to prevent similar incident," The member of parliament said.
