In a meeting with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), Doi reportedly said that the lower house "cannot and will not annul (the decision to summon him) as it has already issued a summons." After the meeting, Matsuoka told reporters that it is not yet decided whether Hosokawa will appear before Tuesday's budget committee session. Hosokawa, in a letter to the speaker, had asked the lower house to review the parliamentary procedures that led to his summoning. At a session of the budget committee on Thursday, its chairman, Tsuruo Yamaguchi, declared that his panel unanimously approved a proposal to summon the former prime minister. Some parties in the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata lodged a protest against the procedure, saying the committee's decision contravened a longtime parliamentary practice of authorizing such summons only when all parties approved of such a proposal. Budget committee members from the JNP and two other coalition parties, Komeito [Clean Government Party] and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], declared at Thursday's session their opposition to the proposal to summon Hosokawa.
