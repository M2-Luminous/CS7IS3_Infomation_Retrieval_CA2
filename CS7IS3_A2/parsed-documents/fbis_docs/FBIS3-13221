The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of Amol, Golpaygan, Khomeyn and Bu'inzahra, and Avej gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Majles Highlights Speeches Mr. Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, criticized the excessive imports of automobiles into the country. Elsewhere in his talk he criticized Note 10 in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget concerning the sale of hospitals and making them autonomous. He called it a disaster. Mr. Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan, mentioned creating conditions favorable to exports, reducing food crop imports, reinforcing and developing conversion industries, population control and insuring vulnerable crops as ways to make the economy grow and prosper. Legislation The Majles approved the scientific, educational, and cultural agreement between Iran and Turkmenistan. The 38-article charter for the Social Security Treatment Services Organization, which the government presented to the Majles in a bill, was approved. Seyyed Mahmud Kazemi-Dinan, Deputy From Amol All those involved in the economic war must strive to produce more. The first pre-agenda speaker was Kazemi-Dinan, deputy from Amol. He thanked the people of the province of Mazandaran for welcoming the president of the republic. He said: This trip brought with it the good news of the prosperity of Mazandaran. This will be continued by the new province management, thanks to the divine blessing of his excellency's (the governor-general's) continued efforts, and it is well-known and obvious that his beautiful leadership and planning has received a lovely and pleasing welcome from the dear nation. God willing, the God-given talents of Mazandaran will emerge in a timely and appropriate way with the help of the sacred government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passages omitted on anti-American, other statements] We have already put behind us its fourth year with steadfastness, through the efforts of the nameless powerful economic officers. Through critical management and the efforts victorious leaders and commanders in the unequal war, we have overcome the enemy's vengeful objectives and the grudges and pessimism of friends on the deadly battlefield of the complicated economic crusade. We continue ceaselessly on our path carrying out the great economic adjustment and we occupy ourselves writing the Five-Year Plan and budget before the astonished eyes of world imperialism's economic monster and despite its heavy blows, such as the drop in the price of oil. The deputy from Amol then said: Thanks are due to the planners, well-wishers, soldiers, and executive managers who were shot at from both sides by bombs and bullets. Have no fear of traveling under the leadership of the decisive commander in the former sacred defense. Under the heroic Hashemi's leadership the courageous army of love will be given matchless courage by the creator. As the famous proverb says, if 'Ali is the camel driver, he knows where to make the camel sleep and he does not fear. Kazemi-Dinan then emphasized: All those involved in the economic war must strive to produce more, in accordance with prior guidance whose expected conditions have arrived. If we exercise piety by consuming less for love of the beloved, we will defeat our rival. This is the second phase of the test, which God willing we will pass proudly, as we did the first historic test. He discussed the other imperialist plot, intended to dominate the Muslim women of our country. He said: We will make every effort to reach the goal of making serious effort to educate our sisters. However, economic planners and managers must be told, based on the fundamental guidance of His Holiness the Imam, to give priority to agriculture and we must put industry in the service of agriculture, because the existence of the noble nation depends on agricultural production. Our nation has high potential, and the governments, which have attained power, have traveled this path. This is in conflict with the goals of world imperialism. The dear farmers must understand that they are the soldiers with low expectations on this path and they strive continuously, having girded themselves under the pressure of arms and and unnecessary delays. It is no longer appropriate for organizations to sell at higher prices and for products to be more expensive while you reinforce them. In the Five-Year Plan you must support their fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, raw materials, electrical power, and water. Morteza Shayesteh, Deputy From Khansar and Golpayegan The ways to economic prosperity include population control, reduced imports, strengthening conversion industries, and insuring vulnerable crops. The next speaker was Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan and Khansar. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the birth anniversary of the prince of martyrs (peace be upon him), His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon him) and His Holiness Seyyed al-Sajedin Zeyn al-'Abedin (peace be upon him) to the Shi'ites of the world and our esteemed compatriots. He said: In view of the fact that the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill is under study and the Second Five-Year Social and Cultural Development Plan will also be studied in the near future, I consider it necessary to give my expert views on the gross national product. He added: In the year 1335 [21 March 1955-20 March 1956] food for 1.6 persons was produced on a hectare of agricultural land. In the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure reached 3.2 persons. To feed the people in our society, we must bring this figure up to 4.5 persons. Various statistics indicate that 25 to 30 percent of various foodstuffs are lost because of poor conversion and storage resources, meaning that enough food to feed 15 to 20 million people is destroyed through losses. Continuing, the speaker said: For many reasons, such as the fact that it uses little foreign exchange and earns much foreign exchange, creates employment, has potential resources and employs existing technology in the country, the agricultural sector needs to continue its rapid development. Based on existing data this sector's share in the gross domestic product [GDP] in the year 1339 [21 March 1960-20 March 1961] compared to the other sectors was 37.5 percent. In the year 1351 [21 March 1972-20 March 1973] it was 16.2 percent. In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] it was less than 10 percent of the GDP. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] it began rising and reached 23.7 percent, and in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] it reached 26.6 percent. One path to development in the economic sector is to increase investment in this sector. According to existing statistics, the agriculture sector's share in forming fixed gross domestic investment is insignificant. In the year 1352 [21 March 1973-20 March 1974] it was 19.7 percent. In the year 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] it was about 4.2 percent and in the year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] it was about 7.5 percent. Although relative attention was given to this sector after the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the sector's share of total development credits was insignificant. From 1352 to 1356 [21 March 1973-20 March 1978] this share was about 7.5 percent. From 1368 to 1372 [21 March 1989-20 March 1994] it was about 9.6 percent, so that about 1.33 rials[R] was invested for each hectare of agricultural land, or about 0.1 percent, an insignificant figure compared to the developed nations. According to existing statistics, in the years 1344 to 1362 [21 March 1965-20 March 1984], the production investment indicator in the agricultural sector was 2.36 percent, and it was 4.23 in other sectors. Again based on existing statistics, about one in three of the workers in our country works in agriculture. It is also worth mentioning: In terms of quantities, the employment structure in the economic development cycle has continually shown a decline in the agricultural sector along with increases in the industrial and service sectors. On the one hand our current society is faced with the phenomenon of unemployment and it is expected that by the year 1385 [21 March 2006-20 March 2007] our country will need 16.56 million employment opportunities. To create a job in the service sector requires investment of R2.11 million, and it costs R1.37 million in the agricultural sector. Apart from the fact that investment for agricultural employment is less than in the other sectors, it also has significant profits and is relatively advantageous. Continuing, the speaker added: Exports of agricultural and traditional goods have always made up the biggest part of nonoil exports, and in the years 1361 to 1370 [21 March 1982-20 March 1992] they grew an average of 24.3 percent. In the year 1361 agricultural goods valued at more than $255 million made up 60 percent of nonoil exports, while industrial export goods were valued at $21 million and made up about 7.5 percent of nonoil exports. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] agricultural exports increased 110 percent over the previous year. That same year industrial goods made up 12 percent of nonoil exports. He then said: These figures show agriculture's place in our nation's economy. I declare that if full attention is given to this sector, in the near future we will be able to forget about the policy of the one-product economy. At the end of his speech he made the following recommendations to achieve economic growth and prosperity: Population control, reducing losses by training producers, distributors and consumers, reinforcing and developing conversion industries, building silos, warehouses and refrigerators, writing laws and regulations in the interest of the economic sectors, especially agriculture, creating conditions favorable for exports, reducing food imports, creating cooperation and better contacts between the service sectors and the economic producing sector in such a way that the focus will be on production, insuring vulnerable crops, reinforcing and developing production cooperatives and organizing the sales market. Mohammad Baqer Tavakoli, Deputy From Khomeyn The sale of hospitals and government units and making them autonomous in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill is a disaster. Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, was the third pre-agenda speaker. He offered congratulations on Combatants and Guards Day. Concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, he said: As long as the government and the Majles are unable to reform the administrative and management structure and reduce the enormous costs in the ministries and government companies and reduce the costs of production, and as long as they cannot limit the enormous competition for consumerism, ostentation, trips abroad and seminars, by raising prices and eliminating some subsidies, we will not succeed in reducing costs. He added: Although the Majles has prohibited the purchase of passenger automobiles and the formation of companies in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget to reduce costs, unfortunately late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] a huge amount of passenger automobiles was purchased and numerous companies were formed. Although Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill was implemented on a revenue cost basis, it will include about R3 trillion in revenues for government, oil, power, and communications companies. If we consider the nation's population in the year 1373 to be 60 million, the average worker wage at 28,000 tomans and the average family to be five people, as of the year 1373 every Iranian will have an average income deficit of 5,000 tomans and every family will have an income deficit of 25,000 tomans. He added: Workers, who are the nation's real vulnerable class, will have 11 months purchasing power in 1373 compared to the year 1372. The implementation of Note 25 optimistically projects inflation at about 10 to 15 percent. Calculating the inflation in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill at about 13 to 25 percent, less an increase of 5 percent in worker wages for that year, this great class in the nation will be faced with inflation of about 20 to 35 percent. According to statistics, the government consumes about 7 million of the 48 million liters of gasoline consumed daily, and in the transportation and shipping sector the government is considered one of the major consumers. With the increase in the price of fuel and transportation costs, heavy costs will be imposed on the government. Ultimately the inflationary burden will fall on the people and the vulnerable class. He then recommended the deletion of Note 25 and discussed the matter of drugs in the country. He said: Drugs are an important and vital public need. In view of the fact that in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], because of limited foreign exchange about 20 percent of the nation's drugs were sold at the floating foreign exchange rate, regrettably I must say that treatment services and social security for this same vulnerable and wage-earning class were eliminated from insurance polices. Next year a percentage will be added to that. I therefore ask my colleagues to give special attention to this vital matter. The implementation of paragraphs Z and M of Note 10 concerning the sale of hospitals and treatment units and making them autonomous is a disaster, because this will only be practical in the major cities and Tehran and will have bad effects on the country. Continuing, Tavakoli discussed the government's failure to observe social justice in Paragraph T, Note 5 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget. He said: Again we saw and are seeing comfortable families receiving huge subsidies. For example, among electrical power subscribers, today rural and low-consumption subscribers receive monthly subsidies of 1,000 tomans. Normal consumption subscribers receive average monthly subsidies of 3,400 tomans, and comfortable and high-consumption subscribers in society receive monthly subsidies of 10,000 tomans. That is, the comfortable subscribers receive ten times the subsidies of the rural and low-income subscribers. He added: Unfortunately, credits to build rural public bath houses and to improve the rural areas in Central Province have been deleted from the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, and I ask officials to correct this error. Continuing his remarks, Tavakoli asked the minister of roads and transportation for help and cooperation in concluding the Khomeyn-Dehno project, and he asked the minister of health care, treatment and medical education for help and cooperation in elevating the expert nursing program in Khomeyn to the level of a nursing college. Majid Naderi, Deputy From Bu'in, Zahra, and Avej The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Naderi, deputy from Bu'in, Zahra and Avej. During his speech he said: Now 38 years have passed since the martyrdom of the great men whose battles and sacrifice began at a time when the dead earth was heaped over this nation, and our Islamic land was subjected to cultural, political economic and military assaults. In those days the enemies of Iran and Islam occupied the country and imposed humiliating treaties. This was done during Reza Khan's 20-year era. Making use of the so-called open political atmosphere and starting groups and political parties dependent on foreign policies, they took over the newspapers and mercenary publications and tried to destroy the freedom of the Iranian nation. It was religious zeal and enthusiasm that led to a reaction against the occupiers. He continued: After the month of Shahrivar in the year 1320 [23 August-22 September 1941] the appearance of publications such as the magazine Parcham, the newspaper MARDOM, the emergence of secular, materialist and nationalist writers and the printing of misleading books and their extensive distribution, were all definitely calculated to prevent religious unity among the various social classes. [passages omitted on Navab Safavi] Legislation Bill on the Cultural and Educational Agreement Between Iran and Turkmenistan The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art Commission on the Bill on the Cultural, Scientific and Educational Agreement Between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Turkmenistan.
