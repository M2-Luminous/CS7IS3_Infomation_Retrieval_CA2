V. Davidovich; UDC 621.372.8] [Abstract] Complex discharge modes of hollow multimode waveguides with a multilayer case are studied with a rigorous electrodynamic method based on joining of field segments and the resultant dispersion equation in a complex plane. The waveguide case is composed of magnetodielectric materials with losses. By varying the thicknesses and permeabilities of the layers and their depth in the case, one can achieve a significant broadband improvement in mode selection at high frequencies. One can also achieve this by reducing losses in the main mode at low frequencies. The figures show run losses of the first few fast modes of a cylindrical multimode dielectric waveguide with a hollow channel for various configurations of complex permittivities and permeabilities and different numbers of layers. The effect of resonant and nonresonant materials on self-filtering are explained. Figures 6; table 1; references 19: 14 Russian, 5 Western.
