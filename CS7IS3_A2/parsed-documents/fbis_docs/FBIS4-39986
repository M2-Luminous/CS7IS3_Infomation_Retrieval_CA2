A spokesman for the Aero-Space Army Command disclosed to Interfax on Saturday that Yeltsin, scheduled to visit Kyzyl, Tuva (a republic within the Russian Federation) and Blagoveschensk (the Amur region), would also go to Svobodny 18 for an on the spot decision on the construction of a space center there. He revealed that essential documents were currently being drafted at the government's request to explain the need for such a Far Eastern project. At Svobodny 18, a town where a strategic missile division was once deployed, intensive work is underway to refurbish the facilities. Launch sites are being remodelled there for small aircraft of a Rokot type. As the Aero-Space Force Commander Vladimir Ivanov has reported, the first Rokot is to be launched in 1996 from one of the five silos that has remained after the disbandment of the division in line with START. Subsequently, a new complex is to be built at Svobodny 18 for an Angara-24 heavy booster, which will be superior to the currently used Proton rocket since it is less polluting and can launch heavier loads to orbit.
