FBIS4-45224 "jptdd023__l94068" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 1 June 1994 NEAR EAST & SOUTH ASIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS `Special' Israeli Report on Syrian Role in Regional Drug `Special' Israeli Report on Syrian Role in Regional Drug Trade Detailed TA2705143594 TA2705143594 BFN [Editorial Report] The SHABAT supplement of Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 27 May carries on pages 14, 15, and 19 a 3,000-word report by Yosi Walter on Israeli efforts to combat the Lebanese drug trade. Walter asserts that "about a year ago, a special team appointed by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, which acted under a heavy veil of secrecy," acquainted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with a plan "to destroy Lebanon's poppy crops. Such an action was supposed to deal a heavy blow to the Lebanese and Syrian economies, but its primary goal was to lift one of the direst threats to Israeli society--drugs brought in from Lebanon." Walter states that the police minister's team suggested several operational options. "The first option was to destroy the poppy crops in al-Biqa'--the drug granary of Lebanon and Syria--by bombing or crop dusting. This option was ruled out because it entailed air activity in regions mostly controlled by the Syrian Army, which are covered by an efficient antiaircraft system. "The second proposed method was bacteriological warfare." It was rejected because of danger to Israeli crops. "The third and most interesting option involved genetically developed poppy seeds. These seeds grow only to half-maturity, at which time they inseminate the other plants and self-destruct. According to the plan, this chain reaction would destroy most of the poppy crops in Lebanon, and in long term, plantations in faraway countries as well. The method was given 60 to 70 percent odds--an amazing rate by any standards. The prime minister embraced the idea, granting it a $1-million budget over a five-year period. Rafi Peled, the previous police chief, was acquainted with the plan, but did not get a chance to begin its implementation. Today the plan is gathering dust at national police headquarters." Walter reports that Israeli efforts to combat the Lebanese drug peril included a "special report compiled with the objective of presenting it to the CIA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in a bid to convince Washington to think twice before removing Syria and Lebanon from its list of countries sponsoring the drug trade. The report, which was compiled by intelligence and police staffers, exposes the Syrian and Lebanese hypocrisy and fraudulence: How the Syrians and Lebanese con the whole world while getting good money for drugs." According to Walter, the report maintains that Syria supplements its meager budget by participating in the drug trade. "The report presents Syria not merely as an involved country, which sponsors the Lebanese drug business, but also as a crossroads and transit station for drug smuggling and shipments. Raw materials--mainly opium from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey--are shipped to Lebanon's al-Biqa' via Syria. The finished products--hashish, heroin, and cocaine--are shipped back from Lebanon via Syria on their way to the West, and via Iran, Turkey, and Jordan on their way to Arab countries. These drugs pass through Syrian air and sea ports." The report further claims that "Damascus does fight drug dealers, wreck poppy fields, destroy laboratories, or detain smugglers and traffickers. Its object is to solve domestic problems, rather than, God forbid, stop international trade." Describing the "almost complete Syrian supremacy" in Lebanon, Walter cites the Israeli report as stating that sometimes "Syria destroys crops in order to force Lebanese organizations to toe the Syrian line." The report is further cited on the subject of "Syria's sponsoring of drug smugglers in return for bribes." According to the report, "this method has permeated the Syrian upper echelons. Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas, for instance, supplied a notorious Lebanese drug dealer with a laissez-passer. A photocopy of the laissez-passer is included in the report. Other reports indicate that General 'Ali Dubah [name as transliterated], head of the Syrian security and intelligence division in Lebanon, issued similar permits--some in Syria and some in Lebanon." Walter further states: "Syrian Intelligence has totally taken over the port of Tripoli. Its members check every cargo item, deciding on the customs to be paid by each and every drug dealer. Some officers have branched out to the shipping business." The report mentions the names of "several high-ranking Syrian Army officers from generals on down, who are involved in these deals." Walter adds: "The main emphasis of the report is on the involvement of the upper Syrian echelons--namely, President al-Asad and his family. The report notes that while no information directly linking al-Asad to the drug business is available, some reports sustain the information claiming that he is fully aware of what goes on around him and of which of his close aides is involved in the drug trade." "Another prominent figure mentioned in the report is Rif'at al-Asad, the president's brother, whom the report describes as `an insatiable, corrupt personality.'"
