The attacks on newsmen and the lynching threats against the university caravan are just the most visible element of a tense plot that could drive the entire region into a new theater of combat. First, the shock wave of the initial explosion, which has not yet faded, evidenced the regional (and national) absence of the rule of law and even of a state apparatus that could take responsibility for solving problems. In this context it is very significant that Don Samuel Ruiz is sought after today by Indians, peasants, and workers all over the country as an intermediary in dealing with a government that has been conspicuous by its absence or that simply fails to acknowledge its responsibility to anyone. This is even more significant because one of the government's tactics has been to set up several "autonomous commissions" and "consensus-building boards" that are substituting for already existing institutions and that will supposedly help to ease the conflict and to develop, at last, sectoral solutions for ethnic groups around the country. A sort of honeymoon period of civil liberalization and rebirth inspired from below was created regionally in this vacuum. The new context evidenced the nature of the authoritarian regime, the true essence of regional cacique power, which has been sustained for several years from the center and has been embodied in the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] governors, the chiefs of small groups that have broken every law and laid waste to Chiapas at their whim. The spontaneous municipal revolt (which has now spread to a third of the state's municipalities), the teachers' rebellion, the protests by the employees of several services, the blockades of creditor banks and roads, the takeovers of ranches and large and mid-sized landholdings in Chilon, Simojovel, and elsewhere, and widespread civil disobedience, etc., have now created an environment of change that has exposed the parallel structures of the State in Chiapas: complicity and corruption, the partisan contracts awarded to several cabinet secretaries (among them, the construction firms of the Zedillo Ponce de Leon family), the indiscriminate looting of public coffers during the administrations of Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido, the fraudulent dummy companies, the systematic violation of human rights, and in particular the existence of a complex array of armed parapolice groups in the city and the countryside (the so-called "white guards") that receive weapons, training, protection, and even lands from the state and federal government and that derive at times from the very disintegration of the peasant movement, which has accelerated over the past three or four years. Chiapas once again seems to be a boiling cauldron whose special hue colors all of the forces that are remodeling themselves there. The sudden emergence of a dissatisfied citizenry is also a relatively new phenomenon (although it does have powerful forerunners in the 19th and early 20th century), because "civil society" there has expressed itself over the past 20 years almost exclusively through the peasant movement and certain fiercely persecuted opposition newspapers. The weakness of this emerging civil society, which lacks mediating sectors between the peasants and the State apparatus, which is far removed from civic-electoral matters, and which is just barely beyond the control of the State party and its elaborate networks, also explains some of the fragility of the new balances. Paradoxically as well, the strong and recurring peasant social movement reflects the entire range of hopes and dangers and very possibly foreshadows the scenarios of the immediate future; all of the paradoxes and contradictions of Chiapas society are mirrored in it. We can say today that the peasant movement, which has regrouped around the 280 associations that make up the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has a very diverse makeup, as no more than 14 organizations in it truly go beyond the local or municipal level. And although its components range from simple cooperatives and production units (and several sham groups) to more or less independent regional organizations and three overtly official ones, they all have in common a treatment of political matters that is a factor today in the movement's structural weakness and in several immediate dangers. It is on this weakness that the corporative control of the old PRI mainly rested, lubricated in recent years by the economic disbursements of Pronasol [National Solidarity Program]. As a result, the bridges that could link this widespread movement to the civic-electoral arena and thus allow for the honest election of a civilian governor of Chiapas do not, in fact, exist today. The two basic currents that began it, the radical leftist organizations of the 1970's and the so-called Mass Line, have come together here to reject a political-electoral approach. The former feel that such a struggle is "bourgeois" or a losing cause from the outset against the backdrop of a "farce." The latter are deliberately disregarding politics so that they can pursue what they have called the "policy of the two faces" (or the thousand masks), which consists of turning the peasant economic movement over to the networks of official "consensus-building," financial corruption, and the captive, corporative PRI vote. When the Salinas administration took office, some of the local advisers to the latter became second-rank federal officials of Pronasol, Sedesol [Secretariat for Social Development], or the CNC [National Peasant Confederation] and established their control over the official part of the Chiapas peasant movement: Peasant-Teacher Solidarity (Socama), ARIC [Rural Associations of Collective Interest]-Union of Unions, and to a lesser extent, the state CNC. It is for these and other reasons that in recent days the CEOIC has become one of the hubs of the Chiapas problem in discussions and battles between those who are calling for an independent, unified peasant movement and those who are trying once again to yoke the entire movement (as if nothing had happened) to the networks of the State apparatus, of the Permanent Agrarian Council (CAP), of the ruling party, and of the "advisers" of PRI and Pronasol. For the time being, in spite of opposition by the majority, attempts have been made to overturn peasant support for the besieged Zapatists (unconditional backing by the main Indian groups in the CEOIC for the EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation]). Efforts have also been made to thwart the "plan of action" of protests, marches, rallies, peaceful takeovers, and widespread resistance and to legitimize in the CEOIC's eyes the presence of advisers to President Salinas de Gortari (such as Javier Gil of UNORCA [National Union of Autonomous Regional Peasant Organizations] and of the CAP) or to bring in as leaders of the process the "Three Wise Men" of the "autonomous" commission (appointed, but of course, by Salinas and Gonzalez Garrido on 8 January): writer Eraclio Zepeda, Patrocinist [partisan of Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido] anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Castellanist [partisan of former Governor Absalon Castellanos] Senator Eduardo Robledo, who is also seeking the PRI nomination for state governor. In this context, the nascent CEOIC, which has achieved a fleeting unity that would have been unthinkable before the explosion (inasmuch as the movement was seriously divided and at odds), would paradoxically be the "natural base" of support for rebuilding PRI domination in Chiapas. The philanthropic ogre is thus endeavoring to lead its "favorite sons," the peasants of Chiapas, once again down the sinuous pathways of the "Laberinto de la Pronasoledad" [Labyrinth of Pronasolitude]. The promises of loans and aid of all kinds, the control of some leaders, the promotional roundup and transporting of people to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, Sedesol's gift of 10 vans to the CEOIC, and many other promises and traps are already being strewn in the path of this nascent organization, this brand-new grass-roots alliance that will have to become one of the guarantors of a local transition to democracy. Nevertheless, most of the groups that make up the CEOIC (the rank and file much more than their advisers), including the battered state CNC, are still alerting domestic and international public opinion "to prevent the CEOIC from becoming another of the instruments of control and manipulation that the federal and state governments are using to avoid addressing the real causes of the social, political and military violence that is wounding Chiapas and the country." (LA JORNADA, 16 February 1994, p 14) If the horizon were to become even more cloudy and if the fancy footwork that the Salinas advisers are doing were to be successful (once again plugging up the hole that the insurrection has opened up in society), some of today's clouds could turn stormy and develop into extremely dangerous situations, such as a turbulent regional civil war. This depends on the evolution of the State's two policies towards the conflict: the mediation of Manuel Camacho Solis, on the one hand, and the political-military siege of the insurgents, on the other. The former policy is weakened by the fact that it binds only the current government (and the Executive Branch more than the subordinate Legislature and Judiciary), which also has just a few months of nominal power left. It is constrained by the fact that the meager legal representativeness of the "mediator" and the EZLN could turn the negotiations into mere "sessions." The latter could turn into a structural solution that in the long run would lead to a low-intensity counterinsurgency that would seek to involve the communities in the highlands and the forest, especially after a military assault on the regions controlled by the rebels. This scenario, unfortunately, is not being ruled out and is already to be seen in several respects: the tightening of the military siege and the creation of the 38th Military Zone in Tenosique; the erratic, irresponsible actions of the government of Absalon Castellanos's former education secretary, Javier Lopez Moreno (appointed from the center, like his corrupt predecessors and accomplices); the traditional repression of the civilian insurrectionists in the municipalities; Los Pinos support for the traditional caciques; and the false promises to "audit" the humblest representatives of a true Mafia (the mayors and lower-level officials), without even trying to do anything about the widespread impunity of the State apparatus in the region (it has always enjoyed a complete, permanent amnesty). The greatest danger, however, looms in the regions in conflict, in which the Salinas administration has not renounced violence as a solution. The forerunner of the future counterinsurgent "civil patrols" (which resemble the ones that are laying waste to the Guatemalan countryside today) was created in Ocosingo in 1992 to deal with the agrarian insecurity prompted by the ongoing invasions of ranches and estates. Called the "Citizen Defense Unions," they were armed and trained, according to the ranchers themselves, by the Federal Army and can already claim several evictions and assaults, as well as prior confrontations with the Zapatists. The next step can be seen coming: using the official peasant organizations in the forest region, especially the ARIC-Union of Unions (which is bitter over the support of several of "its" communities for the Zapatists) to provoke confrontations, to create an unpopulated corridor by relocating refugees, to intone official propaganda (which would be pro-peasant and pro-Indian) against the rebels, to administer the new disbursements of Pronasol, and to manipulate the displaced persons (as the pro-PRI ranchers in Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas have already done). All of these actions would pave the way for the final "siege and annihilation" of the rebels by the Federal Army. There is still time to prevent such a scenario if the government acts in good faith, if the peace negotiations pan out, if intelligent, creative actions are taken (a democratic opening, participation of all parties and forces in a new social pact, comprehensive agrarian reform...), and if the basic premise is that we are looking at a radically new situation. But if the Federal Government remains "tied up in knots" and thinks only about the partisan interests of the small "interest group" and its multimillionaire sponsors or if it continues to act as it has, perpetuating landowner domination of Chiapas and the wild-eyed centralism and presidentialism of the president and his friends, who have done so much harm to the country (in a word, the ignoble peace before the explosion), then we will be hurtling towards a precipice that could engulf the country in violence for several years. As the rebels have been proclaiming since 1 January and the citizens of the entire country have been proclaiming for some time now, a solution to the Chiapas conflict is possible only through a true national transition to democracy. Political parties, which have been overtaken by events, must realize that the fate of the entire nation is at stake in Chiapas and that it is not just some minor obstacle on the campaign trail. It is that easy and that difficult.
