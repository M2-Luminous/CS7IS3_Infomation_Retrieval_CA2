Background The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 580 (the ``HTR''), to add 500.524, implementing Executive Order 12932, which authorizes all transactions on or after October 16, 1994, involving property in which Haiti or its nationals have an interest, and all other transactions previously prohibited by the HTR. The effect of this amendment is to authorize all transactions previously prohibited by subpart B of the HTR or by Executive Order 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920 or 12922, effective October 16, 1994. On October 14, 1994, the President signed Executive Order 12932, terminating the national emergency declared with respect the de facto regime in Haiti and revoking all Executive orders promulgated with respect to that emergency, effective October 16, 1994. Newly authorized transactions include, but are not limited to, new investment, otherwise lawful importations from and exportations to Haiti, and brokering transactions. Reports due under general or specific license must still be filed covering activities up until the effective date of this rule. Enforcement actions with respect to past violations of the sanctions are not affected by this rule. Because the HTR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
