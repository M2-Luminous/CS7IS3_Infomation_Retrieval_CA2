Slovakia cannot accept the linkage of border issues with the situation of ethnic minorities, he adds. However, the idea of Balladur's plan has evolved and the text is still being discussed, says Kukan. "I think the authors of the plan have adopted some of our positions," he states. The new cabinet has been harshly criticised by Meciar's opposition for its allegedly too accommodating approach to the Czech Republic, says Kukan. "Just slamming the door in case of some discord is very easy," he comments on this. "In the election campaign there will certainly emerge politicians who try to play the tune that we are yielding to Prague," he states. Kukan says he does not cherish any illusion that Slovak-Hungarian problems will be resolved quickly. However, we have proposed talks on the readmission agreement and a temporary water regime for the Danube River, as well as other issues to Budapest, he adds. Asked what Americans think about Slovakia, Kukan, former Slovak Ambassador to the United Nations, says that ordinary Americans do not know much about the country. When some of them planned to travel to Slovakia, they asked us about security in the country. Lots of them still mistake us for the former Yugoslavia, explains Kukan.
