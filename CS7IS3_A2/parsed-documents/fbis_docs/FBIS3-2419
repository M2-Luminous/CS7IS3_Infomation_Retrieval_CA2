Alliance chairman, Guy Lam, told Eastern Express yesterday that ACE, which will be officially launched today, would make written submissions to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments on the issue within the next few weeks. The party will initially seek support from returning migrants, although Lam said ACE would aim for a wider band of supporters in the runup to next year's Legislative Council elections. Lam, 39, a solicitor who holds a Canadian passport, said the issue of right of abode after 1997 for an estimated 500,000 foreign passport holders -- many of whom are Hong Kong born Chinese--would be a priority for ACE. His comments came as the Secretary for Security, Alistair Asprey, told the Legislative Council yesterday that the Government had yet to reach an agreement with China on the alignment of the Immigration Ordinance with the Basic Law, including the provision of right of abode for foreign residents. In a written reply to a question from Leong Che-hung, Asprey said the Government would publish a guide as soon as an agreement was reached on the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Lam said the Basic Law, which regards all foreign passport holders as non-Chinese citizens, was "vague" and "open to interpretation" on the issue of right of abode. "We shall be making ourselves known to both governments after our launch," he said. "We need something that is much more elaborate than what exists. We are working towards a proposal or some kind of formula to be presented to the Chinese government that will be fair and open to the people of Hong Kong. "It will be very comprehensive and detailed and something more than just brief comments by Chinese officials." Lam said a legally binding agreement could be necessary to ensure that right of abode was granted fairly. "We want it to be a legally binding agreement but if not, it should be formulated in such a way that would clearly ensure foreign passport holders after 1997 can retain right of abode," he said. He said ACE, which has an initial membership of 20 local and expatriate businessmen and professionals, would also closely follow the localisation of the Civil Service and the issue of allowing legislative councillors to hold foreign citizenship after 1997. "Ours is a pragmatic approach although some may call it conservative -- a word I don't like to use. One of our priorities is the continued economic prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," Lam said. "We don't want to rock the boat, and, therefore the sensible person, whether he or she holds a foreign passport or not, who agrees with our stance will support us. "I think the sensible person will agree that Hong Kong's success is built to some extent on foreign expertise, and that foreign expertise is brought to Hong Kong by returning migrants and expatriates." ACE, which began preparing for its launch just over a year ago, will field several candidates, including Lam, in direct elections and in functional constituencies in next year's elections. "We will be targeting returning migrants but we will limit our activity to Hong Kong. We won't be trying to expand ourselves overseas," Lam said. "The best way to become known is through our performance."
