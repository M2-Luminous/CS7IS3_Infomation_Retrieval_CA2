The only other possibility is a government made up of the League, the Party of the Democratic Left and the Italian Popular Party. If we returned to the polls, not a single representative of the League would be elected to parliament". Berlusconi is right when he says that he cannot take anymore, continued Fini. " How can one carry on negotiations with someone who goes back on what they said the day before".
