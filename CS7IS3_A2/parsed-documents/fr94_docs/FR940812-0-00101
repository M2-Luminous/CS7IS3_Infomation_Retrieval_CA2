The State shall submit all of the SLAMS data according to the same data submittal requirements as defined for NAMS in section 58.35. The State shall also submit any portion or all of the SLAMS data to the appropriate Regional Administrator upon request. 4. Section 58.35 is revised to read as follows: §58.35 NAMS data submittal. (a) The requirements of this section apply to those stations designated as both SLAMS and NAMS by the network description required by §§58.20 and 58.30. (b) The State shall report to the Administrator all ambient air quality data for SO 2 , CO, O 3 , NO 2 , Pb, and PM-10 and information specified by the AIRS Users Guide (Volume II, Air Quality Data Coding, and Volume III, Air Quality Data Storage) to be coded into the AIRS&hyph;AQS format. Such air quality data and information must be submitted directly to the AIRS&hyph;AQS via either electronic transmission or magnetic tape, in the format of the AIRS&hyph;AQS, and in accordance with the quarterly schedule described in paragraph (c) of this section. (c) The specific quarterly reporting periods are January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31. The data and information reported for each reporting period must: (1) Contain all data and information gathered during the reporting period. (2) Be received in the AIRS&hyph;AQS within 90 days after the end of the quarterly reporting period. For example, the data for the reporting period January 1-March 31, 1994 are due on or before June 30, 1994. (d) Air quality data submitted for each reporting period must be edited, validated, and entered into the AIRS&hyph;AQS for updating (within the time limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section) pursuant to appropriate AIRS&hyph;AQS procedures. The procedures for editing and validating data are described in the AIRS Users Guide, Volume II Air Quality Data Coding. (e) This section does not permit a State to exempt those SLAMS which are also designated as NAMS from all or any of the reporting requirements applicable to SLAMS in Section 58.26. 5.

In Appendix A, section 4.1 is revised to read as follows: Appendix A_Quality Assurance Requirements for State and Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) * * * * * 4.1␣Quarterly Reports. For each quarter, each reporting organization shall report to AIRS&hyph;AQS directly (or via the appropriate EPA Regional Office for organizations not direct users of AIRS) the results of all valid precision and accuracy tests it has carried out during the quarter. The quarterly reports of precision and accuracy data must be submitted consistent with the data reporting requirements specified for air quality data as set forth in §58.35(c). Each organization shall report all collocated measurements including those falling below the levels specified in section 5.3.1. Do not report results from invalid tests, from tests carried out during a time period for which ambient data immediately prior or subsequent to the tests were invalidated for appropriate reasons, or from tests of methods or analyzers not approved for use in SLAMS monitoring networks under Appendix C of this part. * * * * * 7. Appendix A is amended by removing section 4.3, including Figure A&hyph;1 (for reporting accuracy data), and Figure A&hyph;2 (for reporting precision data). Appendix A is also amended following Table A&hyph;1 by removing the two data quality assessment reporting forms and the table labeled ``Information to be Contained on the Back of the Data Reporting Forms''. 8. Appendices A, B, and C are amended by revising the words ``Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory'' to read ``Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory'' in the following places: a. Appendix A, Sections 2.3.1 and 2.4; b. Appendix A, Section 4; c. Appendix A, References 2 and 3; d. Appendix B, Section 2.3.1; e. Appendix B, References 2, 3, 6, and 7; and f.
