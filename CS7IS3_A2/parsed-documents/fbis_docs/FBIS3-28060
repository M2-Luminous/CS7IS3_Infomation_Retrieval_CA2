As a result of an almost fanatical commitment to keeping secret the inner workings of their organization, almost nothing is known by outsiders about the leadership of one of the world's most resilient guerrilla movements. But two of the KR's most powerful and prominent of their small group of top leaders have been purged over policy differences since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, the POST has learned. Ieng Sary -- long time member of the Party standing committee, Foreign Minister during the KR rule, in charge of the Party's economic portfolio, and liaison for all Chinese military and financial aid until the Paris Agreements --has been stripped of power in a bitter break within the organization. [passage omitted] Son Sen -- also a member of the Party standing committee, the Minister of Defence, and one of the two official KR members of the Supreme National Council [SNC] set up by the Paris Peace agreements to administer the country prior to election -- was relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high level dispute over whether the KR should pull out of the UN organized peace plan. He supported entering into the phase of the peace agreements that called for the four warring factions in June 1992 to demobilize their armies. [passage omitted] The revelation of Son Sen's dismissal from his position as KR Minister of Defence is particularly important as it is the first firm evidence of high level debate within the leadership over whether to pull out of the UN sponsored peace process and elections in May 1992. [passage omitted] Purges of senior officials within the KR are of course part of their legacy. Indeed, a majority of the top officials of the KR who came to power in the party and state organs after their 197 victory were executed during their 3 and 1/2 year rule. There is no indication that disagreements among leaders are resolved by execution in recent years. Son Sen was days away from being arrested and most certainly executed in late 1978 during the waning days of the KR regime. He was saved ironically, by the Vietnamese invasion in late 1978, according to recent analysis of confessions of other party cadre at Tuol Sleng prison, Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder told the POST. A former deputy Prime Minister in charge of defence during the KR years in power and an alternate on the Standing Committee, Son Sen is a graduate of the Sorbonne and was a director of one of Phnom Penh's most prestigious universities before fleeing to the "maquis" in 1963. While defence minister throughout the 1980's of the guerrilla army, he began to rise further in influence in 1987 when the KR prepared him for future political role as they prepared for a political solution to the war. [passage omitted] Son Sen argued, during April and May 1992, that the KR's future also depended on remaining sincere in the eyes of the world for desiring a peaceful, political solution to Cambodia's conflict and participating in a democratically elected coalition government. To pull out would undermine the groups already rock bottom credibility both domestically and internationally which the KR continue to see as vital to reestablishing their ability to play a role in future Cambodian affairs. This period also marked the dismantling of a carefully developed group of tactical and strategic military alliances with FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], the KPNLF [Khmer People's National Liberation Front], China, the United States, and other powers. The absence of this decade old alliance, which provided political credibility to the KR cause, left the group dangerously isolated and vulnerable. Some leaders saw a pullout from the peace process as resulting in isolation they believed would cause an unacceptable degree of political damage. These arguments did not prevail during high level meetings of the leadership held near the Thai border in May 1992. As a result of his purge, sources say Son Sen went through a period of what appears to be reeducation from June to December 1992, when he is said to have agreed that he had been mistaken in his initial views. His change of heart came when Sihanouk himself in December 1992 began to publicly condemn the UN operation and indicate that a provisional government should be formed under Sihanouk's leadership and elections perhaps abandoned. Internally, the KR interpreted this as Sihanouk entering into an alliance with them to oppose the UN operation and elections. Son Sen is expected to play a role in the future in KR political activities, sources say, but his influence remains far less than before and he no longer has a military role. Ieng Sary's demise came in 1992 after years of friction within the party. He was in charge of foreign relations during the KR rule, and most of the intellectuals who came back to Cambodia after the KR victory in 1975 were under his charge. Hundreds perished, and others, distrusted by the Party, were kept in reeducation camps or virtual prisoners doing menial work in state ministries. After the KR fled to the jungle in 1979, Ieng Sary caused a major rift within the Party by acknowledging to a journalist the existence of the Tuol Sleng torture center in which at least 16,000 people died -- mostly party cadres and their families. He also appeared to criticize the leadership by saying he was out of the country when certain senior KR officials were arrested and executed. This was seen as a breach of solidarity within the KR who hold firmly to collective decision making that strictly prohibits independent public statements by leaders on political and policy issues. But Ieng Sary had the support of the Chinese, who insisted that all covert Chinese assistance -- both military and financial -- be passed through him. As a result he was in charge of the Finance portfolio and disbursement of weapons, which gave him significant power. But he is known to have had several disputes with Pol Pot in the late 1980's, and angered many field commanders and intellectuals for his autocratic style and abrasive personality. When the signing of the Paris agreements ended all Chinese direct support to the faction, Ieng Sary's influence diminished. His headquarters, along the Phnom Malai escarpment on the Thai border, was also the center for KR diplomatic operations and housed the group's intellectuals and their families. Intellectuals, many who hold him in contempt, moved their headquarters and families to another KR base in 1993, further isolating Ieng Sary. While he still controls a small swath of territory in western Cambodia, he no longer controls significant troops or money, and appears to have been removed from the standing committee. Some sources say he retains an "observer status" on the standing committee. KR sources say that he has permanently lost influence within the decision making structure of the party and army. While Pol Pot is said to remain in full overall control of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and its political wing -- the Party of Democratic Kampuchea -- through his position as chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Party, there has also emerged a group of younger military commanders and intellectuals who have risen in influence and are being groomed for power. While the KR officially dissolved their communist party in December 1981, and announced they supported a "liberal parliamentary democracy," most analysts dismissed the claim. They said it was designed to attract united front allies among other Cambodian factions who also opposed the new Vietnamese controlled government in Cambodia. It was also seen as an attempt to draw western political support for a coalition anti-Vietnamese resistance group that formed along the Thai border to wage war against the Vietnamese and their installed government. Similarly dismissed were KR public announcements in the mid-1980 that the three top ranking members of Party -- Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ta Mok -- also "retired." Evidence is strong that most of the same "old guard" leadership that comprised the last official standing committee before 1981 remain in control of the organization today continuing to carry out essentially the same functions they have since the late 1970's. Pol Pot remains a highly effective and respected figure among the top cadres, who view him as the one man who can bridge differences among other leaders. He spends much of his time developing political strategy. He rarely travels to bases and is said to almost never meet cadre under the rank of division commander. Described as a "genius" by his supporters, he is said to be a remarkable orator and occasionally delivers lectures. He still officially holds the title of director of research at a KR military "institute." Many cadre worry that if the 66 year old leader were to die there would be no one to replace him and major infighting could break out within the leadership. Also remaining in the same position, is the little known Nuon Chea, who has been described as Pol Pot's "alter ego." He fled to the jungle with Pol Pot in 1963, and has made one public appearance since then -- in the late 1970's to a Danish communist party. He is in charge of party organization, deputy supreme commander of the armed forces, and number 2 on the standing committee. It is Ta Mok, the number three on the standing committee, who has seen a significant rise of influence since the Paris agreements. He serves as chief of the general staff of the KR army and military commander of the northern region. But when, in 1992, Son Sen gave up control of 6 Divisions under his control, they fell under the command of Ta Mok, who now controls at least 12 Divisions and is responsible for KR cadre and troops from the northwestern Thai border, throughout the north and the entire eastern region abutting Vietnam. This gives him control of perhaps 70 percent of the KR army and most of the country. The one-legged commander is of peasant origin and controlled the southwestern military region during the KR years. It was troops under his command who carried out campaigns against "internal enemies," attacks on Vietnam, and arrests of other KR leaders before the Vietnamese invasion. As a result he has earned the nickname "the butcher." But despite his fierce reputation among foreigners and other Cambodians, Ta Mok engenders tremendous loyalty among his forces. His troops are said to [be] well paid, fed, and armed, and their morale remains high and their commitment to the KR cause strong. But as would be natural in any organization with aging leaders, a new, younger group of political and military leaders are currently rising in power within the organization. In 1987, according to KR sources, Pol Pot issued a directive to groom this younger generation of leaders. On the military side, a group of about 7 commanders -- division level or higher -- now form a collective committee that proposes military tactics and strategy which is submitted for approval to the standing committee. In their 40's and 50's, virtually all of this group fled to the jungle with Pol Pot to join the underground revolution between 1963 and 1967. Many were students or teachers in urban areas when they joined the movement, but have spent virtually their entire adult lives in the jungle. They hold significant power because of the trust given to them by the leadership, and, importantly, because they control "concrete forces." It is these leaders who have long exerted direct control over troops, administer civilians in their "liberated zones", are trained in and conduct "political work" among their rank and file and the peasantry, and disburse funding and oversee economic activity in their zones of control. Their practical experience gives them as much the role of "governor" as military commander in the 20 percent of Cambodia controlled by the KR. Included in the group of 7 are important family ties as well. So Hong, the commander of Military Zone 1002, is a nephew of Pol Pot and was a senior official in the KR Foreign Ministry during their years in power. Mit Nikorn, who was elevated to the position of commander in charge of all western military forces in 1992 with at least 5 divisions under his command, is the younger brother of Son Sen. And Ta Mok has at least one son and one son-in-law who are powerful division level field commanders. Family ties play a vital role in Cambodian culture and, consequently, in access to power in Cambodia politics, including the KR. Son Sen's wife is in charge of propaganda for the Party. Ieng Sary's wife, Ieng Thirit, was minister of social affairs during the KR rule and continued to wield significant influence until her decline accompanied her husband's in recent months. She also suffers from ill health. She, significantly, is also the sister of Khieu Ponnary, Pol Pot's wife until the mid-1980's. Khieu Ponnary suffered a mental breakdown in the late 1980's and was divorced from Pol Pot. He has taken a new wife by which he has two young children. It is generally agreed by observers that the severing of direct family links between Pol Pot and Ieng Sary after the divorce played an important role in the purging of Ieng Sary. There are three primary power bases that now make up the KR. Aside from the all powerful standing committee and the younger collective of military commanders, there is a group of younger political cadre who analyze, carry out, and formulate political policy for the KR. Made up of about 15 highly educated intellectuals who have been with the movement since the 1960s -- and a lesser amount [in] the early 1970's -- they have mostly served in KR diplomatic posts and advisors to the top leaders until the Paris agreements. Many senior intellectuals have quietly left the movement in the 1980's complaining that the organization remained hostile to real change and they were only being used to put an "acceptable face" to the KR. In Nov. 1992, the KR announced the formation of the Great National Union Party and listed 10 intellectuals as its founding members. Headed by Khieu Samphan and Son Sen, all the men are well known technocrats who have been with the organization since before they came to power in 1975. Its members -- all with advanced degrees from European universities -- include one lawyer, three economists, one mathematician, four engineers, and an educator. In the announcement of the new party, there was no mention of the hard-line figures that are said to remain in real control of the party. They announced that the founders of the new party would play the leading role for them in any national reconciliation government that emerged from the peace process. While dismissed by most scholars and analysts as merely a front group with no real decision making authority independent from the old guard remaining in the jungle, they nevertheless have seen an increase in power and influence as the KR increasingly becomes a political movement.
