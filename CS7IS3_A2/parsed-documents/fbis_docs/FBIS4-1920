Investments in fixed assets were up 15 percent from 1992 to reach 1.59 billion yuan, guaranteeing a sustained and healthy development of the regional economy. Judging from a comprehensive analysis of the situation last year, remarkable achievements were made in the capital construction of telecommunications in Tibet. In communications, achievements were made mainly in upgrading the existing highways and ensuring their traffic. Investments in energy were focused on the construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power stations. As Tibet's electricity is mostly generated by hydroelectric power plants, the region paid particular attention to ensure power supply during winter drought season for the next two years. In transport, the annual plan for renovating major highways was completed on schedule. Last year the region invested 300 million yuan in highway capital construction. Maintenance and construction proceeded relatively smoothly on the Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, the three major national highways in which the Ministry of Communications invested and are covered by the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and the 10-Year Program. The reconstruction of the (?Xigaze-Gonggar) highway, a key regional construction project, was started last October. After completion, the highway will improve the traffic condition between Lhasa and Shannan. In aviation construction, expansion of the Gonggar Airport was completed and put into operation. The project to upgrade the main runway of the (?Baingoin) Airport was basically completed. Last year, construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power stations, two key regional projects, overfulfilled the annual construction plan with good quality. An investment of 240 million yuan was made in the construction of the (Yanghu) water-pumping and pumped storage station; and the station's first generating unit is expected to generate electricity on schedule at the end of 1995. At that time, the problem of power supply for production and everyday life in Lhasa will be solved once and for all. The (Chalong) power station in Nagqu was throttled last year ahead of schedule. The whole project is expected to be completed and put into operation in 1996. To alleviate the current power shortage, the Lhasa thermal power plant, in which 14 million yuan was invested to upgrade its technology, was put into operation last December. The total investment scale in 1994 will reach 2.05 billion yuan, and most of the investment will be spent on projects related to infrastructure.
