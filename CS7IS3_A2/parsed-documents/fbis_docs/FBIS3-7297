Among other things, the prime minister stressed the need for deregulation to close the commodity price gap between home and abroad. With plans to finalize its voluntary market-opening package in late June, the government has now set up within the ARH a working group to promote imports, following the earlier establishment of a working group to study deregulation in the housing and land sectors. At the working group's inaugural meeting held this morning, Prime Minister Hosokawa said no one needed to study everything that went on during the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks to realize Japan was expected to build an open economy and society. Promotion of this effort would lead to the correction of and reduction in the commodity price gap between home and abroad, he added. A specialist from the private sector, who is also a member of the working group, suggested at today's meeting that to correct the price gap Japan should ease regulations which are tighter than in most other countries.
