Launch preparations for Japan's first purely domestically produced rocket have been completed, and only some detailed work remains to be done. The two satellites to be launched in the H-II will be the OREX, the orbital reentry experimental vehicle for the HOPE, Japan's version of an unmanned space shuttle now being developed; and the VEP mini satellite, a payload to verify the H-II's performance. The 12-meter-tall satellite fairing containing these two satellites was slowly moved on a trailer from the satellite fairing hangar at 0250 on 18 January, taking about two hours to travel the two kilometers between the hangar and the Yoshinobu launch pad launch-test tower. Then four cables lifted the fairing up about 40 meters, where it was docked to the rocket, which had already been placed in the launch tower.
