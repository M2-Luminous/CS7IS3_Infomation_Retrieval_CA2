The political coordination group of the Party of the Democratic Left is holding a meeting and will discuss the proposal of party secretary Achille Occhetto to extend a hand to the Center in order to form a stronger opposition. However, the signals coming from the Center toward the new government are discordant. Guido Dell'Acquila reports: [Begin recording of Mario Segni, Pact for Italy leader] I thought [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi was going to chose an AC Milan-type soccer team, in other words, a team full of champions, a team capable of being an international force. Instead he has put together a team which is somewehere between the first and second division. [end recording] [Dell'Acquila] Segni was using a soccer metaphor in order to explain his opposition to the newly formed government. However, in the galaxy that is the center of Italian politics, there are a multitude of differing opinions. For example, the former members of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy are trying to form a relationship with the Berlusconi government. [Begin recording of Alberto Michelini, head of the Liberal Democrat Foundation] We must respect democratically the decision of the Italian people, of the electors. I believe that the government must be given a chance and so our opposition is one which does not have any prejudices. Our position will be determined by concrete facts. [end recording] However, the largest centrist party is the Italian Popular Party [PPI], where the left led by Bindi and Mattarella is most definitely opposed to the government of Silvio Berlusconi, but where the emerging group led by Roberto Formigoni has a completely different stance. [Begin Formigoni recording] If it were necessary, and if the government's program were acceptable, then I believe that some PPI senators -- in fact, I hope that party as a whole -- will abstain in the confidence vote in order to support the government so that it can get off the ground. Once this is over then there will be everything to play for. [end recording]
