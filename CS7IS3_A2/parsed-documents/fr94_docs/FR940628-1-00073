FR940628-1-00073 FR940628-1-00014 The agency has concluded that the two metrics with the best correlation to accident statistics are tilt table angle, a static measurement, and critical sliding velocity, a metric calculated from static and dynamic vehicle measurements and expressed as velocity, i.e., units of feet per second, miles per hour, or kilometers per hour. Tilt table angle includes the influences of the vehicle's mass, center of gravity height, track width, and suspension movement, all of which are physically related to rollover stability. Because it does not require an independent measurement of center of gravity height, it is more practicable, less costly, and more repeatable than most static rollover metrics. Critical sliding velocity includes the roll moment of inertia as well as the various static factors mentioned above in its calculation. The Technical Assessment Paper found critical sliding velocity alone to have less correlation with rollover accident statistics than tilt table angle, but found it to be a statistically significant addition to a model already containing tilt table angle. However, an error in the computation of critical sliding velocity was made in the Technical Assessment Paper. When the logistic regression was repeated with the correct critical sliding velocity values and data for more vehicle make/models and additional accident years, NHTSA found the correlation of critical sliding velocity to accident statistics for all light duty vehicles grouped together and for the light truck and passenger car categories to be better than that for tilt table angle. The Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper contains the corrected analysis. B. Analysis of Importance of Factors 1. Additional Analyses Since the ANPRM Since the ANPRM, new vehicles have been added to the data base and their metrics measured. Several make/models have been tested in different configurations to determine the range of metrics within a make/model, given the different available original equipment options. Also included are several make/models of trucks and vans with anti-lock brakes as standard equipment and several make/models of high sales volume passenger cars equipped with anti-lock brakes. A complete list of all vehicles measured to date, their tilt table angles and critical sliding velocities, and the ratio of the number of rollovers involving a particular vehicle model to the number of single vehicle accidents involving the same model (RO/SVA) in Michigan from 1986 through 1990 can be found in Docket 91&hyph;68, Notice 2. 2. Predictive Power of the Metrics The agency performed two types of analyses attempting to separate the influence of driver characteristics, road, and environmental variables in the accident data so that the effect of vehicle rollover stability could be isolated. A logistic regression analysis individually considered every accident in a very large data base. Make/models represented in a great number of accidents influenced the results more than make/models with fewer accidents. A linear regression analysis was also done on the rollover risk of make/models, adjusted for differences in driver and road characteristics within their individual accident data bases, but not weighted by differences in accident numbers. The two analyses are discussed in detail in the Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper. These analyses were conducted using three statistical models: (a) A model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics; (b) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and critical sliding velocity; and (c) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and tilt table angle. For the purposes of comparison, the analyses were limited to accidents involving those make/models for which the agency had both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity data. This results in an equal number of accidents, or observations (88,397), in each statistical model. The logistic regression predicts whether a single vehicle accident will be a rollover based on the factors in a particular model. Then the predicted outcomes of the individual accidents are compiled to predict a rollover risk (rollovers per single vehicle accident) for each of the 128 make/models for which the agency has data on both metrics. This predicted risk is then compared to the actual risk known from accident data on these make/models. Two numbers are presented in the table below for each of the statistical models. The first is the percent variability explained by the comparison of the rollover risk predicted by the logistic regression model and the actual rollover risk. The second number is the percentage of the variability unexplained by the model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics which is explained by the addition of either tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity. For example, the driver/road/environmental model leaves 77 percent of the variability in the data unexplained; 23 percent is explained. When tilt table angle was added to the model to represent vehicle stability, 65 percent of the variability in rollover risk was explained. The difference between the 77 percent unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model and the 35 percent unexplained variability of the driver/road variable plus tilt table angle model is 42 percent, which is 55 percent of the unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model (42 percent/77 percent). Slightly more than half of the variability unaccounted for by driver and road characteristics was explained by the addition of tilt table angle. Thus, the logistic regression analysis indicates that stability, as measured by tilt table angle, is an important predictor of the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Substitution of critical sliding velocity produced similar results. A complete discussion of the results of these analyses can be found in the Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper in the docket.
