FBIS4-46733 "jpusr059___94024" FBIS-USR-94-059 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 8 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Kabardino-Balkaria Decree on Fighting Crime Kabardino-Balkaria Decree on Fighting Crime 944F0733C Nalchik KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA in Russian 8 Apr 94 p 2 944F0733C Nalchik KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA Russian CSO [Kabardino-Balkar Republic [KBR] Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 37, issued 3 March 1994: "On Efforts by the Nalchik City Administration To Maintain Public Order and Combat Crime, With Consideration for the Requirements of a KBSSR Presidential Edict Issued on 16 January 1992, `On Urgent Measures To Improve Law and Order in the KBSSR'"] [Text] The KBR Cabinet of Ministers notes that issues pertaining to maintenance of public order and anti-crime efforts account for a significant share of the work done by the Nalchik City Administration. It is making efforts to ensure compliance with laws and create the proper conditions for the functioning of law enforcement agencies, including public safety militia units (local militia). A number of measures of an organizational, financial and physical support nature have been implemented for the purpose of supporting law enforcement agencies, in particular militia units. However, despite the measures that have been taken the crime situation in the republic capital remains difficult, with the number of serious crimes increasing by 19.4 percent and the number of crimes committed by minors up by 56 percent. The overall apprehension rate is 45.3 percent, below the republic-wide figure. There is no clear-cut interaction between various internal affairs departments. Crime prevention efforts are poorly organized, including efforts to prevent recidivism. Economic crime is occurring on a large scale. Proper interaction between internal affairs agencies, the tax service and the Tax Police Department has not been developed in connection with efforts to combat this type of crime. Serious shortcomings have been noted in the operations of the city court, and procuratorial oversight is not sufficiently effective. Physical and technical support for law enforcement agencies is not up to modern standards. There continues to be a shortage of vehicles, telephone and radio communications equipment and many other types of special equipment. The 2nd Internal Affairs Department lacks office space, the city court is housed in two buildings, and the city procuracy lacks normal working conditions. The problem of how to provide housing for members of law enforcement agencies is acute. Thus far the city administration has not made full use of the powers granted it to maintain law and order and monitor the operations of internal affairs agencies. A plan for priority anti-crime measures in the KBR in 1993 that was approved by a Republic Supreme Soviet decree on 27 April 1993 has not yet been fully implemented. The KBR Cabinet of Ministers hereby resolves: 1. to note that measures taken by the Nalchik City Administration to protect public order and combat crime in the republic's capital are inadequate. 2. in view of the difficult crime situation in the city of Nalchik, to instruct the Nalchik City Administration to draw up during the second quarter of 1994, in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs and other law enforcement agencies, priority measures to improve protection of public order in the city and to prevent and investigate serious crimes. 3. that the Nalchik City Administration (S. B. Abrokov) shall: -- increase its demands on the heads of city internal affairs departments and personally oversee their efforts to combat violations of the law; -- take effective measures to reverse the decline in public activism with regard to preservation of public order, and by 1 July 1994 arrange for the establishment of volunteer citizens' patrols through major labor collectives, providing them with material incentives and reestablishing public law enforcement posts; -- focus greater attention on improving the working and living conditions of persons employed by law enforcement agencies and judges, providing them with office space and housing in a timely manner; during the first half of 1994 make private garden plots, parcels of land for individual construction and loans for those purposes available to the aforementioned personnel; by the end of 1994 fully provide members of the militia, the procuracy and judges with telephones in their offices and homes; complete by 1 April 1994 the renovation of office space set aside for the 3rd Internal Affairs Department; by the end of 1994 solve the problem of locating appropriate office space for the City Procuracy; -- in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs, during the first half of 1994 consider and take action on the possibility and appropriateness of establishing a coordinating center for the purpose of arranging interaction between internal affairs departments and other law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat crime and establish proper order in the city of Nalchik; -- in order to improve protection of all forms of property, in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs and other affected agencies study the appropriateness and possibility of restricting and eventually banning entry into the city by motor vehicles from other regions of the Russian Federation, submitting proposals to this effect to the KBR Cabinet of Ministers during the fourth quarter of 1994. 4. to direct the attention of KBR minister of internal affairs Kh. A. Shogenov to serious shortcomings in the operations of internal affairs departments in the city of Nalchik with regard to the investigation and prevention of crimes, and to demand that effective measures be taken to improve the effectiveness of those departments' efforts to strengthen law and order. 5. that the KBR minister of internal affairs (Kh. A. Shogenov) shall in conjunction with the city administration consider and take action on the following matters in 1994: -- additional allocation of motor vehicles, fuels and lubricants for the needs of city internal affairs departments, primarily dispatcher stations and patrol and checkpoint units; -- full supply of radio communications equipment, recording equipment, photographic supplies, copying machines, video equipment and other types of special equipment to criminal militia under the city's internal affairs departments; -- relocation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Financial and Economic Department, the Address Bureau and the Okhrana [Protection] Association Warehouse (a part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs) out of the 2nd Internal Affairs Department's building in order to ensure normal working conditions for the department's personnel; -- the possibility and appropriateness of setting up militia units in the Volnyy Aul and KBGU microrayons and a militia station in the park zone, with allocation of the necessary buildings; -- improvement of the effectiveness of the medical detoxification unit to ensure profitability in its operations. 6. to propose that the KBR Procuracy (R. I. Abazov) take measures to improve the effectiveness of procuratorial oversight in the city of Nalchik with regard to exact compliance with laws pertaining to the protection of citizens' rights and legitimate interests, crime prevention and investigation, and compliance with the law in the operations of internal affairs agencies, the city court and the executive branch. 7. that the Ministry of Justice (A. M. Batyrbekov) shall take measures to increase the effectiveness with which the city court's operations are organized and ensure correct application of legislation in judicial practice. 8. that the Administrative Law Department of the KBR Cabinet of Ministers Administration of Affairs shall monitor compliance with this decree. 9. that the status of compliance with this decree by the Nalchik City Administration and the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs shall be reported to the KBR Cabinet of Ministers by 1 February 1995 based on year-end findings.
