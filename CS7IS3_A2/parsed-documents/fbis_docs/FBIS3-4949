We, thus feel that we can rest assured that the American government will opt for the most rational measure to maintain good, productive relations and mutual understanding with Indonesia. Extending the validity of the GSP facility seems to be the best alternative, seen from at least two major points of view. First of all, now is the worst time for the U.S. to pick a fight with Indonesia, the chair of the Nonaligned Movement, which will host the next annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in November. Withdrawal of the GSP facility not only would unnecessarily become a thorn in the side of the otherwise good and mature relations between the two countries but also would be counter-productive to the United States' noble objective of helping improve human and workers' rights. The Indonesian Government which has now become increasingly assertive in international fora, obviously dreads the political more than the economic impact of the stoppage of the facility. After all, the $650 million worth of exports that it might lose with the GSP withdrawal would only make a small dent in its total exports of more than $30 billion. What would hurt most would be the "political slap in the face" of a government which has been priding itself on many internationally-acclaimed development achievements. However, the most important point is the fact that the Indonesian Government has fully understood the message of the United States' threat to withdraw the GSP facility. The government has been making concerted efforts to improve the protection of workers' rights. The trade union movement has been restructured to make it a more effective forum for the protection of those rights. The decree that allowed military intervention to break strikes has been revoked and the minimum daily wages have been increased. The government may perhaps violate the International Labor Organization's convention by allowing only one trade union but that, we think, is not "the end of the world" in terms of the workers' plight. In fact, that issue is more political in nature than it is economic. In a country where millions of people are fully unemployed and over 30 million are under-employed, the political right to organize is certainly not top priority in the agenda for the protection of workers' rights. [sentence as published] What the government has been doing to force employers to improve the lot of their workers counts much more than the mere existence of hundreds of trade unions, which are either impotent or technically incompetent to negotiate anything economically viable with powerful employers, or which are simply trigger-happy bodies ready to resort to strikes anytime they want to demand something. Obviously, the protection of workers' rights should not be seen nor undertaken as a oneshot measure, but should be treated as an ongoing process, which follows the stages of economic development and which should take into account the international market competition. It would be futile or even disastrous to the economic stability of this nation if the government, under strong pressure from outside, enforced minimum wages at such high levels it might drive many employers into bankruptcy. We fully understand that a facility or trade privilege, such as GSP, normally imposes certain economic and political requirements. But the enforcement of such requirements should take into account what is economically and politically feasible in the country beneficiary at a particular period of time and what should be postponed until a more appropriate time rolls around.
