With the arrival of this French humanitarian ship, the political organization of Constant-Chambelain sees an attempt to turn the Republic of Haiti into another Somalia. They made this claim during a news conference on 24 March. Rothschild Francois filed a report: [Francois] We do not want this charity that France wants to throw at us like a bone thrown at an animal after a beating. That is the way the FRAPH leader recalled the organization's opposition to the arrival of the French humanitarian ship, Galis Bay, on 25 March in Port-au-Prince. Emmanuel Constant compared this humanitarian aid with an attempt to Somaliize Haiti. It is a sop for the Haitian people, asserted the top leader of FRAPH. For Constant, it is out of question for the population to accept those food products from the French Government. FRAPH attacked France's policy toward Haiti. Paris has always demanded a total blockade against Haiti, which leads Emmanuel Constant to say that France is the leader of the international conspiracy against Haiti. In order to make the arrival of the French ship a failure, FRAPH intends to put all its weight in the balance. Thus, FRAPH is calling for a rally in front of the APN [National Harbor Authorities] on 25 March. Emmanuel Constant asserted that FRAPH is ready to repeat 1804 [the rebellion against France] by preventing the arrival of the French humanitarian aid ship, Galis Bay. [Begin recording in Creole] [Constant] Tomorrow we will hold a huge demonstration to show the international community that we do not want the ship to dock. We want another negotiation. We do not want this kind of aid. It is a situation different from the Harlan County and is more serious because we do not know what is on the ship. The French Government has suddenly decided to send food for children. I believe that it is a national matter and we are counting on the patriotism of every Haitian so that the demonstration is even stronger that the one on the arrival of the Harlan County. [Francois] What if the ship docks anyway, despite the demonstration? [Constant] The 1804 events were not in vain. We will repeat it. I would be ready to accept it. We do not agree, however, to accept the shipment from the country that is sending it. This is a country in distress indeed. It is due to the embargo, not a hurricane. Thus, we should not all of a sudden receive the prepositioned disaster relief supplies stocked in Guadeloupe. For the past three years, they should have said no to the embargo, just like other countries, who are trying to help. Brazil is helping us as well as other countries. I do not see why they do not realize that the embargo is killing the children. That is where the problem lies. We do not want them to give us fish. We want to learn how to fish. [end recording] [Francois] FRAPH has announced that it has sent a letter to the National Harbor Authorities asking the institution to refuse all access to the French humanitarian ship, an initiative supported by other political groups. FRAPH also announced the start of a large solidarity campaign in favor of the deprived people in Haiti, an operation consisting in collecting food aid to benefit the deprived. FRAPH indicated two places for stocking those food products: at the National Radio station and the National Television Station. The leaders of the organization hope for the support of members of all social classes in the framework of this solidarity movement.
