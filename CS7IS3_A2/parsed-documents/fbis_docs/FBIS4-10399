It is the coup d'etat logic that continues, Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul told the Haitian Press Agency regarding the 10 April vote by the Senate [office] led by Bernard Sansaricq for a resolution relating to the reenforcement of the Constitution. It is a masquerade without legal foundation, by individuals with no electoral legitimacy, who do not respect any logic, he adds, explaining that their objective is to work for the ruin of the people and to guarantee themselves continued illicit wealth. Paul further stated that the international community will not back this undertaking, which is already doomed to failure and which will most likely result in reinforcement of the sanctions. After accusing the authors of the resolution and their allies of responsibility for the misfortunes of the country, Mr. Paul noted that no one has acknowledged Sansaricq as president of the Senate. Neither have the parliamentarians stemming from the contested 18 January [1993] elections, whose fate depends on the verdict of the arbitration committee provided for by the Haitian Constitution, been acknowledged as senators.
