The first was the government situation and the attempt to reshuffle the cabinet portfolios based on certain plans by the president and the prime minister. These plans have clashed with calculations by the parliamentary speaker, who demanded the Finance Ministry portfolio for his sect based on the principle that any reshuffle must aim at energizing governmental work and that this can only be done by correcting the course of the state's financial policy, which has demonstrated its failure and sterility. While agreement between the president and the prime minister exists because of the indirect concurrence of interests, the sticky issue of reshuffling the portfolios persists. It affects the Ministries of Finance, Interior, Industry and Oil, and Labor. President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri raised this issue during their meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. The two returned with a firm response from the Syrian leadership that it is ready to assist Lebanon in resolving problems in government work, but that a change of government or reshuffle is an internal Lebanese matter. Lebanese political sources maintain that a government reshuffle is still possible but will not be sufficient as the entire government performance in the political, economic, and security fields is deficient. The second issue discussed by the cabinet was the high cost of living and economic stagnation. This is occurring at a time when the dollar rate in the local market has been stable and the government claims that the development and reconstruction process is continuing. This is casting some doubt on the state's financial policy. The third issue was the demands of the General Labor Federation. With the federation's demands, a crisis has been created for political reasons. Some ministers at yesterday's cabinet session maintained that this fabricated crisis constitutes a crime against the worker and his livelihood and is a dangerous step at this time.
