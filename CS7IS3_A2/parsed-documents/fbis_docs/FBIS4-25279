FBIS4-25279 "drchi111_a_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General More on Cease-Fire Agreement More on Cease-Fire Agreement OW0806174094 Beijing XINHUA in English 1645 GMT 8 Jun 94 OW0806174094 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- After hard bargaining over the past three days, the warring factions in Bosnia agreed here today to a month-long ceasefire, the first of its kind in more than two years of bloody conflict. The accord, signed by top representatives of the Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and Serbs in the form of a statement, will take effect at noon (1000 GMT) on Friday [10 June]. As a first step both sides agreed to avoid any offensive or provocative military operations and give time to broader truce negotiations. "This period of military stabilisation is required in order to give time for reflection leading to a resumption, within the next several days, under U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor) auspices, of negotiations on a comprehensive cessation of hostilities," said the statement released here. Speaking to reporters after signing the agreement, Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the ceasefire is a "first step" toward the overall truce in the war-torn Bosnia. However, he admitted it fell short of his four-month ceasefire target sought in the past three days of talks here. "But under the circumstances such a more ambitious undertaking was not within reach," he added. He said that the Unprofor would convene negotiations within a few days either in Sarajevo, Pale (Bosnian Serbs' stronghold) or at Sarajevo airport. Meanwhile, the U.N. force will continue to monitor and report all military activity along the present line of conflict, the statement said. The accord also provided for an "immediate and complete" release of all prisoners of war under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Akashi said that the accord was a "short agreement reached after a great deal of effort," referring to the long mediation drive by the international community. Last month major power ministers met in Geneva, where they made a call for cessation of hostilities to be followed by territorial negotiations in the former Yugoslav Republic. The major power "contact group" on Bosnia asked Akashi and his military commanders to negotiate the ceasefire. Under the terms of Akashi's original proposal, a ceasefire would have been followed quickly by separation of forces, withdrawal of heavy weapons and the interposition of some 5,000 extra peacekeeping troops along front lines. However, the warring sides had long argument over the duration of the proposed truce. The Bosnian Serbs had accepted Akashi's original proposal, but the Bosnian Muslims and Croats had resisted a long ceasefire, fearing it would cement Serbs' military gains on the ground. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters after signing the accord today that he had accepted a "moderate result" for the sake of peace, while leaders of the Muslim-Croat Federation seemed also pleased by the result.
