FBIS3-54595 "drnes019_r_94004" FBIS-NES-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Jan 1994 India U.S. Urged To Ask Islamabad To Stop Meddling BK2701143394 Calcutta ANANDABAZAR PATRIKA in Bengali 19 Jan 94 p 4 BK2701143394 Calcutta ANANDABAZAR PATRIKA Language: Bengali Article Type:BFN [Editorial: "Kashmir Tangle"] [Text] The information that Pakistan's military intelligence department, the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI], is helping Kashmiri militants carry out terrorist and subversive activities in the state has not been provided by an Indian official in New Delhi but by the United States itself. This was stated in a report submitted recently before the U.S. House of Representatives. The report said Pakistani spies put on the uniform of Indian soldiers and indulged in subversive activities in Kashmir. After seeing this report, it will not be proper for U.S. officials to say that sufficient evidence does not exist to prove Indian allegations of Pakistani interference in Kashmir. Instead of expressing concern over the false allegations of human rights violations by Indian forces in Kashmir, Washington should ask Pakistan to stop meddling in the valley. If this is done then the peace-loving people of the state will give a sigh of relief. Pakistani agents are not only active in Kashmir but also in other parts of India. There is hardly a place in the country where the ISI agents are not operating. According to the Home Ministry's intelligence reports, Pakistani spies were behind the explosions in Bombay and other places. They operate everywhere particularly in busy places such as streets, offices, markets, and crowded train compartments. These agents have already caused great losses to life and property. It may be true that the intelligence agency of the Indian Government, to hide their own inefficiency and failures, are shifting the blame for all mishaps onto Pakistan. But from the incidents occurring in Kashmir and other states it appears that Pakistan has a role in fomenting trouble and tension in this country. It seems very keen to encourage secessionist movements in Kashmir and in the northeastern region of the country by aiding militancy. There is no doubt that tension along the border of Kashmir has increased manifold. Both the activities of the militants and the provocations created by Pakistani soldiers have simultaneously increased. The situation along the border has deteriorated to such an extent that the government has been compelled to ask the armed forces to remain on alert to render any assistance needed by the Border Security Force. An improvement in the situation cannot be expected as Islamabad is repeatedly threatening war and making statements that are not conducive to peace. It is unfortunate that in Pakistan anti-India statements are made for winning elections. This is understandable. But, till now the statements of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto have not been encouraging. Benazir's position has become shaky due to stiff opposition from Nawaz Sharif on one hand and the severe family conflict on the other. But nothing serious has happened for which Benazir Bhutto should become upset or reckless. It will be good for Bhutto if she realizes this at the earliest. It is difficult for New Delhi to give concessions to Islamabad. It has also not been possible for the Indian Government to take the necessary initiatives needed to normalize ties between the two countries. India should take steps to remove fear and mistrust from the mind of Pakistan. Surely both sides do not want another war. Not all problems can be resolved militarily. Steps are needed for a peaceful settlement of all disputes. It appears now that a political solution should be found to the Kashmir issue. The government is making efforts to bring about administrative changes in Kashmir in order to consolidate its position. But why are efforts being made to give so much importance to Dr. Farooq Abdullah [former chief minister of state] now? Is he very important politically? At present, neither him nor his party, called the National Conference, have the support of a majority of the population. No one will forget how he left the country and deserted his close associates in the time of danger. Why can't the government find a person in the state who enjoys the confidence of the people and who can help it find a political solution to the Kashmir tangle?
