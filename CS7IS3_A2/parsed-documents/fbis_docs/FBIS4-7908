FBIS4-7908 "dreeu067__a94027" FBIS-EEU-94-067-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia KDH Condemns SNS on Zhirinovskiy Congress KDH Condemns SNS on Zhirinovskiy Congress AU0504083594 Prague CTK in English 2018 GMT 4 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0504083594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 4 (CTK) -- The fact a leading member of the Slovak National Party (SNS) took part in the weekend pan-Slavic congress shows the party's political line is not just the personal deviation of the new chairman but of the whole party, Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) chairman Jan Carnogursky told CTK today. Carnogursky was referring to the involvement of SNS deputy chairman Juraj Molnar in the Moscow-held congress on Sunday which was organized by radical Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Vladimir Miskovsky, deputy for the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDSDA) which arose from the division of the SNS, said honorary chairman of the SNS Jozef Prokes should be asked his views on Molnar's attendance at the congress, Prokes being shadow foreign minister. "He is in the same party as Mr Molnar and certainly knows best of all what Slovakia's state interests are," he said. Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) in the Slovak parliament Bela Bugar declared he was insulted merely by the fact Slovakia was represented at the congress. "Zhirinovskiy and his statements are known almost to little children now as well," he told CTK. "Unfortunately it must be said the rest of the world behaves towards this man somewhat laxly. It reminds me of 1938 and later times," he said. Even though the SNS had not authorized Molnar to speak at the congress, as SNS chairman Jan Slota claimed today, Molnar still had had the authority to go, Bugar said. "I don't think that in this way we will contribute to rapprochement among nations. The SNS has revealed to us another of its profiles," he said. The pan-Slavic congress was the fifth congress of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). Participants agreed on the creation of a Union of Slav Nations and elected Zhirinovskiy himself as president of the "Slav parliament". At the congress Molnar said independent Slovakia had realized that "if Slav are not united we shall not exist". "It's in our interest to know what role in Central Europe Slovakia will play if the LDPR wins in Russia," he told CTK.
