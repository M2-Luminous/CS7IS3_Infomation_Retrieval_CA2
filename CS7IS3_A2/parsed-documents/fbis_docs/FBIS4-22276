This investment project will amount to around 150 million dollars. Although the Japanese side is fully prepared to take action on the agreements, it has encountered delays on the Russian side. This was the topic of discussion at yesterday's meeting of executives of the Japanese firms involved in the project. The contract the Russian Tekhnopromimport Association (representing the interests of the Orsk Mechanical Plant and the Krasnoyarsk Refrigerator Plant) signed with a Japanese consortium (the Nissho Iwai, Sanyo Electric, and Toyo Engineering firms) for the delivery of Japanese technological lines for refrigerator compressor production was negotiated back in 1990. After the breakup of the Union, however, the Japanese government lines of credit for the financing of this contract were frozen. Talks on the resumption of the deliveries were held regularly after that, but the absence of Russian guarantees of the repayment of the credit from the Japanese Export-Import Bank was the main obstacle. It was not until 1993 that an agreement was concluded by the Export-Import Bank and Russian Foreign Economic Bank on the resumption of operations with lines of credit for the Orsk and Krasnoyarsk contracts. According to the terms of the new contract concluded in December (for a total of around 150 million dollars), the Japanese side promised to deliver and install the technological equipment and train Russian personnel. The credits would be repaid in installments over a period of 8.5 years, starting in November 1995. The Japanese are ready to start acting on the agreements, but now the situation has been complicated by the procrastination of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which still has not provided the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry with government guarantees for the credits. According to observers, the Ministry of Finance's temporizing might be due to the general mood in government. When First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, and Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin met representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and Mitsui Corporation in early February, it was clear that the Russian administrators were not eager to accept any government-backed credits. The "no-strings" preferential credit of 2 billion dollars from the U.S. Eximbank for the Russian petroleum industry was cited as a positive example at that meeting (although the possibility of obtaining this credit and of repaying it seems quite dubious--see KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 3 March). In contrast to the American billions, which would be guaranteed by Russian oil, the Japanese credit presupposes repayment from the foreign currency proceeds of profitable enterprises. The Krasnoyarsk plant, for example, is already exporting its products successfully, and the Orsk plant even has a direct relationship to the military-industrial complex and to the budget allocations for conversion. The simple credit and repayment plan proposed by the Japanese and the low rate of interest (5 percent per annum) in comparison with the American rate are completely in line with government programs for the support of machine-building exports and the enterprises of the military-industrial complex. The behavior of the Ministry of Finance, however, could discourage the already cautious Japanese from investing in the Russian economy.
