On 19 May former Russian Vice President Rutskoy gave explanations to the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office. Rutskoy's attorney, Yu.P. Ivanov, who was present when these explanations were given, asked our editorial office to publish the full text of them. To the Moscow City Prosecutor's office from Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy Explanations In connection with the series of questions raised by representatives of the Moscow City Prosecutor's Office about my speeches on 9 May 1994 and 14 May 1994, I am able to provide the following clarification. First, I should like to note that the investigation of the legality of the actions of the participants in the rally which took place during the Victory Day demonstration is being carried out on the direct instructions of acting Russian Federation Prosecutor General Ilyushenko. In my view, this post does not exist. There can only be an acting prosecutor general if there is a legally appointed prosecutor general who is temporarily absent -- on vacation, for example. In this instance President Yeltsin, ignoring his own Constitution and the opinion of the Federation Council, is keeping one of his own minions in this artificial post (acting prosecutor general). It is no coincidence that former Prosecutor General Kazannik calls Ilyushenko nothing more than a puppet. Ilyushenko does not have even an elementary notion of personal dignity. One might think that after the vote at the Federation Council, which rejected his nomination, Ilyushenko would simply have given up his claims to this post. But he has not done so, and this, it seems to me, is the best indication of his moral qualities. He has a definite interest in me. It was he who, together with Andrey Makarov [staffer of Interdepartmental Commission To Combat Crime and Corruption], was a most active liar who spread rumors which impugned my honor and dignity when he accused me of involvement with some Swiss bank accounts which I was supposed to have. In so saying, in my view, he not only lied but also committed perjury. And I hope that Ilyushenko will still be accountable for this vile act. As for my actual actions on 9 and 14 May, I see nothing unlawful in them. The texts of my speeches contain nothing "criminal." Yes, I believe that today the country is being ruled by a regime of President Yeltsin's absolute power. Yes, I believe that this regime is pursuing an antipeople policy of selling out to foreign interests and thereby destroying our Motherland. Yes, I believe that representatives of the patriotic opposition must come to power in the country, and I hope that, despite all the regime's convulsions, victory will go the patriots. Yes, I believe that it would be good if this happened by the 50th anniversary of the Victory over Fascism, that is, by May 1995. I think that the unification of various social forces and support for their demands by the majority of the people will force President Yeltsin to honor the public commitment he made (and which he himself is crudely violating) to call early presidential elections. I hope that these elections will be won by the presidential candidate for whom the most important thing is service of the people and the Motherland, a candidate who will pursue an economic program which reflects first and foremost the interests of the hapless working people today. It was just such a result that I had in mind when I spoke about the future victory! That is how I see it. I believe that my speech was couched in ideological terms which are the norm today. That is how many political leaders speak today, and there was nothing unusual in my speech. The propresident sycophants (officials in the president's entourage as well as journalists who serve the regime) are using far harsher terms about me and the patriotic opposition. So why do they find my replies intolerable? The answer is obvious. These people live in a state of perpetual fear. The fear of responsibility. Responsibility for what they done: the destruction of a mighty Fatherland -- the USSR; the impoverishment of the majority of the people; the gunning down of the legislative authorities; and much more. The only way in which these cliques can suppress that fear is by driving their political opponents into the concentration camps. In my case they want to find a new pretext for arresting me. I despise these pygmies. And I think I have the right to criticize them publicly irrespective of the fact that they are "representatives of the authorities." In my criticism of this or that individual there is no legal norm which would oblige me to make my criticism commensurate with the office in question and thus I am not breaking the law. But there is one thing of which I want to assure those ordinary citizens who believe in me -- I am prepared to stay in jail the rest of my life for the sake of my people, my Motherland, and its true interests. I have not appealed to Yeltsin and his puppets for a pardon and I am not going to. Nor can I make any comment on the burning of the Russian Federation flag because I simply did not see that happen. I can only express my own opinion about why this flag was burned. Today's Russian Federation flag looks like the one that was used during the Great Patriotic War by Vlasov's traitors. For that reason I can understand the feelings of former front-liners who fought against Vlasov's traitors and defended a different flag -- the red flag. And defended it with their blood.... I have nothing more to add to that. [signed] A.V. Rutskoy, 19 May 1994
