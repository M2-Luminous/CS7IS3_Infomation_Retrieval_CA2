This document says that "the country has approached the limit beyond which there is national catastrophe, economic ruin and civil war." It also says that Ukraine needed a new political course and successful democratic elections. The Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms urged the population not to allow the bankrupt authorities, who are planning to foil the elections, to deceive them. If the Ukrainian citizens do not come to the polling stations on March 27, the policy which has pushed them to the verge of extinction, will be continued, says this bloc's appeal.
