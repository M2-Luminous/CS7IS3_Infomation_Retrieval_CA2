[Begin Conceicao recording] The delegations from the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] did not hold talks in Lusaka today. UNITA presented a verbal protest to the mediators this morning, saying it was not ready for talks with the government delegation today because of alleged air raids on Huambo by the Angolan Air Force yesterday. The government negotiating team says it is not aware of the protest because the mediators have not said anything. This morning, the UNITA negotiating team phoned the government delegation leadership, suspending the meeting scheduled for today, because it was waiting for a reply from the mediators over a certain issue.
