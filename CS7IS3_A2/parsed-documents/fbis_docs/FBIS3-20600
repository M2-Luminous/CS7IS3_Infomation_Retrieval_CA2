China, meanwhile, is huffing and puffing that it will blow Legco down in 1997. Last Thursday, our modest hero heard Sir Percy Cradock say on TV that "Legco had signed its own death warrant" when it approved the first tranche of Chris Patten's bill. Was this person, not to mention the umbrella mender and the cobbler in Sai Kung, really convinced by last week's White Paper on the 17 Anglo-British negotiations sessions? The British must hope so: they printed 140,000 copies in Chinese and 60,000 in English. But the White Paper is only convincing if, as a British official suggested last week, you take it on faith. Suppose you are not a devout believer in Britain, often referred to here as "the two-headed snake"? Suppose you want to believe that Britain negotiated sincerely and that Beijing's men stonewalled, but suppose also that you need proof before you would be willing to enrage Beijing by voting for the rest of the Patten plan on July 6? There is no evidence in the White Paper; it is, frankly, a piece of propaganda. This does not mean it is a lie; it is like the statement of a lawyer who, though he must not commit perjury, is not required to make the best case for the other side. British and Hong Kong officials seem insulted by the suggestion that the White Paper as it stands is no more to be relied on than the 10,000-word article that appeared in the PEOPLE'S DAILY on January 7, which gave China's side of the collapse of negotiations. "You mean you think we're the same as the Chinese?" an incredulous official asked last week when I observed that I could not "believe" the White Paper. I meant of course "believe in". When asked to supply documentation (there exists, afterall, a nearly 1,000-page stenographic record of the 17 sessions), the official said: "But these are confidential diplomatic documents," -- as if publishing the White Paper has not already blown the roof off diplomatic niceties. We don't need the full 1,000 pages. But where the White Paper makes its most telling charges of Chinese shiftiness or reneging, our confidence would be boosted by verbatim quotes showing which Chinese diplomat said what, when he said it, and when he said the opposite. Of course, some would say such quotes had been invented. But most people would not doubt such evidence, unless the Chinese produced their own and different stenographic record. If that happened, it would only confirm what the White Paper and the PEOPLE'S DAILY accounts already indicate -- that (as some British officials here now concede "in retrospect") there never was any common ground between the two sides, just a chasm between different goals and beliefs, which could be spanned only by flimsy bridges like agreement on lowering the voting age. Showing extracts from the actual record would expose this chasm, which is far more important than proving bad faith. The bad faith, if it exists, is primarily a result of the chasm. What also hinders understanding is the way the government managed "to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" (as one official put it) after the Legco vote last week. By Thursday, many Hong Kong journalists -- including those from the non-Communist Chinese press -- were expressing scepticism about the White Paper. Those who asked for more documentation were treated as troublemakers or eccentrics. The official Hong Kong government press conference on Friday reminded some of us who have attended similar events in Beijing that 1997 is only three years away. Chinese officials commonly preface their reply to a difficult follow-up question by saying "It is well known to all that..." and then repeating their earlier statements. Last week in Hong Kong, senior officials -- some wearing the same scornful looks on their faces one recalls from Beijing -- also deflected questions by dismissing them as "speculation" or with curt instructions to "Read the Letters Patent". This last came when the officials were asked under what circumstances Patten and Parliament could refuse to ratify Legco's vote in July, as Patten hinted last week he might, in some circumstances, regretfully have to do. What we were told was that it was "up to the people of Hong Kong", or, again, "Read the Letters Patent". Is this how the government plans to respond to Legco members who need to know what might happen if the council, for example, attempted to pass any of Beijing's proposals. What came out last Friday should indeed worry the average Legco member. He is pincered between Beijing's promise of revenge and the threat that Patten and Parliament may reject any bill that does not meet their purposes. Appealed to for clarification, a Government House source sighed. "Oh God, the answer is so simple -- the Governor is the Queen of Hong Kong."
