"If we fail to form one now, we will come back to it after the elections. However, at present we are willing to negotiate with other parties about a tight coalition," he added. Some of the Hungarian parties have announced they oppose the idea. Duray defined the "essential conditions" for creating the coalition of Hungarian groupings: after successfully entering the Slovak parliament the Hungarian representatives must, first and foremost, create a joint deputies group. The Egyutteles (with 9 deputies in the 150-member Slovak parliament the strongest Hungarian party) will demand from them a unified strategy in local elections with joint candidates for mayors. Duray is also pushing for a unified strategy of Hungarian deputies in foreign policy issues. "Should any of the parties breach the accord, it will not be allowed to claim the relevant sum from the state contribution for the elections," Duray warned.
