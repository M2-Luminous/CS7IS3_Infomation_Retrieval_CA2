Our investigation of the 0.50-micron LDD [lightly doped drain] PMOS process indicates that the LDD can greatly suppress the hot-carriers effect, short-channel effect, and the hot electron-induced punch through (HEIP) effect in the PMOS material. Finally, we have developed an optimum LDD PMOS process and have applied it to fabricate 0.50-micron ICs. On N (resistivity = 1-2 ohm-cm) silicon wafers, we have adopted the PMOS process. After polysilicon-gate fabrication (gate oxide layer thickness of about 28 nm), we did the LDD preparation with the following process flow chart: (a) BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] implantation to form lightly doped P[.sup]-[/] region; implantation dose = 7 x 10[.sup]12[/]-8 x 1O[.sup]13[/]/cm[.sup]2[/], implantation energy = 25-60 keV. (b) LPCVD [low-pressure chemical vapor deposition] SiO[.sub]2[/], 400 nm. (c) CHF[.sub]3[/] RIE [reactive ion etching] SiO[.sub]2[/] to form 0.20-nm Si0[.sub]2[/] side wall. (d) Side-wall mask BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] heavy implantation to form S/D P[.sup]+[/] doping; implantation conditions: 40 keV, 2 x 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. (e) Annealing for 30 min at 950ï¿½ C to form the LDD structure. After this, a conventional CMOS [complementary metal oxide semiconductor] process is used to complete device fabrication. Using this optimized PMOS LDD process combined with an optimized NMOS LDD and a self-aligned titanium-silicide process, we have developed a set of submicron CMOS processes. ICs fabricated with this process include a 0.5-micron voltage-controlled oscillator [VCO] with a 600 MHz speed and a gate delay of 130 ps [picoseconds], as well as other submicron circuits, with very good results [refs. 11-12].
