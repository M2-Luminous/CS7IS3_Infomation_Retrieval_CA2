This was how Sergey Filatov, the Russian president's head of administration, explained the meaning of the reorganization being conducted in the Kremlin's corridors of power in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Two parallel branches, as it were, remain in the apparatus of the head of state: the staff of assistants of the president, headed by Viktor Ilyushin, and the administration proper, led by Sergey Filatov. Asked whether the presence of two parallel structures in the apparatus of the president is an unnecessary duplication, Sergey Filatov replied that he sees no contradiction in this because "all assistants of the president work for the head of state, using the administration apparatus for the fulfillment of their tasks." The number of assistants of the president in various fields of activity will be increased. The head of administration named among the new structures the economic analysis service, the finance and budget section, and the international department. The head of state needs these structures because "the president, in accordance with the new constitution, no longer heads the government, but at the same time needs to be well informed on the state of the economy, the budget and tax policy," Sergey Filatov explained. However, the formation of sections with functions of executive power under the president is already arousing criticism to the effect that the norm of the division of powers enshrined in the Russian constitution are being violated. This collision could become an occasion for reproach against the president, as was recently declared, in particular, by State Duma Deputy Sergey Shakhray. The administration staff will also include the new Directorate of the Federal State Service. The Council for Cadre Policies under the president, set up in spring last year, is headed by three co-chairmen -- Sergey Filatov, Oleg Soskovets, and Vladimir Shumeyko. Three commissions under this council "will deal with the preliminary assessment of cadres": They are the commissions for judicial cadres (headed by Minister of Justice Yuriy Kalmykov), for foreign cadres, and for senior military titles and posts. "Their task includes the accumulation of a data bank on cadres and their professional training," Sergey Filatov pointed out. The president's analytical service is being substantially reformed. A Council of Experts is being set up in it which will very likely be headed by Sergey Filatov, and there will also be a Center of Special Presidential Programs and an analytical service proper. The composition of the Presidential Council will also be renewed and filled with new names. The number of staff in the administration of the president of Russia is currently, according to its chief, 1,983 (but a full strength of 2,000 is proposed). The president will approve the final scheme of the reorganization of his apparatus in the next few days, Sergey Filatov reported.
