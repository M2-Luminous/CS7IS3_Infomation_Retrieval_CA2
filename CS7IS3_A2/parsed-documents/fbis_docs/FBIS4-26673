Chinese sources said while Mr Deng's health remained precarious, he was fit enough to do short-term travelling. Leaving weighty matters of state to lieutenants including President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, the patriarch has devoted his energy to ensuring a smooth succession. Informed sources said in a secret talk to about 20 senior generals earlier this year, Mr Deng spelled out a two-pronged strategy for guaranteeing a trouble-free succession. "Rally round comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the new leadership," Mr Deng told the gathering of top brass, who included former president Yang Shangkun, one of Mr Jiang's major rivals. "Uphold political stability at all costs. Provide help to the party and the Government in maintaining social order. Bolster central authority and check the growth of regionalism." The patriarch specifically asked his long-time comrade-in-arms General Liu Huaqing to help Mr Jiang, Mr Deng's successor as Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman, consolidate his hold over the People's Liberation Army and the paramilitary People's Armed Police. Under Mr Deng's overall guidance, Mr Jiang, General Liu and the generals laid down contingency plans through which urban riots could be contained and defused. Military sources said after having secured the loyalty of the generals, including the commanders and commissars of the eight military regions, Mr Deng and Vice-chairman of the CMC, General Liu, are confident that the centrifugal tendencies of a number of powerful regional cadres could be held in check. In return, the army officers have been assured a big budget and a large say in civilian matters, particularly foreign policy. The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported yesterday that Mr Deng recently toured Qingdao in eastern Shandong province. It quoted authoritative sources in Beijing as saying Mr Deng was accompanied by General Liu and that he had given instructions on maintaining stability. The report was yesterday denied by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin. Asked to clarify Mr Deng's whereabouts, Mr Wu said: "Mr Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is." Sources in Beijing said however, that Mr Deng had indeed travelled out of Beijing, and that he had spent time with General Liu on ways to promote stability. The sources said the senior leader paid a week-long visit to Shanghai in late April. The patriarch's recent edicts are similar to those reported in WEN WEI PO yesterday. "To ensure the longevity of Communist-Party rule, we must absolutely not change the policy of taking economic construction as the national core," Mr Deng reportedly said. "Taking the lesson from the former Soviet Union, we must handle well the relationship between the centre and the regions. "We must uphold Communist Party leadership The ruling status of the Communist Party must no be compromised. China cannot have a multi-party system." What WEN WEI PO has not reported is that Mr Deng has given instructions to the PLA, his major power base to "provide imperial escort" to his policy.
