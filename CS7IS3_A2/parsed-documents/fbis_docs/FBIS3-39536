Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now, according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff, 22 terrorists were being arrested every day. Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state penitentiary would be moved to another prison. He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions in Turkish prisons. He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in the province where they were sentenced, the government should increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas were terrorism was most intense, because transferring prisoners was both difficult and dangerous. Meanwhile, chief prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor of the State Security Court, met in the Justice Ministry under the supervision of the justice minister to discuss the problems of prisons in which terrorists were kept, and ways of avoiding jail breaks, the ANATOLIA news agency reported. The 36 chief prosecutors agreed that jail breaks had greatly disturbed the public, and that recent measures had reduced the number of incidents and allowed the guards some advance warning before a prisoner tried to escape. They said that there were two laws waiting to be passed by the Grand National Assembly, and that once they were approved measures would be taken to prevent all jail breaks. The chief prosecutors meet five times a year, and will continue to do so.
