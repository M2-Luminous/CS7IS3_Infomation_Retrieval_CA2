Thus, the incremental increase in the update factor from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 1995 is 1.0222. In contrast, the exceptions payment adjustment factor and the budget neutrality factor are not applied cumulatively. Thus, for example, the incremental increase in the budget neutrality factor from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 1995 is .7986/.8947, or .8926. C. Calculation of Inpatient Capital-Related Prospective Payments for FY 1995 During the capital prospective payment system transition period, a hospital is paid for the inpatient capital-related costs under one of two alternative payment methodologies: the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless methodology. The payment methodology applicable to a particular hospital is determined when a hospital comes under the prospective payment system for capital-related costs by comparing its hospital-specific rate to the Federal rate applicable to the hospital's first cost reporting period under the prospective payment system. The applicable Federal rate is determined by adjusting: •For outliers by dividing the standard Federal rate by the outlier reduction factor for that fiscal year; and, •For the payment adjustment factors applicable to the hospital (that is, the hospital's geographic adjustment factor, the disproportionate share adjustment factor, and the indirect medical education adjustment factor, when appropriate). If the hospital-specific rate is above the applicable Federal rate, the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless methodology. If the hospital-specific rate is below the applicable Federal rate, the hospital is paid under the fully prospective methodology. For purposes of calculating payments for each discharge under both the hold-harmless payment methodology and the fully prospective payment methodology, the standard Federal rate is adjusted as follows: (Standard Federal Rate) × (DRG weight) × (Geographic Adjustment Factor) × (Large Urban Add-on, if applicable) × (COLA adjustment for hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii) × (1 + Disproportionate Share Adjustment Factor + Indirect Medical Education Adjustment Factor, if applicable). The result is termed the adjusted Federal rate. Payments under the hold-harmless methodology are determined under one of two formulas. A hold-harmless hospital is paid the higher of: •100 percent of the adjusted Federal rate for each discharge; or •An old capital payment equal to 85 percent (100 percent for sole community hospitals) of the hospital's allowable Medicare inpatient old capital costs per discharge for the cost reporting period plus a new capital payment based on a percentage of the adjusted Federal rate for each discharge. The percentage of the adjusted Federal rate equals the ratio of the hospital's allowable Medicare new capital costs to its total Medicare inpatient capital-related costs in the cost reporting period. Once a hospital receives payment based on 100 percent of the adjusted Federal rate in a cost-reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1994 (or the first cost reporting period after obligated capital that is recognized as old capital under §412.302(c) is put in use for patient care, if later), the hospital continues to receive capital prospective payment system payments on that basis for the remainder of the transition period. Payment for each discharge under the fully prospective methodology is the sum of:
