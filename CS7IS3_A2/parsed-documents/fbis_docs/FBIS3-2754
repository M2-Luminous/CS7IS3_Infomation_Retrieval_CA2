This poll, cosponsored by "Beijing Nine-Day Technology Park" and the State Statistical Bureau, was held at the end of last month. From 20 neighborhood committee districts in Beijing, 1,000 resident households were selected at random and given a questionnaire. The results indicated that 55 percent of the respondents believed that a stable political situation was most needed for the success of reform; 34 percent of the respondents believed that building the legal system was most needed. On these two points, public opinion was in line with the understanding of the central authorities. Among all respondents, 76.7 percent believed that the main threat to the reform was corruption, while 51.7 percent put bureaucracy as the main threat. As to which reform the public was most concerned about, 59 percent of the respondents thought it was reform of the housing system and 56 percent thought it was medical insurance reform. The levels of concern over other reform items were in the following order: the pension system (36.7 percent), the development of law (25 percent), the political system (23 percent), education (21 percent), labor employment and the personnel system (19 percent), government organs (15 percent), unemployment insurance (13.5 percent), and state-owned enterprises (12 percent). Even people working in state-owned enterprises put the level of concern over pension reform in third place, next only to medical insurance and housing reforms. In addition, on economic matters, 76 percent of the respondents believed that the mainland's economic development was very fast or relatively fast; 61.6 percent believed that the mainland's economic growth rate should be kept within a certain limit, which indicated that the concept of maintaining balanced development has taken root in people's minds after several twists and turns. Those who believed that China would become an economic power in the world within 20 years took up 45 percent of all respondents and 14.7 percent of them believed it could be achieved within 10 years.
