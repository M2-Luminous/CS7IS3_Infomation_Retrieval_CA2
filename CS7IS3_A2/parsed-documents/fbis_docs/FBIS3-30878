In a statement issued by the Egyutteles Parliamentary Group and given to CTK today, movement representatives said they considered the constant questioning of the legitimacy of parliament to be part of a dangerous scenario which could develop into establishing an open dictatorship. The opposition movement voices the view that the current Slovak Government was incapable of stopping the economic fall of society and of finding a way out of the accumulated tension. By the lack of will to create a functioning government coalition the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could create a permanent governmental and parliamentary crisis. The government lacks a concept for the transformation of society and a strategy of economic and social policy. That is why it is resorting to ever more arrogant methods to maintain and concentrate power, the statement says.
