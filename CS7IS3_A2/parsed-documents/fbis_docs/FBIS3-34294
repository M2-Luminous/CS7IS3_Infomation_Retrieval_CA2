He submitted his letter of resignation and left the cabinet chamber. The resignation takes effect on 48 hours' time. During the meeting, several ministers expressed reservations about IDF [Israel Defense Forces] involvement in the peace process; others spoke up for this involvement. On this and other issues on the agenda, David Ze'ev: Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is scheduled to arrive home late this afternoon. His office says the foreign minister will sit down with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the next steps in the peace process towards evening. At this morning's cabinet meeting, a government source says Prime Minister Rabin told his ministers: We are always giving, and the Palestinians are always taking. Internally, the prime minister spoke out against the criticism of Labor Knesset Member Hagay Merom that Army officers are overly involved in the diplomatic process of the negotiations with the Palestinians. Rabin is said to have complained that the critics are never satisfied. Either, they say, the Army isn't having a big enough say, or, they say, the Army is too involved. Meretz Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that while certainly the Army must be involved in the military ramifications of the Gaza Jericho First arrangement, there is the impression, says Tzaban, that the IDF's involvement goes beyond what is necessary. Health Minister Hayim Ramon presented his letter of resignation, as expected. He was abrupt when asked about the next 48 hours until the resignation takes effect, but he certainly did not rule out the possibility of his remaining in the government, and not just as a Knesset member.
