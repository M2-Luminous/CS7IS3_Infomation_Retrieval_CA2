FR940906-0-00006 FR940906-0-00005 21 CFR Parts 558 and 573 [Docket No. 86F&hyph;0060] Food Additives Permitted in Feed and Drinking Water of Animals; Selenium; Stay of the 1987 Amendments; Reassessment AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is confirming the continued validity of the stay of the 1987 amendments to the selenium food additive regulations. The amendments provided for an increase in the maximum supplementation level of selenium in animal feeds. On September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47962), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stayed the 1987 amendments to the selenium food additive regulations. In that document the agency stated that it intended to reassess the decision to stay the amendment of the regulation, based on the progress of the needed research on selenium, by September 13, 1994, and as needed thereafter. The agency has determined that sufficient progress has been made and is issuing this document to confirm the continued validity of the stay. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written information to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. The public file may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Woodrow M. Knight, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;226), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1731. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47962), FDA stayed the 1987 amendments to the selenium food additive regulations. As a result of the stay of the 1987 amendments, the maximum permitted use levels of selenium returned to those levels permitted before FDA issued the amendments. FDA also stayed the portion of the regulation that provided for the use of a bolus for selenium supplementation at the increased levels. This action was taken because the agency concluded that FDA's finding of no significant impact and the environmental assessment prepared by the American Feed Industry Association for the 1987 action were inadequate to determine whether selenium supplementation of animals results in wastes that may cause selenium-related environmental impacts. FDA also stated in the September 13, 1993, final rule that it intended to reassess its decision to stay the amendments by September 13, 1994, and as needed thereafter. Progress made on the research required to complete an adequate environmental analysis is to be evaluated to determine the continued validity of the stay. If the agency makes the determination that progress is not adequate, the agency is to take action to deny the petition and revoke the 1987 amendments. For that reason, the agency asked to be kept advised of all research endeavors. II. Confirmation of the Stay The agency has determined that sufficient progress is being made to confirm the continued validity of the stay after September 13, 1994. The basis for this determination is the progress made at the Selenium Environmental Roundtable, which was held by the Forum for Animal Agriculture on January 25 and 26, 1994. The final report of the Roundtable assists in prioritizing the research needed (Environmental Roundtable: Selenium Use in Animal Feeds, Final Report, January 25 and 26, 1994, Forum for Animal Agriculture). A copy of this report under the same docket number 86F&hyph;0060 is on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Further, the agency has been advised of independent research initiatives at Michigan State University, University of Kentucky, University of Idaho, and Texas A & M University. FDA should continue to be kept apprised of all research endeavors. Comments should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and identified with the docket no. 86F&hyph;0060. The agency will conduct periodic reassessments of research progress as needed after September 13, 1994. If the agency determines, based on the reassessments, that research progress is not adequate, the agency will take the actions necessary to deny the 1986 food additive petition and revoke the 1987 amendments. Dated: August 24, 1994. William K. Hubbard, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21835 Filed 9&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
