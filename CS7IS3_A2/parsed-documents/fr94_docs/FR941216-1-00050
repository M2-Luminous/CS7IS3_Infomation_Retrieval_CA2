FR941216-1-00050 FR941216-1-00010 (v) Loss at maturity. On December 31, 1998, Z's basis in the debt instrument is $1,350 ($1,405 original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1997 and $128 for 1998, minus the negative adjustment of $243). As a result, Z realizes a loss of $5 on the retirement of the debt instrument (the difference between the amount realized ($1,345) and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument ($1,350)). Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the $5 loss is treated as loss from the retirement of the debt instrument. Consequently, Z realizes a total loss of $65 on the debt instrument for 1998 (a $60 ordinary loss and a $5 loss on the retirement of the debt instrument). Example 2. Basis less than adjusted issue price_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1998, Y purchases for $910 a debt instrument that pays 7 percent interest semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and that promises to pay on December 31, 2000, $1,000 plus or minus $10 times the positive or negative difference, if any, between a specified amount and the value of an index on December 31, 2000. However, the payment on December 31, 2000, may not be less than $650. The debt instrument was originally issued on January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. Y is a calendar year taxpayer. The projected payment schedule for the debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of $35 and a contingent payment at maturity of $1,175. On January 1, 1998, the debt instrument has an adjusted issue price of $1,060, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. Since the time the debt instrument was issued, market rates of interest on similar debt instruments have increased from approximately 10 percent to approximately 13 percent. In addition, because of a decrease in the relevant index, the expected value of the contingent payment has declined by about 9 percent. (ii) Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price. Y's basis in the debt instrument on January 1, 1998, is $910. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Y must allocate the $150 difference between basis ($910) and adjusted issue price ($1,060) to daily portions of interest or to projected payments. These amounts will be positive adjustments taken into account at the time the daily portions accrue or the payments are made. (A) Based on forward prices on January 1, 1998, Y determines that approximately $105 of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price is allocable to the contingent payment. Y allocates the remaining $45 to daily portions of interest on a pro-rata basis. This allocation is reasonable. (B) Assume alternatively that, based on yields of comparable debt instruments and its purchase price for the debt instrument, Y determines that approximately $49 of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price is allocable to daily portions of interest as follows: $13.32 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 1998; $16.15 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 1999; and $19.53 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000. Y allocates the remaining $101 to the contingent payment at maturity. This allocation is reasonable. Example 3. Secondary holder sells debt instrument_ (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 of this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F) and that Y allocates $49 to daily portions of interest and $101 to the contingent payment at maturity, on the same basis as in paragraph (ii)(B) of Example 2 of this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F). In 1998, Y has a total of $104.68 of daily portions of interest, receives two semiannual payments of $35, and has a positive adjustment of $13.32 from the allocation. Thus, Y has $118 of interest income on the debt instrument for 1998 ($104.68 of interest and a $13.32 net positive adjustment). On December 31, 1998, Y has an adjusted basis of $958 in the debt instrument ($910 original basis, plus $104.68 total daily portions for 1998 and the $13.32 positive adjustment, minus $70 interest payments for 1998), and the debt instrument has an adjusted issue price of $1,094.68 ($1,060 adjusted issue price on January 1, 1998, plus $104.68 total daily portions for 1998, minus $70 interest payments for 1998). (ii) Sale of debt instrument. Assume that Y sells the debt instrument for $950 on January 15, 1999. In 1999, Y has total daily portions of interest on the debt instrument (using a semiannual accrual period ending June 30) of $4.47 and positive adjustments allocable to the total daily portions of interest in 1999 of $0.64. Therefore, Y has $5.11 of interest income on the debt instrument for 1999. On January 15, 1999, Y has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $963.11. As a result, Y realizes a $13.11 loss on the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the loss is an ordinary loss.
