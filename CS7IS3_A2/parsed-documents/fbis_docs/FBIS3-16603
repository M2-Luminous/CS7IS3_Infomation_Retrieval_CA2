Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino Reinart, began consultations on the issue in Brussels, a press release by the Estonian Foreign Ministry says. The release issued today also says Estonia accepted Russia's proposal to hold the next round of talks in Moscow on Apr. 5-6, "despite a number of statements by Russian leaders, that are difficult to explain, on breaking off the negotiations and transfering the agreed final date for the withdrawal of troops." The Estonian Foreign Ministry reminds that at the past round of the talks held in the seaside resort of Lohusalu near Tallinn, "the Russian side refused to pull out its remaining 2,600 troops from Estonia by the earlier agreed deadline -- Aug. 31, 1994. The Russian representatives also moved forward new conditions for the troop withdrawal and did not propose a date for the next round" of talks, the statement says. Estonia also says that a "quick and powerful" reaction from the West had influenced Russia to continue talks and abide by the troop withdrawal deadline.
