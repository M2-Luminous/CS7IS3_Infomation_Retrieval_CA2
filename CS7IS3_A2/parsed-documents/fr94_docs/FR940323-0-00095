FR940323-0-00095 FR940323-0-00023 Possible future Federal actions that could affect Holy Ghost ipomopsis on the Santa Fe National Forest include road construction and maintenance, aerial spraying of Bacillus thuringiensis to control spruce budworm infestations, and fire suppression within the habitat area. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove and reduce to possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for endangered plants, the Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of such plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issued because Holy Ghost ipomopsis is not common in cultivation or in the wild. However, because of its beautiful and uniquely colored flowers, local demands for garden cultivation may increase as the species becomes better known. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/541&hyph;2104; FAX 703/358&hyph;2281). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited Sivinski, R., and K. Lightfoot. 1991.
