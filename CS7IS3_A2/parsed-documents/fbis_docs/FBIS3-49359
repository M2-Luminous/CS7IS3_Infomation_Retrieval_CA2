FBIS3-49359 "dreeu006__a94012" FBIS-EEU-94-006-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic CTK Outlines Clinton's Prague Agenda AU0801180094 Prague CTK in English 1907 GMT 7 Jan 94 AU0801180094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague Jan 7 (CTK) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will devote the first day of his two-day visit to Prague January 11-12 to meetings with Czech President Vaclav Havel, Premier Vaclav Klaus and, according to unofficial reports, to a walk across the Charles Bridge and a visit to some Old Town sites. After his arrival, which is expected at around 4:00 PM [1500 GMT], Clinton is to go to Prague Castle where, after a welcoming ceremony, he will meet with Havel in the Brozik Hall. They will later be joined by Klaus, likely after moving into the Hall of Mirrors. According to the original programme, Clinton is to begin his visit to the Old Town at 6:30 PM. There he wants to take a walk across the Charles Bridge and possibly stop into a typical Prague pub. Clinton is to spend the night at the Hotel Atrium, but there is also speculation that he might stay at the presidential apartment in Prague Castle. On Wednesday morning, the president is to tour the Jewish Cemetery and meet individually with the presidents of the other Visegrad Group countries -- Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa of Poland and Michal Kovac of Slovakia. The meetings are to be held at the U.S. ambassador's residence and culminate with a joint briefing. A working lunch is planned for Clinton and the Visegrad presidents. Before 3:00 PM, Clinton is to visit the Kmart-Maj department store for a discussion on Czech-American trade and business activities, which Klaus is also to attend. Clinton is then to have 15 minutes of "private time" as part of the Kmart visit. Afterwards he will head for the airport, where he is to spend an hour meeting with U.S. embassy employees. At 5:30 PM he will depart for Moscow. According to some reports from American sources, original plans for an "entertainment programme" will probably be cut back due to the Thursday [6 January] death of Clinton's mother. He was originally to visit the Na Zabradli Theatre, the U Zlateho Tygra pub and the Reduta Jazz Club on Tuesday evening. Clinton may go jogging on Wednesday morning. Official spokespersons for both the American and Czech sides say that the programme has not yet been definitively set down.
