He stressed the need for those who are involved in trade union work to persist in arming themselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide trade union work. Wei Jianxing pointed out the need for those who are involved in trade union work to have a good understanding of the nation's general interests when engaging in trade union work. He called on all levels of trade unions organizations to concentrate their tasks on promoting the nation's general interests -- that is, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. He urged them to proceed from reality and to actively involve themselves in helping solve prominent problems which could affect reform, development, and stability. The prominent issues which have a direct bearing on the personal interests of staff members and workers, according to him, are employment, distribution, social security and establishment of trade unions at foreign-funded enterprises.
