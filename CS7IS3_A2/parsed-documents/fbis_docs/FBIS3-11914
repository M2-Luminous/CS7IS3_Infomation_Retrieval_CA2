In remarks made to a Costa Rican radio station from Washington where he headed his country's delegation at the voting, Serrano Pinto cited his sadness over the coercive methods applied against the members of the continental organization by a nation he declined to identify. Costa Rica's government officials have not commented officially about the outcome of the election, which handed victory to the Colombian president with 20 votes cast for him and 14 for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. As Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon charged a few days ago, the United States resorted to pressuring the Caribbean and Central American states to hand the election to Gaviria, as that country regards Gaviria as "a candidate of hemispheric projection."
