The Turkmen Military Prosecutor's Office has brought a criminal lawsuit against the officer under Article 240 of the Turkmen Criminal Code (misuse of office). The circumstances of the case are still uncertain, the sole report saying that the officer's arrest was preceded by the suicide committed by Private Geldyyev, a Turkmen citizen, upon being exposed as a thief by fellow soldiers. Andrey Titov is currently being held in an investigatory cell in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]. The Russian side thinks the arrest and legal action against Titov by the Turkmen law-enforcement agencies to be unlawful and plans to insist that the criminal case and the defendant himself be turned over to it. In accordance with the Russian-Turkmen treaty on the joint protection of Turkmenia's state border and also on the status of the Russian Federation border troop servicemen on the territory of the republic, all military crimes committed by Russian border guards fall under Russian jurisdiction and must be considered by Russian law-enforcement agencies. It should be recalled that in 1993 the Turkmen authorities attempted to start legal proceedings against 15 Russian servicemen. The Russian side, however, managed to make sure that their cases were turned over to it to be tried in Russia.
