With the departure of this architect of the Socialist antiterrorist policy--he was appointed director of state security in 1982--Asuncion holds all the reins in the area held by the outgoing official, while assigning "all necessary powers" with respect to drug trafficking to Baltasar Garzon, [government] representative for the National Drug Plan [Office] [PNSD]. This body, Asuncion recalled yesterday, has been attached to the Interior Ministry "on the government's decision," in accordance with reports recommending this allocation submitted by the former judge to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez over the past few months. Asuncion said that, apart from some dismissals pending in his office, the reform of the ministry had been completed with the changes formalized yesterday. In addition to Fernando Puig de la Bellacasa's inauguration as deputy secretary, there was that of Director General of Aliens and Asylum Jaime Axel Ruiz Baudrihaye, Director General of Interior Policy Carlos Perez Anadon, government representative in Aragon Rafael Garcia de la Riva y Sanchiz, and Civil Governor of Castellon Juan Ignacio Subias. Vera's departure, which has even been accelerated, according to government sources, is a logical consequence of two facts. The policy of Asuncion, who as interior minister has toughened his language on ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] and has emphatically ruled out any negotiation, is at odds with Vera's line of constant messages to ETA leaders to achieve a dialogue with the terrorist gang. Moreover, Asuncion--although he has not publicly mentioned this fact--likes to control all the intelligence reins. It was not for nothing that Vera centralized all intelligence concerning terrorism, and only former Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan occasionally bypassed that "filter" and went directly to the minister. Judging by this decision, Asuncion did not wish to be caught unawares by any subordinate's initiatives to sound out ETA leaders, as happened to his predecessor. Second, Garzon's arrival at the Interior Ministry has been interpreted as a political slap in the face by not a few top officials of that ministry, with whom he has had disputes in matters such as the investigation of the Antiterrorist Liberation Groups or the dismantling of the Civil Guard's UCIFA (Central Antidrug Fiscal Investigation Unit). In addition, Garzon comes, as Asuncion said, with "all the powers he needs" to combat drug trafficking--previously clearly disparaged police tasks of the state secretaryship still headed by Vera, who was absent from the ceremony yesterday "because he was on vacation." Currently, only Police Director Carlos Conde Duque remains out of the previous Interior Ministry leadership team with antiterrorist responsibilities. Asuncion pointed out yesterday that the National Drug Plan's inclusion in the Interior Ministry is "an aim of the government," in light of the reports submitted by Garzon to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, with whom the former judge has met on several occasions over the past few months. Although Garzon's main task will be drug trafficking, Asuncion yesterday made clear his idea of work: "This is a team. We will work shoulder to shoulder. I will directly take charge of what I must do in all areas, but I will also expect my team to take charge of everything." In fact, a very high percentage of anticrime activities are connected with drug trafficking, and will therefore be overseen by Garzon. Asuncion emphasized that he maintains the same aims as his predecessor in charge of the ministry, but stressed that he will use different methods. "The ETA prisoners should become more involved and should express more openly what they tell us in private, and not allow themselves to be manipulated." This idea stems from his philosophy that the price of rehabilitation should be higher than hitherto, and this could take the form of demanding more active cooperation in informing on their former comrades, or at least publicly condemning them. The minister has even privately shown himself in favor of setting a limit to rehabilitation and of ETA members serving their sentences in full after a certain point. Asuncion described as forged the letters published by EGIN yesterday as having been written by ETA prisoners stating that the solution to the conflict "does not lie in the prisons." Both Asuncion and Garzon strongly emphasized that the National Drug Plan will not relinquish its responsibilities for prevention and rehabilitation. One of the most significant novelties of their exposition is the government's intention to set up independent central courts to combat drug trafficking, with the aim of relieving the National High Court of work. The aim of this initiative is for those detained for drug trafficking to be tried as quickly as possible, since time acts as an enemy in these cases and promotes plots to change testimonies and destroy evidence. These courts could have jurisdiction over more than one community, and only indictments with international or national ramifications would come before the National High Court.
