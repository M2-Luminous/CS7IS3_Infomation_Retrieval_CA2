The extent to which the committee head is critical of the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry can be seen from his interview given to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent in which Mr. Lukin has apparently skipped none of the topical foreign policy issues. Assessing the performance by the Foreign Affairs Ministry over the recent period, Vladimir Lukin stressed that compared to 1992, the foreign policy department has begun to work better. Diplomats have begun gradually to find their own identity, and talk with their partners more actively, professionally, and independently. Yet many weaknesses have remained. The main one among them is that so far there is more showing-off and pretentiousness than real activity. At the same time Mr. Lukin noted that there are enough professionals in the Foreign Affairs Ministry who are doing real business. Their efforts so far, however, are not sufficiently coordinated, while the ostentatious "airfield" ["aerodromnaya"] diplomacy remains the ministry's prevailing style. The committee chairman intends to change this style by accessible and legitimate methods: hearings, consultations, and parliamentary debates on Russia's international treaties. Mr. Lukin also plans to transfer to Russian soil the experience of the United States, where candidates for responsible posts have to pass congressional hearings while the president is obligated to take the lawmakers' decision into account. Touching on the issue of protection of Russia's economic interests as part of its foreign policy, the committee chairman expressed his certainty that the main thing here is not to engage in ideology, but to count money. For instance, in concluding the "Indian" deal, it was necessary to count how much would be gained and how much lost, also considering that the space agreement with the United States in that event would be impossible. The opinion that Russia is in no position now to maintain its space complex took the upper hand. But the agreement with India was not canceled either. According to Mr. Lukin, thereby Moscow killed two birds with one stone. Russia's support of sanctions against Libya, Iraq, and Yugoslavia was quite warranted. But Russia has had to pay a higher price for that than anybody else. The committee chairman is determined, with Duma assistance, to change the situation where "some people dance, while others get paid." Incidentally, he thinks that Iraq is essentially observing the UN resolutions, and the question about alleviating the sanctions against it has now grown urgent. As for the situation in Yugoslavia, it is vital to avoid a double standard approach here: As soon as it comes to the Serbs, sanctions are used against them; but when the Croats are involved, the FRG and other countries oppose it: "Yet both are guilty to approximately the same extent." The most acute problem today, according to Mr. Lukin, is the situation of Russian-speakers in the former USSR. Here, the head of the Duma committee intends to do everything "to make sure that these people can either live normally outside Russia or come here, with dignity." The Foreign Affairs Ministry has been reacting too slowly to this problem: "Its leadership resisted even when the problem was literally pushed under the ministry's nose." Now the Foreign Ministry is paying lip service to it. The problem with Russophones in the Baltics can, in his opinion, be resolved in a very simple way: "Speak softly but carry what has to be carried in your hands. There is no need to keep saying that we shall not withdraw the troops, but this can actually be done while smiling nicely and gently." As for integration within the CIS framework, some form of unification, according to Mr. Lukin, is historically inevitable. He favors a gradual and soft form of association, economic interdependence, and a single cultural space. Russia should find such a formula for integration whereby it would pay less (although it will have to pay in any event). "As to who will be the little king in what area, I could not care less," Mr. Lukin said. Touching on the territorial problems that can arise in the former USSR owing to the aspirations by, for instance, Crimea, South Ossetia, or the Dniestr Republic to join Russia, Mr. Lukin recalled the story of Shura Balaganov [a character in the novel "The Golden Calf" by Ilf and Petrov] who, having received a thousand rubles, picked someone's pocket for a three-ruble bill. He was caught and everything he had was taken away from him. Russia must not follow these rules. On the issue of the Kuril islands, the committee head advised to remember the wise Deng Xiaoping, who once said about a territorial dispute with Japan: A compromise needs to be sought, but if this proves impossible, our children will be wiser than us. Commentary by the international department The news about Vladimir Lukin's appointment as head of the Duma committee has been received negatively on Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry], to put it mildly. People there would have preferred to see Anatoliy Adamishin in this capacity. Now Andrey Kozyrev has an active and influential opponent in the Duma: Lukin is known not only as a critic of Foreign Ministry policy as a whole, but also as a person who has a "difficult" personal relationship with this department's head. Lukin has never made any secret of this and while ambassador to the United States, he approached the president directly, bypassing the Foreign Ministry hierarchy. Signs are that Lukin's relations with the Foreign Ministry on a number of issues will be even more acute than under Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, who headed a corresponding committee in the Russian Supreme Soviet. The situation in the Duma is objectively conducive to this: The mood in the chamber is often marked by a sharpened feeling of patriotism understood in its own peculiar way. In this light the conflict in the former Yugoslavia could become a subject of foreign policy debates. The point about "gentle smiling" on the issue of troop withdrawal from the Baltics apparently contains a serious problem. Now Vladimir Lukin is trying to put himself across as a man of business. It can be supposed that even with the outward similarity of his conceptual positions with those of the Foreign Ministry (the interview gives reason for that), Lukin will try to use his present position as a springboard for the ministerial post.
