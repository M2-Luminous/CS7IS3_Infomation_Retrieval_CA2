The April 1994 poll reveals that 51 percent of managers think the Dehaene government's action is "fairly positive," 46 percent regard it as "fairly negative," and 3 percent prefer not to give an opinion. Compared with December 1993, these results have only slightly changed, but enough to give the federal executive the support of the managers' "majority." What should be pointed out is that after seeming to be very unpopular for several months, the government has gradually won back credibility among the economic decisionmakers. Witness the fact that in December 1992, after nearly one year in government, it only received a 28 percent favorable rating; in April 1993 that percentage was no more than 18 percent (with a 78 percent unfavorable rating). The recovery, which is fairly clear, took shape in December 1993 after the overall plan was made official (46 percent favorable rating, 49 percent unfavorable rating). The prime minister's personality is a contributory factor. To the question: "Do you have confidence in the following institutions to solve the current problems (federal government, prime minister, regional and community executives, political parties, European Commissions...)," Jean-Luc Dehaene enjoys the greatest score of confidence. Fifty-five percent of managers say they have confidence in him, compared to 51 percent in December 1993 and only 28 percent in April 1993. The federal government receives a 41 percent favorable rating in this sphere (compared to 22 percent a year ago). It is outstripped by the European Commission (45 percent), which has nonetheless dropped compared to April 1993 (50 percent). The Belgian Parliament is unchanged with a 31 percent favorable rating. With 12 and 8 percent expressing confidence in them, the political parties and the politicians in general have gone a little further down the scale of perception by the economic decisionmakers. In passing, we should note here that the regional and community governments enjoy less credibility (levels of confidence of 37 and 35 percent, compared to 43 and 39 percent a year ago). Just three out of every 10 managers think the record of the ministers in their region is positive, compared with a proportion of four out of 10 in April 1993. Overall, although the federal government's popularity has increased a little, the economic decisionmakers have a fairly negative or even very negative overall judgement of political circles. It is therefore not surprising that the current efficacy of our government in terms of the handling of contemporary problems should suffer discredit as a result. More than 60 percent of managers do not think that Belgium will be able to satisfy the Maastricht objective, aimed at reducing the overall public deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1996. Compared with last December, this percentage has not changed (which is logical, because the spring budget changes were only modest adjustment operations). Compared with April 1993, pessimism has increased. In addition, almost 100 percent (98 percent to be precise) of the sample think it likely that unemployment will increase in the coming months. Ninety percent expect a reduction in the purchasing power of cadres, 58 percent expect major social conflicts, 51 percent a political crisis, 31 percent an erosion of the Belgian franc, however only 25 percent expect an increase in inflation. As was the case last December, more economic decisionmakers think that Belgium is "fairly ill-equipped" (51 percent) than "fairly well equipped" (45 percent) to face the near future. In April 1993, the proportions were reversed.
