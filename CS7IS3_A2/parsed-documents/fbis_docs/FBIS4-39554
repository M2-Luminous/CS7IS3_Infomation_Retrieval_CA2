Birkavs stressed that the Saeima's [parliament] Latvian Way faction and the leading coalition must consider the appointing of a new foreign minister. The new minister has rights to appoint his state ministers and the parliamentary secretary, said Birkavs. Presently Gunars Meierovics, Olgerts Pavlovskis and Martins Virsis still occupy their posts. Birkavs refused to name any concrete candidate to the post of the foreign minister. Birkavs noted that, while he is performing the duties of the foreign minister, he wanted to make several important steps in the ministry's work because coordination of the Foreign Ministry's activities with other ministries' work is needed.
