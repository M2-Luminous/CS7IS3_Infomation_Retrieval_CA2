Now it is possible: "Heads up." Italian Socialists are rediscovering the left. As in the rest of the world, they are aligning with the progressive forces, against the conservative forces, from [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli to [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. There was an atmosphere of euphoria at this new beginning. Having set aside the much-brandished Italian flag, the lost International has returned, and tears were shed at the appropriate moment. Moreover, there was a blessing from [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, whose arrival drew loud applause right at the start of Del Turco's speech. It prompted the angry departure of Ugo Intini, amid a chorus of catcalls. But that is another story. The old PSI and the new stood side by side in a hall at Rome's exhibition center. There were at least 7,000 people there, divided into regional battalions. In the front row on the stage some representatives of the nomenclature made a reappearance. There was no longer a presidium platform, for several reasons -- in order to avert impossible attempts at diplomacy and to mark a sharp break with the past. In any case, it was only an official christening. The congress takes place in May. Del Turco sat waiting in the audience. On the stage a plain table was provided for Gino Giugni and Enrico Boselli. Panseca no longer featured at this exciting working-class "opening night." It was an occasion for old friends to renew their acquaintance and for acknowledging old affinities. There was something of all this (a return to humanism; nobody now would take the old diktats seriously) with, in addition, some judicious asperity in Del Turco's remarks to his men. The battle is won, but the internal war goes on. This is why the name "Craxi" was never mentioned, and neither was the word "Tangentopoli" [Bribesville]. Break with the past -- He was hoping for the "spontaneous departure" of the investigatees that had "compromised" the party. However, there was no such "spontaneous generosity." Now there is "no turning back. Our path diverges from those who refuse to identify with the new symbol" (already approved by the Socialist International), "and who presume to dictate conditions." It is an "irreversible option" [no opening quotes as published] for a renewal that is "clear, open, and evident. Woe betide us if we hesitate. We will not allow ourselves to be intimidated." This was set against the defeated apparatus (who were also absent -- Craxi, Martelli, De Michelis, Ando, Conte). It was to them perhaps that Del Turco was referring when he said that it is "difficult to show affection and gratitude to those who think only of doing us harm." Intini was there, however, next to Alma Cappiello. Catcalls for Intini -- Almost heroically (he was suffering from a high fever), Gino Giugni had just finished recalling the "destructive moral pollution" of the old leadership group, when a chorus of catcalls came from the back of the hall. "Out, traitor, throw him out." Everyone looked toward the second row, where Ugo Intini -- having been wrested away from his appearances on any and every television channel -- was speaking. Craxi's former spokesman fell silent and sat down, with a grimace. He got up suddenly to leave when he saw Occhetto come in. It was like a historical revenge, 10 years after Verona and the catcalls reserved for Berlinguer. A few hours later he issued this exaggerated accusation: "Occhetto ordered Giugni and Del Turco to expel the independent socialists as a precondition for belated admission to the left-wing negotiating table." PCI [Italian Communist Party], Berlusconi, [Northern League Secretary] Bossi -- The new PSI has reversed Craxi's affinities. It dismissed Forza Italia -- it is right-wing -- and also the "preaching of egoism of Bossi and Fini." Del Turco silenced one lady senator who perceived in Berlusconi "the advent of the alignment for freedoms." What did she mean? "The freedom not to pay taxes, to expel all colored people from our country, to hand over to private enterprise all that functions and is efficient. What does all this have to do with the history of socialism?" He cited "the pictures emerging from Arcore" [where Berlusconi lives] with the following "clear language: Let the poor take care of themselves; the prosperous will survive." PSI and the left -- Meanwhile, there must be "equal status" for all. With the AD [Democratic Alliance] "the prospects are increasingly substantial" thanks to "common roots"; and the same goes for the "Christian-Social" group (Carniti was in the audience). There is no obligation to engage in controversy with the PDS, and there must be mutual autonomy. If possible, a joint battle must be waged; otherwise, there must be separate lists in order to avert "humiliating compromises." This was a tribute to the delegates' wounded sense of patriotism. But relations are good. Everything is fine with the Greens, less so with Communist Renaissance. Bertinotti (formerly of the Lombardo faction) received the tribute of a verse which Pasolini dedicated to [founder of PSI] Nenni: "Struggle without victories brings aridity." As for Rete, "I have nothing to say to [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando," who is seeking a "grim, disputatious, and counterreformist left." But if it is his ideas that guide the progressive forces, "we will opt for freedom of action." PSI and the center -- "Esteem and respect for Martinazzoli," less so for [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who "propounds the theory of indifference to alliances." After the elections there must be a constituent period. "Let it not be believed that all this can be achieved by means of an agreement between the major forces above the heads of the minority forces." The curtain fell, to the strains of Elsor's March. In the front row, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri listened and applauded. He was Craxi's shadow during his years of glory. So is everything fine now, too? He pondered. He asked a reporter to hand him his notebook, and wrote: "No embarrassment. The option taken is consistent with my own political and personal career. There are times when you have to opt for ideas rather than individuals."
