Han is scheduled to meet with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata Sunday afternoon to explain the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and discuss the U.N. Security Council president's statement on North Korea adopted Friday. Han and Hata are expected to discuss follow-up measures on the nuclear dispute. The South Korean foreign minister will call on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday to express Seoul's appreciation for Japanese cooperation in the Security Council's adoption of the presidential statement. They will discuss ways to maintain closer consultations on the North Korean question. Prior to his departure, Han held intensive discussions with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on resumption of the military exercise Team Spirit and beefing up joint defense capabilities in South Korea. Han and Perry agreed that the two countries will decide on Team Spirit's timing in subsequent discussions considering developments in the nuclear impasse, and when Perry visits South Korea in mid-April, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho. In the hour-long meeting, Han and Perry shared the opinion that Friday's unanimous adoption of the Security Council statement would exert enormous pressure on North Korea. Earlier, Han attended a policy debate attended by Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs.
