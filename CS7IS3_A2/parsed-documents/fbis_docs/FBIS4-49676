The festival is expected to be held in 16 Chinese cities. Indian performances, exhibitions and a movie festival will be held in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Guangzhou. The Indian Government will dispatch seven cultural delegations to China to participate in the festival. Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Li Tieying, Chinese State Councillor, Buhe, vice-chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Liu Zhongde, Chinese culture minister, and Arjun Singh, head of the culture delegation of the Indian Government and minister of human resources development. They also lighted lamps, an Indian version of cutting the ribbon, to open the festival. This is the first time for China to sponsor such a large-scale foreign culture festival since the founding of the country in 1949. The premiers of the two countries decided to exchange culture festivals when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited India in 1991, and the decision was contained in the Sino-Indian Joint Communique issued at that time. A 45-day Chinese Culture Festival was successfully held in 11 Indian cities in late 1992.
