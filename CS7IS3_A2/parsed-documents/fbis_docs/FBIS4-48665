The airport in Kigali has been a contested area and the UN activities have been disrupted a number of times. The United Nations has had to cancel a number of flights to Rwanda due to the heavy fighting at the airport. The United Nations has been trying to negotiate for neutrality of the airport with the RPF and the Rwandan Government forces. Now that the airport is no longer contested the question of negotiating neutrality at the airport may no longer be relevant. What is needed now is for the United Nations to work out modalities with the RPF concerning the use of the airport by the United Nations.
