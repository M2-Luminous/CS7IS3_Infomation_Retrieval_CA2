Etr." report: "Serbian Secret Weapon, According to Zhirinovskiy"] [Text] The "secret weapon" given to the Bosnian Serbs is apparently called Elipton and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian extreme nationalist leader, on a visit to the former Yugoslavia until yesterday, states that it is not a joke: "Russian counterespionage officers used it on Wednesday against a Muslim military unit, killing 12 enemy soldiers. Their bodies bore no trace of firearm injury and the neighboring buildings were not damaged." The Elipton apparently kills by some kind of ultrasound. The story may seem crazy and some close aides of Zhirinovskiy are playing down these remarks. But the latter insists and denounces skeptics and "all those who are afraid of the strength of his party and the new Russia." A section of the Serb press goes further, citing academicians with very grand-sounding titles who maintain that the principle behind this revolutionary weapon, capable of reversing the balance of forces with the West, is based on the work of Eugene Mathieu, a French mathematician of the last century.
