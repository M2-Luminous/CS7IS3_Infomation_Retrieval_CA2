It is quite possible that the latter will really happen. However, the first is no more than a very strained approval. After the Duma voted for revenue, expenditure, and budget deficit figures on 11 May, many commentators hastened to declare that the chief thing was done. It should be noted that the Duma itself gave reason for this, having put down, in violation of its own regulation, in the decree (where revenues were solidified in the amount of 124,477 billion rubles and expenditures, 194,495.31 billion rubles, the deficit totaling 70,018.31 billion rubles) that the draft law "On the 1994 Federal Budget" was approved at the first reading. Mikhail Zadornov, head of the Duma Budget Committee, confirmed the fact of violation of the regulation concerning the budget process to a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This violation lies in the fact that at the first reading the following were not approved: 1) distribution of revenues between the federal budget and budgets of components of the Russian Federation; 2) appropriations for sections of the federal budget in absolute amounts and in percent of the federal budget expenditures; 3) the list of defended items and upper limits of appropriations for them in percent of the federal budget expenditures (see Article 11 "Provisions Concerning the Procedure of Examination and Adoption by the State Duma of the Federal Draft Law 'On the 1994 Federal Budget'" adopted on 23 March 1994). Thus, there was no "first reading" (in general, this word combination can be used only in quotation marks). At best only one-half of it took place. Mr. Zadornov attributed such a situation to the fact that the Budget Committee was totally unprepared for the competent first reading on 11 May, because it could not receive and examine amendments and proposals by Duma committees concerning budget sections and items. It is obvious that on 11 May it was impossible to examine them just by hearing and, therefore, in the Duma decree all this work was postponed to the second reading. The Committee on the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances is now preparing for it. It can be assumed that its members, as well as understanding deputies burdened or not burdened by the obligation to lobby for someone's benefit, with fear or, conversely, with hope are waiting to hear and see how the bomb planted by the impatient chairman of the Duma and by leaders of most fractions will explode ("Yabloko," "Russia's Choice," "12 December," and IPRF [expansion not given] were against the submission of the budget for the "first reading" on 11 May and all of them, except the last, also voted). The smartest advocates of an increase in military expenditures, who lost on 11 May, set off the fuse of this bomb. At the end of last week they held parliamentary hearings, at which it was decided to again raise the question of an increase in expenditures on the "national defense" section. An amount was also mentioned: in the bracket of 15 to 18 trillion rubles and, of course, its lower limit was the limit of a compromise for these lobbyists. However, it was stated that the budget deficit should remain as before. From where will money be taken? Apparently, part of this amount can be covered by taking advantage of the proposals by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy, for an increase in revenues from foreign economic activity, privatization, and consolidation of the resources of extrabudgetary funds. Deputies will hardly agree with the fact that, in reality, all this will give approximately 30 trillion rubles and, in principle, revenues can be increased by part of this amount. However, since the revenue obtained will be spent on defense, the missing part will have to be collected through the redistribution of money from other sections. And then it can explode. True, at first everyone will hear only the bang of the detonator--at the very fateful meeting of the Budget Committee, where before the second reading it will have to decide which amendments for budget sections and, moreover, items of these sections (sic!) to recommend for adoption by the Duma and which to postpone. All fractions are represented in the Budget Committee, that is, it has lobbyists of every stripe and level. Such a meeting will not manage to make any sensible decision on what should be given priority. However, even if some lobby is poorly represented in the committee, it can have stronger positions during the counting of the total number of deputies. Thus, it is possible that the committee, inevitably gets into a stalemate situation. Not being able to decide what amendments it should submit for approval or rejection by the Duma, it will decide to submit all of them come what may. A stalemate may not happen in the committee. Nevertheless, in one way or another, the chamber has the last word. The bomb charged by the Duma's violation of its own regulation will explode precisely at the Duma meeting devoted to the budget. Need one say that, according to the results of the voting in the chamber, the amount for individual items can exceed the limit on a specific section, while the total increased appropriations for sections in no way will amount to the approved limit of the budget deficit? The practice of the Supreme Soviet shows that this precisely happens. Can it be foreseen that some lobby will meet another halfway and will let it have part of the appropriations? Thus, the Duma, most likely, will have either to expand the deficit after repeated votes and additions, resulting from them, of sums, or even before their beginning to declare the so-called "first reading" of 11 May a phenomenon of the type "the devil got into you" and to practice witchcraft, but only on paper, adjusting revenues to the amount of expenditures maximally suiting everyone. At the same time, it will have to try not to greatly increase the deficit in order not to anger Viktor Chernomyrdin very much, who from its rostrum once told the Duma with disdain: "You are not worth shooting." In fact, how can anyone give up something to someone else when the budget gives little to everyone? For example, it cannot even be assumed that there will be a majority wishing to reduce the expenditures on state support for national economic sectors (42,364.7 billion rubles were allocated). The following are the biggest items in this section: the coal sector (5.9 trillion); the agro-industrial complex (11.9); state investments (18.2 trillion, of which 14 go for construction, architecture, and urban development; 2.4, again for the agro-industrial complex; the rest, for debts for capital construction and into the fund for the revival of the merchant marine). Larger or smaller appropriations also go for the reproduction of the mineral and raw-material base (almost 2 trillion) and the protection of the environment, natural resources, hydrometeorology, cartography, and geodesy (a little more than 1 trillion). In principle, dealing with this section, agrarians can fight with coal industry workers for the norm of distribution of the fund for financial support for key sectors (the former receive 58 percent, while the latter, 42 percent of this fund), but there can be no clear victory in this fight if it takes place. Of course, 14 trillion for construction and architecture is a tidbit, but deputies from regions will hardly permit anyone to take them away. In fact, it is impossible to significantly redistribute expenditures in this section and all those offended will have to convince colleague deputies that the amounts allocated here and there should be changed. Nevertheless, lovers of distribution have a small field of activity in the section "foreign economic activity" (a little over 21 trillion rubles), where it is possible to reduce the amount of credits to foreign states (1.4 trillion). However, they have nothing more to do here, because the lion's share of this section (12.8 trillion) is devoted to an investment program (including the agro-industrial complex and the public health system) at the expense of foreign credits and, as practice shows, the connection of any money with agrarians' needs is the most reliable undertaking. It is difficult to imagine the Duma voting for a reduction in expenditures on social and cultural measures (12.4 trillion)--rather a reverse effect is possible--or on basic research and assistance for scientific and technical progress (only 4.2 trillion). The "national defense" section (37 trillion 126 billion) has already been mentioned above. A vote for its increase alarms the deputy's soul when the increase occurs at the expense of other sections. Nevertheless, the deputy understands that, apparently, this will have to be done through an increase in the deficit or machination with revenues. The section, where only 837.2 billion rubles are allocated for the realization of international treaties on the liquidation, reduction, and limitation of arms, is too small to nip off something from it. Most likely, only the fate of social and cultural measures can befall the 12 trillion for law-enforcement activity and securities bodies: Everyone will try to increase them. Court and procuracy systems receive 1.3 trillion rubles and also do not have chances to become the object of redistributors' longings. It will be more complicated with sections IX and XIV: state administration (3.8 trillion) and financial assistance for other levels of authority (1.8 trillion). The fractions that voted on 11 May against the "first reading" have already announced repeatedly the need to significantly reduce expenditures on state administration, but a response to their angry appeals has not been noted in the hearts of the majority of deputies. Although, if the majority somehow manages to connect such big money with something concerning the president, there is a chance for the Duma's intervention in these (and, especially, the second) sections. A total of 5.9 trillion rubles are also allocated for the replenishment of state orders and resources; 1.8, for the prevention and liquidation of the consequences of natural calamities and extraordinary events; 6.5, for the support of the North. All these expenditures are more or less indisputable. Apparently, nor is it possible to touch the liquidation and servicing of the state (domestic and foreign) debt (16.8 trillion rubles). If deputies have enough strength, in principle, they will be able to calculate that less (7.7 trillion) is spent on the domestic debt than on the foreign debt and they will be indignant. True, one can hope that deputies will want to probe the last section--"other state expenditures" in the amount of 8.9 trillion, of which only approximately 2.5 trillion are allocated for items. The possibility of adjusting revenues in order to reduce the deficit to a level acceptable to the government has already been discussed above. Despite official assurances that, in principle, the situation with the receipt of revenues is normal, this is not quite so. This is evidenced by Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin's nod during the battles in the Budget Committee on 11 May in response to the statement by one of its members that it would be good if in 1994 revenues exceeded 60 trillion rubles, that is, less than one-half of what has been planned. This statement is based on the dynamics of collection of basic components of the revenue part of the budget during the first and the second quarter of this year. Discussing revenues, nor should it be forgotten that the share of the value-added tax, from which the fund for regional support is formed, by no means satisfies the potential majority of the Duma and it demands an increase in this share. In general, going back to the degree of reality of budget revenue and expenditures figures written on paper, it should be noted that in our country in the last few years they have run far away, but in different directions, and could be stopped only through the direct nonfinancing of certain sectors.
