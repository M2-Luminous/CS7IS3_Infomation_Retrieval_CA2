Despite that, it is opening a new chapter in the economic debate. The question from now on is not how we will overcome an economic depression but how we will manage and take advantage of an upswing. Even Hans Tson Soderstrom, the most pessimistic of all economists in 1993, stated on Monday [10 January] that he no longer feared a self-reinforcing economic depression in Sweden. "It is quite obvious that we are not following the Finnish pattern." The 1990 tax reform put money in people's hands, enabling them to pay down their excessive debts from the 1980's considerably faster than the Finns could. As a result, domestic demand is now going to rise again at the same time that the volume of exports is soaring. How can the forces of inflation be kept in check until 1995-96 so that Sweden's economic recovery will last? That ought to be the main question when this spring's economic judgments and decisions are being made. Uncertainties should be removed to the extent possible so that companies will venture to expand their capacity in plenty of time. The main thing here is a quick yes vote in the referendum on Swedish membership in the European Union. The Riksdag and the government must also show that they are able to get state finances under control. In that respect, Minister of Finance Wibble's third budget is inadequate. It is an election year budget, not because of what it proposes but because of what it omits. It is true that the state is expected to borrow less in the coming fiscal year than it did in this one (220 billion kronor compared to 270 billion). Bank subsidies, lagging payments to the municipalities, and so on will disappear. But the national debt will continue to climb at a terrifying rate. It passed 1 trillion kronor in the fall of 1993. It will pass 1.5 trillion kronor in the fall of 1995, at which time it will equal 100 percent of our total gross national product. Experience in the few Western countries that have gone even higher than that -- Belgium, for example -- shows that the state will lose all room to maneuver. If drastic steps are not taken, fear of inflation will increase, and interest rates will rise along with it. External borrowing by the state will increase the money supply. Domestic borrowing will increase the competition for loans with businesses that are investing again. So the upswing will be brief, whereas what we need is lasting growth to bring down unemployment. The government is pleased overall with what it has already done during this term of office. The additional savings being proposed in the budget are marginal: slightly less unreasonable child allowance levels for families with five or more children, a maximum price of 25 kronor instead of 10 kronor for medicines beyond the first one on a prescription, a few hundred kronor per year in individual contributions to dental insurance, and a slight restriction on home-language instruction. The opposition is continuing to talk about incentives instead of savings, although Ingvar Carlsson has now hinted that a lower VAT [value-added tax] and an end to inflation goals may not be the right medicine as we approach an industrial boom. It is true that employment must increase, for one thing just to get public finances back in balance. But this does not apply to tax-supported employment. According to the preliminary national budget, the upswing in industrial production will have a bigger indirect effect on private services dependent upon industry than was previously thought. It is estimated that the number of people gainfully employed in industry and private services will increase by 105,000 during 1994 and 1995. A continuation of that trend needs to be ensured at the same time that the drop in construction is halted, employment obstacles and beginning wages for young people are reduced, and new supplementary means of financing social services are developed. The amount of the ATP [general supplementary pension] cash benefit needs to be reduced and the resulting margin used to introduce long-term health care insurance. But neither a hastily suggested government goal of 4-percent economic growth nor vague opposition nonsense about jobs is any help. The important thing is to get into a permanent pattern of good cycles. This means that the probable boom from 1994 to 1996 must be taken advantage of to make active decisions for keeping the national debt from increasing in relation to GNP. Four government veterans -- from the Social Democratic, Moderate, Liberal, and Center Parties -- recently told VECKANS AFFARER the kinds of steps that need to be taken: reduce illness, unemployment, and parents' benefits to 70 percent of their present levels, abolish the allowance for the first child (the state's cash subsidy to families with children has risen steadily since 1985 from 19.8 billion to 48.7 billion kronor), cut back on road and railroad investments, and reduce housing subsidies. In addition, unemployment insurance, which still has a deficit of 34 billion kronor, will have to paid for through higher individual contributions, as will the pension system. It is to be hoped that Anne Wibble and Goran Persson both know what is waiting this fall. But by this spring, the government will need to come up with at least a new long-range estimate regarding a realistic course of action for restoring public finances. That is something that is entirely lacking in the unfinished budget.
