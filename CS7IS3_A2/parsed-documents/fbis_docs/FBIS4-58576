In a statement today, Khalid said that the formula of the agreement and its supplements consecrate the isolation of Jerusalem from the occupied territories, suspend the Palestinian people's right to sovereignty over their territories, and give Israel the right to control crossing points, borders, and foreign security. He said that the agreement was not presented to the PLO organizations, especially the Palestine National Council, which did not authorize the PLO Executive Committee to sign the agreement. He called on the Palestinian people to unite their ranks and continue resisting the occupation.
