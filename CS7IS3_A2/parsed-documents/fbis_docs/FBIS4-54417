Answering questions from the press, Herenyi denied that his party is carrying on a negative campaign. Herenyi also said the MDF is "deeply indignant" at attempts to revive the fascist arrow-cross and Hungarist movement. The MDF presidium has called upon the state prosecutors office to do all it can to ban these organizations. At the same time, the presidium also cautioned against the resurgence of the extreme left. Herenyi said the presidium has learnt from local MDF organizations that groupings even more extreme than the Workers' Party, such as members of the former Workers' Militia, hold regular meetings, disturbing and intimidating people in many places.
