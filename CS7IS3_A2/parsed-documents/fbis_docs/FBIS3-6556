A photograph of the summit talks in the White House shows President Clinton and you turning your faces away from each other. The United States is now threatening to revive the Super 301 provision. Nevertheless, a global trend is that the center of the global economy is now moving from Europe and the United States to the Asia-Pacific region. What will be Japan's role in the Asia-Pacific economic sphere? [Hosokawa] Regrettably, no agreement was reached on the comprehensive economic consultations during my talks with President Clinton. However, Japan-U.S. relations cover not only automobiles, financing, and the insurance markets but politics, security, and international cooperation. It is very regrettable that no agreement was reached on economic issues. However, President Clinton and I have continued our dialogue to ensure that this does not adversely affect overall bilateral relations and that the two countries handle this issue cool-headedly. The report that President Clinton and I turned our faces away from each other is not true. The two of us left the meeting room shoulder to shoulder. The photograph recently carried in newspapers was taken when President Clinton looked back a little bit earlier than I did. Frankly, it is regrettable that no agreement was reached. However, President Clinton and I agreed to continue consultations. I have continued phone consultations ever since. Concerning the Super 301 provision, I expect that the United States will make a sensible judgment and action. It is unthinkable the notion that Japan will make no effort just because no agreement was reached on comprehensive consultations. Japan will make positive, substantial efforts in the future. We are hurriedly making efforts at cabinet meetings and on other occasions to map out meaningful measures before the end of March. [passage omitted] [Choe] The North Korean nuclear issue is a matter of concern not only in the ROK, Japan, and the United States, but also in the world. In particular, by using the nuclear card, North Korea is trying to hold negotiations with the United States and Japan to establish diplomatic relations with them. How do you, Mr. Prime Minister, think the North Korean nuclear issue should be handled? And, what do you think are the prospects for reunification on the Korean peninsula? [Hosokawa] I have serious concerns over the North Korean nuclear suspicions. I hope the nuclear inspections which started on 1 March will make smooth progress and bring clear results. I think the ROK, the United States, and Japan must cooperate among themselves, pay attention to North Korea's violent nature [nanpokham], and take a countermeasure [taeung] against it. I think it is necessary for China to positively have a hand in this matter. I will soon visit China. At every opportunity, I have expressed this hope of mine to the Chinese leaders and proposed that China show positive action to ensure that North Korea choose good approaches. I think resolving the North Korean nuclear suspicions is the most important prerequisite for North-South reunification. If the North Korean nuclear issue is not resolved, I think, no discussion on the normalization of relations between Japan and North Korea can take place, and the North-South reunification issue cannot be resolved smoothly. Therefore, I think the nuclear issue, a prerequisite for reunification, must be resolved first of all. [Choe] There is a dominant view that, after the end of the Cold War, the United States appeared as the sole big power in the Far East region. I would like to know the Japanese Government's stance to the newly mapped out security order in the Far East region. In addition, what is your opinion on voices expressing concerns over the revival of Japan's militarism? [Hosokawa] Japan would like to make contributions to the peace and stability of the international community within the possible range on the basis of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. This is the basic stance of the Japanese Government toward this region's security. Regarding the voices worrying about the revival of Japan's nuclear armament, I want to assure you that Japan will never change its attitude of only concentrating on self-defense under the present peace Constitution, considering the Japanese people's sentiment. The Japanese people, who have horrible nuclear bomb experiences, are highly allergic to nuclear weapons. In this connection, the three principles on denuclearization -- not possessing nuclear weapons, not manufacturing nuclear weapons, and not bringing in nuclear weapons from overseas--have been passed at the Diet. Under such conditions, it is impossible for Japan to have nuclear weapons or become a major nuclear power. [Choe] The United States is assuming a high-handed attitude by bringing forth the Super 301 provision. The trade war between the United States and Japan is also expected to have a great effect on the ROK. What is Japan's strategy regarding a countermeasure in the Japan-U.S. trade war? [Hosokawa] As I have mentioned earlier, it is necessary for Japan and the United States to make a sensible, calm judgment and act upon the trade issue. I think Japan should put more efforts into easing regulations; further accelerate the policies of mutual cooperation; and promote market opening. We are trying to arrive at a conclusion within March. However, regarding macroeconomic policies, we will probably need more time. But since the comprehensive economic consultations between Japan and the United States, which started last July, are made on a one-year basis, we are trying to put more efforts into solving various pending issues between the United States and Japan until the G-7 summit talks are held in Naples next July. Fortunately, nothing has yet been concluded and the issue on mobile telecommunications involving Motorola is entering into a phase of reaching an agreement. Small problems can be solved one by one. Regarding the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, Japan will make efforts to reduce trade surpluses sector by sector. [passage omitted]
