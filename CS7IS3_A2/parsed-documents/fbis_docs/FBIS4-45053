Twenty members of the GIA will be executed in retaliation by the AIS, Baa Azzedine's communique announced. You cannot touch the "chouyoukh" and get away with it. Meanwhile, Benhadj is said to continue his letter-writing activity with a letter to Zeroual. The communique signed by Gousmi for the GIA, Redjam for the FIS provisional executive committee, and Said Makhloufi for the HDI [Haraket addawla al Islamiya] and the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement] (on behalf of Abdelkader Chebouti who would have achieved the feat of being there while being elsewhere) suffers from authentication problems at a time that is propitious to all manipulations. However, there are some indications that this attempt to unify armed groups (the pious hope of Hocine Abderrahmine, instigator of the attack at the Houari Boumediene airport) and the subsequent communique may be genuine. First, the tone. It confirms, on the one hand, the approach of the three terrorist groups, namely the rejection of any notion of a dialogue with the government, and on the other hand the campaign launched in mosques to clear Makhloufi of the suspicion of being an informer, under which he had been since the death of Djaafar el Afghani. This almost unnatural rapprochement of Old Makhloufi and Iranian Gousmi must have been the result of a deal. The former pledged allegiance to the latter who, in turn, rehabilitated the author of the "Civil Disobedience Manual" who had been suspected of belonging to the security services. The second indication that makes it all credible is the reference (the first one) to suicide terrorist attacks. Those who have an idea of Gousmi's initiatory path will see it as a legible signature. Gousmi never concealed his Shiite preferences, and while others were trained in Peshawar he chose Qom for his Pasdarans and the training personnel of the Lebanese Hezbollah, the promoter of suicide attacks. Counterterrorism specialists established already long ago that armed group members avoid direct confrontation with the enemy. They fire at unarmed people, in the back, or when they are superior in numbers, but they never face death. In other words, this rules out suicide attacks. That people talk about it may mean that a new strategy is being introduced, a sort of Iranization of terrorist activities, but it bears the mark of the former coordinator of the FIS community office in Birkhadem. Baa Azzedine, also known as Mustapha Abou Mohamed, probably considered that Gousmi was blinded by his ambition. The communique he signed shows that he had read the one issued by Redjam, Makhloufi, and Gousmi. How can this small community executive expect to command all these "leaders with a prestigious past"? Controversial as he may be, Makhloufi is still a great figure of Islamism. Rabah Guettaf, mentioned in the airport case, is still a former comrade of Bouyali. Abassi and Benhadj rank practically as prophets. Chebouti remains the only known and recognized Islamist general. And now the Shiite from Birkhadem claims that all these men pledged allegiance to him. Baa Azzedine's violent speech denotes the determination of the FIS (the FIS from before the Batna congress, that is) to distance itself from the GIA, its mistakes and its dirty hands, on which is wiped today the blood of all the victims, especially the foreigners whose dead bodies keep weighing more and more in European or American parliamentary debates. By announcing openly that 20 GIA members were to be executed, the AIS, of which Katibet Ennasr, its "victory squad" wrote the text and decided on the sentence, Chebouti's eternal assistant just declared a war that carries all the germs of barbarity. [sentence as published] The mention of the names of the banned-FIS chairman and vice-chairman in this case of allegiance to the GIA not only aroused the anger of the "victory squad" leader, but it also poses a credibility problem. No armed faction, no matter how bloody its record, may get the honors of the jihad unless it clearly publishes the fact that it acts with the blessing of the imprisoned leaders. How does one extract this blessing, and in what form? No one knows. We know that the first letter that Benhadj wrote from his cell to Chebouti caused the penitentiary administration to react and change the conditions under which the FIS leaders were detained. Now we are told that Benhadj did it again, since he is said to have written to the head of State. The contents, it would seem, are far from friendly.
