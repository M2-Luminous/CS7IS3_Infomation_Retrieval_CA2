The well-known results of the recent parliamentary elections having been noted, a whole company of official presidential advisers -- recruited at one time or another more on the nomenklatura basis -- were given their marching orders in the Kremlin, and now they have started uniting the ranks of presidential experts. Knowledgeable people believe that some analytical structure is taking shape within the president's staff. It will be tasked with refining the strategic political line, and elaborating a course for the future development of which the head of state is responsible under the new constitution. The sphere of interests of the new super-center will include strategic problems of both foreign and domestic policy.
