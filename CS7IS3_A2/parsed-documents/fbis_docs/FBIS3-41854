In a communique, the state workers argue that the privatization of the nuclear plants ``would cut the main source of income'' of the National Atomic Energy Commission [CNEA] and would end the chain of research, development, and production. ``From the technical viewpoint, private capital does not offer any guarantees because the simple market law states that profit comes before any investment in nuclear safety,'' they stated. ATE workers state: ``The CNEA will be reduced to a comptroller's office which will merely oversee nuclear safety.'' The communique is signed by ATE Secretary General Victor de Gennaro. In it the organization ratifies its position ``in defense of a complete CNEA within the framework of the Presidency of the Republic and at the service of national interests.''
