This reporter has compiled his discussion as follows. Hong Kong's Economy Is Full of Vitality Lu Ping said: Hong Kong's economic situation is not bad of late. The stock market fell two days ago but went up again yesterday. How the market will perform today remains unknown. Naturally, the stock market cannot fully reflect Hong Kong's economic situation, but it certainly can to a certain extent. So it indicates that Hong Kong people are confident of Hong Kong's future and are optimistic about the mainland's opening policy. This is one of the reasons for foreign funds flooding into Hong Kong's stock market. The fact that a large amount of U.S. and Japanese funds flooded into Hong Kong shows American and Japanese investors are upbeat about Hong Kong and China. Some people say that the 21st century belongs to Asia, and I believe this assessment is entirely correct. Many people are upbeat about various countries in Asia, especially Hong Kong, which enjoys unique conditions. Hong Kong has been regarded as a stepping stone or a window because foreign countries which plan to open up markets on the mainland must do so through Hong Kong, while the mainland must also expand market accessibility for its products in Western countries through Hong Kong. So Hong Kong plays a special role in this respect, a role which is not shared by other Asian countries such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. I am of the opinion that Hong Kong's economy will always be full of vitality despite political disputes. Hong Kong has experienced several setbacks in the past. When the West was bogged down in an economic recession, Hong Kong was inevitably affected. But it was Hong Kong that first recovered from the effect of economic crises. Hong Kong has survived every setback this way in the past. Lu Ping continued: Now that there is a China factor, China's economic development is having greater and greater impact on Hong Kong. The mainland is a huge potential market and has a strong appeal to foreign countries. German Chancellor Kohl signed quite a number of contracts with China when he visited China with many German entrepreneurs not long ago. China and France recently published a joint declaration in which France promised not to sell weapons to Taiwan in the future. When attending a meeting in Seattle, President Jiang Zemin met with U.S. President Clinton. All this indicates that foreign countries take great interest in China's market. Nevertheless, Britain is now falling far behind other foreign countries in this regard, but other people can do nothing about it. Our policy is that we hope British consortia will remain and develop themselves in Hong Kong. We recently reiterated this position to a visiting delegation from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. I told them: You British consortia have done business in Hong Kong for over 100 years. You have contributed to Hong Kong's economic development in the past, so we hope that you will stay and expand your business in Hong Kong and continue to make contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. This is only our desire, but cooperation calls for mutual agreement. Without Mutual Desire There Would Be No Cooperation Cooperation concerns two parties. If the British side refused to cooperate with us, we could do nothing about it. Cooperation calls for enthusiasm from both parties. I have often cited the following example: We used to see in Beijing streets barbers carrying a shoulder pole with a burning stove at one end, which was used to heat up water for giving the customer a shampoo, and at the other end a barrel of cold water. There would be no cooperation if only one party was enthusiastic about it, like the barber's shoulder pole, which only had a burning stove at one end instead of both. We feel it is really a pity that the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements broke down due to a lack of sincerity on the British side. As far as we are concerned, the door to the talks is open at all times. We have formally told, through the foreign ministry, the British side our willingness to resume the talks on the condition that the partial electoral bill which had been tabled in Legco (Legislative Council) be withdrawn, because the bill has not been agreed by both sides. As everyone knows, the British side has always acted this way: It presented a certain bill to Legco for discussion while bringing pressure to bear on the Chinese side. After Legco has made a decision on the bill, it would say: You see, Legco has passed the bill, so it cannot be amended. If this was allowed, is there any point in holding talks? If what Legco decided on counted, was there any need for negotiations? So their tactics as mentioned before are absolutely not allowed. It is known to all that Legco is entirely controlled by the British side. We could follow their example by presenting a certain bill to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation while the bill is being discussed by both sides. If the NPC adopted the bill, we could also say the bill cannot be amended because the NPC is the organ of supreme power. If both sides acted this way, would it be of any use to open negotiations? Such is the conduct of mean people rather than of gentlemen. We feel it beneath our dignity to do so, although we can if we choose to. In April last year we set the following precondition before the talks began: No Legco deliberation of the problem under bilateral discussion is allowed; should this principle be violated, the talks would be suspended. Now that they have knowingly violated this principle, the talks naturally could go nowhere. If the British side wanted to resume talks, they must withdraw the partial electoral bill. We cherish no illusions about the British side mending their way now, though we still have good faith in talks. The British Side Has Lacked Sincerity From the Beginning During the 17 rounds of talks, we repeatedly reminded the British side of the principle. We tried in every possible way and made concessions to reach an agreement. In the latter stages, we suggested first discussing the 1994 electoral arrangements, which are simpler and more pressing, for district boards and the two municipal councils so that there would be more time to deal with Legco elections. They agreed to our proposal but advanced three preconditions: The first concerns the voting age, the second the voting method, and the third the abolishment of appointed seats. During the talks, we in fact made concessions on the three preconditions. We agreed on lowering the voting age to 18, which we also proposed long ago. We also agreed that the voting method be changed into a single-vote-single-seat system. We did not agree with the third precondition in principle because we must respect public opinion. After a total of 18 district boards had voiced their objection to the abolishment of appointed seats, it was the British side's business if they chose to abolish appointed seats in the 1994 elections, but we told them we will restore appointed seats after 1997. This problem was in fact solved later because the British side agreed with the Chinese side's approach, believing agreeing to disagree provided a good way out. But they raised new issues at this point by proposing that the single-vote-single-seat system apply in 1995. We did not say yes or no to this proposal but suggested that this problem should be discussed together with the 1995 elections. Our position was reasonable because this was a problem concerning the 1995 elections. Since they had agreed to first address the problems concerning the 1994 elections, the problem concerning the 1995 elections should be discussed later. But they insisted on solving the two problems together, saying it will waste time to discuss the voting methods for the 1994 and the 1995 elections separately in Legco. We replied that this does not mean wasting time and that it matters little to spend a little more time if this will facilitate smooth transfer of government. Legco had wasted much more time on discussions! How should this be regarded as wasting time? For the British Hong Kong government, this was a problem of technicalities, but for the Chinese side this was a matter of principle. We did not agree with nor objected to the single-vote-single-seat system, but after the 1995 electoral bill was tabled in Legco and a Legco decision made, the bill could not be amended. We adhered to our principle and made our position clear on 17 April of last year. Finally the British side firmly rejected our position and decided to unilaterally present the partial electoral bill to Legco for examination and approval. All this shows that British side lacked sincerity from the beginning. Therefore we will have to organize three-tier councils in 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law. We have no other alternatives. We did not anticipate this. While drafting the Basic Law, we decided to provide a through- train for legislators elected in 1995 so that they would be allowed to ride the train to the post-1997 administration. Our overall design aimed at smooth transition, which was our wish. Unfortunately our wish will not come true due to noncooperation of the British side. Despite this, we will still firmly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. We will make determined efforts to make smooth transfer possible so that Hong Kong will still be a prosperous and stable city after 1997. Think About the Interests of Hong Kong People Administering Hong Kong Despite political problems, we will still help Hong Kong people effect a smooth transition. For Britain, Chris Patten must go home in three years and it does not matter whether he goes by plane, ship, or bicycle. However, Hong Kong people will remain in Hong Kong for several decades and several centuries. After several decades and several centuries, Hong Kong will remain China's special administrative region (SAR) and everyone should contribute to Hong Kong's long-term stability. In this sense we hope to develop economic cooperation with Britons. Specifically speaking, the airport issue is in fact a very simple issue. We held eight-month- long talks on the issue and our premier signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport. One, the Chinese Government formally expressed support for the building of a new airport; two, the new airport must be cost effective so as not to leave a heavy financial burden to the future SAR government; and three, specifically speaking, the Hong Kong British Government should leave the SAR government a financial reserve of HK$25 billion (Hong Kong dollars), which is not a big amount. This is not an excessive demand. I should like to tell you: We contended for the 25 billion bit by bit. At first, they promised to give HK$5 billion. We asked them how the Hong Kong people can get along with HK$5 billion. That was why I said that they only gave the change. I have made an unpleasant analogy: Like an old lady doing shopping in the vegetable market, they haggled about the price. They finally agreed to give HK$25 billion and said not a cent will be added. In our view, the HK$25 billion was absolutely not sufficient, but there would be a land fund in the future. We are taking care of the fund now and will give it back to Hong Kong people after 1997. According to the earlier estimation, the land fund would increase to over HK$70 billion by 1997. This amount plus the 25 billion would make 100 billion. Experience shows that the land fund alone will probably increase to HK$100 billion by 1997. We must hold ourselves responsible to the SAR government and lay a sound financial foundation for it. In short, we hope Hong Kong people will have more money at their disposal when they are entrusted with the task of administering Hong Kong. A Guarantee of HK$25 Billion Is Demanded The future Hong Kong Special Administration Region [SAR] will be independent financially. Honestly, the central government will not ask for a single dollar from Hong Kong. They do not need to turn over a cent, and our value-added tax does not concern them either. The central government will not levy taxes in Hong Kong. But if Hong Kong has a fiscal deficit and asks for financial help from the center, it will also be difficult, I am afraid, to get it. Many localities and departments do not understand why we will are not going to levy taxes in the Hong Kong SAR in the future. They feel we treat Hong Kong too well and ask why we should treat it so well. The center is doing something for Guangdong and Shanghai in the hope that they will make a greater contribution to the state. The state is currently having financial difficulties, but some places are better-off. Hong Kong is, of course, much better-off. Nevertheless, our policy is that we will not ask for a single dollar from Hong Kong. Therefore, we now have to explain to every province and department why we cannot levy taxes in Hong Kong and why we need to maintain Hong Kong's financial independence. We should not view Hong Kong from the perspective of a little tax, but from a broad perspective and from Hong Kong's overall contribution. In order for Hong Kong to have a comparatively good financial foundation in the future, we demanded that the British Hong Kong Government offer a guarantee of HK$25 billion. Later, after the Memorandum of Understanding was signed, Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod said that the financial reserves by 1997 were estimated to stand at HK$78 billion. As we heard this, we asked him: "You said on the conference table that it was difficult to retain HK$25 billion, how then will the reserves come to HK$78 billion? It is just as well to retain the HK$78 billion." But he said no, claiming that the HK$78 billion was only an estimated figure and was unreliable. I said: "As financial secretary, you have to be responsible for whatever you say. It shows you are being irresponsible if you say something when you are not so sure of it. Although you said there would be HK$78 billion, for our part, we do not demand that you retain all the HK$78 billion for the SAR government. In any case, we only demand that HK$25 billion be retained strictly in accordance with the Basic Law. That was the first specific question. The Debt To Be Left to the SAR Government Must Not Be Added The second specific question was about the debt to be left to the SAR government. It is provided that the debt to be left to the SAR government must not exceed HK$5 billion. If the debt exceeds this amount, they must negotiate with us because they will only leave a total of HK$25 billion to the SAR government. If the debt increases, then the SAR government will be penniless. Therefore, the principle is very simple, that is, leaving no financial burden to the SAR government in keeping with the basic principle of cost- effectiveness. We thought that the matter was already settled when the Memorandum of Understanding was signed and that the airport could be constructed in accordance with the memorandum. If the British Hong Kong Government needs to borrow money, it can do so as long as the borrowings do not exceed HK$5 billion and as long as they notify us of the borrowings. The question has already been settled, but why are they now saying that they need to negotiate with us? This only serves to complicate the matter. Now the amount of debt they have agreed to will greatly exceed HK$5 billion. It will even be greater than the financial reserves to be left to the SAR government. Although the debt does not necessarily remain unsettled by that time and, in fact, it will probably have been repaid by that time, if any problems crop up there is the possibility of insolvency. Some projects in particular are loss-making deals. They entail high costs and bring low returns, not the other way round. As far as the airport railway is concerned, judging from the data they have given us, we see that until the year 2036, the annual profit rate only stands at 2 percent. Now they will put the railway under the management of the Mass Transit Railway Company [MTR]. Moreover, the data they have given us says the MTR also maintains that it is impossible to run the railway with a profit rate of 2 percent and that the profit rate must reach at least 10 percent. It is obviously a loss-making deal. If this question is improperly settled, it can be a very big burden on the future SAR government. The British Hong Kong Government is demolishing the eastern wall in order to build the western wall, that is, it is subsidizing the losses on the airport railway with the MTR's surpluses. For this reason the MTR has requested not to distribute dividends after 1997 which should otherwise be distributed. Moreover, the MTR also needs development and needs to construct new routes in the future. If it uses up the surpluses now, how can it construct new routes in the future? If so, it will inevitably ask for money from the SAR government. But where will it find the money then? Therefore, I say it is possible that the debt cannot be cleared in the future. We can see from this that they have no sincerity with regard to cooperation with the Chinese side and with Hong Kong people. They simply lack sincerity for cooperation with Hong Kong people and simply do not consider the interests of Hong Kong people. We also know that many contracts have already been won by British companies. Some are even on very unreasonable terms. There is no fair treatment for some public tenders. After all, we cannot use up the money that is to be left to the SAR government in 1997. We say that they cannot use all the money on constructing an airport because we need a very substantial amount for contingency uses. Honestly speaking, affected by the price factor, the current HK$100 billion or more of reserves will surely be worth far less three years from now. Therefore, considering the interests of Hong Kong people, we cannot make any further concessions on this question. The British Side Does Not Separate Politics From Economics The reason why I say this here today is simple. I hope the British side will return to the Memorandum of Understanding and construct a new airport as soon as possible in accordance with the memorandum. The British side keeps on saying that they have separated economics from politics. In fact, it is precisely the British side that has mixed economics and politics. Their words are high- sounding, but in fact they have lumped them together. It is not only on political matters but also on economic matters that they do not cooperate with us and Hong Kong people. To put it in irritating terms, they consider their own interests or proceed in everything from their own interests. Therefore, we regret the British attitude very much. Out of good intentions and in order to promote the soonest- possible settlement of the airport issue, our Preliminary Work Committee discussed some regulations regarding the airport management organization. I have read several times the data given by the British Hong Kong Government. There are many things there that I really do not understand. I had hoped the British side would send a person to give an explanation of some of the questions to the Preliminary Work Committee. The Preliminary Work Committee is our advisory body, and we need to solicit their views so that they help us in the talks with the British Hong Kong authorities on the airport issue. But, as you have also seen, they simply will not come. We did not intend to put them in a difficult position, and we did not specifically invite Gordon Siu Kwing-chue to give an explanation in Beijing. Earlier on, he had decided to attend a ceremony in Beijing on the 26th of this month for the signing of an agreement on cooperation in training between the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong. Precisely because of his coming, our Economic Group decided to hold a meeting on the 26th so that he could give an explanation to the Preliminary Work Committee. When we made this request, the British Hong Kong Government not only totally rejected it but also canceled Siu Kwing-chue's Beijing trip. What attitude was this? Was this the separation of politics and economics? Although we have failed to reach agreement on political matters, we should cooperate well on constructing an airport, which is an economic matter. But they are not willing to cooperate anyhow and we regret this very much. Finally, Lu Ping said: After all, Hong Kong is the Hong Kong of Hong Kong people. We are only helping them. The concerted efforts of everyone are still needed in the future.
