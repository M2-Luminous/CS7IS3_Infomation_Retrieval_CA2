He branded the Kim Yong-sam group's moves for the development of nuclear weapons as a gross violation of the joint declaration on denuclearisation between the North and South, a perfidy and treachery to the nation and a heinous challenge to the DPRK's efforts for denuclearisation and peace. Recalling the fact that the Wolsong heavy water reactor alone has produced as much spent nuclear fuel containing plutonium as is capable of manufacturing some 370 nuclear shells, he continues: "The Kim Yong-sam group is putting spurs to the development of nuclear weapons of late. It proves that they have neither the idea to take hands with the fellow countrymen, nor the will to solve the reunification question of the country in a peaceful way. The Kim Yong-sam clique is undisguisedly scheming to nullify the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation, openly talking about the `right to possess nuclear weapons.' This is motivated by their sinister scheme to justify and legalize their development of nuclear weapons. If their moves to develop nuclear weapons are not held in check, the whole nation cannot escape a nuclear holocaust to be entailed therefrom. All people who are concerned about the future destiny of the country and the nation, if only a little, must turn out in the struggle to check and frustrate the puppets' moves to develop nuclear weapons and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam group, irrespective of party affiliation, political view and ism and ideology. "The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately stop developing nuclear weapons to destroy the nation and at once step down as unanimously demanded by the South Korean people."
