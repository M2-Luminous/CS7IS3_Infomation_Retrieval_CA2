Yelena Sandomirskaya reports: [Sandomirskaya] According to Valeriy Dmitriyevich himself, he did not stop his work in the Constitutional Court, as he regards the decision on his forcible removal as unjust and legally incorrect, which is, I would like to note, not the same thing. But all this is in the past. Today Judge Valeriy Zorkin has new problems: to draw up a draft law on the Constitutional Court and to elect its chairman. As to the new Russian constitution, Valeriy Zorkin said that he has always criticized it. But because it is considered to have been adopted, there is nothing else to do but to protect the new main law. Valeriy Zorkin said that being a judge who always respects the law, he will guard any other constitution. I hope that the defense process will be held within the court and not far outside its framework -- this is what Judge Valeriy Zorkin promised.
