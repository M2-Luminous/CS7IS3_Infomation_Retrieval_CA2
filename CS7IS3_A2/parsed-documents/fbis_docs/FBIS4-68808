Morozov, personal correspondent (Salekhard): "In the Interest of the Northern Peoples"] [Text] The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" association discussed the results and implications of the March election and addressed a statement to Russian government agencies. It says: "As a result of the elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, there are no representatives of the small Northern nationalities among the three elected deputies. Only three of the 13 elected deputies of the representative agency of the government of the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug represent small Northern nationalities. This has confirmed the earlier fear that the present electoral system would lead to a situation in which no one in the representative bodies of government would be defending the rights of the small Northern nationalities. "The board of the `Yamal for the Descendants!' association demands that the RF Federal Assembly include quotas in legislative instruments on federal and local elections, pursuant to Article 69 and the first paragraph of Article 72 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, so that at least 25-30 percent of the deputies will represent small nationalities and ethnic groups." A similar statement was issued by an association of small nationalities from Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug. In the middle of March the State Committee on the Management of State Property issued Directive No 508-r. It defines the procedure for exchanging vouchers for shares of stock in the Gazprom RAO by the population of Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrug. The board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" association feels that the document "contradicts the essence of the Russian President's Directive No 58 of 26 January 1993 on the sale of 5.2 percent of the stock of the joint-stock company to the small Northern nationalities and the personnel of budget-carried organizations and organizations securing the development of gas condensate deposits." The association feels that the directive of H. Chubays' agency should be amended because it will allow all inhabitants of the okrug to take part in the check auctions, with no restrictions on the checks negotiated by a physical person. Even individuals who have never lived within the territory of the okrug will be allowed to bid in the auctions. The Yamal Investment Check Fund, which collected the vouchers of much of the rural population, has been excluded from the participants. All of this "will lead to a situation in which a privilege intended for segments of the population with little social protection will be granted to absolutely different groups, and primarily to commercial and shadow entities." That is why the board of the "Yamal for the Descendants!" association authorized, Kh. Kzyngi, its president, to send a letter to Chairman R. Vyakhirev of the board of the Gazprom RAO. The letter explains the association's assessment of the directive and expresses the hope that esteemed Rem Ivanovich "will, as usual in recent years, take effective action to protect the interests of the small indigenous nationalities of the North.... "The present situation is so critical that we have to take the necessary steps to let the population of the okrug judge the seriousness of our intentions to cooperate."
