FR940303-2-00023 FR940303-2-00019 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the State of Nebraska, Governors' Ethanol Coalition AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The DOE, Kansas City Support Office announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7 (b)(2), DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, State of Nebraska Energy Office (Administrator), to support the development, production and distribution of an educational reference document for alternative fuels and vehicles. The coalition activities are jointly funded by DOE and nineteen cooperating states. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Nebraska Energy Office (NEO) administers the program plan and grant for the Governors' Ethanol Coalition (GEC) consisting of nineteen states (IL, AR, NE, CO, HI, IN, IA, KS, KY, MI, MN, MO, MT, NM, ND, OH, SD, TX, WN). The GEC has requested funding for development, producing and distributing of a document entitled the ``Clean Fuels Book'' as a resource for educational organizations, legislators, policy makers, media, financial and other institutions interested in the clean fuels subject. This award recognizes the need to assist states in adopting alternative fuels in transportation markets and accelerating the implementation of EPACT '92 activities. The results from the activity accomplished will be shared with the participating GEC states and DOE for replication in other states and projects. Due to their prior experience the GEC is uniquely qualified to continue the efforts associated with their assigned tasks. The grant application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other opportunity to conduct such a program by any other organization or entity. The project period for the grant award is 12 months and is expected to begin in March 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $25,000 for this effort.
