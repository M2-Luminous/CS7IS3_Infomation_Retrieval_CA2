Speaking to our correspondent this morning, he said Labor had promised that through the peace process, it would remove terror from within the boundaries of the Green Line. According to him, since the State of Israel was founded, the state of security has not been as unstable as it is now. He added that he supports the closure but, according to him, the government has been pulling Israel Army soldiers out of certain places in the territories and replacing them with the terrorists' army. Such acts are stupid and dangerous to the citizens of Israel, Netanyahu said.
