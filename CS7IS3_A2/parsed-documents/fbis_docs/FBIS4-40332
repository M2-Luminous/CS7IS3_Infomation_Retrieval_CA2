They met the leadership of the Supreme Kenges and the Cabinet of Ministers, held talks at the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs, and visited military units. A news conference was held today on the outcome of the visit by Major General Alibek Kasymov, chief of staff of the main HQ of the Kazakh Armed Forces and Peter Heinrich Karstens. The NATO general told journalists that after the end of the Cold War, NATO is facing many qualitatively new objectives. Foremost is the expansion of the security area in the world, establishment of friendship with the former USSR countries and the Warsaw Pact. The Partnership for Peace program was designed with this aim in mind. Kazakhstan has already joined. One of the provisions of the program is cooperation in the military field. Later this year joint training exercises for ground troops will be held in Poland and Holland where Kazakh observers are invited to participate. One of the aims of the NATO delegation's visit to Kazakhstan is to establish links with the Kazakh top brass and learn more about their routine work. As Alibek Kasymov said, nobody dictates any conditions to Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan itself now determines the degree of intensity of its participation in the program, taking into account realistic possibilities of the program's feasibility. The NATO delegation's arrival became an important benchmark in the establishment of cooperation between Kazakhstan and that organization, Kasymov stressed.
