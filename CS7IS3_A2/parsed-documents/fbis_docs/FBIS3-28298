Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has hammered out a plan to boost domestic demand by implementing a comprehensive pump-priming package centered on implementing tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen and introducing a national welfare tax system. However, while Hosokawa has been forced to make a complete turnaround and "rescind the plan for raising and cutting taxes," U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor has returned home without achieving his plan to reach a political compromise. What has been left behind is a damaged image of the prime minister due to his failure to exercise leadership. "For the government to be thought of as being weak would be disadvantageous to Japan." These were words of concern uttered by a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] after watching the prime minister make a series of moves on the tax issue. On the morning of 3 February, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii briefed Kantor on government plans to boost domestic demand by implementing pump-priming measures. In response, Kantor said: "We hope they (the pump-priming measures) will help promote growth of the global economy." He had just finished making this comment when in less than 24 hours it was decided the government would start over from scratch on the tax measures. The government hopes to somehow work out a pump-priming package, which includes tax measures, before the planned Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, voices have been raised questioning "whether changing a plan, for which a news conference was even held, should be considered a mere matter of procedure," (as stated by a senior MITI official). Since, to begin with, the United States has expressed dissatisfaction at the size of the planned tax cuts, it is certain all the more that the U.S. Government holds doubts about the prime minister's leadership. Japan has hoped that negotiations in the disputed sectoral trade issues, such as automobiles and auto parts, would proceed smoothly if it could achieve a certain level of success regarding macroeconomic measures. However, it seems this plan has completely fallen through. What has been made clear in Kantor's meetings with Japan's foreign minister, trade minister, and finance minister is the gap between Japan and the United States on numerical targets. In a bid to seek a political compromise, the U.S. Government, which has complained that "trade negotiations are not progressing because Japanese bureaucrats are inflexible," has sent Kantor at a time when it felt that Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership has reached the highest point so far with the passage of the political reform bills. However, retracting the announced tax measures has left no small impact on the United States.
