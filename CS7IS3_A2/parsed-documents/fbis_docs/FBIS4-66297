The GNP rose 13 percent; per capital GNP increased by more than 2,500 yuan over the previous year. It is estimated that agricultural value has risen by 3.7 percent based on constant prices, with grain production topping 456.4 billion kilo and oil production topping 17.61 million tons. Industrial value increased by 19.5 percent based on constant prices. The people's income also increased: After taking the price factor into consideration, it is estimated that per capital cost-of-living income for people in cities and towns rose 10 percent last year; the rural population's per capita net income rose around 2 percent. People's newly added savings broke through the 300 billion-yuan mark. The markets were very active. It is estimated that after taking inflation into consideration, social retail sales actually rose 9 percent over the previous year. 1993's total import and export topped $190 billion, approximately a 15 percent increase compared to 1992. Despite the above-described fine situation, China's economy was still plagued by many problems. The pre-existing and the new problems together caused the overall price level to rise sharply, and this will have a significant effect on the economy in 1994. In 1993, the nation's total retail price index rose 13 percent over the previous year's. The price increases covered a broad spectrum of commodities; almost all major consumer products, labor and services, and factors of production were affected. After mid-July, the macro regulation and control measures adopted by the central authorities began to take effect, and overall price level and the prices of some factors of production leveled off some. But after November, inflation picked up momentum again. The price situation was even worse in the fourth quarter. The consumer price indexes in the large- and medium-sized cities soared; the low-income class and college and high school students had strong reactions. The prices of agricultural means of production were rising faster than agricultural product prices, and agricultural trade conditions were unfavorable. Despite the comprehensive price increase, however, the prices of energy, rail transport, and a handful of capital goods and infrastructure remained fairly low. The main causes of the above situation are: 1. The slow-developing basic industry has not kept up with economic development. Development of the basic industry, energy, transportations and communications and similar sectors has remained slow. The situation has not changed in 1993. Year-end statistics showed that rail transport capacity has increased only 3 percent compared to the previous year. Basically no new trunk-line was put into service the whole year. Last year was one of the worse years for rail transport in recent history. The power department has estimated that currently China has a power supply shortfall of around 20 percent. The Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area has a 8 billion kw shortfall; the northeast region has a 3-5 billion kw shortfall; east China has always had a power shortage problem. Based on actual needs, our elasticity of demand for power is greater than 1.2, but the actual average is only 0.95. Coal supply and demand are more or less balanced, but because of transport capacity, supply is still tight in the economically well-developed east and south China. The supply of steel materials barely meets demand even with enterprises working beyond capacity and with massive imports. Rapid economic growth has resulted in a strong demand for basic goods and infrastructure, which directly causes prices in the basic goods markets to soar and in turn causes the overall product price level to rise as a result of higher production cost. 2. Imperfect market organization and clogged channels fail to link supply to demand despite ample supply. Due to the slow relay of information, monopoly, regional separatism, and failure to organize supply in a timely fashion, product circulation in China has often failed to link supply to demand. For example, in late November 1993, soaring grain price was first spotted in Guangdong. It then spread to Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi and so on, and before long, it reached the north, resulting in grain price fluctuations over a fairly wide area. Actually, we did not have a grain shortage in 1993; we also had an ample reserve, but because grain management departments were cut in some localities, grain transfer and shipment was slow, making it too late to remedy the shortfall in some grain markets. 3. Behind the active markets is the hidden concern for inadequate market demand. The economy has been growing rapidly and prices have been soaring, which seem to indicate brisk demands and a lively market, but market demands for some products have been flat. For example, the market for household electrical appliances is already saturated; textile goods have long been in a slump; cement stockpile has grown to around 21 million tons, and stockpiles in the large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have continued to grow. It is estimated that the stockpile of finished goods at year-end may be 12 percent larger than 1992's. In the rural markets in particular, because the increase in the peasants' income has slowed recently, sales of agricultural means of production has also been sluggish, and sales of industrial goods in the rural areas has not yet recovered, and in view of the increasing scope of industrial production, these have become a potential concern. 4. Despite the excess currency in circulation, there are still some settlement problems. Since 1992 and for two years in a row, currency in circulation has been increasing at a rate of nearly 40 percent. During the same period, the national economy was growing at 27 percent while prices were increasing at 19 percent--the rate of increase in currency in circulation almost doubled these rates. Despite that, settlement remained a problem in many sectors; enterprises' triangle of debts continued to grow. Too much currency in circulation seriously threatens to further drive up prices, but settlement problems continue to call for more money input. II. Forecast and Analysis of Price Situation in the First Half of 1994 Judging by 1993's economic situation and 1994's plans for economic development and reform, it is expected that we will continue to experience a high rate of economic growth accompanied by high rate of inflation in the first half of 1994. The inflation rate will keep pace with the rate of economic growth and may exceed 10 percent or even higher. The causes of the high rate of increase in prices are: 1. The "rooster-tail" effect of higher prices in 1993: In 1993, while the economy sustained a 13 percent growth rate, the cost-of-living index in cities and towns was 15 percent, and in the 35 large- and medium-sized cities, it actually exceeded 20 percent. It is expected that last year's price increases will continue to have an effect this year, accounting for 4-5 percentage points of this year's retail price increase. 2. Massive currency input has generated strong inflationary pressure. The macro regulation and control measures taken after July curbed the loss of control over currency input that had begun in the first half of 1993, but there was still too much money in circulation. There was substantial currency input in the second half of last year, and at year-end, various specialized banks had approximately 180 billion yuan in basic currency. Today, the banks have twice as much reserve fund as they had last July; it has created a huge amount of high-energy money. At year-end, currency in circulation may nearly quadruple that at the end of last year. The state banks' plans for new loans in 1994 are based on a fairly high rate of economic growth of 9 percent; total loan volume will be 470 billion yuan, a 17.8 percent increase. Thus, the money supply which is ready to explode will have tremendous pressure on market prices. 3. The huge investment scope and unbalanced industrial structure will continue to be the main driving force behind the price increases. Although the total scope of fixed asset investment declined after the "macro regulation and control" efforts, it continued to increase at a rate of more than 46 percent in 1993. It is estimated that the state-owned units will have about 1.44 trillion yuan's work carried over from last year, 40 percent more than in the previous year. This year, in order to ease the restriction in the "bottleneck" industries, the start-up rate of new key projects will continue to increase substantially. Adding the state's matching investments in foreign capital utilization, this year's planned social fixed asset investment scope will be 1.3 trillion yuan, 13 percent more than last year's, and it is more than likely that we will exceed that amount. Accompanying this huge investment scope is the unbalanced industrial structure, especially the weak basic industry, which limits the increase in energy and raw materials supply, creating a large supply shortfall. Thus, it can only push the price level higher and cause a chain-reaction. 4. The potential effects of the restructuring of the economic system and price reform. Several economic reform measures will be introduced this year. Those that have potential effects on the overall price level include exchange rate reform, tax reform, and the structural readjustment of prices. The merging of the exchange rate tracks will make it easier for domestic enterprises to obtain foreign exchange, and so we may find even more imports this year, and enterprise production cost will also increase as a result. Tax reform overall will not increase enterprises' burden, but because of the change in the tax structure, individual enterprise tax burden will necessarily change. The value-added tax will increase wholesale enterprises' tax burden; retail enterprises' taxes will go down. In addition, grain, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, live hogs, and reprocessed resources and other previously tax-exempt businesses will be paying a value-added tax this year. The structural adjustment of prices will primarily affect grain, crude oil, and rail transport prices, but no doubt, it will directly push market prices higher. 5. The structural change in workers' income and people's consumption will also raise the consumer price index. In recent years, the income level has risen significantly. Statistics showed that from January to November 1993, the nation's total wage bill rose 21.8 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Specifically, wages in the people-owned units rose 21.9 percent; city and town collective economic units, 15.1 percent; other economic units, 73.5 percent, which set a historical record. The workers' nonwage income has also reached substantial amounts. The rise in labor cost has become another important factor pushing up production cost and product prices. Even more serious is the change in income distribution. A typical survey showed that currently, 2 percent of the population is accounting for 30 percent of the income. Meanwhile, the consumer market is also becoming more luxury-goods-oriented. A 2,000-yuan leather coat is no longer a novelty. The demand for soap and cosmetics has shifted to more expensive kinds that are either imported or produced by joint-venture enterprises. Motor cycles, air conditioners, video tapes, camcorders, computers, hi-fi, multi-function TV sets, refrigerators, telephones, and telecommunications equipment are already or will soon become hot-sellers. This kind of conspicuous consumption has a strong enticing or exemplary effect on the low-to-middle income people. Therefore, even though total demand in the consumer goods markets will not change dramatically, the change in income distribution and the structure of the products market will still push the prices of consumer goods higher. 6. The imperfect market construction and market organization cause sudden market and price fluctuations for some products. China's various tangible markets are small-scaled; supply and demand are scattered. The supply and marketing channels are disjointed for many important products, and regional blocks and market monopoly are fairly serious problems. Therefore, even for goods whose supply and demand are balanced, because of changes in certain policies or people's expectations, there can still be market and price fluctuations. If these fluctuations become frequent occurrences, there will be a natural tendency for prices to rise. III. An Analysis of 1994's Price Trend and Some Policy Suggestions Looking over China's current economic situation and the reform and development, it is inevitable that we will find price increases of significant magnitudes in 1994. Judging by the developmental trend, we may encounter one of the following two situations in the second half of the year: A) Given the in-depth restructuring of the economic system and the stepped-up macro regulation and control, abnormal price fluctuations and price increases are put under effective control; the rise in the overall price level will keep pace with the fairly high rate of economic growth. B) The economy will grow at high speed and inflation will be in double-digits, forcing a readjustment of the national economy. The result will be slower economic growth, but because various factors contributing to the higher prices are not eliminated, the price level will continue to rise, creating a situation of slow growth accompanied by high inflation. In the former situation, the price situation will be grim, but under the latter situation, it will be horrible. To avoid even worse inflation, we must include controlling the price level in our macro policy objective. We suggest adopting the following policies or reform measures: 1. Keep the increase in the money supply steady. The state's monetary policy must strive to stabilize the money supply. Considering the fact that there is already excess supply of currency in circulation, we must control the increase in currency issuance to within the sum total of the planned price increase and economic growth; the maximum rate should not exceed last year's rate of increase. 2. Keep the increase in investment demands under tight control. To control investment demand, ultimately we must turn to the restructuring of the investment system and other economic systems. Currently, while reform is not fully in place, we must still rely on administrative regulation and control. Primarily, we must adopt different financial and taxation policies when dealing with investments of different types. That is, for highly profitable and competitive investments, we should turn to higher-interest, commercial loans and impose a higher tax rate. For less profitable capital investments which take a longer time to generate profit, we should adopt a low-interest policy and commercial loans and reduce the tax burden accordingly. For low- or even no-profit public-good-type investments, the state not only must allocate special low-interest loans but should formulate policies to encourage society at large to make investments. In addition, the state should also take local development into consideration and guide and adjust the investment scopes in various industries in different regions. 3. Set up and perfect macro regulation and control and indirect market regulation measures. To prevent abnormal fluctuations of great magnitudes in the commodities market, the state should set up some agricultural and sideline product and industrial capital goods wholesale markets in the goods and materials gathering and distribution areas and the large and medium-sized cities. Thereupon, it should target the products' different characteristics and adopt different macro regulation and control and indirect regulation measures. A) For low demand-elasticity products, such as grains, cotton, sugar, salt, pesticides, and groundcove, we should adopt a regulation and control policy whose objective is to "guarantee supply." The state must resolutely set up a system of stockpile of important products in various localities over a period of time and in groups and diligently set up a special regulation fund and link the management of those products to stable market supply. For example, it should be stipulated that managers must keep a standard-size stock on hand. That is, they must maintain the government-regulated maximum or minimum stock on hand and operate as directed by the government at times of market fluctuations. B) For industrial consumer goods with high elasticity of demand, we should emphasize the construction and standardization of wholesale markets, and as much as possible, adopt economic measures to curb price fluctuations and, if necessary, resume the price increase application filing system. C) For industrial capital goods market which governs the trend of market demand, while we keep up the necessary macro planning and regulation, we should regularly make small adjustment through monetary, financial, taxation, and other macroeconomic policies. 4. Vigorously open up the rural markets. To open up rural markets, besides guiding enterprises to produce goods that sell well in the rural areas, the most important thing is to increase the peasants' income. On the one hand, we must set protective, supportive prices for agricultural products; and on the other hand, we must continue to encourage and support the development of township enterprises, and accelerate the shift of the surplus rural labor force. At the same time, agricultural investments must be given comprehensive preferential treatment through government policies. 5. Open up a variety of investment channels, guide the people in increasing savings and diversifying their investments, and dissipate the market pressure on hot-selling consumer goods. The most important thing today is to create conditions to facilitate the people's financial and real estate investments. The financial investment sector should be opened up more to the public to turn consumption funds into production funds. Reform of the real estate system should aim to help the people achieve the goal of owning their own homes.
