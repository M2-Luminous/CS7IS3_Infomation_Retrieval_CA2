Section 7.5) and the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552b), hereby gives notice that it intends to hold a meeting at 8:00 a.m. on Monday, December 12, 1994, in Washington, DC. The meeting is closed to the public (See 59 FR 61927, December 2, 1994). At its meeting on December 5, 1994, the Board of Governors voted to add to its agenda consideration of the Postal Rate Commission's Opinion and Recommended Decision on Remand in Docket No. 90&hyph;1. The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection with proceedings under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States Code. The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public and no earlier public announcement of the addition to the agenda was possible. In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code; and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations. The meeting will be held at U.S. Postal Service Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, S.W. The Board expects to discuss the matters stated in the agenda which is set forth below.
