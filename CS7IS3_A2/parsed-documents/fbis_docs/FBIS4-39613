This was stated today by Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian foreign policy department, speaking to journalists at the Russian Embassy in France. Today's exchange of opinion with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and other colleagues on the efforts of the "contact group" on Bosnia convinces one that the difficulties in its work should not serve as pretext for postponing the meeting of ministers, he pointed out. On the contrary, "in the next week or two" a second meeting of ministers on the Bosnian problem should be held. "It is clear that a political level is needed, first of ministers, and then also of the leaders of the countries in keeping with the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin, in order to bring forward a political resolution of the conflict," the head of Russian diplomacy stressed. "The `contact group' was able to do some important preparatory work, but it cannot replace the ministers." So, in his opinion, a ministerial meeting should not be postponed. The first such meeting was held in Geneva on 13 May with the foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, and five countries of the European Union participating.
