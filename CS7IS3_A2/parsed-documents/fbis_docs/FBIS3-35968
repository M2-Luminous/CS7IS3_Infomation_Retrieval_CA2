"I did not mention any issue related to alliance relations with the U.S.A. in my report," Popov told INTERFAX Tuesday. In his words, the RDRM wants "Russia to seek long-term allies and the U.S.A. can be one of them." He also denied having said that the RDRM platform called for "large scale government control and financing." Popov thinks that "reliance on the West and the Western development option did not work in the sense that the West was unable to offer resources for reforms in Russia and the recipes the West offered Russia made the situation here worse." He emphasized that "the International Monetary Fund's recipes were not what the developed countries had used themselves but what they had offered to underdeveloped countries." "What they had to offer to Russia was a Latin American option," Popov said.
