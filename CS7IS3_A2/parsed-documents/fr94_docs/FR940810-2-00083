SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most listed species native to the Unites States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ), requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. This recovery plan addresses recovery needs of five species which share a common habitat area by using an ecosystem approach that addresses conservation of basic habitat features the organisms share. The Draft Plan also addresses more localized or species specific problems and needs. The fountain darter was listed as endangered on October 13, 1970 (35 FR 16047) and critical habitat was designated on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). The fountain darter is a small fish that inhabits both the Comal and San Marcos ecosystems and was described by early collectors to be abundant in both ecosystems. Fountain darters prefer constant temperature and undisturbed stream floor habitats that have a mixture of submergent plants and mats of filamentous algae. The San Marcos gambusia was listed as endangered with critical habitat on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). This fish has only been known to occur in a small segment of the San Marcos River and apparently prefers relatively shallow, quiet, shaded, and thermally constant waters over a muddy substrate. The San Marcos gambusia has not been relocated since 1982, although several surveys have been made in its historical habitat. The San Marcos salamander was listed as threatened with critical habitat on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). It is a small salamander that remains aquatic throughout its life cycle. The San Marcos salamander occurs in rocky or sand and gravel areas with thermally constant, flowing water near spring openings. Habitat for this salamander usually includes aquatic mosses or filimentous algae that provide cover and food. San Marcos salamanders have been found near all major spring openings scattered throughout Spring Lake at headwaters of the San Marcos River system, and extending into rocky habitat below Spring Lake Dam. Texas wild-rice is an aquatic plant that was listed as endangered on April 26, 1978, (43 FR 17910) and critical habitat designated on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). This plant is only known from the San Marcos River system where it was once abundant in Spring Lake and the river. By 1967, the species had declined significantly in abundance and distribution. Plants usually grow underwater except for emergent flowering stalks, and are found in constant temperature, flowing water of varying depths. The Texas blind salamander was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). It is a small aquatic, unpigmented salamander with reduced eyes that are cave-adapted. The Texas blind salamander's habitat is in water-filled cavernous areas in the San Marcos portion of the Edward's Aquifer. The species has been collected and studied through collections and observations made from caves with pools that access the underground water table, and from well samples. The most imminent threat facing the five listed aquatic species is loss of stream flows and/or water levels in the Edward's Aquifer necessary to sustain the Edward's Aquifer and associated stream ecosystems. The species are also threatened by pollution from runoff or discharges associated with urbanization of surrounding areas. Additional threats include impacts from recreational activities, predation, and habitat destruction or modification caused by human activities. The objective of the Draft Plan is to secure the survival of these endangered or threatened species in their native ecosystems. Downlisting criteria are given in the plan for two of the five species. The Draft Plan addresses broad regional threats to ecosystem integrity as well as local threats to each species. Regional recovery efforts outlined in the Draft Plan include protection of the Edward's Aquifer, the San Marcos springs and river ecosystem, and the Comal springs and river ecosystem. The Draft Plan addresses need for a mechanism to manage groundwater withdrawals in order to assure continued springflows, and identification and management of existing or potential impacts to water quality in the Edwards Aquifer and the Comal and San Marcos River ecosystems. To address more local threats, the Draft Plan recommends development of local spring and river management plans, control of non-native species, and cooperative work with local landowners and water users to alleviate threats to the affected species and their habitat. Other recovery efforts outlined include developing propagation techniques and maintaining a broodstock that represents genetics of existing wild populations. The Draft Plan includes tasks to continue monitoring the status of all five species and their habitats, research to determine the biological and ecological requirements of each species, studies to evaluate threats and develop management techniques of each species, and inform the public of significance of these ecosystems to maintaining the Region's economy and quality of life for all.
