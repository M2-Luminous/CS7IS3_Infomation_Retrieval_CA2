The NATO ultimatum has provoked a furious Serbian reaction. In Belgrade extremists such as ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj have even threatened to bomb Italy and other NATO countries, as well as the blue helmets deployed in Bosnia. Defense Minister Fabbri, who telephoned U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, regards the threats as groundless; thus, the situation is very tense on the very day that the cease-fire has come into force in Sarajevo.
