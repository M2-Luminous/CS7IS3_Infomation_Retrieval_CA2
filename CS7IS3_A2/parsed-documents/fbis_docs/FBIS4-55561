Kanis and Army Commander J. Humaj, our delegation met with L. Kolencik, commander of the Slovak engineering battalion in the former Yugoslavia, at its base in Daruvar, approximately 120 km east of Zagreb. Colonel Kolencik briefed the delegation on the battalion's situation and on the work it has done and will do in the very near future. He said that our unit has an important position within the UN peacekeeping forces in view of its activities, which consist mainly of constructing and repairing roads and bridges as well as disarming mines. To date, Slovak engineers have built eight new bridges, and, in the Lipik district and Sarajevo, they have checked for mines over almost 30,000 square meters of terrain, have completely repaired 96 km of roads, and have built more than 30 watchtowers. In this context, he asked Minister Kanis to expand the military hardware to include several STRALOM-type tanks, which will make it easier to remove mines. Kolencik also emphasized that, in the future, it will be necessary to tighten up the criteria for selecting the command corps for UN missions. The Slovak ambassador to Croatia, M. Kucera, asked the military delegation to make available at least one helicopter to the Slovak contingent's command in the former Yugoslavia to allow for greater flexibility in supervising the individual groups in this large area. The delegation was also in Lipik, where the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supreme commander, General Bertrand de La Presle, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Slovak engineering battalion's deployment in this part of Europe, presented a UN commemorative medal to its 144 members for their involvement in the peace mission. A further 210 members of the unit were awarded a ribbon, second class. B. de La Presle highlighted the high morale of the battalion, which a year ago was given the honor of participating alongside another 30 armies in resolving the Balkans conflict and thus entered into the consciousness of the world community. He also added that this is one of the best units that has served under his command. The commemoration, which, apart from the UNPROFOR supreme commander, was also attended by the commanders of other UN units, continued with a parade of military hardware and a gala reception.
