FR940803-0-00128 FR940803-0-00040 (2) Vehicle car line; (3) Engine displacement, in cubic inches, cubic centimeters, or liters whichever is consistent with the customary description of that engine; (4) Number of engine cylinders or rotors; (5) Additional engine description, if necessary to distinguish otherwise identical model types, as approved by the Administrator; (6) Fuel metering system, including number of carburetor barrels, if applicable; (7) Transmission class; (8) Catalyst usage, if necessary to distinguish otherwise identical model types; and (9) California emission control system usage, if applicable and if the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy from those intended for sale in other states. (d) The vehicle description on specific labels will be as follows: (1) The descriptions of paragraph (c) of this section; (2) Inertia weight class; (3) Axle ratio; and (4) Other engine or vehicle parameters, if approved by the Administrator. (e) Where the fuel economy label is incorporated with the pricing information sticker, the applicable vehicle description, as set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, does not have to be repeated if the information is readily found on the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act label. (f)(1) For fuel economy labels of passenger automobile model types requiring a tax statement under §600.513, the phrase ``*␣*␣* Gas Guzzler Tax: $ XXXXXX *␣*␣*''. (2) The tax value required by this paragraph shall be based on the combined fuel economy value for the model type calculated in accordance with §600.207 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg. Adjustments in accordance with §600.209 will not be used to determine the tax liability. (g) General labels. The annual fuel cost estimate for operating an automobile included in a model type shall be computed by using values for the fuel cost per volume (gallon for liquid fuels, cubic foot for gaseous fuels) and average annual mileage, predetermined by the Administrator, and the fuel economy determined in §600.209(d). (1) The annual fuel cost estimate for a model type is computed by multiplying: (i) Fuel cost per gallon (natural gas must be expressed in units of cost per equivalent gallon, where 100 SCF = 0.823 equivalent gallons) expressed in dollars to the nearest 0.05 dollar; by (ii) Average annual mileage, expressed in miles per year to the nearest 1,000 miles per year; by (iii) The average, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 gallons per mile (natural gas must be expressed in units of gallons equivalent per mile where 100 SCF=0.823 equivalent gallons) of the fuel economy value determined in §600.209(d) for a model type. (2) The product computed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and rounded to the nearest dollar per year will comprise the annual fuel cost estimate that appears on general labels for the model type. (h) Specific labels. The annual fuel cost estimate for operating an automobile included in a vehicle configuration will be computed by using the values for the fuel cost per volume (gallon for liquid fuels, cubic feet for gaseous fuels) and average mileage and the fuel economy determined in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section. (1) The annual fuel cost estimate for vehicle configuration is computed by multiplying: (i) Fuel cost per gallon (natural gas must be expressed in units of cost per equivalent gallon, where 100 SCF=0.823 equivalent gallons) expressed in dollars to the nearest 0.05 dollar; by (ii) Average annual mileage, expressed in miles per year to the nearest 1,000 miles per year; by (iii) The inverse, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 gallons per mile (natural gas must be expressed in units of gallon equivalent per mile, where 100 SCF=0.823 equivalent gallons) of the fuel economy value determined in §600.206(a)(2)(iii) for a vehicle configuration (city and highway values will be adjusted by the factors in §600.209(a) and (b) and combined according to §600.209(d) before the calculation). (2) The product computed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and rounded to the nearest dollar per year will comprise the annual fuel cost estimate that appears on specific labels for that vehicle configuration. Subpart F_[Amended] 22. A new §600.501&hyph;93 is added to subpart F to read as follows: §600.501&hyph;93 General applicability. (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to 1993 and later model year gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles. (b)(1) Manufacturers that produce only electric vehicles are exempt from the requirement of this subpart, except with regard to the requirements in those sections pertaining specifically to electric vehicles. (2) Manufacturers with worldwide production (excluding electric vehicle production) of less than 10,000 gasoline-fueled and/or diesel powered passenger automobiles and light trucks may optionally comply with the electric vehicle requirements in this subpart.
