Many people here believe that it is irresponsible for the U.S. to slash its imports of textiles from China by 25 percent to 35 percent in 1994, just at a time when the two countries are set to start their fourth round of negotiations on bilateral textile trade. The U.S. action will seriously damage Sino-U.S. trade, they said. A senior manager with the China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation told XINHUA that the U.S. action goes against the doctrine of free trade espoused worldwide, as well as the Multilateral Fibers Agreement. "It creates new obstacles for Chinese textiles as far as access to the U.S. market is concerned, and will inevitably hurt the interests of American consumers," he said. During the first 11 months of last year the volume of China's textile exports to the U.S. through normal channels accounted for 13.1 percent of the country's total textile exports during the same period. Zhao Guohua, deputy general manager of the Sanhuan Woolen and Knitwear Corporation, based in Beijing, said China has adopted a series of measures to halt the illicit transshipment of textiles. Five Chinese companies were punished last December for illegal shipment of textiles, he noted. "The U.S. action, in disregard of China's efforts to curb the illegal transfer of textile products, will not weed out such a practice; instead it will only harm lawful textile exporters," he said. An official of the China National Textile Council said China is promoting a large-scale technological transformation of its textile industry, involving some U.S. interests. "The Sino-American textile trade, as well as imports of textile technologies from the U.S. and other Sino-American co-operation projects are bound to be affected by the headstrong action taken by the U.S. as regards the textile import quota from China," he said. He added that the obstinacy on the part of the U.S. in this regard is in fact a kind of power politics, "coercing the Third World countries with its economic supremacy." All the people interviewed by XINHUA said they hoped that a way out of the impasse in the interests of both countries could be found through negotiations so as to guarantee a healthy development of bilateral trade, especially the textile trade.
