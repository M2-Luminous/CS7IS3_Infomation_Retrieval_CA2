We oppose the export of internal problems of separate countries, Greek Minister of Macedonia and Thrace Dr. Konstandinos Triaridhis told Bulgarian journalists in Thessaloniki on May 24. He stressed the need for the promotion of Bulgarian-Greek economic cooperation, including the establishment of new transport links. The meeting coincided with the visit by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov in Athens. Dr. Triaridhis said the ministry in his charge implemented the policy of the Greek Government. He elaborated on Greek views on development in the Balkans. According to him, all countries in the regions, including Greece, have their share of problems. Greece is a member of the European Union whereas other Balkan states, including Bulgaria, would like to join in, and integrate into European structures. Greece would like to help those countries, from which it would benefit itself. Hopefully, these Balkan states will have made progress in some ten years, including Albania and Skopje, said the Greek minister. Greece is trying to help cope with difficulties, he said. He said Greece is glad about meetings such as that with Minister Daskalov. But it also would like to see livelier contacts among non-governmental bodies, among journalists, business and ordinary people. He cited recent meetings in Varna and Khaskovo. According to Triaridhis, the strengthening of economic cooperation in the Balkans and especially between Bulgaria and Greece can benefit integration between the Middle East and Central Europe. Dr. Triaridhis elaborated on the Greek stand on Skopje. He said that if Skopje leaders show willingness for dialogue in the Balkans, Greece was ready to lift the embargo today, not tomorrow, but Greece could not tolerate manifestations of fanaticism in Skopje. According to him, these manifestations can create problems for Blagoevgrad and Sofia, and involve Greece and Albania, too. Greece opposed a time bomb that might explode in some five years. The Skopje problem is a problem for the Balkans, said Triaridhis. According to him, it is a paradox that Bulgaria, which is in the same situation as Greece, supports the name of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Greek minister stressed that the war in Bosnia should end as soon as possible. Involvement by Turkey, Albania and others would only aggravate it. He also commented on the long-lasting embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) which has severely hit Greece and Bulgaria. According to him, it is very bad that Balkan countries let foreigners manage the situation is the Balkans. The Greek minister focused on major guidelines for the development of Macedonia and Thrace, that concern not only Greece but can have a positive impact in other Balkan countries, especially Bulgaria and Albania. According to him, this is of interest to the Bulgarian Government. Dr Triaridhis said there were no minorities in Macedonia and Thrace but religious communities that have all the rights and obligations of Greek citizens.
