Background on the Utah Program On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, Federal Register (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16, and 944.30. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated January 27, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;888). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed to revise were: Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;200&hyph;100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;200, responsibilities of the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining concerning (1) notice of intention to conduct minor coal exploration and (2) major coal exploration permits; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100, requirements for coal exploration approval; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100, required documents for notice of intention to conduct minor coal exploration and major coal exploration permits. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the February 25, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 9152), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;897). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on March 28, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232, roads and other transportation facilities, and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, disturbance of the hydrologic balance, and provided editorial comments. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated April 15, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;915). Utah responded in a letter dated May 10, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;921).
