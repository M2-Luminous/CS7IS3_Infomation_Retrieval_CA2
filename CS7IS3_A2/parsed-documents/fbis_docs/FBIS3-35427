FBIS3-35427 "drnes037_j_94001" FBIS-NES-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA `Official Source' Criticizes Leaders' Recent Actions JN2302130694 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1205 GMT 23 Feb 94 JN2302130694 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] In light of the current situation and its developments since the signing of the document of pledge and accord in Amman, an official source has made the following statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA': Following the signing of the pledge and accord document, and amid the joy and happiness which prevailed throughout the Yemeni homeland on this occasion, the masses of the people were surprised at the refusal of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership to return to the capital of the homeland and to convene the state legislative and executive institutions to embark on the practical implementation of the document provisions. Instead of showing concern for the immediate implementation of the document following its signing, the YSP leadership paid visits abroad that were not agreed on and without the knowledge of the state presidency or the Foreign Ministry which are charged by the Constitution with running the foreign affairs of the Republic of Yemen. This shows that the YSP leadership is not interested in the immediate implementation of the pledge and accord document. Instead of ending the crisis, this would further escalate it and continue its dangers despite the fact that all have agreed that the signing of the pledge and accord document came to put an end to the crisis and to immediately move to the practical implementation of all provisions of the pledge and accord document. As we reiterate our full concern to develop and reinforce the ties of fraternity, cordiality, and joint cooperation between the Republic of Yemen and all its sisterly and friendly states; and as we reiterate our commitment to expand these relations -- despite all that could be created by the contacts of the YSP leadership -- any effort that does not stem from constitutional legitimacy and common responsibility cannot yield fruit. As we greatly appreciate the good intentions with which these sisterly countries welcomed some leaders of the YSP, proceeding from their strong fraternal relations with the Republic of Yemen, this stand by the party blatantly conflicts with the interests of the homeland and with the provisions of the pledge and accord document. This also coincides with the military escalation represented by moving the al-Wahdah Brigade from the Hadramaut Governorate and the subsequent move of 30 tanks from the city of Aden to the Abyan Governorate which took place on 21 February. This is despite the fact that instructions and orders have been issued by the chairman of the Presidential Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces not to move any military units in compliance with the Constitution and the provisions of the pledge and accord document to save the citizens of the Abyan Governorate from the suffering they have been experiencing as a result of this military escalation. All this confirms the existence of premeditated intentions aimed at foiling the implementation of the pledge and accord document and at obstructing all good offices aimed at ending the bloodshed, protecting the unity, and reinforcing democracy. This also reiterates the existence of these premeditated intentions before and after the final signing of the document as well as the objective of harming the homeland's unity, sovereignty, security, and stability. This requires all members of our people, our Armed Forces, and security organs to be on maximum alert to prevent the realization of these suspicious intentions that are covered by a media campaign, which employs deception and trickery, and incites sectarian, fractional, and tribal problems aimed to divide Yemen after this great unionist achievement was realized for our people on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic manner. The document of pledge and accord emphasized that its implementation requires a strong political will that is united in words and deeds, fulfillment of promises, honesty, and commitment. All of this urges everybody to respect the responsibility of their signatures before the public opinion inside and abroad. Regrettably, we see the YSP's leadership behaving in a different manner than what had been agreed on. Since the first moments after the signing ceremony in Amman, this leadership followed a policy based on disavowal of the pledge and accord document and disassociating itself from commitment to the people's collective will and the democratic option. This behavior harms the unity of the homeland and people at present and in the future. Our national duties and responsibilities call on us to continue to adhere to unity and democracy, and to inform the masses and all political parties and organizations, scholars, and social figures of the seriousness of the current situation, for which the YSP's leadership bears complete responsibility since the beginning of the crisis on 19 August 1993. This leadership practically emphasizes its rejection to commit itself to the document of pledge and accord, and its insistence on escalating the crisis and situation, and on keeping the country suffering from the political crisis. This will only serve the enemies of unity and democracy. We will not spare any effort to keep the public opinion informed of all facts and developments. We pray God to guide all to the right path, He is the best Lord and supporter.
