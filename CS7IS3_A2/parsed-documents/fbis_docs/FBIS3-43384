The closing ceremony was chaired by National Assembly speaker Andre Milongo. A plenary session was held in the morning of the same day, during which the 1994 state budget was adopted. Andre Mimossi, a permanent correspondent at the Parliamentary Palace, has the details: [Begin recording] [Mimossi] [passage omitted] During the extraordinary session, parliamentarians discussed the major item of their deliberations, which is no other than the 1994 financial draft bill, that is the state budget for this year, as well as the basis upon which it was drafted, namely the economic and social recovery plan known as PARESO [expansion unknown]. The 1994 budget, which was adopted by the National Assembly is nearly 166 billion CFA francs, that is 38.64 billion CFA francs less than the figure for last year. By adopting the text submitted to it at the session, the National Assembly has just paved the way for a reassuring future for Congo. Assembly speaker Andre Milongo pointed out the importance of this text. [Milongo] During the deliberations, the honorable parliamentarians examined the various draft bills which would enable us in the very near future to set up local councils and allow for unrestricted management of local authorities. With the adoption of this text our country has taken a major step in the march toward the country's decentralization and municipalization. I am convinced that this praiseworthy policy will contribute to the development of our regions and municipalities through the control and valorization of their own human, economic, and technical resources. However, it must be stressed that the step being taken is realistic and cautious because in the first stage, only the regions and municipalities will be upgraded into administrative entities. During the same session, our honorable assembly also examined and adopted the 1994 appropriation bill, as well as the action program for economic and social recovery, PARESO, which accompanies it. These measures will enable the government to reorganize and improve the economic and social fabric which is now in a shambles. [passage omitted] I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our honorable parliamentarians for all the initiatives taken, which led to the adoption of the statement on the restoration of peace in the country at their congress meeting on 16 December 1993. I hope that there will soon be a return to peace now that the measures included in the statement have been effectively implemented. I, therefore, urge all the honorable parliamentarians, and I repeat, honorable parliamentarians to work tirelessly and above all sincerely for peace in their various constituencies because working for peace means ensuring one's own security. Collective security is the best security. [end recording]
