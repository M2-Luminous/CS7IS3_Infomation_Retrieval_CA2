FBIS4-23500 "drafr110_a_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire Opposition Press Criticizes French `Hypocrisy' Opposition Press Criticizes French `Hypocrisy' AB0706200694 Paris AFP in French 1452 GMT 7 Jun 94 AB0706200694 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Kinshasa, 7 Jun (AFP) -- The Zairian opposition press today published the criticisms leveled against France on 5 June at a rally organized by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS], Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's radical opposition party. UPDS executive committee member Kibassa Maliba had on that occasion severely criticized France's position on Zaire -- France was accused of "supporting dictatorship" -- and announced that a campaign would be organized to boycott French interests in Zaire. According to LE PHARE, this is a "real declaration of holy war reminiscent of what Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has launched against French interests, in particular. "Both in Kinshasa and up-country, people are today convinced that France does not deserve anything better than the war now being waged against her by FIS fighters," the paper continued. "Thank God," the paper adds, "the difference is that the Bantu is essentially nonviolent by nature." So, French nationals in Zaire do not risk waking up one day to the reality of finding their throats cut, their children's heads smashed, and their women raped. But it must be repeated that this does not in anyway attenuate the hatred which the Zairian public henceforth has for this Mitterrand style of hypocrisy. In its own installment, LE PALMARES is of the view that "France is a thorn in the flesh of Democratic Zaire" and accuses her of "infiltrating the Zairian democratic process to draw attractive dividends from it." The paper further writes, "France is enticed by the hope of deriving economic benefits from the rich Central African region." For its part, LA REFERENCE-PLUS points out that "the spontaneous enthusiasm" created by the criticisms leveled against France among participants at the 5 June rally is a testimony "that it will not be a good thing for a countryman of Francois Mitterrand to invest tomorrow in Zaire."
