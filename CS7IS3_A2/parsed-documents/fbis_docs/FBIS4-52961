Presently, the United States is arrogantly and shamelessly planning to serve as ringleader of the allies in providing arms to the communist Vietnamese's puppets and two-headed government for continuing to kindle the war to kill the Cambodian nation and people. II. This is a continuation of the strategy of the allies and the communist Vietnamese to pit the traitorous Cambodians against the patriotic Cambodians and Cambodian people to kill the Cambodian nation and people, thus enabling them to compete for the benefits of the Cambodian nation and people. III. After our nation and people valiantly and arduously struggled for the past 10 years and more against the aggressor communist Vietnamese, thus inflicting heavy defeats on them and plunging them into an impasse, the Western allies, headed by the United States, have resorted to a new strategy by joining hands with the communist Vietnamese to continue slaying the Cambodian nation and people. The Baker-Shevardnadze communique issued in Paris in July 1990 is an official and open declaration of this new strategy. The communist Vietnamese's goal is to smash Democratic Kampuchea so that they can annex and turn Cambodia into another Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. They have continued to kindle their war of aggression in Cambodia to seek a chance to send more Vietnamese nationals to engulf Cambodia. The United States and its evil allies also have the goal to smash Democratic Kampuchea to put Cambodia into their sphere of influence. This is why the allies, with the United States as the ringleader and France, Australia, and Japan as the proxies, have joined hands with the communist Vietnamese in launching various criminal activities. 1. They opposed the Paris Accords by refusing to give the right and power to the quadripartite Supreme National Council and not supervising the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia; 2. They organized a sham election under the control of the communist Vietnamese administration and UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]; 3. Immediately after the elections and establishing the two-headed government, they have continued to kindle the war by leading the forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the forces of the two Para groups [noncommunist resistance groups], which are U.S. puppet forces, to launch offensives against Democratic Kampuchea and the people in Stoung, Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas. However, they have suffered successive defeats and more serious setbacks militarily, politically, economically, financially, and socially. In the military field, the two categories of Para forces, which are U.S. puppets, are dissolving, and the communist Vietnamese puppet forces are badly beaten and collapsing. In the political field, both the allies and their puppets grouped up with the communist Vietnamese puppets have all been exposed at home and abroad as the conspirators of the aggressor communist Vietnamese, as the warmongers, traitors, and the arch corruptors. In the economic and financial fields, the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government are collapsing. They have been able to survive only because of the small-scale aid drops from the allies. They are strangling one another and are plunging into the abyss. Although in an all-around impasse, they are blindly seeking to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people and Democratic Kampuchea through military means. IV. In what situation are the United States, France, Australia, and the other evil allies jointly providing arms to the communist Vietnamese puppets? It is in a situation in which the two-headed government has only a decaying skin left. In reality, what remains is only the pure puppet administration and puppet army of the communist Vietnamese. The Vietnamese puppet administration and puppet army are also collapsing. They have no people on their side. The people very strongly oppose them. This situation shows that the policy to continue kindling the war pursued by the United States and the other evil allies is a blind policy that will only lead them toward an abyss of more shameful defeats. The overwhelming majority of countries around the world, especially in Southeast Asia, oppose this blind policy. In the United States and other Western countries, public opinions has asked: Which is better -- to follow this policy to blindly kindle the war or to reconsider helping Cambodia achieve peace and national reconciliation? More and more, public opinion has asked: What benefit do the United States and the allies expect to gain from opposing the national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia by continuing to provide dollars and arms to the communist Vietnamese puppets? Those who ask these questions have become well aware of the fact that it is impossible to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea. Attacking Democratic Kampuchea is tantamount to attacking the Cambodian nation and people. V. Esteemed and beloved compatriots, both the communist Vietnamese and the allies are very very cruel toward our Cambodian nation and people. They have been jointly mustering their puppet forces to serve their strategy to eliminate our nation and people. They have opposed our national reconciliation. They have opposed the national reconciliation policy of King Norodom Sihanouk. They have continued to kindle the war of the aggressor communist Vietnamese. However, they have suffered serious defeats successively. The United States and the other evil allies are now openly taking the lead in providing arms to their puppets, that is, the communist Vietnamese and the Vietnamese puppets, to continue killing and exterminating our nation and people. Therefore, we call on all compatriots to rise up and launch all forms of activities to check and smash this arch criminal plan. Compatriots in the country should rise up and join hands with the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in defending your villages, houses, farm lands, property, oxen, buffalo, and fowl. You should prevent yourselves from being forcibly recruited as soldiers or as militiamen. You should call on your offspring and husbands to desert the fascist administration and the battlefields and return home. Compatriots in the cities should rise up to oppose the fascist regime, which is completely corrupt, betrays the country and people, and sells out our nation and territory to the communist Vietnamese and the alliance. You should rise up to demand national reconciliation and peace so that our nation and people and each of your families can survive and earn a living peacefully. VI. I would like to take this opportunity to stress once again that the Democratic Kampuchean forces vehemently oppose the war, vehemently oppose the attempt to continue kindling the war of the communist Vietnamese, Vietnamese puppets, and the allies and their puppets. Democratic Kampuchea unswervingly adheres to the policy of national reconciliation. In whatever circumstances, it will never deviate from the king's five-point national reconciliation policy. The king has repeatedly appealed to us that national reconciliation is the only holy medicine for our nation and people to regain genuine peace and thereby move on, step by step, toward achieving their national independence and sovereignty. The king has said: War is death; peace is life. However, if the communist Vietnamese and bellicose allies of all categories continue to oppose our national reconciliation and to kindle the war, they should look back at the past historic experiences, especially the experiences in the full-fledged war of aggression of the communist Vietnamese in the past 13 years and the war rekindled by the allies together with the communist Vietnamese from July 1993 until today. These experiences clearly show that the evil elements and weaponry of the foreign aggressors definitely cannot conquer the solid and dynamic forces of unity of the Cambodian nation and people. Reject the warmongers! Down with the warmongers! Long live the mighty great national united forces of the Cambodian nation and people! Long live the mighty force of national reconciliation!
