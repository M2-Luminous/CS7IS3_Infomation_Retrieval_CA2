Ciller also revealed that a new package of democratization measures to encompass the entire country will soon be announced together with Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister. The prime minister left for the United States to conduct contacts. In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport before her departure, Ciller reported that in the United States she will meet with President Bill Clinton and hold a series of meetings. She said that it is difficult to understand Turkey when you look at it from the outside. [Begin Ciller recording] Turkey is also a secular country. The Republic of Turkey will remain secular. There is no argument about the regime. Sometimes, it may be difficult to understand our country when you look at it from the outside. Another matter we will explain to the other countries consists of the additional moves Turkey will undertake in the field of democratization. I met with Mr. Karayalcin before my departure. Upon my return, together with Mr. Karayalcin, we will announce a package of democratization measures. Turkey will adopt a series of measures which will further broaden the scope of democracy within the framework of a state of law. In actual fact, these measures were also included in our coalition protocol. We will embrace these issues with determination. Turkey is a democratic country and it has covered a great distance in this direction. It will continue to do so in the future. We do have economic problems, but we have already adopted very important measures aimed at overcoming these problems. Our whole nation supports these measures. Turkey's future will become increasingly brighter and it will occupy its rightful place in the world as a leading country. [end recording] Commenting on her scheduled contacts in the United States, Ciller explained that she will deliver a speech at a meeting organized by the Elie Wiesel Foundation in New York. In Washington, Ciller recounted, she will meet with President Clinton and hold contacts with representatives of financial circles. [Begin Ciller recording] The main goal of my meetings with financial circles will not consist of asking for loans for Turkey. The aim is to reinstate the flow of information necessary for Turkey's reintegration into the world's money markets. As you know, our country is experiencing a period of economic difficulties. We are adopting all the necessary measures to surmount this problem. We will implement these measures as a nation, in solidarity. We will certainly overcome the problems. Let no one have any doubts on this matter. We may experience some ups and downs in the coming days, but we are determined to overcome this. The necessary measures have been adopted. We will experience certain difficulties for some time, but, as I said, let no one doubt that Turkey's future is open. Turkey is a great country. I will explain the economic stability measures we adopted to the other countries and to financial circles. I will inform them that we are approaching this issue in a comprehensive manner and in all seriousness and determination. Our goal is to secure Turkey's reintegration with the world money markets and to ensure that everything proceeds according to its normal course. This will be achieved. [end recording] Ciller took off for New York aboard a scheduled Turkish Airlines flight. She was seen off at Ataturk Airport by State Minister Necmettin Cevheri, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other officials. The prime minister will return to Turkey on 17 April.
