This remark was made yesterday by General Anibal Rejis Romero (retired) during a break at the Armed Forces seminar that is currently being held at the Chamber of Deputies building. Gen. Rejis Romero and his colleague Mario Escobar Anzoategui, also retired, participated in the seminar on "International Meeting on Military Issues," at the Chamber of Deputies, which was also attended by Argentine and Paraguayan congressmen and special guests. Gen. Rejis Romero skirted round the issue of corruption quite craftily. He nonetheless acknowledged that "nowadays, thanks to the invaluable help of the press, we are learning that some members of the Armed Forces have also fallen into corruption--that general so-and-so is well off, but what's-his-name has this and that, etc. Nevertheless, the fact that a sergeant, a captain, or maybe a colonel are involved in corrupt practices does not give us the right to say that the Armed Forces are racked by corruption. This is not so," he warned. He conceded that "we can all make a slip, but this is no reason to implicate the entire Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are too great and meritorious to mix them up with individual actions," he said. Later in the interview, the retired general said that a war is being waged against corruption. "Have you not read that the Army commander in chief has ordered the investigation of criminal acts? A pre-trial inquest was ordered not long ago to identify those guilty of smuggling logs out of the country, after charges were made in Pacova, Canindyu District. A sergeant was indicted for this crime, but this does not entitle us to involve the Armed Forces as a whole in it," he explained. Gen. Rejis Romero further stated that relations between the military and the public are more intense at present because there are many officers who are attending school. "This was totally forbidden during the dictatorship. Things are different now. The commander in chief allows officers to go to the university, where they are brought into contact with other citizens," he stated. Gen. Rejis Romero declined to answer a question about the prevalence of authoritarianism in the government's top echelons, saying that as he had been retired for months, he had relinquished all official duties and was therefore not abreast of current affairs. He later praised the Army commander in chief and the military leadership.
