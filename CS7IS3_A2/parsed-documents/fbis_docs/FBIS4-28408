FBIS4-28408 "dreas112_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam Security Meeting Remarks Criticized Kim Yong-sam Security Meeting Remarks Criticized SK1006045594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 10 Jun 94 SK1006045594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Folly of Puppet Precipitating Self-Destruction" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam called a "meeting of the National Security Council" on June 8 and let out a string of bellicose words over the "nuclear issue" of the North, crying that "a tough action for a solution through UN sanctions" must be taken now and "there is no other solution to the nuclear issue of the North but sanctions", according to a radio report from Seoul. His outburst is a malicious challenge to the North and an anti-national criminal act that cannot be overlooked. The Kim Yong-sam clique is crying for "sanctions" against the North more hysterically than outside forces. The puppets are foolishly trying to increase the intensity of pressure and "sanctions" against the North by misleading unbiased public opinion with outcries over "challenge". But this is of no use and pressure and "sanctions" have no effect on us. Such method cannot lead to a solution to the issue but may drive the situation to a catastrophe. It is a gross mistake, if they intend to attain their mucky political aim through "sanctions" against fellow countrymen, joining hands with outside forces, clean indifferent to the interests of the nation. The Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that should they choose an adventure, pinning hope on the notion of "not by any possibility", it will bring the "civilian" regime to destruction.
