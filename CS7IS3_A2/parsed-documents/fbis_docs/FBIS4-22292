As a consequence of these measures, the Uzbekistan can control elections completely, allow a desired party to take part in the election or declare an undesired party illegal. In fact, the Assembly legalized a one-party system. Aside from this, the results of the 1993 Assembly were uninspired. There was neither applause nor praise. Even the fawning lickspittles reaching out to the tribunal seemed dispirited and no one made a speech. Not even the "retirement" of the Assembly chairman Sh. Yoldoshev could disturb the numbness of the deputies. And President I. Karimov's amazing question of the type of "why do you all look so tired?" remained without influence. In the opinion of observers, this situation is a sign of confusion in the ranks of government cadres. The ties between the government and the cadres are becoming weaker every day. The cadres' lack of belief in the leadership is constantly growing stronger. As they begin to fear for their own positions and future, so do they fear for the future of the state. This situation was clearly felt at the High Assembly's last session.
