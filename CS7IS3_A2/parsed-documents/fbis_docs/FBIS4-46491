The Western Press Acknowledges This, Commenting on the Results of the Visit to Brussels of General of the Army Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation Minister of Defense"] [Text] The visit of General of the Army Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of defense, to Brussels at the end of May, his meetings with the NATO leadership, and his speech to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council had been planned long ago. The closer the date of the visit came, the more attention it attracted and the more frequently the Western countries' mass media carried forecasts of its course and results. Very contradictory opinions were expressed -- some people even predicted the visit's total failure. Such a pessimistic approach was evidently connected with the delay over Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, which came as a surprise to many people, and with the contradictory statements on this which came out of Moscow. "Initially Russia's position was not clear enough," Paris LE MONDE stated. Assessments of this kind only served to boost interest in the upcoming Brussels meeting. But the most important thing was that, despite everything, Russia's authority and influence and its role in ensuring stability in Europe and throughout the world are so great that far-reaching expectations were associated with this meeting. People were expecting the talks with the Russian minister to elucidate, above all, the prospects for developing relations between the Russian Federation and NATO and, consequently, to draft a scheme of a future European security system. Naturally, they were also expecting an exposition of the fundamentals of Russian military doctrine. Thus, Pavel Grachev was faced with a difficult task. He had to convince his former opponents and potential partners of Russia's fundamentally new approach to problems of ensuring security, to secure their approval for the principles of the Russian Federation's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, to eliminate accusations of Moscow's neo-imperialist ambitions, and, at the same time, to uphold its right to special relations with the West, mindful of Russia's status as a great power with tremendous nuclear might and its permanent membership of the UN Security Council. This under conditions of NATO's obvious reluctance to assume additional commitments to Russia out of fear that this might bring about a weakening of the alliance's influence in the world. There is no need to describe in detail the entire course of the Russian Federation defense minister's visit to Brussels. It received quite wide coverage in the Russian press. But I must emphasize at once that his mission succeeded. LE MONDE wrote at the end of the visit that it "made it possible to draw the sides' positions closer together and showed the goodwill for cooperation between Russia and NATO." In the opinion of the Western press, Pavel Grachev's personal qualities played a considerable part in achieving that result. People had been expecting to see in Brussels "the jaded leader of a demoralized army," as THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote. But they saw a self-confident and firm military leader. "A good man, but dangerous," one German general commented respectfully on him in the press on returning from Brussels. London's THE TIMES wrote of the Russian minister that he "played a virtuoso game with the alliance" at the meeting in Brussels. But it is not, of course, just a matter of Grachev himself. In the meetings with the NATO leadership he advanced a well thought-out position which had been worked out carefully together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and which had been examined and approved by the Russian Federation Security Council and president. This lent special weight to his words. So, in Brussels the Russian side unequivocally declared that it was prepared to join NATO's partnership program in the very near future and presented its interlocutors with a document containing the main parameters of Russia's involvement in implementing it. At the same time it was proposed to prepare a large-scale program of bilateral political and military cooperation between NATO and Russia consonant with the latter's place in Europe and the world. At the same time the report on the main provisions of Russian military doctrine, which Pavel Grachev delivered at the conference of defense ministers of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council countries, emphasized that the political bases of this doctrine reflect two interconnected tasks -- prevention of war and readiness to rebuff an aggressor. According to Western press data, NATO rated highly the Russian document, which contains the main parameters of participation in the partnership program and of its realization, particularly in the military sphere. "NATO cannot treat Russia the same way as Tajikistan or Albania," FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe declared. "Russia must become a strategic partner of NATO and feel that people reckon with it as such." I could also cite other statements and assessments of this kind concerning the results of the Brussels meeting. Many other articles, however, have also appeared in the Western press. The reaction to these results expounded in them was restrained, to put it mildly, and sometimes even sharply negative. A statement by Sergio Balanzino, deputy secretary general of the alliance, that it is no good Russia reckoning on special status, since all are equal in the partnership program, was cited, for example. "The North Atlantic Alliance has no intention of adopting any documents that would endow Russia with special rights," he declared. Germany's FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE regarded Russia's desire to legitimate consultations with NATO on questions of European security as an attempt to erode the entire North Atlantic Alliance. Britain's DAILY TELEGRAPH pointed out that NATO must make the development of cooperation with Russia dependent on "Moscow's conduct in the near abroad." At the same time it is frequently emphasized that such guardedness is perfectly justified, since "NATO must be ready for a worsening of the situation in Russia." Particular skepticism was shown in the West in respect of the substance of the Russian military doctrine. It is said, in particular, that its provisions make intervention in the near abroad possible. In an interview in the newspaper LE FIGARO British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd did, indeed, admit that Russia has special interests here, but he emphasized that concern for them "must not transcend international law." Other doctrinal provisions were also criticized. What can be said about all these attacks? To some extent they reflect the essence of the debate in Brussels. This is on the one hand. On the other, they attest that Pavel Grachev firmly upheld Russia's interests and did not forgo them, despite all the pressure that was put on him. Russia is joining the partnership program with a sense of its own dignity and is sure that it will be able to arrange fully equal and constructive cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance.
