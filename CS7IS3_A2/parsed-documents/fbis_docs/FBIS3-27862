Kumagai told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that the combination of an income tax cut and a consumption tax hike has been the fundamental notion of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet. "It is up to the government and the ruling parties to make adjustments for combining the tax cut and the tax hike," he said. Asked about the scale of income tax reduction, Kumagai said the cut should help quicken Japan's economic recovery and contribute to the global economy.
