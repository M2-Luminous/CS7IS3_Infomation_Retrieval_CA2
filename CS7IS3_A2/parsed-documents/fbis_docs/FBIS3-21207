For pilot fabrication, it will be necessary to provide stable microfine pattern fabrication technology (equipment, processes, etc.) in a few months. At the present stage in which photoexposure (i-ray, KrF, + resolution improvement) technology which is fully usable below 0.25 �m has not been established yet, electron beam (EB) direct-drawing technology, which is capable of drawing microfine patterns and is not restricted by chip size, is considered the only lithography technology which can provide stable processing in this domain. Usually, the following are considered the major issues of the EB direct-drawing technology. (1) EB equipment technology: Analysis and improvement of drawing accuracy, improvement of throughput, and stabilization of operation. (2) Resist process technology: Selection of resist, optimization of process conditions, and countermeasures against charge-up. (3) Pattern data processing technology: Technology for conversion of massive data, correction of proximity effect. These are universal technological issues that have been tackled for more than a decade; technologies have been developed and optimized for each generation and applied in prototyping advanced devices. Recently, we developed and optimized these technologies and applied the results to prototype a 256M DRAM.[.sup]1[/] In this report, we will introduce 0.25 �m EB direct-drawing technology, detailing the analysis and improvement of drawing accuracy with regard to drawing equipment, optimization of process conditions with resist processing technology, and correction of the proximity effect by pattern data processing technology. EB Equipment Technology -- Analysis and Improvement of Drawing Accuracy To secure the drawing accuracy required for 0.25 �m processes, analysis and evaluation of the accuracy of each part of the equipment is necessary along with the study of accuracy improvement based on the results of the analysis. Variable-shaping EB equipment[.sup]2[/] used for our prototyping provided the drawing accuracy analysis results shown in Table 1, where the improvement of mark detection accuracy with the largest error is essential. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

But the detection accuracy is largely variable depending on the value of correlation operation parameter W (correlation operation width). Therefore, to minimize variations in detection accuracy, we developed a technique for optimizing operation parameter W. Figure 1 shows the W optimization technique that we developed.[.sup]5[/] First, to improve the S/N of input signal Y(i) (the primary differential signal in mark detection), autocorrelation processing is performed and output correlation signal Z'(i) is obtained. Then, from the signal peak width of Z'(i) with improved S/N, optimum correlation operation parameter W is obtained from the following formula: W = W[.sup]0[/] + _D_W Here, _D_W is the beam width when a mark is detected. The use of this technique can improve the mark detection accuracy from 0.046 �m (3 _s_) to 0.020 �m (3 _s_). In addition, overall drawing accuracy was improved by improving the stage-moving accuracy. These improvements have made it possible to reduce the calculated overall drawing accuracy below 0.070 � (3 _s_), assuring the drawing accuracy necessary for use of the 0.25 �m rule. Figure 1. Optimization Technique of W (Correlation Figure 2 shows the alignment accuracy in the actual prototyping of a 256M DRAM. It refers to the accuracy of the word-line layer with respect to the device-separation layer. The accuracy is good on both the X and Y axes, sufficiently within the alignment margin required from the device structure. Similar alignment accuracy results were also obtained with other layers by previously optimizing the correlation operation parameter for each EB drawing layer, within 0.075 �m (3 _s_) which is almost the identical level to the calculated accuracy. Figure 2. Alignment Accuracy (Word-Line Layer) Resist Process Technology -- Optimization of Process Conditions With EB direct drawing, electrons lose energy when they are scattered in the resist, and this energy forms a negative or positive image by causing chemical reactions among the resist molecules. Therefore, electron scattering in the resist is the most important factor governing the shape of the resist. Because the prototype EB equipment used an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, the resist film thickness should be decreased to reduce the influence of forward scattering. However, thin resists cannot cover the height differences in the device and are not sufficient for use as the mask in etching. Actual prototyping was based on a multi-layer resist process. A single-layer resist process was also used in some instances for reducing the TAT. When a multi-layer resist process is used, it is essential to optimize the thickness of the organic film in the lower layer. Previously, the lower-layer organic film had a large thickness (1 to 2 �m) to reduce the influence of backscattering from the wafer. However, when drawing patterns at the 0.25 �m level of the 256M DRAM class, the aspect ratio rises during organic film etching, causing a size shift, pattern tilting, and shape deterioration. In short, the minimum required thickness of organic film is determined by the absorption of height differences, resistance to etching, and influence of backscattering. We first studied the thickness of the lower-layer organic film and the influence of backscattering by simulating energy accumulation.[.sup]6,7[/] As shown in Figure 3, the thickness of the lower-layer organic film hardly influences the contrast of the distribution of the electron accumulation amount (at the interface with SOG film). This result shows that the thickness of the lower-layer organic film can be optimized by considering only the thickness of the etched material and the height difference on the wafer in every EB drawing. Figure 3. Interface Contrast of Accumulated Energy (at Figure 4 [photo not reproduced] shows the bit-line patterns of SAL601 negative-resist prototype with a multi-layer resist process. The single-layer resist process can be applied in prototyping in the case where the height difference on the wafer is small, the pattern is coarse, and the selectivity ratio between the etched film and resist is sufficient. As the single-layer resist process allows the TAT and etching count to be reduced, it makes it possible to minimize size variations. In actual prototyping, the single-layer resist process was applied with bit-line and capacitance contacts. As shown in Figure 5 [photos not reproduced], contacts were fabricated with reasonable accuracy in both (a) the cell-array section and (b) the peripheral-circuit section. This is assumed to be possible by a small mutual proximity effect attributable to the relatively coarse drawing pattern and by the wide exposure margin of the ZEP520 positive resist used. Pattern Data Processing Technology -- Correction of Proximity Effect For the fabrication of microfine patterns of the 0.25 �m class using EB direct-drawing technology, it is essential to correct the proximity effect which degrades the drawing accuracy. Therefore, when we converted the design data into data formatted for the EB equipment, we developed a data conversion system which can correct the proximity effect at the same time as the two-level data compression processing. This correction processing is based on the two-dimensional self-consistent method using the EID (energy intensity distribution) function,[.sup]8[/] and also uses contour processing and rectangle redivision processing. Also, we specially developed a vector processing system using an SX-2 supercomputer and a simplified one-dimensional drawing intensity calculation technique to decrease conversion time (CPU time). Figure 6 shows the basic concept of the one-dimensional processing technique. In case identical patterns are developed infinitely (beyond the backscattering domain) in the direction of an axis (Y axis), the mutual proximity effect (drawing intensity) in the axial direction can be considered constant. Therefore, because the intensity drawing on the pattern to be corrected (required when correcting the proximity effect) can be determined by a primary line integral calculation considering only the drawing intensity in the X-axis direction, the drawing intensity calculation time can be reduced. Figure 6. Simplified Technique for One-Dimensional By optimizing the weight of the drawing intensity, the processing at the corner sections of the array-developed region becomes possible in the same way as at the array center section and a satisfactory pattern can be obtained as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Before and After One-Dimensional Proximity Figure 8 shows the conversion time when the above is applied to the word-line layer. The conversion time when vector processing and one-directional proximity effect correction are applied is drastically reduced to about 1/20 of the conversion time with two-dimensional processing without vector processing. Also, as a result of applying the one-dimensional proximity effect correction to other layers of the prototyped 256M DRAM, we could reduce the conversion time to a practical period of 30 to 50 minutes, and the proximity effect would be corrected satisfactorily. Figure 8. Result of Performance Evaluation (Application to Conclusion We applied EB direct-drawing technology using variable-shape electron-beam drawing equipment (accelerating voltage 20 kV, current density 10 A/cm[.sup]2[/]) to the prototyping of a 256M DRAM using the 0.25 �m rule. Actual prototyping was hybrid with i-ray technology and EB direct-drawing technology used for layers with the 0.25 �m rule. Aiming at stable operation of EB equipment and the improvement of its alignment accuracy, we analyzed the accuracy factors of the prototype, developed a technique for optimization of the correlation parameters (EB equipment technology), optimized the multi-layer resist process (partially single-layer resist process) (resist process technology) and developed the two-level data compression technology for large-capacity data and one-dimensional proximity effect correction technology (pattern data processing technology). As a result, we were able to produce the prototype 256M DRAM shown in Figure 9 [photo not reproduced], with an alignment accuracy of no more than 0.075 �m (3 _s_). References 1. T.
