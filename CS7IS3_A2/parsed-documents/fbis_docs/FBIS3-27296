Because of this, the people of the two countries often misunderstand the actions taken by the government of the other side. Sino-US relations have recently been subject to just these kinds of misunderstandings. The Chinese government does not believe America really cares about the fate of the Chinese people. As Beijing sees it, the US is using the human rights issue as an economic bargaining chip and a political tactic for attacking the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, the Chinese government tries to deal with human rights as a problem in foreign relations. Its main rationale for resisting the mounting international pressure is that "interference in China's domestic politics is unacceptable". There is a tendency to treat political dissidents as human pawns in China-US trade negotiations. Beijing participates in this sordid trade because it does not understand US thinking. Beijing does not believe the US will actually refuse to deal with the Chinese government because of human rights. Beijing does not believe the Americans are really willing to forego a chance to make some quick money, or that the Americans are applying these same moral judgments impartially to the policies of other countries. Though perfectly well aware their own behaviour is wrong, Beijing's leaders are determined to hold out until the last minute in the belief that this will allow them to recover "face". In time, they believe, the "Yankees" will reveal the reality behind their feigned concern for human rights. This will result in greater freedom for the Chinese communist government--all the better to strip more freedoms from ordinary people. It appears the US government also misunderstands the real thinking of the Chinese government. US leaders have the impression that the Chinese leadership are like the dimwitted, obtuse rulers of a backward people who do not understand that violating human rights is actually wrong. As a result, the Americans are considering abandoning the strategy of steadily increasing pressure on China and relying instead on "persuasion and education" in order to improve China's human rights. This is like Aesop's fable about the lamb that tried to reason with a wolf. I fear any attempt to use reason and logic in this situation will prove abortive. It's not that the wolf doesn't understand reason, but rather that he isn't interested in discussing reason. I'm not sure whether the American people understand the way the Sino-US relationship is changing, but the Chinese people's understanding of their own government is very clear. Before the communists took power, they were the group which clamoured most enthusiastically for human rights and democracy. It is impossible that they do not understand these concepts. But their autocratic rule has given them excessive power and they have no interest in honouring the promises they made to the masses. The Chinese people's understanding of the US government's position, on the other hand, is not necessarily correct. The real effect of America's new China policies has been to convince the Chinese people that the image of the US the communist leadership has peddled to them for all these years is correct. The line is that the US government is a rich man's government controlled by capitalists and that--like the Japanese--the Americans do not care about violating their consciences to make a quick buck. I do not believe this is the case, or rather I do not want to believe it. But when people disdainfully equate the democratic system of the United States with Japan's plutocratic system, what evidence can I offer against it?
