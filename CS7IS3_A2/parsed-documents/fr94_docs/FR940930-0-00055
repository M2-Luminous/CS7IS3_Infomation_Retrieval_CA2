Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This interim rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). The title, description, and respondent description of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden.

Title: Quality Standards and Certification Requirements for Mammography Facilities. Description: FDA is issuing an interim rule to implement the certification and quality standards provisions of the MQSA. This regulation, which amends two previously published interim rules, modifies and adds to the definitions previously set forth. In addition, the interim rule provides a mechanism to request permission to meet alternative requirements, other than those previously set forth, if the proposed alternative requirement is at least as effective as the existing quality standards in achieving quality mammography services for women. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA is submitting a copy of this interim rule to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for FDA.
