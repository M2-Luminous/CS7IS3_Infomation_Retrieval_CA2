The U.S. side, which calls the three major issues the Big Three, has asked the Japanese Government to come up with ways to relocate, streamline, and integrate U.S. military bases on Okinawa. The Japanese Government, which has so far entrusted the U.S. side with the power to handle the relocation, streamlining, and integration of the U.S. bases, is being pressed to coordinate the views of Okinawan residents in areas where some U.S. military bases are relocated; and to study ways to secure the cost of relocating U.S. artillery units on Okinawa. The Japanese Government has yet to give the United States a clear answer. Burdened with the U.S. military bases, Okinawa is about to greet the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War. When pleading directly to the U.S. Government, Prefectural Governor Ota has asked them to resolve the three major issues, among other things. The OKINAWA TIMES has filed urgent reports on the intentions of both Japan and the United States, who have begun moving toward settling the three major issues as a priority matter, and the Okinawa Prefectural Government's response to such moves. In U.S.-Japan security talks in 1974 -- two years after Okinawa's reversal to Japanese rule -- the two sides agreed that Naha Military Port would be returned on condition that an alternative site was provided by Japan. The temporary use of the military port by U.S. Forces on Okinawa has continued for 20 years after the agreement was reached between Japan and the United States; 75 percent of U.S. military installations in Japan are concentrated on Okinawa. It has been said that the "agreement is irrational" because it conditions the return of the military port on its relocation in Okinawa, one- fifth of which is occupied by U.S. military bases. A relocation proposal put forth by the U.S. Forces on Okinawa to the Japanese Government is that an area inside Makiminato Supply Depot be used as the site for a new military port and the supply depot be located to a coastal area. The coastal area of Makiminato, Urasoe City is now under development and the relocation proposal is that a berth be established along the coastal area and linked to the supply depot by road. If Naha Military Port is relocated to the area inside Makiminato Supply Depot, the current military port located at the gate to Okinawa will disappear and the new military port will be half the size of Naha Military Port. The merits of Naha Military Port's relocation are great. The new military port will be located near the capital of Okinawa and in a western coastal development area which will become a key area for future industrial development on Okinawa. It still remains uncertain whether Urasoe City will accept the proposal to relocate Naha Military Port to an area under its jurisdiction. The relocation of Naha Military Port is expected to go through many twists and turns. The relocation and scaling back of Naha Military Port is taken as an indication of certain headway in Okinawa's interests. A high- level political judgment is required, however, to have Naha Military Port completely withdrawn from Okinawa. Prefectural Governor Ota has asserted: "The U.S. military bases on Okinawa should be streamlined or integrated by relocating them across Japan, and the Japanese should bear the burden of their country's security equitably." The prevailing view is that his assertion will be hard to realize. Kosuke Uehara, former director general of the Okinawa Development Agency, has persisted in his view: "It is necessary to take a realistic approach; no headway can be made without such an approach in resolving problems arising from U.S. military bases on Okinawa." Some Okinawans take the view that it is necessary to study ways to break the status quo by relocating and integrating U.S. military bases within Okinawa. If some U.S. military bases are relocated on condition that alternative sites are provided on Okinawa, like Naha Military Port, this will pressure the Okinawans to make decisions that may entail some pain.
