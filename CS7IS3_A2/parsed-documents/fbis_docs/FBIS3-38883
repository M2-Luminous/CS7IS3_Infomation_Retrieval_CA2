With these words Chancellor Helmut Kohl commented on the recession at the forum "Safeguarding Germany as a Business and Investment Location," organized by Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt in Bonn. The majority of the structural problems that we have to settle today have "nothing whatsoever" to do with German unity. In the next tax reform, clear priority must be given to families with children. Safeguarding Germany's attractiveness as a business location includes improving the climate for progress and technology, Kohl pointed out. The chancellor sees reason for "realistic optimism." Rexrodt stressed that the inflexibility that is currently prevailing might ultimately mean the end. [as published]
