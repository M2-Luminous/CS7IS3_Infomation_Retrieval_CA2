Like President Itamar Franco and Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Serpa, Leite advocated punishment for the "greedy" who are attempting to harm the economic plan. Minister Serpa believes it is also necessary to restructure the administration of justice in Brazil in order to make it more expedient. The two ministers made their statements today after a ceremony at the Navy Ministry marking the 500th anniversary of the Treaty of Todersilhas' signing. Franco promised to issue a provisional measure punishing oligopolies if Congress has not approved a bill by 8 June punishing cartels, sponsored by PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Fabio Feldmann. "In a democracy, it is not enough to just be willing to punish. There must be laws, and in the case of Brazil, the laws must be quickly enforced after a crime has been committed," Serpa said. He wondered: "Is it right to delay trying someone who has committed a crime until the statute of limitation makes the law unenforceable?" Asked about the type of crime he was referring to, Serpa replied: "I am referring to all crimes because to me thieves, even if they steal a chicken, are all the same, despite the fact that here in Brazil there are some differences in this regard." Minister Serpa added that he is concerned about oligopolies in Brazil. He said entrepreneurs must be careful because if they increase their prices they may be mortgaging their own future, because with high prices the number of clients drops dramatically. He believes that "profits, as such, are not a crime but a sin." "Profits become a crime when entrepreneurs violate the law," the minister noted, adding that those who break the law must go to jail. "Criminals should go to jail," he stated, adding that "unfortunately, few people go to jail in Brazil." About the military salary problem, Leite said military salaries did not deteriorate after implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit], but food prices are undergoing "tremendous" growth. Leite blamed the exaggerated price increases on entrepreneurs' greed.
