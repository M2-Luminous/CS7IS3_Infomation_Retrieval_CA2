FR940707-0-00027 FR940707-0-00010 Comments: One commenter expressed concern that the Secretary had not defined the circumstances in which an institution could satisfy the financial responsibility requirements added through the Technical Amendments of 1993 by demonstrating that it had sufficient resources to ensure against precipitous closure. The commenter suggested that the regulations need to provide specific guidance to institutions showing when the exception can be used. Several other commenters also questioned whether the general financial responsibility standards in the proposed regulations were consistent with the statutory exception permitting an institution to participate without restrictions by demonstrating that it has sufficient resources to ensure against precipitous closure. Discussion: The Secretary agrees to establish a standard in the regulations that is consistent with the explanation made by Senator Pell that the technical amendments were intended to make sure that financially at-risk institutions are subject to careful scrutiny, to protect institutions that are not financially at risk, and to accomplish these aims without weakening the general standards for financial responsibility. See 139 Cong. Rec. 162&hyph;2, S16593 (daily ed. November 19, 1993). The Secretary therefore considers it necessary to define the limited circumstances in which an institution may satisfy the statutory exception in a manner that will not create a lower standard for financial responsibility. Because an institution using this exception will not be required to post surety or enter into provisional certification, the Secretary has minimized the Federal risks in such unprotected participation by making the exception only available to an institution that met the financial responsibility requirements in its last timely submitted audited financial statement. This structure will permit an institution that now fails the financial responsibility requirements but meets the alternate standards in the exception to have an opportunity to improve its financial condition for one year without having to post surety or be placed under provisional certification. This requirement prevents this exception from becoming a means to continue participating under a lower standard of financial responsibility than that required for all other institutions. An institution that has not satisfied the general standards of financial responsibility in its previous audit and has not improved its operations to meet current financial responsibility standards is not permitted to participate on an unrestricted basis under this provision, and is required to provide the additional safeguards presented through a surety or through provisional certification. If an institution that met the standards of financial responsibility, as demonstrated by its last audited financial statement, fails to meet these standards in its current audit, it can show that it meets the alternate standards in this provision in order to participate on an unrestricted basis for one year to give it an opportunity to solidify its operations and demonstrate that it meets financial responsibility standards in its next timely submitted audited financial statement. Such participation without surety or provisional certification can only be permitted where the institution meets all of the requirements in ยง668.15(d)(2)(ii)(A) to show that it is current in all tax obligations, its equity and operating income have not materially decreased since its last audit, and that it is not shifting the institution's operating capital to its owners or related parties. These standards are necessary to show that the institution's financial condition has not significantly deteriorated since it last demonstrated financial responsibility, and that the institution's failure to meet the current financial responsibility standards is not exacerbated by benefits given to its owners or related parties. In order to participate without restriction under this provision, an institution that now fails to demonstrate financial responsibility after having done so in its last audit, must show that it has not accelerated the funds going to its owners or related parties through disproportionately large salary increases, or through making uncollateralized loans to these parties. The institution must also show that all loans made to the institution's owners or related parties are in repayment, and that a demand has been made for repayment of any loans that did not carry fixed payment terms. These measures will help ensure that the institution's failure to demonstrate financial responsibility is not due to capital diverted to its owners or related parties. The institution must also show that there have been no material findings in the institution's latest compliance audit, and that there are no pending administrative or legal actions pending before a member of the Triad or other Federal or State entity.
