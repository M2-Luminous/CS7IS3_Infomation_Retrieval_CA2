French diplomats in Bangkok would not confirm or deny the reports, but Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap said the French Government had notified its Thai counterpart through the Thai Foreign Trade Department that Paris would abide by its commitments to allow the imports. The source said the Thai Commercial Counselor's office in Paris had reported that France would today freely allow the imports to enter. A Commerce Ministry source said the ministry could not indicate why the process of adding Thailand to the list of countries allowed to export fishery produce to France was speeded up, after the Thai Government made diplomatic protests last week.
