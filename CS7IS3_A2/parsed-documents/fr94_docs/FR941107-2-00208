Absolute Priority 2_Cultural Experiences for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals Background This priority supports a variety of cultural activities designed to enrich the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children and youth, as well as adults. These activities must use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults, who are deaf and hard of hearing with those who can hear while conducting cultural experiences that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. During FY 1992 the Department funded projects that: (1) Provided theatrical experiences for deaf and hard of hearing individuals, and (2) used integrated approaches by having among cast members a mixture of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing performers. During FY 1993 cultural experiences were extended specifically to younger people with hearing impairments and to the creation of art as well as theatrical experiences, using the same approaches. Projects under this proposed priority can include a variety of artistic approaches such as the creation of works of art (painting, drawing, designing, etc.), dance, and storytelling, as well as developing and performing dramatic productions. A grantee may not use funds under this priority for passive activities such as viewing a play or video, or passively watching a storyteller or artist at work. Priority To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_ (1) Use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing, with those who are hearing in carrying out project activities; and (2) Develop and implement strategies that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children, youth, and adults. Outreach activities such as promoting the project to schools, community organizations, news media, and relevant national organizations are encouraged. Invitational Priority Within this absolute priority 2, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the following invitational priority. However, pursuant to 34 CFR 75.105(c)(i), an application that meets this invitational priority does not receive competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet this priority: Projects that include people from a variety of cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Absolute Priority 3_Captioned Films and Videos Distribution System Background This priority would support the operation of a captioned films/videos distribution system which provides deaf and hard of hearing individuals, as well as other eligible individuals with disabilities, with access to captioned educational and general interest films and videos on a nonprofit free-loan basis. Activities under this priority include, but are not limited to: (1) A computerized user-registration process; (2) circulation of captioned films and videos; (3) development or updating of a catalog of captioned films and videos in the collection; and (4) outreach activities. This priority would provide students and other eligible individuals with disabilities with captioned films and videos so they may benefit from the same educational media used to enrich the educational experiences of students and other individuals who do not have disabilities. Priority To be considered for funding under this priority, the project must_ (1) Develop strategies and procedures to be implemented in operating a distribution system, consisting of local and regional centers including depositories, and one central general interest and educational films/video center. Local and regional centers may include State schools for disabled individuals, public or private school systems, public libraries, colleges or universities, or other distribution points that distribute captioned films/videos. (2) Ensure that the system permits interdepository circulation of captioned films/videos, allows individuals, depositories, and local and regional centers to access booking information from the computerized depositories and the general interest and educational films/video center via modem and generic communication software, and provides immediate confirmation or denial of a request; (3) Establish and describe the computerized registration procedures that will be used to register users. The current computerized system configuration may be used as a basis; (4) Develop and implement criteria and procedures for replacing irreparable films/videos;
