In an interview with the HERALD Nottage said he was here looking into a wide range of foreign policy issues and economic and trade matters, stressing the common interests which exist between Argentina and New Zealand -- southern hemisphere countries who are non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, major agricultural producers who compete on several fronts but share common problems such as protectionism. In outlining the current state of affairs between both countries Nottage underscored the high degree of cooperation being achieved on matters of common interest, singling out the Cairns Group and the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations as two examples. One of the questions being looked into with great detail is what happens to both countries after the Uruguay Round. Nottage said both he and his team -- which includes Crawford Falconer, Director of the ministry's American Division; Ms. Lackey, Director of Trade Negotiations and Ambassador Frank Wilson, who is New Zealand's representative before the governments of Chile and Argentina -- were also looking into opportunities for further economic cooperation between both countries as well as between trade blocs, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], ASEAN, APEC, etc. Reviewing global issues Nottage pinpointed trade and the environment as being of particular interest. Within the latter a whole range of topics such as forests, fishing and the climate were currently being studied. As far as the economy was concerned Nottage mentioned the importance of the New Zealand experience of domestic economic reform started in 1984, under which a highly regulated market had been opened to competition through privatization of state enterprises.
