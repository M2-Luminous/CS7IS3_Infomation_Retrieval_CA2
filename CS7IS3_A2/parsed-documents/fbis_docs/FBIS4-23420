FBIS4-23420 "drafr108_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Favoritism in Senior Civil Service Alleged Favoritism in Senior Civil Service Alleged MB0506154894 Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 5 Jun 94 p 2 MB0506154894 Johannesburg RAPPORT Afrikaans BFN [Report by Piet Muller] [Text] Ninety senior executive posts in the central civil service system, among others those of receiver of revenue for Pretoria, will most likely soon be filled by officials from the former homelands and self-governing regions. This will be the practical result of a recent directive from the new minister responsible for the civil service, Dr. Zola Skweyiya. Several ministers and premiers are understandably also walking around "with lists of their own pals who they want to appoint to executive positions in the civil service," RAPPORT was told. According to Dr. Skweyiya's instructions, these 90 posts may not be filled before officials of the civil service in the former black territories have obtained positions. This has caused a stir in civil service circles as it is seen as a deviation from the constitutional ruling that the most qualified person should be appointed in a specific post. RAPPORT asked the minister by fax to either confirm or deny the information, and to give an explanation of his standpoint and the practical effect it will have on new appointments. Frozen The 90 vacancies, from deputy director upward, have been frozen by the Transitional Executive Council. There will not, however, be a lengthy waiting period regarding the appointment of personnel, since the relevant departments cannot be without executive staff for an indefinite period. One of the senior posts likely to be filled by an official from a former independent territory is that of receiver of revenue in Pretoria. The post is regarded as one of the most senior in the civil service. The appointee "must not only have a thorough knowledge of tax law, but should also be well versed with the practical implementation of that law, otherwise the government will be shooting itself in the foot," RAPPORT was told. The dismissal of the director general for housing, Mr. Louis Kock, by Joe Slovo, has sent shockwaves through the civil service even though it took effect with Mr. Kock's consent. They are now waiting to see how many other ministers are going to try the same. Vacant The post of director general for manpower is currently vacant after Mr. Joel Fourie resigned at the end of last month. Manpower Minister Tito Mboweni reacted sharply when RAPPORT approached him in the wake of rumors that he was trying to appoint Professor Halton Cheadle, who has strong ties with COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], but found out that civil service regulations made the move difficult. An allegation has also been made to RAPPORT that Prof. Cheadle was then appointed as a consultant at 1,000 rands per day. The minister, in a faxed message, rejected those rumors and said that they were inaccurate and based on hearsay. "The process to appoint a new director general has not started. The process will necessitate consultation between the minister of manpower and the civil service commission. You will be informed at the opportune moment when the process has been completed and the appointment made." According to the same fax, Prof. Cheadle "was not a member of the department or the ministry. He is one of the possible candidates being considered to comprise a team of advisers for the ministry. No decision has yet been taken on any member of the team." The Chosen Ones Mr. Casper van Rensburg, executive manager of the Association of Civil Servants, said he was aware of the rumors that ministers were walking around with lists of the chosen people they intended to appoint. His organization has already resorted to "certain measures" regarding the rumors. He adds that "a director general is not without rights, and that it will not be so easy to get rid of senior staff members." "People must be careful not to undermine the expertise of the executive staff in the civil service," Mr. van Rensburg said. "If they are surrounded by inexperienced people, it is usually the minister who falls on his face."
