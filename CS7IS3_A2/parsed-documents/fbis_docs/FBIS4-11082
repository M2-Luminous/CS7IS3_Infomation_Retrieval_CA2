"I have never denied there are human rights problems, but international organizations are not properly assessing things taking place in Colombia to protect fundamental principles," Gaviria stated to reporters in the Caribbean city of Cartagena de Indias. AI, a human rights organization headquartered in London, asked the United States to suspend economic aid to the Colombian military because "the Colombian Armed Forces are a bridge for the violation of the rights of individuals." According to the Colombian president, AI "lacks objectivity" in reporting how Colombia has managed the situation and how Colombia has protected human rights in past years, especially after the new National Constitution was promulgated in 1991. The Colombian president underscored that the Armed Forces, when they combat insurgents, "cannot ever fall into the trap of imitating the guerrillas' behavior of intimidation, extortion, torture, kidnapping, and slaying and injuring soldiers and policemen, or putting them out of action." Gaviria added: "Colombia has confronted persistent attacks against its democratic institutions for many years. The attacks come from organizations that receive economic resources from kidnapping and extortion activities." He added, "To confront these groups, there is an overwhelming majority of members of the military and police forces who respect the law."
