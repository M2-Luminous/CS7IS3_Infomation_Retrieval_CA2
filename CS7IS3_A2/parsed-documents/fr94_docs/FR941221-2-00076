Specifically excluded from the scope of the investigation are mechanical pencils, cosmetic pencils, pens, noncased crayons (wax), pastels, charcoals, or chalks. 4 Commissioner Rohr and Commissioner Newquist also voted in the affirmative with respect to critical circumstances. Background The Commission instituted this investigation effective June 16, 1994, following a preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain cased pencils from China were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34865). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on August 25, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on December 15, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2837 (December 1994), entitled ``Certain Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;669 (Final).''
