A fact-finding mission has already been sent to Shanghai early this year to arrange for the start of a full-scale research to be conducted by the two countries. Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who will visit Japan on 23 February, will confirm the promotion of the bilateral cooperation at his talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. China intends to turn this project into one of the major projects for obtaining the next yen-based loan (scheduled to last from fiscal 1996 till fiscal 1998) just as in the case of the project for building a bullet line between Beijing and Shanghai. Hongqiao Airport, which is located about 15 kms west of the old downtown section, currently serves the Shanghai area. However, due to a rapid increase in the number of flights, this airport has become overcrowded. The new airport will be built in the Pudong district, where drastic measures have been taken to introduce foreign capital, and which is expected become the forefront district for promoting the reform and open-door policy. The new airport will be built on the bank of the Chang Jiang River in the Pudong district, located about 30 kms east of the old downtown section. It has been reported that the new airport will be built not only as a replacement for Hongqiao Airport, but also as a major gateway to the Pudong district in Shanghai, where efforts are being made to turn the district into an area for promoting the development of finance, business, and advanced technology. The government plans to organize a study team mainly composed of officials from the Transport Ministry and other agencies and ministries; start a full-scale study in May; and work out a report as early as September. China has already worked out on its own a first-phase project for completing one of the runways, hopefully, by 1996. By promoting the upcoming cooperative plans, the two countries intend to work out both the second-phase project, which will be completed by 2005, and a long-term comprehensive improvement program which covers the period up to 2020. The total cost for the project is estimated at approximately 20 billion yuan (equal to 260 billion yen). It is expected that while promoting the study of the project, the two countries will hold discussions on concrete measures for promoting financial cooperation.
