Two events of the past week make one proclaim this. Minister of Finance B. Federov prepared a report for the session of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers, in which he noted that an increase in the budget deficit from 11.9 to 22.2 trillion rubles is taking shape this year. This exceeds the gross national product by 14 percent. The nation is on the threshold of hyperinflation. Shortly before the session of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers President B. Yeltsin issued for official distribution an ukase "On Stabilizing the Economic Situation of Enterprises and Organizations of the Defense Industry and Measures to Secure State Defense Orders." The reader unfamiliar with this ukase will assume that it has to do with curtailing the appetite of the military-industrial complex. This would be only natural, since the minister of finance is warning of hyperinflation. Unfortunately, the reader would be wrong. That is how it is with us. We are moving toward hyperinflation but we do not want to reform defense production. First, a brief account of the measures contained in the president's ukase. Military plants are allowed an advance on state defense orders up to a maximum of 20 percent of the total of annual budgeted allocations for the purchase of weapons and military equipment. At the beginning of next year enterprises filling defense orders are allowed to include in the basic cost of products outlays for wages in the amount of eight times the minimum wage; those engaged in the development of nuclear weapons, nine times the minimum. By way of comparison, other branches of industry are allowed to include only four times the minimum wage. Let us say right off that the president cut back the rigid demands of the directors of the military-industrial complex. They wanted not 20 but 30 percent in advance for defense jobs. The president would go no further. The commentators did not fail to underscore the fact that the president was pressured by the political atmosphere. It is not worth arguing with the directors of the military-industrial complex on the eve of elections, and the president understands that full well. This is why he signed the ukase. The restructuring of the military-industrial complex will still have to continue, however. This unpleasant fact will not be mitigated by statements to the effect that the economic effectiveness of the defense industry has to be improved. It is clear even to a person only superficially familiar with the situation in this sector that the defense plants have never recognized market economic principles, but have operated and continue to operate by the rule: If you want reliable weapons, pour in the money! Of course, one can take comfort from the fact that individual defense enterprises are now doing a great deal to produce substitutes for imported equipment, saving foreign currency for the state, that they are in fact converting and switching to totally civilian products. Nor can one forget that outlays for arms production are being reduced year after year. Still, in Russia's present situation it cannot afford outlays for these purposes, which place a great burden on it. Otherwise, no steps to stabilize the financial situation, over which the government is racking its brain, will help us avoid hyperinflation. According to the finance minister, it is even now at our front door.
