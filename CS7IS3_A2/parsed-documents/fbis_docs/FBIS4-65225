The Russian officials visited the Democratic Party, the Republican Turkish Party, and the CLP headquarters today and exchanged views on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] with the party leaders. In a statement after the meeting, Atun said he explained the Turkish Cypriot views on the recent developments, adding that he gave details on the discrepancies between the CBM package accepted in principle and the current problems that have arisen. Pointing out that he explained to the Russian officials the source of the current impasse, Atun stressed that the Turkish Cypriots expect simultaneous benefits from the package. Noting that the Turkish Cypriot side is waiting to receive information on which countries Turkish Cypriot flights taking off from Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport will be able to land in and on what kind of documents will be necessary, Atun said that the United Nations should have a practical solution to this issue. He added that it was explained to the Russian officials that the Greek Cypriot side cannot make the Turkish Cypriot side its legality, adding that this is an entirely different issue. In reply to a question on whether the Vienna talks on the CBM's were assessed, Atun said that efforts will continue to define the differences of views between the two sides. In a statement during his meeting with the Russian officials, Ozgur recalled that Russia is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members, adding that in that capacity, Russia is interested in the Cyprus problem. He noted that an agreement acceptable to both sides regarding the implementation of the CBM's may be reached through the goodwill of the two sides. Speaking after his meeting with the Russian delegation, Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister, said that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to contribute to reestablishing the balance in the CBM package, which was upset by the 21 March document, and to continue the talks to achieve that end. He added that the contacts are aimed at launching this process. In a statement prior to the meeting, Akinci said his party has always maintained a positive approach regarding measures aimed at creating a rapprochement between the two communities on the island. He added that through mutual goodwill, a solution can definitely be found. He concluded: Everyone should exert every effort possible. The greatest duty, however, befalls the two peoples and their administrators. Dobroserdov said that Russia, which is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, takes an interest in the Cyprus issue and especially in the CBM package, adding that his presence in Cyprus is aimed at listening to the views of the parties concerned. Stressing that Russia attaches great importance to the package, Dobroserdov said: One cannot advance toward the solution of the actual problem without implementing the CBM's. In a statement after his meeting with Atun, Dobroserdov said that the meeting had been very positive, adding that Atun's explanations were important in terms of determining the Russian position.
